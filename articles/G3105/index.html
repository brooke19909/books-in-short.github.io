According to reviews, the Amsterdam Hotel on Shchelkovskaya provides visitors with everything that is needed for a comfortable stay.  At the same time, the cost of the package of services offered to guests is significantly lower than in a regular hotel. </p><h2>  Hourly rent: the pros and cons </h2><p>  Renting apartments or rooms with an hourly or daily rate is very popular among guests of the capital.  Many visitors consider this accommodation option to be economically advantageous.  However, private apartments adapted for the hotel business, as a rule, do not provide guests with proper systemic and qualified services.  According to reviews, and the level of sanitation in such places often leaves much to be desired.  In addition, mainly apartments for rent for a day are located either in residential areas or at a considerable distance from the metro.  Another important factor that visitors should remember: renting rooms from private individuals in Moscow is not always safe. </p><h2>  Alternative </h2><p>  A great alternative to renting a private room or apartment for an hour is to stay in an hourly mini-hotel.  Particularly famous among tourists and business travelers was the Amsterdam chain of hourly mini-hotels.  This popular chain of mini-hotels "for an hour" offers guests of the capital accommodation in rooms of various capacities and prices.  In any of the Amsterdam hotels in Moscow, you can comfortably stay, traveling both alone and with a group of tourists.  You can reserve a place in the mini-hotel online or by phone.  Visitors are given the opportunity to rent a room hourly, day or night. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="ostrovok.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="In one of the rooms." class="if uuid-2592781" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39987/2592781.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotel "Amsterdam" on "Schelkovskaya": acquaintance </h2><p>  This hotel has received many excellent reviews.

Not all guests are satisfied with the view from the windows in the hotel.  According to some residents, the location of the hotel near two markets also leaves much to be desired.  But in view of the quite affordable price, these shortcomings, according to the authors of the reviews, are quite excusable.  Those who need to stay for a couple of days in the capital can safely choose this hotel. </p>
