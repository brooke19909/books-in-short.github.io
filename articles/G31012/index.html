    <h2>  A little about the city of Yekaterinburg </h2><p>  More than one and a half thousand kilometers separate Ekaterinburg from the state capital - Moscow.  They are separated by the mountain system - the Ural Mountains.  Therefore, its inhabitants have to live in a harsh mountain climate.  To somehow brighten up the harsh living conditions of urban residents, the <span>developers of Yekaterinburg</span> are trying to provide them with the most comfortable residential apartments.  LCD "Michurinsky" just meets these requirements.  Being both an urban type building and housing almost out of town. </p>

    <h2>  Location of the complex </h2><p>  The residential quarter is located in a promising place - the Wide River district of the Verkh-Isetsky district of the city of Yekaterinburg.  When designing, the developer of the residential complex "Michurinsky" was guided by the European level of housing, so urban comfort and environmental friendliness of suburban life were combined in the quarter. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  About 10 kilometers separate the complex from the city center.  Residents can get to their place of residence by private car on Repin Street, crossing the Bypass Road.  Further, Svetlorechenskaya and Sukhodolskaya streets will lead directly to the quarter.  In addition, the complex can be reached by public transport. </p>

    <p>  The “Capital” program provides for the construction of a road connecting the areas of Academic and residential complex “Michurinsky” (Yekaterinburg).  The aforementioned Sukhodolskaya Street is also planned to expand and increase the number of public transport stops up to 44. It will be additionally lit and equipped with sidewalks and bicycle paths. </p><h2>  Description of the complex </h2><p>  The complex has built more than 70 residential buildings of three- and four-story sectional buildings.  All houses are built with brackets, which makes their territory closed and safer for walking.  In addition, the entrances to all yards are limited by barriers, which creates a complete isolation of the courtyard territory.  LCD "Michurinsky" (Yekaterinburg) very successfully combines individual housing and low-rise multi-apartment buildings. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The developer tried to create a <span>living environment</span> for the residents of the <span>complex,</span> which provides them with the most comfortable accommodation.  This includes comprehensive landscaping of the complex: completely asphalting driveways and access roads to houses, arranging sidewalks, pedestrian and bicycle paths, walking alleys with landscape design. </p><h2>  Complex infrastructure </h2><p>  The Michurinsky residential quarter inside the complex offers for its young residents equipped playgrounds and sports grounds for recreation and sports.  Adhering to the concept of “a yard without cars”, the developer ensured the maximum safety of children's games. </p><p>  This year, in the immediate vicinity of the complex, a unique educational center will open, combining a kindergarten with 150 seats and a secondary school with 800 seats.  Each apartment house is equipped with video intercom.  An additional convenience in the form of apartment gas heating can boast part of residential buildings.  But the residents of the remaining houses will not experience inconvenience, since the gas boiler house will provide heat. </p>

    <p>  Owners of their own vehicles are also not left unattended by the developer.  They are provided with a multi-level underground parking.  As is customary in almost all new buildings, and the Michurinsky residential complex (Yekaterinburg) is no exception, the first floors of the houses will be given over to non-residential premises that will house the necessary social infrastructure: shops, pharmacies, offices. </p><h2>  Ecological situation </h2><p>  The developer chose a very good place for the location of the quarter away from busy streets, city noise, industrial enterprises.  The complex is buried in a forest, which makes it possible to completely immerse yourself in nature.  The south side of the complex is bordered by forests, the west - with gardens.  The territory of the quarter itself is ennobled by the natural Lake Polovinnoe. </p><p>  Thus, having settled in the residential complex “Michurinsky”, reviews about which are only the most positive, residents will be able to combine urban living conditions and real suburban life in almost their own homes.  The remoteness from the city creates such a feeling; I want to complete all things faster, come home to breathe in the freshest air. </p>
