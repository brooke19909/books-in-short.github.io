Hotels here could be counted on the fingers of a hand.  The level of service in them was so terrible that it was easier to stay in a rented clean apartment or rent a room near the lakes in a small house.  In addition to the fact that there were practically no free rooms, the prices were still the same as in Orenburg. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel in salt ileck" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23318/920939.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Currently, hotels are not a problem for visitors here.  There are plenty of them in the city.  Local service can easily handle the increased flow.  I am glad that the price policy in the city has significantly softened: the cost of living is not so much reduced, but the level of service has improved, which provided the tourist with everything necessary for the same money. </p><p>  If you need a hotel in Sol-Iletsk, you do not need to focus on its proximity to the lakes.  This is a fairly small city, and each tourist attraction, historical landmark or body of water, is here within walking distance.  Pay your attention to other parameters: the quality of service and the level of the hotel, the correspondence of the price and the declared service. </p><h2>  Hotel "Riviera" </h2><p>  The Riviera Hotel in Sol-Iletsk is a new luxurious establishment located in the very center of the city, 200 meters from the entrance to the famous salt lakes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It offers guests several rooms (2-seater and 4-seater) of the "luxury" category with individually designed design combining home comfort and elegance. </p><p>  All rooms have a private bathroom, air conditioning, LCD TV, and everything you need for a normal stay.  There is free Wi-Fi access in the lobby and rooms of the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel riviera in salt ileck" class="if" height="346" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/920965.jpg" width="500"></div>
