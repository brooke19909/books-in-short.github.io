    <h2>  A few words about the story </h2><p>  Since time immemorial, Belarus has been keeping its chronicle.  Orsha, located in its eastern part, is the same age as Minsk.  The first time it is mentioned in the famous "Tale of Bygone Years".  We are talking about the year 1067, when the gullible prince <span>Vseslav Polotsky</span> crossed the river to Orsha on a boat in order to meet with the princes Yaroslavichi.  Those guests were seized and imprisoned.  Only then it was not a city, but a village called not Orsha, but Rsha (Rzha).  ‚ÄúO‚Äù was added later.  Since then, these lands have seen a lot of bad and good things.  They entered the <span>Principality of Polotsk,</span> the Lithuanian, the Russian, until finally, after the October Revolution, they became part of the Belarusian Soviet Republic.  The transition from one owner to another has always been accompanied by heavy fighting.  Historical evidence of a bloody massacre called the "Battle of Orsha" that occurred during the war between Russia and Lithuania (1514) has been preserved.  Napoleon also smashed and burned Orsha.  By the way, the commandant then was Marie-Henry Beil, more familiar to us as the great Stendhal.  The last wave of destruction and horror swept over the city during the Second World War.  The Nazis brought a lot of grief, but Orsha again rose from the ashes, and now she hospitably welcomes all her tourists. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location and road links </h2>

    <p>  There are several settlements with the name Orsha.  So, in Russia there are three villages in the Pskov and Tver regions with the same name, the city of Orsha (Belarus) is located about 200 km from Minsk in the east, and 80 km from Vitebsk in the south.  The city is located at the mouth of Orshitsa, on the banks of this river and the Dnieper.  The city has always been on important trade routes from Russia to Poland and Ukraine.  Now it is called the "Eastern Gate" of Belarus.  Two international highways (M1 and M8) pass through Orsha.  The M1 highway, popularly called the Olympic, is paid.  In addition, Belarus runs through Orsha to Krichev, Mogilev, Vitebsk, Lepel, Dubrovno and Shklov. </p><h2>  Railway transport </h2>

    <p>  You can also get to Orsha by rail.  As early as 1871, they began to lay the first railway line connecting Smolensk and Brest.  This event was a turning point in the history of the city.  And although Orsha has always occupied an important place as a trade and economic hub, the ‚Äúpiece of iron‚Äù served as the very factor that led to the fantastically fast growth and development of the city.  That is why the sights of Orsha include in their list <span>an old steam locomotive</span> standing in a place of honor at the Central Station.  And the building itself, erected in 1912, is an architectural monument.  Before him there was another, wooden station, but to date it has not survived.  Orsha is the largest railway hub where international trains stopping from Moscow, St. Petersburg, Vilnius, Lviv, Kiev, Chisinau.  There is also a suburban connection linking Orsha with many cities and towns of Belarus. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The most ancient monument </h2>

    <p>  Walking along the streets of Orsha, guests are surprised at the abundance of buildings with the signs "Historical and cultural value."  It turns out that here almost every house is a tourist attraction.  However, there is one especially revered place, which indicates almost every tourist map of the city of Orsha.  This is Zamchishte (or Gorodishche).  Here, many centuries ago, Orsha Castle stood, with which the city began its life.  Five centuries ago, he was a formidable handsome man with five towers, was armed with cannons, arquebuses, and anovitas.  Unfortunately, now only images on ancient maps and a sign in the form of high gates are left of him.  But for the townspeople this place is sacred.  They say that there is even a special boulder that can heal any ailment.  They also say that there are still secret passages under the castle, stretching to the "White Kovel" - another dilapidated castle in the neighboring village of Smolyany. </p><h2>  Monasteries </h2>

    <p>  Monasteries, operating or not, always attract attention.  You can say these are the most ancient sights of Orsha.  There are several in the city.  Kuteinsky male Holy Epiphany, built on the river Kuteinka in 1620, survived the heyday and complete oblivion.  Once, a printing house was opened here and the first Belarusian Primer was released.  Nowadays, the monastery and the Holy Trinity Church under it have been restored again.  The Basilian monastery was less fortunate, of which only one dilapidated building remained.  Not much has been preserved from the Trinitarian monastery, but the city registry office is now located in its walls and a wonderful fresco is stored, so it will stand for a long time.  But the Assumption Monastery, which survived the rout and conflagration, has been restored and is functioning again.  The Dominican monastery has also been restored and reconstructed.  Today it is the church of St. Joseph the Betrothed. </p><h2>  Famous collegium </h2><p>  Speaking about the sights of Orsha, it is impossible to ignore the Jesuit collegium.  Founded in 1612, it operated until 1820.  The collegium building is very beautiful.  It is not only fully restored, but also complemented by a colorful clock tower.  Now there is a gallery, a library for children and a part of the city executive committee.  And in the XVII ‚Äì XVIII centuries, a school for children of the city nobility, the Orsha Theater, were organized here, the church worked.  At the monastery there was a bursa, a good library, a boarding school for students from distant villages.  Today, fairs, all city festivals, festivals, music and entertainment shows are held near the collegium. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Belarus Orsha" class="if" height="294" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/469289.jpg" width="392"></div>

    <h2>  Modern sights </h2><p>  Monuments and monuments dedicated to the heroic struggle of the townspeople with the Nazis also make up the sights of Orsha.  Belarus sacredly keeps the memory of its defenders and liberators, because in this country the Nazis destroyed three quarters of the population.  The younger generation and tourists are especially interested in the memorial complex ‚ÄúFor Our Soviet Motherland‚Äù (the second name is ‚ÄúKatyusha‚Äù).  It was in Orsha that this weapon was tested, which terrified the Germans.  In 1941, several experimental shells were launched here in just 8 seconds, completely destroying echelons with German equipment.  While in Orsha, one cannot but lay flowers at the Barrow of Immortality, where there is also a handful of land from the Brest Fortress. </p><p>  And children, no doubt, will enjoy a walk in the wonderful park "Fairytale Country", where you can see Gulliver, the <span>crocodile Gena,</span> singing under the button accordion about his birthday, a fairy genie and many other favorite fairy-tale characters.  There is even a small railway in the park, and a fun train rides the kids along the alleys drowning in flowers and greenery. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cities of Belarus" class="if" height="304" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/469290.jpg" width="407"></div>

    <h2>  Museums </h2><p>  A story about the sights of Orsha would be incomplete without mentioning the museums located on the territory of the city and the region. </p><p>  The Mlyn Museum of Ethnography, located in the building of an old mill, is always popular with tourists.  It works from Tuesday to Sunday, from 10am to 6pm. </p><p>  More recently opened and immediately became a favorite Museum of wooden sculptures.  All of its exhibits are made by the most talented carver Semyon Shavrov.  The sculptures look so realistic that they seem alive.  The museum has a workshop in which the followers of a talented master teach the art of carving to everyone. </p><p>  Not far from the city, in the village of Levki, there is a complex-reserve Yanki Kupala.  It is open to visitors all days except Monday. </p><p>  And another place that must be visited is the museum of partisan Zaslonov, who was the head of the partisan army in the Orsha district. </p>
