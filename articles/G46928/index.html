As well as utensils, coins, jewelry and various tools dating back to the 4th century BC. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bukhara Uzbekistan" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13750/149903.jpg" width="400"></div>  The city of Bukhara (Uzbekistan) has an age of about 2.5 thousand years.  In ancient times, Bukhara was part of the large Asian state of Sogd, which was conquered by <span>Alexander the Great.</span>  Near the city, the remains of an ancient settlement were found, which became famous thanks to its beautiful paintings with scenes of cheetah hunting. <br><br>  The city center is considered the fortress of Acre, rulers and retinues lived in it, behind the walls was Shahristan, which surrounded a suburb of merchants.  <span>The Great Silk Road</span> ran through the city of Bukhara (Uzbekistan).  Merchants from China, India, Iran and other countries were housed in more than 60 caravanserais (as in former times called inns). <br><br>  After Arabs came to Uzbekistan (Bukhara is no exception) in the 7th century, the spread of Islam began, many mosques and minarets were built, as well as a large number of cultural buildings and madrassas.  After many millennia, the Sassanid mausoleum built at that time remains surprisingly beautiful, perfect, harmonious.  Architectural complexes - Poikalo, Gaukushon, Lyabi-Hauz and other buildings of medieval architects - are especially unique.  In addition, Bukhara (Uzbekistan) is distinguished by various <span>architectural monuments</span> preserved for contemporaries. <br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Uzbekistan Bukhara" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13750/149904.jpg" width="490"></div><br>  Architectural complexes - Chor-Bakr, Bakhautdina, Toshmachit - are distinguished by special charm.  Thanks to the outstanding masters of architecture, ancient Bukhara (Uzbekistan) is clearly visible in the preserved monuments, made in a special unique manner.

A huge part of the history of mankind is associated with it.  For a long time, caravans of camels from China and Europe transported not only goods along the Silk Road, but also news about other civilizations and cultures.  This news was reflected in the architectural monuments of the city of Bukhara (Uzbekistan), which are distinguished by their originality. <br><br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tour to uzbekistan" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13750/149905.jpg" width="490"></div>  Bukhara is an ancient city, as ancient as Samarkand.  Its exact age is a mystery to archaeologists.  Scientists have determined that 2.5 thousand years ago, the first settlements began to appear here.  When the Sassanid dynasty ruled in the city in the 9-10th centuries, it flourished.  At the time when the Sheibanid dynasty reigned, he became the capital of the Bukhara Kaganate.

    <p>  Despite the fact that Islamic saints and relatives of the Prophet were buried in Bukhara, the city always remained accessible to other religions.  Synagogues are still open in Bukhara. <br><br>  At any time, this city was the capital of poetry and fairy tales.  Scientists and writers grew up in it - Avicenna, Rudaki and others, known and glorified all over the world.  Residents are hospitable and welcoming, they are always happy to welcome guests and are proud of their homeland.  Any tour to Uzbekistan includes a visit to this wonderful city.  Each visitor can see what Bukhara was originally. </p>
