Breakfast is not expensive, but some guests prefer to buy food in nearby stores, because each room has mini-refrigerators. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crystal Hotel Kazan" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1201845.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Organization of events </h2><p>  Conferences, business meetings, trainings and presentations - for various events, the Kazan Crystal Hotel offers a conference room (capacity 50 people). </p><p>  Hall rental services: </p><p>  - 3000 rubles up to 3 hours; </p><p>  - 5400 rubles from 3 to 6 hours; </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  - 800 rubles per hour over 6 hours. </p><p>  The price includes the necessary furniture, tribune and screen.  In addition, equipment rental (laptop, microphone, projector, flipchart), as well as restaurant services and the organization of coffee breaks are paid.  Wireless internet is available to event participants for free. </p><h2>  Pros and cons </h2><p>  After analyzing the guest reviews, we can distinguish several advantages that the Crystal 3 * Hotel (Kazan) has. </p><ol><li>  The rooms.  Spacious and bright rooms like guests.  It has everything you need for living: cosmetics, a hairdryer and comfortable beds.  In addition, accommodation prices are suitable even for budget travelers. </li><li>  Service.  The maids do their job perfectly, and the friendly managers try to make your trip even more comfortable. </li><li>  Infrastructure.  On the territory of the hotel there is a restaurant with Tatar and European cuisine, a left-luggage office, free parking for guests.  There are water coolers on the floors. </li><li>  Price policy.  The Crystal Hotel (Kazan) has a number of special offers for newlyweds and birthday parties, corporate clients and group rides. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Crystal 3 Kazan" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1201844.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ol><p>  Traveler reviews also found several flaws: </p><p>  - weak Wi-Fi signal; </p><p>  - poor soundproofing; </p><p>  - lack of a kettle in the room; </p><p>  - problems with the plumbing. </p><p>  This creates inconvenience to guests.  In addition, the Kazan Crystal Hotel often hosts groups of schoolchildren.  Children, as you know, can make noise and cause inconvenience to other guests.  It is recommended to check the information about the settlement of young guests before booking. </p><p>  Many travelers were not able to appreciate the location of the hotel.  At first glance, the proximity to the station means comfort for independent travelers.  Nearby are shops, inexpensive cafes and shopping centers.  On the other hand, this is a rather specific area, where many dubious personalities live.  Kazan Hotel Crystal is at the epicenter of urban life.  The noise from the trains and the busy street cause some discomfort - it is best to choose rooms with windows facing the courtyard. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Dreaming of a trip to Kazan?  Hotel ‚ÄúCrystal‚Äù, the photo and description of which is presented to your attention, offers its guests excellent service and affordable prices.  As we already said, the hotel is close to the main attractions. </p><p>  So, if you have only one weekend left, devote time to walking around the city.  The first thing you should pay attention to is the <span>Kazan Kremlin.</span>  A unique architectural ensemble, on the territory of which the Presidential Palace, the Annunciation Cathedral and the Kul-Sharif Mosque are located. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kazan hotels crystal" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1201842.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  A fascinating journey into the past thirty years ago is promised by the exposition presented at the Museum of Socialist Life.  Badges, toys, a collection of jeans, guitars, cassettes, photographs, equipment - all objects can be touched and even tried on.  You will have even more vivid impressions after an excursion with the founder of the museum. </p><h2>  For souvenirs </h2><p>  Bauman Street is another popular destination for both tourists and locals.  The pedestrian street in Kazan resembles the Moscow Arbat.  There are many cafes and restaurants, souvenir stalls and shops, and the public is entertained by street musicians. </p><p>  On Bauman Street you cannot pass by one of the symbols of the city - the ‚ÄúKazan Cat‚Äù, a monument to which was erected in 2009.  Regarding the popularity of furry pets in the capital of Tatarstan, there are several legends, so souvenirs with mustachioed are sold here at every step. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Crystal 3 Kazan" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1201846.jpg" width="345"></div>

    <p>  Continuing the theme of gifts, it is worthwhile to dwell on national clothes.  Tourists often buy shoes with bright leather ornaments, skullcaps and kalfak (a female version of the headgear).  Religious souvenirs can be purchased near the Kul Sharif Mosque. </p><p>  <span>Horse sausage</span> is considered the main delicacy in the republic <span>,</span> and for lovers of sweets in grocery stores you can find many variations of the Chuck-Chak dessert.  In alcoholic supermarkets the famous Bugulma and Tatarstan balms are sold. </p>
