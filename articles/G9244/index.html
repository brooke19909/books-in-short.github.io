    <ul><li>  there is too much mayonnaise in salads; </li><li>  stocks of hygienic cosmetics in the bathroom are not replenished (in fact, it is provided only upon check-in); </li><li>  too small pools (at "rush hour" you will not be able to swim normally); </li><li>  miniature balconies, which barely fit two plastic chairs; </li><li>  Considering that there is a mosque next to the hotel, at 5 a.m. guests will hear the sounds of prayer; </li><li>  the terrible quality of wireless Internet (only by the pool and in the bar a more or less good signal); </li><li>  low-quality alcohol in the bar; </li><li>  too little entertainment, which makes the hotel almost unsuitable for youth and outdoor activities; </li><li>  weak pressure of water in the shower; </li><li>  old noisy air conditioning; </li><li>  drinks are not provided on the beach as part of the All Inclusive system; </li><li>  instead of juices, the restaurant serves instant powder drinks; </li><li>  there is nowhere to dry towels (guests have to hang them on the railing or buy clotheslines). </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  A variety of opinions can be heard about such a resort institution as Artemis Princess Hotel 4 *.  Turkey is a country with an established tradition of service.  Here guests are greeted with a smile.  The staff does everything possible so that guests spend as little time as possible waiting for check-in and check-in.  If you can‚Äôt do without it, you will certainly be fed, after which they will give comprehensive information about the hotel and tell you a little about the city.  True, for their hospitality, the workers are not averse to receiving tips, but these are trifles.  It is especially worth noting the presence of Russian-speaking employees, thanks to which all arising problems are solved with lightning speed. </p><p>  The concept of this hotel is such that lovers of a quiet holiday will feel good here, as well as active tourists who spend most of their time on excursions and walks.  It provides a minimum of entertainment (a concert is held a couple of times a week), so travelers can fully enjoy the silence.  True, noisy groups of tourists who entertain themselves in the evenings can interfere.  Advantageous location allows you to get to know Alanya and its surroundings as close as possible.  So if you like fascinating excursions and walks, go to this hotel.  In order not to limit yourself in time, order only breakfast from meals. </p>

    <p>  As for the rooms, then most likely they will not surprise you.  These are standard rooms of compact sizes, which have long been in need of redecoration.  Although the furniture is old, the administration took care of comfortable orthopedic mattresses for guests.  In addition, we cannot but rejoice at the presence in the bathroom of new high-quality plumbing.  As for the interior, it does not cause admiration.  Everything is simple and tasteful, but no more. </p><p>  One of the main advantages of this hotel is food.  Everything here is very tasty and homely.  Despite the fact that many spoiled tourists complain about the insufficiently varied menu, no one will remain hungry here.  Perhaps the only thing to complain about is some synthetic fruits and vegetables.  Well, of course, powder juices, as well as low-quality local alcohol, can spoil the impression.  Sweet tooth can get acquainted with traditional Turkish desserts. </p>
