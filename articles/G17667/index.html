  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Memorial zones of St. Petersburg: Seaside Victory Park</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There is <span>Seaside</span> Victory <span>Park</span> in <span>St. Petersburg</span> - a place that attracts citizens and numerous tourists from all over the world.  It preserves not only the amazing nature of the Neva Delta, but also many monuments of historical and cultural significance, and also provides ample opportunities for interesting pastime and relaxation.  How to get to the Seaside <span>Victory</span> Park of <span>St. Petersburg?</span>  To explain this is not so difficult: you need to get on the subway and get off at Krestovsky Ostrov station, cross the road.  On the contrary, you will see the main entrance to its territory. </p><h2>  Park on Krestovsky </h2><p>  The territory of Victory Park in St. Petersburg occupies a fairly large area of ‚Äã‚Äãland of the Neva Delta.  It is located on an island between two Neva arms - Malaya and Middle Nevka.  Address of Seaside Victory Park in St. Petersburg: Krestovsky Prospekt, <span>23 A.</span> </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="59.969919" data-lng="30.249203899999998" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="14"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/2/7/2/1272.png"></div><p>  The park is considered one of the first in the city by the number of species of diverse vegetation.  Now it grows about fifty species of green spaces.  On the water of the <span>park pond</span> in spring and summer you can see snow-white swans.  And at the end of the main alley there is a small zoo.  It is interesting not only for its "population", but also for its unusual buildings in a fairy-tale style, making this corner of the park an unforgettable place.  Here you can even find huts on chicken legs peacefully grazing on green grass.  They can often be found in numerous photos of the Seaside Victory Park of St. Petersburg. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="st-roll.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="seaside victory park in St. Petersburg how to get" class="if uuid-2307832" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54338/2307832.jpg"></div><h2>  A bit about history </h2><p>  The breakdown of the Seaside Park begins immediately after the end of the Great Patriotic War.  However, at the beginning of the XVIII century, these lands were in the possession of the first governor of the city, Alexander Danilovich Menshikov.  In the middle of the XIX century, their owners became representatives of the old noble family of Beloselsky-Belozersky.  During the years of Soviet rule, it was supposed to make a recreation area for citizens here. </p><p>  The current Seaside Victory Park in St. Petersburg was conceived as a zone reminiscent of the exploits of Soviet soldiers in battles with the Nazis.  The idea is immortalized in a stone stele.  The relief depicts a kneeling child, lowering a seedling into the ground as the basis of the future park - a symbol of eternal life. </p><div class="photo" data-original="st-roll.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Seaside Victory Park in St. Petersburg" class="if uuid-2307797" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54338/2307797.jpg"></div><h2>  The memory of the military pages - in the original </h2><p>  Two monuments and an old pillbox from the times of the Great Patriotic War remind of military events in the Seaside Victory Park in St. Petersburg.  After all, it was here that the line of the defensive line passed on the approaches to the city of Lenin. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Stone pillbox is located on the banks of Malaya Nevka.  The stone bunker protrudes slightly above the ground.  Above the entrance there is an inscription: ‚ÄúLife is beautiful and the feat of life is eternal. The immortality of the fallen is in the courage of the living.‚Äù  On the sides of the stairs, leading to a room underground, is framed by a roll of walls made of logs.  Two crowns protrude above the ground.  Around the earth, the area is lined with boulders.  For durability, the logs are held by metal staples.  To the right of the path from the boulders is a small commemorative stele with the inscription: "Here, during the days of the blockade, the line passed ..." Further, the inscription is not readable in the photograph, as it is covered with flowers planted in two stone vases. </p><div class="photo" data-original="st-roll.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Seaside Victory Park in St. Petersburg" class="if uuid-2307766" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54338/2307766.jpg"></div><h2>  Monuments: marine valor and grateful youth </h2><p>  The sculpture "Sailor-Chernomorets" is made of stone and is a full-length figure of a sailor standing on a rock.  His pea jacket is wide open, the visor is shifted to the back of his head, in his hand is a rifle.  The gaze of the sailor, fixed and focused, is directed into the distance.  Warrior as if waiting for an approaching enemy.  His right foot is about to step towards the enemy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dslov.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Seaside Victory Park in St. Petersburg photo" class="if uuid-2307759" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54338/2307759.jpg"></div><p>  Nearby there is another sculpture called "Girl Meeting the Winners".  The granite pedestal depicts a girl in full growth, frozen in stone stillness, holding a bouquet of flowers, intended for the Russian warrior-winner.  In anticipation of his girlfriend peers into the distance, putting her hand "peak" to her eyes, blocking herself from the bright May sun.  Summer dress flows, emphasizing the charm of youth.  A light scarf curls in the wind.  The girl‚Äôs right leg is slightly bent at the knee as a sign of readiness to step towards the Soviet soldier. </p><div class="photo" data-original="st-roll.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Seaside Victory Park in St. Petersburg photo" class="if uuid-2307779" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54338/2307779.jpg"></div><p>  Both sculptures are located on the main alley of Primorsky Victory Park, framed by triple rows of lindens.  At the same time, an alley of <span>Friendship of Peoples</span> was laid <span>.</span>  Here, delegations of foreign guests planted oak seedlings as a sign of friendship with Russia.  There is also the Tree of Friendship - a symbol of close friendly contacts between twin cities. </p>
