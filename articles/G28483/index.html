Agree, this is not a pleasant situation.  But how to dry a phone that got into the water?  Do not be upset.  There are many ways to restore a smartphone.  What to do and how to act, we will consider in our today's article. </p><h2>  How to restore a means of communication? </h2><p>  How to dry a touch phone?  All procedures must be performed correctly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="talktalk.aol.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to dry a phone dropped into water" class="if uuid-2273639" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/2273639.jpg"></div><p>  The very first action is to remove the apparatus from the water.  Sometimes moments are enough for water to enter all places and completely destroy the mobile device.  It is believed that when the means of communication lies in the aquatic environment for a long period of time, then there is simply no chance of recovery.  In this case, you have to go to the master and change: </p><ul><li>  CPU. </li><li>  Microcircuit. </li><li>  RAM, etc. </li></ul><p>  Although on sale there are communications that are not afraid of water.  But still it is a rarity today.  Experts say that sensor devices have a weak zone, namely the screen.  Therefore, the question of how to dry, the phone that fell into the water, is of interest to many. </p><h2>  How to behave? </h2><p>  If such a surprise occurs, under no circumstances should you turn on the device.  Only in this way is there a chance to save him.  After the apparatus was removed from the water, the following manipulations must be done: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Remove the battery from the device and put it on a towel in a warm place. </li><li>  Remove the SIM card, as well as external memory. </li><li>  Leave the device in a warm place for at least a day. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="skinsandarmor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dry a phone that has fallen into water" class="if uuid-2273641" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/2273641.jpg"></div><p>  Many could hear such an opinion that after getting into the water, the mobile phone must be washed with distilled water.  But you shouldn‚Äôt do it on your own, otherwise you can aggravate everything.  In addition, the craftsmen use alcohol, which immerse some parts from the phone.  This is done so that there is no corrosion in the chips.  But do not completely immerse the device.  After the mobile device enters this fluid, various changes occur with it. </p><h2>  Sensor malfunction </h2><p>  How to dry a phone that has fallen into water?  The first thing that suffers is the sensor.  But how to restore it?  Unfortunately, this is not always possible.  Odds are one in ten.  To cope with this problem, you have to change the touch screen.  Cleaning with special products may not help. </p><p>  If you choose the latter option, most likely the device will not work for a long time.  Many masters offer to replace part of the parts.  After all, after a short period of time, deviations from normal operation may appear.  The wet sensor starts to fail and refuses to respond to touch.  So the best option would be a complete replacement of this part of the device. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Speaker failed </h2><p>  How to dry your phone after getting in water?  Some say that water is quickly collected in the speaker, but it is easier to recover.  Once this has happened, you can put the device in salt.  She draws moisture out of it well.  But this is not the only way.  You can do it this way: </p><ul><li>  Put the device in rice for a day. </li><li>  Use a hairdryer by selecting cooling mode.  At the same time, remove the battery from the smartphone. </li><li>  Put the device on a towel and leave it for two days in the room (at the same time do not turn it on). </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="citythatbreeds.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dry phone dropped into water" class="if uuid-2273636" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/2273636.jpg"></div><p>  Please note: the use of devices with a supply of warm air is fraught with consequences.  The mechanisms inside are very fragile and can fail due to heat. </p><h2>  The phone does not turn on </h2><p>  After falling into water and performing a series of manipulations, the device may not turn on.  But this does not mean that you have to go to the store for a new phone.  It happens that it turns on after a few days.  If you try and dry the phone in a disassembled state for a long time, then you can avoid all the problems.  But only on condition that the parts responsible for the ‚Äúbrain activity‚Äù have not been seriously affected by water. </p><p>  If they were still hit by water, you will have to look for a master.  Also, his help will be needed if: </p><ul><li>  After 3-4 days, the device did not start to function. </li><li>  The phone turned on, but it‚Äôs intermittent. </li><li>  There are signs of corrosion on the internal parts. </li></ul><p>  In order not to harm the phone, do not make unacceptable errors: </p><ul><li>  Without skills, you do not need to completely disassemble the mobile device. </li><li>  Do not heat parts with hot air. </li><li>  Do not turn on the device for at least one day after the incident. </li></ul><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear how to dry the phone.  By eliminating these errors, you can bring your cell phone back to life. </p><h2>  What to do if the device does not charge? </h2><p>  How to dry touch phone?  There are a number of methods, but problems may occur after drying.  Having completed the above steps, charging may not take place.  In this case, when wet, the nest simply deteriorated. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.naldotech.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to dry a phone that has fallen into water" class="if uuid-2273642" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/2273642.jpg"></div><p>  It is easier to replace.  Doing such manipulations at home is not worth it.  The price of work is small - up to 500 rubles.  All you can do yourself is to dry the device externally.  After falling into the water, having completed all the steps, you do not need to immediately connect the cellular to the network.  This will negatively affect the operation of the antenna.  Another point is the battery.  It is worthwhile to carefully examine his condition.  If it is swollen, then such a battery must be replaced. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cio.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to dry your phone" class="if uuid-2273640" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/2273640.jpg"></div><p>  It is clear that the screen will be the most affected.  If water passes under it, then it is already difficult to return the sensor to life.  That's why deviations from the norm appear on the screen: </p><ul><li>  Boards get wet. </li><li>  The touchscreen is deformed. </li><li>  Loops corrode. </li></ul><p>  In this case, only replacing the part will help. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear how to dry the phone after getting into the water.  The first thing to do is to remove the battery and dry it.  However, one must remember that the final outcome will be different.  Someone‚Äôs smartphone will start working in two days, and someone will have to go to the master.  Do not use a hairdryer, because all the inside of the device is very sensitive.  Thanks to the correct and quick actions, you can not lose your favorite smartphone and not get a new one. </p>
