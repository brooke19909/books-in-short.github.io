The revival of culture in the 50-60s</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>On March 5, 1953</span> , an event occurred that radically changed the course of the USSR's foreign and domestic policy.  Died I. Stalin.  By this time, repressive methods of governing the country had already exhausted themselves, so the Stalinist proteges urgently had to carry out some reforms aimed at optimizing the economy and implementing social transformations.  This time was called the thaw.  What did the thaw policy in the <span>spiritual sphere</span> mean <span>,</span> what new names appeared in the cultural life of the country can be read in this article. </p><h2>  XX Congress of the CPSU </h2><p>  In 1955, after the resignation of Malenkov, <span>Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev</span> became the head of the Soviet Union <span>.</span>  In February 1956, at the Twentieth Congress of the CPSU, his famous speech on the cult of personality was voiced.  After this, the authority of the new leader was noticeably strengthened, despite the resistance of Stalin's proteges. </p><p>  The Twentieth Congress launched various reform undertakings in our country, reviving the process of cultural reformation of society.  What did the thaw policy mean in the spiritual and literary life of people can be learned from new books and novels published at that time. </p><h2>  Thaw Policy in Literature </h2><p>  In 1957, the publication of the famous work of B. Pasternak “Doctor Zhivago” was published abroad.  Despite the fact that this work was forbidden, it diverged in huge print runs in self-published copies made on old typewriters.  The same fate befell the works of M. Bulgakov, V. Grossman and other writers of that time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what did the thaw policy in spiritual life mean" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/914753.jpg" width="422"></div>

Solzhenitsyn, “One Day of Ivan Denisovich,” is indicative.  The story, which describes the terrible everyday life of the Stalinist camp, was immediately rejected by the chief political scientist Suslov.  But the editor of the New World magazine was able to show Solzhenitsyn’s story personally to N. S. Khrushchev, after which permission was given to publish. </p><p>  Works exposing the <span>Stalinist repressions</span> found their readers. </p>

    <p>  The opportunity to convey their thoughts to readers, to publish their works contrary to censorship and the authorities - that is what the thaw policy in the spiritual sphere and literature of that time meant. </p><h2>  The revival of theater and cinema </h2><p>  In the 50-60s, the theater experienced its rebirth.  The repertoire of advanced scenes from the middle of the century will best tell what the thaw policy in the spiritual sphere and theatrical art meant.  The production of workers and collective farmers has gone into oblivion, the classical repertoire and works of the 1920s return to the stage.  But still in the theater the team style of work dominated, and administrative positions were occupied by incompetent and illiterate officials.  Because of this, many performances did not see their audience: the plays of Meyerhold, Vampilov and many others remained to lie under the cloth. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The thaw had a beneficial effect on cinema.  Many films of that time became known far beyond the borders of our country.  Such works as “Cranes are Flying”, “Ivan Childhood”, have won prestigious international awards. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what did the thaw policy in the spiritual sphere mean" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/914754.jpg" width="220"></div>  Soviet cinema returned to our country the status of a cinema power, which had been lost since the time of Eisenstein.

    <h2>  Religious persecution </h2><p>  Reducing political pressure on various aspects of people's lives did not affect the religious policy of the state.  The persecution of spiritual and religious figures intensified.  The initiator of the anti-religious company was Khrushchev himself.  Instead of the physical destruction of believers and religious figures of various faiths, the practice of publicly ridiculing and debunking religious prejudices was used.  Basically, all that the thaw policy in the spiritual life of believers meant was “re-education” and condemnation. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the period of cultural prosperity did not last long.  The final point in the thaw was the landmark event of 1962 - the defeat of an art exhibition at the Manege. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what did the thaw policy mean" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/914760.jpg" width="386"></div>  Despite the curtailment of freedoms in the Soviet Union, a return to dark Stalinist times did not take place.  What the thaw policy in the spiritual sphere of each citizen meant can be described by the sensation of the wind of changes, the diminishing role of mass consciousness and the appeal to a person as a separate person who has the right to his own views.
