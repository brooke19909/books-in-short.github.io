    <h2>  What is MSC </h2><p>  The coefficient serves to encourage drivers who comply with the rules and ride without accidents.  They receive discounts when applying for a policy.  For each year of driving without an accident, the driver coefficient is reduced, due to which you have to pay less for the policy. <br>  Previously, it was assigned to a specific machine, and when it was sold, the discount was lost.  However, in 2008, amendments were adopted, according to which the KBM belongs to the driver himself, regardless of which vehicle he drives.  The discount is retained even if the driver decides to be serviced by another insurance company. </p><p>  However, it decreases or is completely reset to zero and even goes into minus if, after an accident, the driver applies for payment.  The amount of reduction depends on the class that was assigned to the driver before the accident. </p><p>  It is often more convenient and more profitable to fix a minor accident on the spot, without calling the traffic police.  Then, of course, the cost of the policy for the culprit of the accident will not increase. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  How to find out your CBM in OSAGO </h2><p>  If the driver wants to know what his MSC is and how it is changing, you need to use a special table.  In general, in the first year he is assigned the third class, which is equal to the KBM unit. </p><p>  If this year the accident in which he would have been the culprit did not happen, then next year he will receive fourth grade, and KBM will decrease by 5%.  But if an accident does occur, then the class will be the second, and the KBM will increase to 1.4, that is, the cost of the policy will increase by 40%. </p><p>  Thanks to riding without accidents, a 5 percent discount will be awarded every year until it reaches 50%. </p><h2>  CTP table </h2>

    <p>  The coefficient is easily determined by this special table, which is the same for all SCs.  To do this, it is enough to know the driver's class. </p><p>  Take for example the third class.  On it in the next column we see a unit.  This is MSC.  Next year, the driver receives the fourth grade, which corresponds to a coefficient of 0.95.  It looks like this further.  Other columns indicate which class will be assigned in the future if accidents occur. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Self settlement </h2><p>  Another way to find out your CBM in OSAGO is through self-assessment.  Consider an example with the same driver who first got behind the wheel.  If he does not have an accident within three years, then for the fourth year of driving his discount will be 15%.  However, in the event of an accident, which he becomes the culprit, his class will not be the 7th, which corresponds to a 15 percent discount, but only the fourth. </p><p>  If the table is at hand, then it is easy to see.  But even without it, calculating the KBM is also possible. </p><h2>  KBM for multi-driver insurance </h2>

    <p>  How to find out your CBM in compulsory motor third-party liability insurance if several people are allowed to drive a car?  It is very simple.  The coefficient that has the greatest value of all is applied.  For example, one KBM driver has 35%, while another has only 15%.  Then the cost will be calculated based on a 15% discount. </p><p>  If one of the drivers gets into an accident, which becomes the culprit, and the other travels accidentally for a year, then only the driver - the culprit of the accident, will grow KBM.  Another will receive a 5% discount on him. </p><h2>  How to find out your CBM OSAGO on the basis of PCA </h2><p>  RSA, or the Russian Union of Auto Insurers, is a community organization of insurers.  The Union helps car owners on many issues.  An important role is given to informing drivers.  So, on the official website there is a lot of information of practical interest and benefit. <br>  PCA maintains a single database on MSC.  Going to it, you can easily find out your KBM by OSAGO in RSA. </p><p>  This information is available to both legal entities and individuals.  For individuals it is enough to enter their driver's license.  And if OSAGO is issued without limiting the list of drivers, then you will also need a passport of the car owner and TCP. </p><p>  The situation with the KBM is just as simple.  It is not difficult for legal entities to check the CBM of CTP in the PCA database.  To do this, just enter the company TIN and the necessary documents for the car. </p>

    <h2>  Is it possible to fix the data in the PCA database for KBM? </h2><p>  Suppose we succeeded in checking the OSM CMB on the basis of the SAR.  But here another problem may come up.  It happens that on the site the system produces a coefficient that is not true.  For example, the policyholder receives a KBM equal to one, while he traveled in his car without accidents for many years. <br>  The reasons why this happens may be as follows. </p><p>  If <span>a driver‚Äôs license</span> was <span>replaced,</span> it is possible that the data was not corrected, but those that were on the old document were left.  To achieve the correct display of information, you should write a query about this in the PCA with attachments of copies of the new and old identities.  It happens that an error was made during data entry. </p><p>  This can also be found when the driver‚Äôs name appears on several policies at once.  For example, Ivanov, who has 11th grade and drives his own car, is also allowed to drive his wife's vehicle.  And the latter coefficient is only 0.95, which corresponds to the 4th class.  Thus, when transmitting data, its coefficient will be displayed as 0.95. </p><p>  And another reason when the KBM of drivers on the basis of the AIS RSA for OSAGO may not appear in the database is the bankruptcy of the insurance company. </p><h2>  How to save a discount </h2><p>  So, we found out how to find out your CBM in compulsory motor third-party liability insurance on the PCA website.  Suppose that your independent calculations do not match the numbers on the site.  How to be in this case? </p>

    <p>  A complaint should be written in the PCA that the real value of the coefficient is different than on the site, and to justify this information.  The claim shall be accompanied by copies of policies and certificates from the UK stating that for a certain number of years the ride has been trouble-free. </p><p>  If an error occurs, the policy whose action is completed does not need to be discarded.  After all, there information is displayed corresponding to reality.  It does not make sense to prove anything to the <span>insurance agent</span> or to call.  It is better to immediately contact the main office of the company by writing a corresponding complaint.  When sending a complaint, save the receipt, which will be a confirmation of payment. </p><p>  And if you decide to take the application to the company in person, then make it in duplicate, so that on one of them you will be marked with acceptance. <br>  If within two weeks neither documents nor a refund were made, you can safely contact the authority above and seek justice. <br>  Thus, the question "how to find out your CBM in compulsory motor third-party liability insurance in RSA?"  It is important not only for the sake of simple curiosity, but in order to be sure that the calculation of the next policy will be correct. </p>
