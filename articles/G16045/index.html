  <section class="page js-page"><h1>ABB frequency converters: purpose, advantages, error codes</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the article we will talk about ABB frequency converters, which are used to control electric motors.  With the help of such devices, you can smoothly change the moment and speed, and most importantly - completely get rid of such a harmful phenomenon as inrush current.  When converting direct current to alternating wave, an inverter creates waves (square, sinusoidal).  As with any other power source, the frequency converter must have stability, and it must provide a sufficient level of current to maintain the power of the entire system. </p><h2>  What are chastotniks for? </h2><p>  It is worth noting that today ABB frequency converters have gained wide popularity, they are increasingly used in industry.  It is extremely important to use minimum size drives in production.  For this reason, all components of the frequency converters are installed inside the housing in close proximity.  Of course, this arrangement of components also has drawbacks - all equipment failures can occur. </p><div class="photo" data-original="alexnld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Frequency converter" class="if uuid-2878420" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57090/2878420.jpg"></div><p>  Devices are needed in order to facilitate starting the engine, and then control it.  The ‚Äúbrains‚Äù contain a large number of settings that allow you to make fine adjustments.  We will talk about this and much more later in the article, and most importantly, we will examine in detail the error codes of the frequency converters ABB. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Repair of chastotniks </h2><p>  As for the repair of chastotniks, it is often impractical to make it if the control unit is out of order.  But there are models that are built on a modular basis.  As a rule, these are devices whose power is 100 kW or more.  As a result, the functional diagram is greatly simplified and the resource is increased.  The main factor that will ensure the smooth operation of the device is timely diagnosis.  It is also worth noting that the device is quite complex, and during operation there will certainly be problems. </p><p>  Frequency converters are sensitive equipment, since the components used have a very high level of complexity.  Quite often, problems lie in the software.  The more features a device provides, the greater the likelihood that it will fail.  It is quite difficult and expensive to repair equipment, but you can fix some breakdowns yourself if you can handle a soldering iron and screwdrivers. </p><h2>  Bug fixes </h2><p>  The cooling system in the frequency converter plays an important role.  In fact, this is the "pain point" of the entire frequency converter ABB.  To increase the life of the emergency, you need to blow out the radiator with compressed air at least once a month.  But it will be even better if you thoroughly blow through the case, so that even on the board there are no traces of dust.  After all, consider the fact that dust conducts static electricity, is able to accumulate it.  And statics is the worst enemy of semiconductor components.  It is also worth noting the fact that the chastotniks for three-phase electric motors are afraid of overloads.  Therefore, the operation should be carried out as gently and accurately as possible. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chastotnik ABB" class="if uuid-2878419" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57090/2878419.jpg"></div><p>  IGBT keys are mounted on radiators.  These keys directly control the electric motor, they convert DC to AC.  But the byproduct of the work is heat.  It can cause the key to overheat and burn. </p><h2>  Cooling and condensers </h2><p>  Quite often you can find electric fans that allow you to forcibly cool the radiator.  Sometimes it is necessary to check the operation of coolers in order to ensure the proper level of cooling of the frequency converter ABB.  It is worth noting that the dust accumulated on the blades will cause a decrease in the rotor speed.  But the power of the engine is already low, pollution will lead to the fact that the air flow is not enough for normal cooling. </p><div class="photo" data-original="exodraft.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Frequency inverter ABB" class="if uuid-2878425" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57090/2878425.jpg"></div><p>  Another problem that is relevant not only for chastotniks is electrolytic capacitors.  They are often charged and discharged, resulting in excessive wear and aging.  As a result, their capacity decreases, an inter-polar breakdown occurs.  You can detect this by external signs: the case is destroyed or swollen.  The frequency converter is a complex device that needs constant care. </p><h2>  System resistor </h2><p>  It is possible to regulate the operation of the converter using either a microcontroller or manually.  Quite often, problems arise in a variable resistor, with which the engine speed is regulated.  Management can also be carried out using the remote inverter panel.  In order to change a faulty external resistor, it is enough in the settings to switch the adjustment option from the remote panel.  The resistor can be replaced independently with a similar one.  Be sure to look at its face value, you can find it in the instructions for a particular device. </p><h2>  Alarm </h2><p>  The frequency converter is a complex device that is controlled by a special module.  But it allows you to both manage and diagnose the entire system.  Most of the chastotniks are equipped with an indicator, on which errors are displayed if any.  It is worth noting that to eliminate most errors, it is enough to check the cables and tighten the terminals.  The most common mistake is overload.  It occurs due to the fact that a spark gap appears between the terminal and the wire. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lscontrol.dk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Frequency for three-phase electric motor" class="if uuid-2878423" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57090/2878423.jpg"></div><p>  It is also worth noting that the chastotnik for a three-phase electric motor can be controlled from a remote panel.  And if the integrity of the wires or the connection of the plugs is violated, an error will appear that signals a malfunction. </p><h2>  Common Mistake Table </h2><p>  Next, we will consider the most common errors of chastotnikov ABB.  For a better perception of information, use our table. </p><table border="2" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5" class="if"><thead><tr style="background-color: #ffe4b5; text-align: center;"><td><p>  Error code </p></td><td><p>  Decryption </p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>  1 </p></td><td><p>  Overload </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  2 </p></td><td><p>  DC overvoltage </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  3 </p></td><td><p>  IF overheating </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  4 </p></td><td><p>  IF output short circuit </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  5 </p></td><td><p>  Not used </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  6 </p></td><td><p>  DC voltage low </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  7 </p></td><td><p>  Lost analog input AI1 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  8 </p></td><td><p>  Lost analog input AI2 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  9 </p></td><td><p>  Motor overheating </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  10 </p></td><td><p>  Lost Communication With Control Panel </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  eleven </p></td><td><p>  Motor start error </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  12 </p></td><td><p>  Motor speed loss </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  thirteen </p></td><td><p>  Not used </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  14 </p></td><td><p>  External failure 1 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  fifteen </p></td><td><p>  External failure 2 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  16 </p></td><td><p>  Short to ground </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  17 </p></td><td><p>  Not used </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  18 </p></td><td><p>  Faulty temperature control system </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  19 </p></td><td><p>  Error in optical isolation </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  20 </p></td><td><p>  Internal power supply error </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  21 </p></td><td><p>  Error in current measurement circuit </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  22 </p></td><td><p>  Phase error </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  23 </p></td><td><p>  Encoder malfunction </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  24 </p></td><td><p>  Exceeding maximum rotor speed </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  25 </p></td><td><p>  Not used </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  26 </p></td><td><p>  The presence of an internal error in the configuration block </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  27 </p></td><td><p>  Error in internal configuration file </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  28 </p></td><td><p>  Communication error serial 1 com </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  29th </p></td><td><p>  Error reading fieldbus configuration file </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  30, 31, 32, 33, </p></td><td><p>  Fieldbus failure </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  34 </p></td><td><p>  Motor failure </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  35 </p></td><td><p>  Power failure </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  36 </p></td><td><p>  Software Error </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  37 </p></td><td><p>  Inverter overheating </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  38 </p></td><td><p>  Incorrectly set parameters 3701, 3703 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  101-299 </p></td><td><p>  System errors </p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  The electric motor does not start </h2><p>  A fairly common malfunction of ABB frequency converters is an error that the motor does not move.  There are only two reasons: </p><ol><li>  The motor is out of order. </li><li>  The control system was damaged.  In this case, only disassembling the converter and replacing the control board will help. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="lscontrol.dk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Frequency converter this" class="if uuid-2878422" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57090/2878422.jpg"></div><p>  In the event that you yourself can not perform the repair, it is worth contacting specialists.  But most of the engineers, by the way, carry out modular repairs - they replace the entire unit at once, they are not puzzled by the search for a capacitor that has failed.  But sometimes modular repairs are much more expensive than buying a new ABB frequency converter. </p>
