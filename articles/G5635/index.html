The conditional border for the separation of resorts passes between the city of Byala (Varna region) and the city of Obzor (Burgas region).  In the South there are such famous resort places as Obzor, St. Vlas, Nessebar, Ravda, Pomorie, Burgas, Chernomorets, Sozopol, Dunes, Primorsko, Kiten, Lozenets, Tsarevo, Ahtopol, Sinemorets and Elenite. </p><p>  The northern coast of the country is represented by the resorts of Byala, Varna, Golden Sands, Sunny Day, Riviera, St. Constantine and Elena, Albena and Balchik. </p><h2>  Club complexes </h2><p>  When reviewing hotels in Bulgaria, it can be noted that hotels on the coast are developing every year and can already compete with hotels in Turkey and Egypt.  The all-inclusive system is quite developed on the coast.  Some hotels form entire club complexes of several hotels with vast territory.  Guests of such complexes can use the entire infrastructure for free: visit bars, swim in pools, use the services of spas and mini-clubs.  In reviews of hotels in Bulgaria, tourists note that it is very convenient and unusual.  That is, flew into one hotel, and you relax in several at once. </p><p>  One of these complexes is the famous Riviera resort. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rivierabulgaria.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel pool Riviera" class="if uuid-2351142" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72243/2351142.jpg"></div><h2>  Resort "Riviera" </h2><p>  "Riviera" is a gated complex located fourteen kilometers from the city of Varna and directly adjacent to another famous resort Golden Sands. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Riviera is located on the territory of a luxurious coniferous park with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã12 hectares and consists of five-star hotels Imperial, Riviera Beach, four-star Oasis and Lotus and a three-star Nymph.  All hotels of the Riviera complex in Bulgaria are located on the seashore, on the beach, and are one of the most expensive and luxurious on the <span>Bulgarian</span> Black Sea coast. </p><p>  Until 1989, the complex was a government residence with strictly limited access.  It was attended by ministers and senior officials of Bulgaria.  In the 90s, the complex was privatized, and rest in a closed resort became available to everyone. </p><p>  Surrounded by a natural park on the Black Sea coast, the Riviera resort complex offers its guests a variety of services, sports, spa treatments and, most importantly, a natural mineral healing spring.  You can stand under a stream of healing water right on the beach near the Nymph Hotel.  Water temperature is over 48 degrees.  The source flows directly into the sea, and those who find it hard to withstand enough hot water can lie in the warm, natural bathrooms, which are made of stone on the shore.  In these baths, mineral water combines with sea water, and the temperature becomes more comfortable for the human body. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="The view from the room" class="if uuid-2351132" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72243/2351132.jpg"></div><p>  "Riviera Beach" refers to hotels in Bulgaria for families with small children.
