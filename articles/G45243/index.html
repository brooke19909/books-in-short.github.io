    <h2>  Common problems </h2><p>  Unfortunately, all devices tend to break.  The Indesit WISL 102 model is no exception. The instructions that come with the kit contain information about the most common problems.  Let's take a quick look at them. </p><ul><li>  Failure of the heating element.  This problem occurs due to contact with water.  TEN breaks due to the formation of scale on it.  To prevent breakage, it is recommended to periodically clean it with special tools or use a water softener during washing. </li><li>  Problems with the electric motor.  The company supplies the devices with a high-quality motor, but its sensor is its weak point.  Many buyers report frequent capacitor problems.  Only replacing the part with a new one will save. </li><li>  Problems with the surge protector.  Unfortunately, there are lots of factory-owned washing machines.  Most often, it manifests itself in the first three years of operation. </li></ul>
