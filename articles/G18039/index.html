    <h2>  "New" </h2><p>  Hotel "New" is located at the entrance to the city, near the highway Moscow-Minsk.  Modern interchanges and convenient location allow guests to easily get anywhere in Smolensk. </p><p>  The hotel complex has a large secure parking.  In the absence of a personal car, the problem of remoteness from the historical center is solved with the help of a relatively cheap taxi, and a <span>bus stop</span> is 200 meters away <span>.</span> </p><p>  Hotel "New" (Gubenko St., 26) offers guests five categories of rooms: </p><ul><li>  standard DBL (3400 rubles); </li><li>  standard double TWIN (3500 rubles); </li><li>  Standard Superior Superior (3700 rubles); </li><li>  Junior Suite Junior Suite (4200 rubles); </li><li>  two-room Suite Suite (4600 rubles). </li></ul><p>  All rooms are decorated in a classic style, and the price includes: breakfast, Wi-Fi and secure parking. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Additional services: </p><ul><li>  laundry; </li><li>  organization of excursions; </li><li>  transfer; </li><li>  accommodation with pets; </li><li>  luggage storage. </li></ul><h2>  Traveler Reviews </h2><p>  According to guests, the Novy hotel is 100% justified by its name - the rooms are clean and comfortable, well-groomed area.  The location of the hotel is offset by developed infrastructure.  In the hotel complex you will find a restaurant, currency exchange and even a gift shop. </p><p>  Of the minuses, guests note the lack of an elevator.  In addition, the restaurant with a beautiful interior is not entirely happy - the waiters are in no hurry to serve, the breakfast buffet is modest, and the menu does not even contain half of the declared dishes. </p><h2>  Premier </h2><p>  The Premier Hotel is another complex on the outskirts of Smolensk (64 Krupskaya St.).  Major sights are a twenty-minute walk away.  There is a shopping and entertainment center across the road, so at any time guests can go to the cinema, a supermarket or go shopping. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="new hotel" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1044896.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The rooms are available for booking: </p><ol><li>  Standard - from 2500 rubles. </li><li>  Standard Plus - from 2900 rubles. </li><li>  Deluxe - from 3500 rubles. </li></ol><p>  The rooms have air conditioning, a safe and a telephone.  A hairdryer, kettle and kitchenware are available upon request, as well as an ironing board and iron. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At extra charge: </p><ul><li>  laundry; </li><li>  driver services; </li><li>  transfer; </li><li>  flower delivery. </li></ul><p>  For business meetings, negotiations and presentations, the Premier Hotel offers rental of special equipment and a conference room for 100 seats. </p><p>  There is a restaurant on the territory of the hotel complex, providing full-fledged meals for guests.  Own wine list, a wide range of dishes and first-class service are also available during celebrations or coffee breaks. </p><h2>  Three stars </h2><p>  Guests rate the Premier complex with three stars.  The modern rooms are in good condition, the staff is attentive to requests, and the hearty breakfast in the restaurant leaves the most pleasant experience. </p><p>  As for the minuses, most guests note a dull view from the window of the industrial zone and a small parking lot, which may not be enough space for everyone. </p><h2>  Back to USSR </h2><p>  A real journey into the past is offered by the tourist complex ‚ÄúRussia‚Äù.  The main advantage is the location in the historical center of the city - the building was built on the eve of the Olympics in 1980. </p><p>  Today, ‚ÄúRussia‚Äù continues to be the largest hotel complex in the Smolensk region, which is able to receive up to 300 guests at a time.  Not all Smolensk hotels are distinguished by such a scale, but, unfortunately, the current state of the number of rooms leaves much to be desired - we will talk about this a bit later. </p><p>  Hotel infrastructure includes: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  conference room with 250 seats; </li><li>  bars and banquet hall; </li><li>  meeting room; </li><li>  two restaurants; </li><li>  gym; </li><li>  billiard room; </li><li>  a hairdresser; </li><li>  souvenir shop; </li><li>  Laundry </li><li>  left-luggage office; </li><li>  Wellness complex with swimming pool, Finnish and Turkish saunas. </li></ul><p>  Available for booking single and double rooms, as well as junior suites and suites.  Double accommodation will cost at least 3600 rubles. </p><p>  The railway station, as well as the main <span>attractions of Smolensk,</span> is within walking distance. </p><h2>  The need for change </h2><p>  As we already said, the housing stock in the hotel is presented mainly in retro style, more precisely - it has not been substantially updated since the times of the USSR.  For this reason, most guests are perplexed by the high cost of living with a minimum level of comfort and not the best service. </p><p>  Old-school people work in such hotels, and you can‚Äôt teach them how to be friendly and smile.  Guest reviews say that after such a reception, you want to spend less time on the territory of the complex, and the magnificent city park becomes the only salvation. </p><p>  Lack of hot water in the morning, old plumbing, restaurant prices and poor breakfast - these are just some of the guests' comments.  But the most important thing is the discrepancy between the high cost of living and the quality of services. </p><p>  According to the guests, the hotel still has workers who wholeheartedly ‚Äúroot‚Äù for the Rossiya complex.  However, if the situation does not change for the better, then even these people will look for another job.  The city of Smolensk is the largest tourist center, and the main hotel must comply with this status. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúCathedral yard‚Äù </h2><p>  In the immediate vicinity of the Cathedral of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary is the pilgrimage house "Cathedral Court". </p><p>  The inn can offer the traveler only a few rooms: </p><ul><li>  triple economy; </li><li>  triple comfort; </li><li>  Double Room; </li><li>  Suite </li><li>  executive suite. </li></ul>

    <p>  Despite the rather simple design of the rooms, guests talk about comfort and cleanliness.  An ironing board and iron, dishes are available on request, and a cooler with hot water is freely available. </p><p>  Smolensk hotels, as a rule, cannot provide guests with peace and quiet due to restaurants.  However, there is no such institution on ‚ÄúCathedral Court‚Äù, accommodation with children and animals is also not provided, therefore a full rest after a day full of excursions is provided to you.  An obvious plus is the location on the territory of the cathedral, as well as the presence of a small parking lot for cars. </p><p>  Of the shortcomings most often noted: </p><ul><li>  lack of breakfast; </li><li>  weak Wi-Fi signal; </li><li>  Private bathrooms are not available in all rooms. </li></ul><h2>  ‚ÄúVilla Grove‚Äù </h2><p>  Hotel ‚ÄúVilla Grove‚Äù, despite the distance from the historical center, is considered one of the best in the city.  A complex of three small buildings welcomes travelers in a residential neighborhood, away from the hustle and bustle of the streets.  For rest and walks in the fresh air, a tree nursery with a lake, which is located nearby, is ideal. </p><p>  The following room categories are available for booking: </p><ol><li>  Standard economy - 2300 rubles. </li><li>  Standard - 2600 rubles. </li><li>  Triple standard plus - 3500 rubles. </li><li>  Standard plus - 3000 rubles. </li><li>  Junior Suite - 3500 rubles. </li></ol><p>  All rooms include a work area with a desk and private bathrooms. Amenities include a range of toiletries, a hairdryer, a safe, a TV and air conditioning. </p>

    <p>  Breakfast and Wi-Fi are included in the price, and coffee or tea can be enjoyed in the lobby.  Upon request, cots, irons, cutlery and dishes are available, as well as a parking space. </p><h2>  Guest opinion </h2><p>  ‚ÄúVilla Grove‚Äù is popular with many travelers.  Laconic design of rooms, new furniture and plumbing - these are undoubted advantages.  From the <span>sleeping area,</span> you can reach the historic center in a matter of minutes, and in the absence of a car, a city taxi comes to the rescue. </p><p>  According to hotel guests, breakfast did not deserve the highest ratings.  Dishes must be selected in advance, and the serving size is quite modest.  In addition, some rooms do not have refrigerators. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúRespect‚Äù </h2><p>  The city center and silence, it would seem, are incompatible things, but the Respect Hotel can prove the opposite. </p><p>  The building of the mini-hotel is located at: st.  18. Paris Commune. It is just a five-minute walk from Blonie Garden and <span>Lenin Square.</span>  Despite being close to the sights, the place is quite secluded. </p><p>  ‚ÄúRespect‚Äù offers travelers sixteen rooms of the categories of standard, superior single or double, as well as luxury.  The most modest option for two guests will cost 2000 rubles.  The price includes internet access, breakfast and parking. </p><p>  According to guests, the main advantage of the hotel is its location.  Walking distance to the promenade and central streets with many cafes and shops.  Breakfast is no frills, but decent.  A good impression is the condition of the rooms after repair and the presence of coolers on the floor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tourist complex russia" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1044898.jpg" width="270"></div>

    <p>  Disadvantages: </p><ol><li>  The picturesque hills, among which the hotel is located, can become a serious obstacle for novice motorists and people with sore feet, who will be hard to master the slopes and climbs. </li><li>  Lack of a ramp for prams. </li><li>  Soundproofing. </li><li>  Inconvenient beds and mattresses. </li><li>  Lack of air conditioning. </li><li>  Night club near the hotel. </li></ol><h2>  ‚ÄúManor‚Äù </h2><p>  Convenient location, indoor pool and upscale service promise travelers the Manor Hotel.  The Lopatinsky Garden and the Assumption Cathedral, the <span>Smolensk Kremlin</span> and the <span>Blonie Garden,</span> as well as the train station are within walking distance. </p><p>  It offers two buildings - a total of 23 comfortable rooms.  Infrastructure includes: </p><ul><li>  restaurant and cafe; </li><li>  pool; </li><li>  a sauna; </li><li>  a play area and a playground; </li><li>  dry cleaning and laundry; </li><li>  underground two-level parking. </li></ul><p>  The cheapest is a double attic room (2700 rubles), located in the main building.  The new building houses exclusively superior rooms, the most modest of which (classic suite) - for 4700 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel respect" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1044900.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Opinions of travelers regarding the Manor Hotel are divided.  Everyone who was relaxing in the new building was delighted with the interior and equipment of the rooms, in which even an individual infrared sauna was provided. </p><p>  As for the old building, here the price-quality ratio summed up a bit.  Not the best furniture and small rooms (especially attic rooms) spoiled the impression a bit. </p><p>  Breakfast, which is included in the price, must be ordered in advance.  The choice is very modest, but it does not affect the taste.  In the main restaurant, according to guest reviews, the prices are too high. </p><p>  The location is good, but in the private sector.  For this reason, craving for evening walks does not arise. </p><p>  In addition, all guests noted the responsiveness and friendly attitude of the staff. </p><h2>  "Wheel" </h2><p>  The holiday home ‚ÄúWheel‚Äù does not attract travelers with a good location or affordable prices.  Of greatest interest is the original design of fourteen rooms, each of which has its own theme. </p><p>  For example, in the Chukotka room there is a huge bed in the form of a sleigh, and the walls are decorated with deer skin and horns.  In the ‚ÄúAttic of Love‚Äù there is a bed in the shape of a heart, a canopy and the predominance of red in the interior.  The atmosphere of the ‚ÄúFazenda‚Äù room is created by a rustic style and a waterfall with real turtles. </p><p>  The price includes breakfast buffet.  For younger guests, a playground with slides and a trampoline is equipped on site. </p>
