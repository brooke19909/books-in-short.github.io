    <h2>  Would you like to settle with a dog?  You are welcome! </h2><p>  It is worth noting that, compared with other settlements of the Taman Peninsula, the cost of rest on the territory of the village of Golubitskaya is somewhat overstated.  The reason for this is the high popularity of the resort.  Pensions in various ways try to attract the attention of customers.  For example, in some establishments pets are allowed.  Such a service offers the recreation center "Christina."  The village of Golubitskaya is famous for the hospitality of local residents.  On the territory of almost every private house there is a guest house or even a small hotel complex.  Additionally, you can use the food services. </p>

    <h2>  Shell invasion </h2><p>  The main reason why tourists come here is the sea, the sun and the beach.  The latter, I must say, in the morning is a stunning sight.  During the night, a huge amount of large shell rock is thrown onto the coast, which makes up the top layer of the beach.  During the day, large fragments are crushed and turned into fine sand.  You can and should walk on it barefoot: this is the perfect acupressure for the feet.  It should be noted that the largest and most famous is the central beach.  For him, for the most part, a crowd of vacationers flocked to the private sector.  If we go towards the Peresyp, the number of people decreases.  Near the sea, various events are often held to coincide with any event: whether it is the opening of the holiday season or Neptune's day. </p>
