Here are just household trivia and our striking resemblance is limited.  Someone loves the cold, and a person walking nearby - the heat;  some prefer to be creators, others like the role of the contemplative.  There are couch potatoes for whom a cup of tea, a plaid and a favorite series are more expensive than any adventure.  Silence, peace and beloved books - what could be better than a peaceful contemplation of the beautiful, reflection and search?  And there are people for whom the birthplace is the road.  All they would have to go, fly, run, swim somewhere.  For them to release all the money that was saved on a fur coat, for travel and adventure - just spit.  Familiar around the world, a bunch of photos and breathtaking impressions are the memory of those moments that are really worth living for.  There is such a side in the world that will satisfy both home people and adventurers;  and intellectuals and extremes;  both adults and children;  and children of mountains, and salted sea wolves.  And this is Montenegro.  Meet the beautiful country by the sea! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sea ​​montenegro" class="if" height="378" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13530/438016.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  For centuries: Montenegro </h2><p>  This country is often confused with Croatia, Serbia, Albania ... It comes to the point that they unite it with its neighbors.  This is not surprising, because this state gained independence only in the relatively nearby two thousand and sixth year.  Then they broke a family bond with neighboring Serbia.  In general, the situation in the Balkans was often tense, starting in the twentieth century.  The constant manipulations of Germany, the incompatibility of peoples, although considered fraternal, which they tried to unite in one territory, all this affected the state of the region.  And so, at the beginning of the young century, a map of the peninsula was finally formed.  Nevertheless, peace in the Balkans is rather fragile: frequent strikes and conflicts arise either in Serbia or in Greece.  The countries of the former Yugoslavia are considered one of the poorest in Europe.  Therefore, tourists should not expect chic palaces or fashionable streets.  And yet this does not prevent them from visiting these countries and going to sea.  Montenegro also shook from rallies, but remains attractive to travelers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Montenegro hotels by the sea" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13530/438013.jpg" width="600"></div>

Montenegro is a country with a predominantly mountainous terrain.  Its highest point is about two and a half kilometers.  There is also a canyon, considered the deepest in Europe and almost inferior to no one in the world.  Climbers will definitely like it here.  Not far from the Albanian border is <span>Skadar Lake.</span>  It is striking in its grandeur and beauty of species.  By the way, the relief here is pretty flat.  And, of course, the most interesting part of Montenegro is the one where land and sea meet.  Montenegro received as a gift from nature only a narrow strip of the Adriatic coast.  But these shores are breathtaking.  The gentle sea beckons.  On the coast, the country's climate is quite mild, it belongs to the subtropical type.  But in the depths of the peninsula, it ceases to be so gentle, although it still remains comfortable.  Popular resorts in Europe are located here.  And this is not at all surprising!  The mild climate, mountains and plains, the Adriatic Sea - Montenegro is simply created for tourism! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="montenegro budva sea" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13530/438009.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Count Montenegro </h2><p>  One way or another, but all tourists have to deal with the Montenegrins.  And everyone is destined to remain delighted with these proud people.  Their life is measured and leisurely.  These people are very polite, never climb into other people's affairs.  They were tempered in past centuries, and everywhere, especially in the villages, independence, honor, pride, courage and courage are valued above all.  Montenegrins are very good tourists, and for some reason they are especially warm with Russians, who are very loved here.  Travelers leave only positive reviews, in which they mention the decency of the staff, store employees.  What is also important, they also note the sense of humor of the inhabitants of this warm country.  Most of the country is engaged in metallurgy and agriculture.  Representatives of all the peoples of the <span>Balkan Peninsula</span> live here <span>.</span>  The culture of Montenegro was created under the pressure of all kinds of religions, movements, trends, eras.  So the state religions are both Christianity and Islam.  After visiting this state, the tourist will not have a bitter aftertaste from communicating with local residents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="popular resorts in europe" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13530/438005.jpg" width="600"></div>

Urgently! </h2><p>  Not the only sea - we will talk about the Adriatic later - Montenegro lives.  And here is what you should definitely see a person who came even just to soak up the sea.  Montenegro has a rather rich history and culture, and the landscapes come across just magnificent.  So, what should a tourist see?  Do not ignore Budva.  She simply cannot be overlooked with its cobbled streets and unique color.  It’s not clear where you are: in a noisy Arabian market of spices and exotic or walking in Prague.  St. Stephen's Island is also a kind of classic of the tourist genre.  Montenegro has many islands, but this one can rightly be called a diamond in the tiara of the country's attractions. </p><p>  But medieval Europe pulls from Skadar Lake.  Under the din of birds, visit monasteries, churches, crypts, admire the haze above the water.  Ada Boyana is <span>Montenegro's</span> most famous nudist <span>beach.</span>  However, where the sea meets the Boyana River, you already feel unity with nature.  Since the Montenegrins are very religious, in almost every village you can find a temple or mosque.  Many of them breathe in antiquity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Adriatic Sea Montenegro" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13530/438004.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Popular resorts of Montenegro </h2><p>  The route "Montenegro - Budva - Sea" is perhaps the most popular.  And Becici attracts all visitors with a beach, sparkling like gold.  In general, at any resort you will find places where you can soak up the sun and swim in the waves of the Adriatic.  Also, almost all resorts offer food for the mind: excursions and walks.  Kotor, for example, with its architectural ensembles, is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  Go to Bar for your impressions.  All resorts are interconnected and are located at a short distance from each other, so that you can travel the coast along and across.  Imagine: snow-white houses near the same beach with red tiles, paved streets, and all this is seasoned with splashes of lush greenery of pines.  And this is in the small village of Milocer.  And in Herceg Novi, visit the beautiful open-air Botanical Garden.  And all this - with the salty smell of the sea.  One cannot even dream of a better vacation. </p><h2>  Sea holiday </h2><p>  All attracted by the welcoming <span>Adriatic Sea.</span>  Montenegro has several worthy resorts.  But what to do besides sunbathing?  Admire how beautiful the Adriatic Montenegro (sea) is.  Photos with her image are simply excellent.  Be sure to ride along the coast.  Swim around the island of Stephen.  Wonderful spas will delight you with a massage.  Just wander along the quays, and the pictures will breathe freshness.  Montenegro combines the freshness of the sea, and the spice of the streets, and the solemnity of the monasteries. </p>

    <h2>  Travel Tips </h2><p>  Going on a trip, exchange rubles for euros in your own country (it’s more profitable).  It is worth noting that Montenegro is a civilized country, so there should be no problems with communication or the Internet.  You can rent a car, but you can also use public transport: the railway view is well developed.  Carry photocopies of documents with you, but leave all values ​​at the hotel.  Although crime in the country is low, Montenegrins respect tourists.  Before departure, read the memo to the traveler.  It’s good to learn the necessary legal information.  There should also be no problems with the language, as many residents of the state understand the Russian language, as well as English.  But it’s better to learn a couple of the most necessary phrases and polite words in Serbo-Croatian.  You will bring the impressions from the trip to the sea.  Montenegro will forever settle in your heart. </p>
