  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Discipline History of Economics</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  As an independent <span>branch of science, the</span> history of economics arose in the second half of the 19th century, when it stood out from the political economy.  Such a need arose due to the fact that it was necessary to scientifically comprehend the development of economic processes in society in a historical aspect.  The role of the economy in the life of society required independent study, for this a <span>comparative analysis of</span> all socio-economic trends in world development was needed, using this analysis it was possible to identify specific features that distinguish the development of the economy in different regions of the planet and various countries, taking into account the features of their development, geographical conditions, the specifics of traditions and mentality. </p><p>  The separation of the history of economics into a separate independent science was also associated with the need to make it possible to comprehend the various socio-economic reforms that were carried out in different countries under the influence of global objective development trends in similar and approximately identical conditions.  Already at the end of the 19th century, the history of economics became an independent discipline, which was taught in many higher educational institutions.  Using this subject, specialists were trained who were able to carry out reformist activities, using knowledge from the historical experience of reform and relying on this experience. </p><p>  The practical use of the history of economics also requires unconditional knowledge of <span>economic theory, the</span> ability to identify and use the laws of economic development and know the specific features of different <span>economic systems.</span>  Research in the historical and economic field has reached great importance in world science.  Since 1960, international congresses began to be held regularly and international centers for the coordination of economic research were created.  In 1962, the international association of economic history was founded.  Undoubtedly, the history of the Russian economy has also undergone a thorough study and research. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The subject history of economics itself is at the intersection of three areas of study of the history and development of human society.  This is history, as well as the theory of economics and the particular economy itself.  Such a nature of the history of the economy, which is integral, creates its complex structure, inevitably leads to a large number of immediate objects for study.  If we take everything in general terms, then the study itself is the history of the origin, formation and development of the economic processes and phenomena themselves. </p><p>  When studying the economic history of individual regions and states, the features of their historical development, the influence of these features on such development, economic causes and various consequences of various historical events, as well as the <span>economic policy of the state</span> and the ensuing consequences are used as a subject for study.  When studying the history of the national economy of the country, the development of the mechanism of the functioning of the economy is studied, the evolution of economic systems, the history of the development of various sectors of the economy, and its individual processes are studied - this is industrialization and urbanization, the development of market relations and cooperation, the degree of centralization and directivity of the economy, the history of the development and use of taxation as well as finance, loans and income. </p><p>  The difficulty in studying the history of economics creates the need for a combination of different forms and <span>methods of scientific</span> research.  The main methods in this case are the historical method, logic, classifications method, historical modeling method, comparative historical, chronological, socio-psychological and others. </p>
