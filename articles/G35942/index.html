    <p>  There are many legends about how an unusual and magnificent building appeared in the center of Minsk.  A true story is not as romantic as folk fiction.  Pishchalovsky castle was originally built as a prison (prison).  In 1821, the construction of the fortress began.  The chief architect of the project is Kazimir Khrschanovich.  Most often, this castle is named after its customer - the landowner and official Rudolf Pischallo.  The thing is that the previous building of the Minsk prison was in emergency condition.  And then the regional government held a "bargain" (a procedure similar to the modern tender), which Rudolf Pischallo won.  It is important to understand that this person was only the customer of the construction.  In some sources, one can find the statement that Pishchallo was also an architect - this is not true.  How to choose a place on which the Pishchalovsky castle was erected?  Minsk over the past years has grown significantly.  At the time the construction of the new prison began, the modern Volodarsky Street was the outskirts of the city.  That is why the prison was built here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The legendary Volodarka </h2>

    <p>  Pishchalovsky castle was completed and commissioned in 1825.  The life of prisoners at that time was very different from the modern one.  The prisoners prepared their own food for themselves, earned money on socially useful urban work, and even received a salary.  But despite such a democracy, living in prison was not easy.  Very often, real epidemics flared up behind state walls.  During which a large number of prisoners died from disease.  World War I did not damage the castle prison.  The magnificent structure went to the new government in excellent condition and continued to be used for its original purpose.  After the events of October 1917, the street on which the Pishchalovsky Castle is located was renamed.  The former Serpukhovskaya was named after Moses Volodarsky.  Around the same time, the prison gets its informal name - Volodarka.  Even during World War II, Pishchalovsky Castle was not damaged.  Belarus was occupied by enemy troops.  However, the Germans decided not to destroy the building of the old prison, but to organize their own prison in it.  In the 1960s, the prison received its modern name - SIZO No. 1. From the very beginning of the XXI century, there was talk of allocating a new building for the detention center.  It is possible that moving the prison would be delayed further.  However, in 2008 one of the castle towers collapsed.  No one was injured during the incident, but it was no longer possible to deny the emergency state of the building. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Does the ancient castle have a future? </h2>

    <p>  Pishchalovsky <span>Castle (Minsk)</span> looks like a medieval military fortress.  The building is made in a pseudo-Gothic style, four massive towers are located in its corners.  The main building has three floors, narrow windows visually resemble loopholes.  The building looks especially majestic due to the fact that it is located on a hill.  The castle is a unique attraction of Minsk and the whole of Belarus.  After the collapse of one of the towers, a decision was made to partially move SIZO No. 1. But what awaits the historic building?  There is no exact answer to this question yet; the castle requires high-quality restoration and overhaul.  Perhaps sometime a museum will be opened here. </p><h2>  Actual information for tourists </h2>

    <p>  To visit the capital of Belarus and not see the Pishchalovsky castle with your own eyes is a real crime!  However, tourists should be prepared for the fact that you can only enjoy the views of the facades.  You won‚Äôt get inside the old prison.  But even the external examination of such a magnificent and unusual structure makes an impression.  The Pishchalovsky Castle (Minsk) has the following address: Volodarsky Street, 2. Today we can only dream of opening a museum or other cultural institution once in this place. </p>
