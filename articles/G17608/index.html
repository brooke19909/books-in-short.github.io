    <p>  Here you can add a reliable connection with the owner of the security system, which is available at any time and in any place.  And as another indisputable plus of the alarm, we can safely add warranty service for five years. </p><h2>  Pandora DXL 5000 System Management </h2><p>  Two-way alarm Pandora has a very wide selection of control methods, which many similar and competing products lack: contactless tags, smartphones, smart watches, key chains and other immobilizers.  You can manage all this (disarm, start / stop the engine, etc.) from any smartphone, as well as through your personal account on a special service site.  Naturally, the entire process of "communication" with the alarm occurs through password systems and access points. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The designers of the Pandora DXL 5000 have developed a special application for Android and Apple devices that make it easy to control the alarm system in tandem with the immobilizer.  The remote control with a feedback has a ‚Äúlong-range‚Äù frequency of 868 MHz, equipped with a thick glass made of special mineral-based materials, which will not allow dust into the system and protect it from shock. </p><h2>  Trinket </h2><p>  In general, the manual for the Pandora DXL 5000 states that the system is considered to be ‚Äúkeyless‚Äù, but numerous requests and feedback from the owners have done their job, and the manufacturer has kept the key rings for those who are comfortable with this control method. </p><h2>  Other management methods </h2><p>  As an optional option, the security system can be equipped with an innovative and quite interesting way of control - the ‚Äúsmart watch‚Äù RW-2.  They do not come with the main components, so you have to purchase them separately from the Pandora DXL 5000 device.  The instruction manual also notes that since the previous generations, wireless tags have significantly decreased in size, allowing the owner to use them more widely. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Duplication </h2><p>  The peculiarity of the Pandora alarm system is the duplication of the basic functions in a manner similar to that implemented in aviation - each more or less important part (a cellular communication channel, wireless engine lock, etc.) has its own double, and sometimes a third embodiment in case of system failure or failure, which is unlikely. </p>

    <p>  Alarm ‚ÄúPandora DXL 5000‚Äù is equipped with a SIM card slot, which is responsible for receiving signals from a mobile device (smartphone, tablet) to perform a number of functions such as starting the engine, opening doors and other commands of the owner.  Also, with its help, the owner receives all the data that relates to his car: engine temperature, alarm messages, listening to the passenger compartment, the rest of the fuel in the tank, etc. </p><h2>  GPS tracker </h2><p>  Duplicated the first SIM card backup in a standalone GPS-tracker type NAV-04.  This device is also part of the Pandora DXL 5000 alarm system, it is located even more secretly, unlike the main unit, and is not directly connected to it.  Communication is only possible through encrypted transmission at a frequency of 2.5 GHz. </p><p>  At the moment the car moves, the tracker performs the functions of a satellite receiver, analyzing the incoming data about the location of the object.  All received information can be viewed both in real time and through a database that is stored for a very long time on the servers of the manufacturer's company.  The remote control interface is clear and convenient, and it will not be difficult for a simple user to deal with it.  The control method is carried out through the site or through a special mobile application.  There you can carefully configure the interface, there is a detailed instruction manual and the ability to leave your wish and review. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Car alarm Pandora DXL 5000 when trying to hijack, first activates the central unit, sending a short message from the SIM card to its owner.  In the event that the hijackers were able to neutralize the central unit of the device, removed it or completely disconnected the vehicle‚Äôs battery, then the tracker then switches to <span>stand-alone</span> operation from its built-in power source and with its SIM card, transmitting signals to the owner with exact coordinates, according to which you can find a car. </p><h2>  Radio relay </h2><p>  Doubles have locking systems that will not allow the engine to start at the time of theft.  <span>Car alarm Pandora DXL 5000 (New,</span> Pro, Classic) is equipped with two engine compartment modules, that is, a pair of radio relay - RHM-06 as the main and RR-100 as an additional. </p>

    <p>  Relays receive instructions from the main module of the system and, like the tracker, are in no way connected by wires, ‚Äúcommunicating‚Äù only via an encrypted digital channel in a radio frequency of 2.5 GHz.  There is no need to pull any wires under the hood, as was the case with previous generations of car alarms.  In the new ‚ÄúPandora DXL 5000‚Äù, the installation instructions indicate that no holes in the motor shield for wiring are drilled and that radio modules cannot be tracked through wires (which are missing) - it is not possible. </p><p>  Both radio relays perform approximately the same protective functions, and since they are completely independent and separated into different parts of the alarm, this will double the problems of the hijackers. </p><h2>  Jamming protection </h2><p>  The use of sirens in modern car alarms is causing more and more negative disputes and related problems.  By themselves, sirens - as a means of preventing theft - were abolished by long-range remote controls with feedback, and even later they began to completely abandon them - cellular communication channels appeared.  Instead of a loud siren, which sometimes wakes up half a block, the system will personally inform the owner of the car about problems or other dangers. </p><p>  But progress does not stand still and the flip side always, sooner or later, will make itself felt.  In almost any radio store or on the Internet, you can find devices that suppress the GSM signal.  Such gadgets have become a real phobia among the owners of such alarms.  Indeed, similar security systems based on cellular reception are extremely vulnerable to such jammers, thereby depriving the signaling system of the ability to send any ping to its owner. </p><h2>  Communication channel protection </h2><p>  But this case does not apply to the Pandora DXL 5000 system - to protect against such attacks, the alarm system is equipped with an additional protection function, which is called ‚Äúcontrol of the communication channel‚Äù.  It doesn‚Äôt act according to the usual algorithm: ‚Äúthere was an alarm - send SMS‚Äù, but on the contrary, the alarm periodically sends small packets of information to the Pandora‚Äôs server, thereby showing that it is ‚Äúin touch‚Äù and there are no problems.  And when the attackers launch the ‚Äújammer‚Äù, the system loses connection with the servers and begins to inform the owner of the threat that has arisen. </p>

    <p>  Such a two-way mode, although it requires some cost for cellular traffic, is relevant only in roaming - in the home network, channel support practically does not require expenses and amounts to about 1-2 rubles per day. </p><h2>  Smart watch </h2><p>  "Smart watches", or Smart watch, is a rather promising direction on the gadget market today.  Such a device works, as a rule, in synergy with a smartphone, acting as a multimedia assistant.  The headset, in fact, is a quick access display that reflects the main events and much more.  In tandem with car alarms, such a gadget is presented for the first time. </p>

    <p>  RW-02 watches, designed specifically for the Pandora DXL 5000 (price within 10 thousand rubles) are not included in the basic set of car alarms, so you need to purchase them separately.  The gadget's software is constantly updated and overgrows with a new functional set, but the main areas of work are unchanged: </p><ul><li>  An alternative to wireless tags.  Having both a watch and a smartphone, you will no longer need to take an immobilizer tag, as well as an <span>ignition</span> key: everything is started by pressing the ‚ÄúStart / Stop‚Äù button. </li><li>  Function "local navigator" for car parking.  Now, thanks to the built-in cellular receiver, ‚Äúsmart watches‚Äù remember the place where you left your car and, if necessary, lead you to the car acting as a compass - which is extremely convenient in some cases; </li><li>  The watch is comfortable, stylish and well-protected. </li></ul><p>  Users respond especially warmly to the built-in compass navigator, especially this function helps out in large parking lots at hypermarkets or intricate multi-level parking. </p><p>  The watch has an intelligent monochrome display, but as such, it is not a multimedia gadget, so you will not find in it seemingly familiar things for smart devices such as touch control, video viewing or convenient chat - energy saving comes first.  It is very important for a Pandora smartwatch to work out as long as possible on one rechargeable battery, and not to ask for an outlet every day, as other smart brothers do. </p><h2>  Installation of car alarms Pandora DXL 5000 </h2><p>  Do-it-yourself installation of such a modern alarm system as Pandora is practically unrealistic, so do not be surprised that most of the most advanced installation services will not be able to help you in this matter. </p><p>  Only certified units (companies, installers) can install the DXL 5000 system, that is, those who have been accredited by the alarm manufacturer - Alarm Trade.  The system adjusts and works only with a specific car in online mode, therefore the entrance and further access to all the functionality, and therefore to the alarm setting for the owner, is exclusively from a certified and approved master. </p>

    <p>  Many users express dissatisfaction in their reviews with such a rigid system of control and selection of specialists, but the company explains its actions with some facts.  Installing a Pandora-type car alarm requires the skills of a highly qualified master and is significantly different from installing similar and competing devices, therefore, in order to save its customers from poor-quality installation of such an expensive premium system, the company decided to limit the number of installers by introducing strict accreditation.  Although such an initiative slows down sales growth, it maintains the company's reputation. </p><p>  In total, we get that in such large cities as St. Petersburg and Moscow, services approved by the manufacturer, where there are corresponding masters, you can find only two and four, respectively. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  The cost of the Pandora 5000 series car alarms on the manufacturer‚Äôs official website ranges from 30 thousand rubles.  For the installation will need to pay about 8-10 thousand rubles. </p><p>  To enhance the protective characteristics of your car here, you can add the cost of one or two <span>electromechanical locks</span> for the hood and the price of their installation.  Agree that, having in your arsenal such a powerful defense system as Pandora, it would be unreasonable to leave intruders an extra loophole in the engine compartment, where the transmission and engine blocking modules are located. </p>
