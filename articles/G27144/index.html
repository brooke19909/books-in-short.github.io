In 2011, a certificate of compliance with the requirements of GOST R ISO 9001-2008 was obtained.  This means that business processes and the management system meet not only domestic but also European quality standards.  This applies not only to insurance contracts, but also to reinsurance.

That is why vehicle insurance is a mandatory procedure.  In the event of an emergency, the culprit can rely on the assistance of the insurance company, which will indemnify the damage.  In addition, after the entry into force of the Law on OSAGO, the possibility of direct compensation for losses appeared.  This means that a client who has got into an accident and is not at the same time the culprit can turn to RESO-Garantia for help.  MTPL reviews show that full compensation is incurred. </p>

Not the culprit of an accident can contact his company only if the accident occurred with the participation of two objects and only vehicles were damaged.  All participants in an accident must have an insurance policy.  If more than two cars were involved in the accident, other people's property was damaged or the health of the participants was harmed, the compensation rests with the culprit.  The perpetrator will also have to apply to the insurance company when the insurer has his license revoked or is not a party to the Direct Compensation Agreement.  This document is signed by RESO-Garantia IC.  MTPL reviews show that this greatly simplifies the process of recovering losses incurred in accidents.  The driver does not need to wait for help from the culprit of the accident.  He receives payments from his own agency.
