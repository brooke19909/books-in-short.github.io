Everyone already knows that the Z series is represented only by flagship gadgets, but what is a line called M?  Everyone may think that these are original devices with a large number of innovations.  But this is absolutely not the case. </p>

    <h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The <span>Sony Xperia</span> M2 D2303 smartphone we are considering is a continuation of the M line, which the world saw in 2013.  The first model occupied a budget niche, had a small size and a chubby, rather nondescript appearance.  There was absolutely nothing in common with the flagships of the Z line.  As for the second model, called the Sony Xperia M2, here everything is a little different.  But let's start by considering the technical characteristics of this gadget, which are as follows: </p><p>  - Operating system: Android OS, version 4.4.2 with a specially developed shell. <br>  - Screen: 4.8 inches in diagonal, IPS, 540x960 pixels, capacitive, multi-touch up to 8 pixels, pixel density 229 dpi. <br>  - Processor: 4 cores, frequency 1.2 GHz, Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 model MSM8926, ARM Cortex-A7. <br>  - GPU: Model Adreno 305. <br>  - RAM: 1 GB. <br>  - Flash memory: 8 GB (available for downloads of 5 GB). <br>  - Support for <span>memory</span> expansion <span>: microSD card up</span> to 32 GB. <br>  - Connectors: microUSB 2.0, micro-SIM, headphone output 3.5 mm. <br>  - Camera: main 8 megapixels (autofocus, flash), front with a 0.3 megapixel sensor. <br>  - Communication: Wi-Fi, 3G, 4G, GPS, A-GPS, GLONASS, Bluetooth 4.0. <br>  - Battery: polymer, Li-Ion, 2330 mAh. <br>  - Optional: accelerometer, gyroscope, <span>light</span> and proximity <span>sensor</span> , <span>digital compass.</span> <br>  - Dimensions: 140x71x8.6mm. <br>  - Mass: 150 g. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  From all these characteristics, we can conclude that the Xperia M2 D2303 is a middle-class device, which the company itself positions it.  But it is worth making a small remark in the form of value.  As for Sony products, the smartphone has an average price, but for the money you can easily buy a flagship of Chinese manufacture. </p>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  ‚ÄúThey are greeted by clothes ...‚Äù - this is how a well-known proverb begins.  And it concerns everything that surrounds us.  For this reason, we begin a detailed review with the appearance of the Sony Xperia M2 D2303.  Feedback from users and specialists, this indicator has very good.  In fact, we can say that you can safely purchase this gadget for only one appearance.  Marketers acted very reasonably: they took the form factor of their flagship, made it a little smaller in size and shoved the stuffing much weaker.  This is how the M2 was born. </p><p>  Taking up the Sony Xperia <span>M2 D2303,</span> you can see that it is made of very pleasant to the touch plastic.  Unlike its counterparts in the Z line, Emka does not have an oleophobic coating that would protect it from contamination and the appearance of prints. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The borders around the screen fit very well in the overall look.  Their width makes it easy to use the smartphone with one hand.  Also, the front side does not have physical buttons. </p><p>  In the middle of the right end is a proprietary power button.  Nearby is the <span>volume control</span> and the camera power button.  At the very bottom of the right end there is a stub under which slots for a SIM card and memory expansion are hidden. </p><p>  The top end is occupied by a headphone jack, and the left has only an output for microUSB.  Below, except for the microphone slot and the groove for the strap, there is nothing more. </p><p>  The back panel has a Sony logo in the center and a name at the bottom.  At the top is the camera and flash.  If you look at everything from a distance of about three meters - this is practically a spit Z2, only the dimensions are slightly smaller. </p><p>  This gadget is produced in three colors: purple, black and white.  They are absolutely no different, except for the end of the names: Sony D2303 Xperia M2 White, Black and Purple. </p>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The screen of the Sony Xperia M2 d2303 in the diagonal has 4.8 inches.  Thanks to the good TFT-matrix during rotation, image distortion is not very noticeable.  The brightness and contrast of the information displayed on the screen are very pleasing.  Naturally, such a screen can not be called advanced, but for the middle price class it is pretty good. </p><h2>  Hardware </h2><p>  The heart of the smartphone is a processor called Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 model MSM8926.  It has 4 cores and an operating frequency of standard 1.2 GHz.  Such parameters have almost all the gadgets of the middle price category.  Thanks to the low resolution indicator, the <span>Adreno 305</span> video processor ‚Äúpulls‚Äù almost any game without hangs.  All this stuffing of RAM with a size of 1 GB is crowned.  Overall pretty good.  Nevertheless, the Sony Xperia M2 D2303 is located in the middle class niche, but its cost in the entire market of mobile gadgets can be equated to the flagship models. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  As the main camera, an 8 megapixel sensor is used.  It has 4x digital zoom and the ability to record HD video.  Plus, the package comes with a package of additional programs for working with photos, support for 36 prepared scenes in automatic mode and autofocus. </p><p>  <span>The front camera</span> can not boast of anything.  It has a 0.3 megapixel matrix, which is enough to establish video communication.  It is not suitable for more, but thanks to Sony for this. </p>

    <h2>  Operating system and software </h2><p>  As an OS, the Sony Xperia M2 D2303 Black and other color solutions use Android 4.4.2.  Initially, this smartphone had an earlier version of the OS, but was updated over time, making it much faster and less demanding.  In general, nothing remarkable.  The only thing I would like to draw attention to is the proprietary shell from Sony.  It is she who gives the features. </p><p>  As additional software, everything is also as standard as possible: video player, music player, games, etc.  A set of additional utilities for processing photos is also standard for Sony smartphones. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  This smartphone uses a battery with a capacity of 2330 mAh as an autonomous power source.  Smartphone Sony Xperia M2 D2303 received good reviews mainly due to the battery.  Such a battery in combination with the special STAMINA mode allows you to: </p><ul><li>  talk on the phone for more than 14 hours; </li><li>  Standby time for up to 693 hours </li><li>  listen to music for 57 hours; </li><li>  View videos with an average screen brightness of 8.5 hours. </li></ul><p>  These indicators are very pleased fans and partially justified a bit overpriced. </p>

    <h2>  User reviews </h2><p>  User reviews model Sony Xperia M2 D2303 received different.  It's all about the different tastes and devices that they used before.  So, for example, after a purchase, some have the inconvenience of using it themselves due to the size of the smartphone.  But you get used to it quickly.  As for the case (especially purple), all users unanimously say that it is beautiful, bright, but, in turn, it gets dirty very quickly.  This problem can be solved by purchasing a cover.  The battery has received very good reviews, which, with moderate use, can keep the phone ‚Äúalive‚Äù for 3-4 days. </p><p>  If you highlight the flaws that were noticed by the happy owners, these are cameras.  Home does not pull on the claimed 8 megapixels (maximum 5 megapixels).  In this case, the pictures are dark, inconspicuous.  The front camera also displays a very dim image.  For this reason, it is recommended to take a camera separately for shooting, and keep this just in case of fire. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  As a conclusion to this review of the Sony Xperia M2 D2303 Purple gadget and other colors, we can say that in general it is not bad.  The execution of the gadget, form and capabilities greatly pleased everyone.  But, as always, the cost of the device becomes an obstacle.  Well, you have to pay your price for everything, and the Sony Xperia M2 D2303 smartphone is no exception, where only 20% is pounced on the brand itself. </p>
