Even if the buyer chooses the most capacious version, sooner or later he will still face a similar problem.  Most often this is due to the fact that along with programs and games, system files are installed that require additional space.  Therefore, it is useful to know how to clear the memory on the Samsung in order to prevent drastic measures. </p><h2>  What is the problem? </h2><p>  All Samsung smartphones have the Android operating system.  This, in turn, leads to a number of troubles. </p><p>  The fact is that the system memory of devices on Android is the most vulnerable spot.  Many smartphones suffer from errors associated with a full archive. </p><p>  Sometimes the problem is the incorrect operation of the smartphone, sometimes the cause can be viruses and other malicious programs.  Sometimes it is impossible to prevent it, but sometimes careful use can help avoid such problems. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.engadget.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to clear memory on a Samsung phone" class="if uuid-3009924" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3009924.jpg"></div><h2>  Smartphone memory </h2><p>  Before you figure out how to clear the memory on the Samsung, you need to understand which archive you need to clear.  Manufacturers are trying to produce models that would contain such an amount of internal memory so that the user does not have to purchase an additional memory card. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But sometimes 256 GB of memory is not enough.  Therefore, the owner purchases an SD card, which expands this volume. </p><h2>  External memory </h2><p>  How to clear the memory on the Samsung in this case?  Having a memory card makes it much easier to deal with this issue.  Usually, a card reader is offered with it, which allows you to connect it to a computer.  In this case, it is not necessary to have a smartphone.  It is enough to place the memory card in such an adapter and connect it to a laptop or PC. </p><p>  The system will determine the availability of the drive.  It will open it in a separate dialog box, from where it will be possible to delete files.  Usually you should pay attention to the Download folders and your personal data.  It stores the information that can be deleted without harming the system. </p><div class="photo" data-original="aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Memory cards and card reader" class="if uuid-3009930" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3009930.jpg"></div><p>  If there are important files among the files, you can transfer them to an external hard drive or PC. </p><h2>  Inner memory </h2><p>  How to clear the memory on the Samsung?  In this case, things are somewhat different.  Everything is connected with the structure of the system archive.  There are a large number of files that are responsible for the health of Android.  If you remove something superfluous, you may need the help of specialists. </p><p>  There are several ways to make room: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  check applications on the phone; </li><li>  delete files from explorer; </li><li>  Use task manager </li><li>  clear messenger data; </li><li>  install special software; </li><li>  Use cloud storage </li><li>  perform a reset or flashing. </li></ul><h2>  Check apps on the phone </h2><p>  How to clear memory on a Samsung phone?  Try to get rid of all games and applications.  It happens that many of them were installed on a smartphone, but later they were forgotten.  Such programs continue to receive updates, respectively, and upload their files to the archive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.samsung.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Clear memory on samsung galaxy" class="if uuid-3009928" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3009928.jpg"></div><p>  It is also worth understanding that there are some games that, in the process of passing, write data and statistics to memory.  Sometimes they can occupy more than 1 GB of free space.  If you stopped playing the game, it is better to delete it. </p><h2>  Delete files from explorer </h2><p>  This option is suitable for those who understand in which folder which files are located.  For example, Download usually stores all downloaded documents.  Sometimes there are files left for installing utilities.  Perhaps photos from the Internet got here that you needed to quickly download, and after that you forgot to delete them. </p><p>  You need to get rid of all this quickly.  It is enough to understand what is important for you and what is not.  How to clear the memory on the Samsung Galaxy?  To do this, just go to the file‚Äôs properties and select the ‚ÄúDelete‚Äù item or hold down the file and select several at once, and then click on the basket icon. </p><h2>  Use task manager </h2><p>  You can delete programs from a special menu.  It is in the settings.  It has a whole list of smartphone utilities.  There you can see all the information about the programs, their scope and purpose. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pocket-lint.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy slows down what to do" class="if uuid-3009932" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3009932.jpg"></div><p>  Experts recommend not only deleting programs from this menu, but also clearing the cache.  Each application collects ‚Äúgarbage‚Äù that must be periodically removed.  Sometimes for this you can use special programs, and sometimes perform actions through the task manager. </p><p>  Some believe that the same can be done using the engineering menu.  But it is responsible for setting up the smartphone and is not designed to delete files.  Through the engineering menu, you can configure the frequency of GSM communication, test the components of the phone, etc. </p><h2>  Clear messenger data </h2><p>  How to clear memory on Android?  Samsung and other smartphones usually store almost all the information that goes to the device.  Not many people know that photos from instant messengers and other files can automatically be downloaded to the smartphone‚Äôs memory. </p><p>  This leads to the fact that even deleting all your photos that were stored in the corresponding folder, you can not completely free up memory.  And all because the root of the system contains files that have downloaded one or more instant messengers. </p><p>  This problem can be fixed easily.  It is enough to find the folder in the explorer, which is called the name of the messenger, and clear it. </p><h2>  Install special software </h2><p>  Perhaps your Samsung Galaxy is slowing down.  What to do in this case?  This is largely due to system errors.  But lack of memory can also affect the correct operation of the device. </p><p>  Therefore, in addition to cleaning the smartphone archives, you need to install an auxiliary utility.  Sometimes they are preinstalled and are suitable for such tasks.  Sometimes you need to install them from Google Play. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidpit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Clean Master Program" class="if uuid-3009935" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3009935.jpg"></div><p>  A useful program is <span>Clean Master.</span>  It helps not only to remove ‚Äúgarbage‚Äù, to clean the cache and memory of the phone as a whole.  The application copes with the general acceleration of the system, helps to find errors and corrects them. </p><h2>  Use cloud storage </h2><p>  If you often encounter a lack of memory, and there is no opportunity to purchase a memory card, you can install a mobile version of cloud storage.  For example, Google Disk.  The utility will help to automatically synchronize files and send them to the server. </p><p>  This option is perfect for those who work with multiple devices at once, including from a smartphone.  You can edit files if possible, corrections will be automatically saved. </p><h2>  Make a reset or flashing </h2><p>  Sometimes system errors force the user to drastic measures.  Sometimes neither manual deletion nor auxiliary utilities give the desired result.  The phone still slows down, and the memory is full of "invisible" files. </p><p>  In this case, it is worth mentioning such a concept as a ‚Äúgray sector‚Äù.  This is a common Android issue.  Devices are suddenly filled with files that cannot be found or deleted. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.techadvisor.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="engineering menu" class="if uuid-3009937" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3009937.jpg"></div><p>  In this case, you have to use formatting (in the case of external memory) or reset to factory settings, if we are talking about internal storage. </p><p>  Some also use flashing, but if installed incorrectly, it can harm the system.  Therefore, it is better to use Hard Reset, which will save the phone not only from system failures, but also from malicious programs that are difficult to detect by antivirus programs or manually. </p>
