    <h2>  Anavadia Hotel 4 *: reviews on beach vacations and other attractions </h2><p>  According to the guests, the distance from the hotel to the sea is about 1 kilometer.  The path runs along one of the paved paths.  You can easily walk to the beach in a quarter of an hour at leisurely pace.  A shuttle service to the shore can also be arranged upon request.  If you would like to use this service, then inform the reception in advance. </p><p>  As for the local beaches, they are pebble, but there are also sandy areas.  Since there are stones in some places at the bottom, swimming in special shoes is recommended.  The sea here is very clean and pleasant, there are practically no waves. </p><p>  Since the beaches in Kolymbia are municipal, you need to pay for the rental of sunbeds and umbrellas (about 8 euros per day).  However, you can always sit on a mat or towel brought with you. </p><p>  As for other entertainment, then on the territory of Anavadia Hotel 4 * there are two swimming pools for adults and the same for children.  There is a sun terrace, where, according to our compatriots, sun loungers and umbrellas are always enough for everyone.  There is no animation in Anavadia Hotel (as in most other hotels in Greece). </p>
