    <p>  The work begins with the fact that one black elastic is put on the right side of the device.  It scrolls four times, stays on the base. </p><p>  A pair of black rubber bands is put on two bases at the same time, with the help of a hook, a single black one is thrown on top of two common ones and is thrown off from two columns simultaneously. </p><p>  Both white ones are added, which are thrown on the right and left sides at the same time, and are thrown off.  A pair of white rubber bands is added and again throws off.  Then a couple of blacks.

Throw 1 white gum onto one slingshot, twisting 5 times.  Spread two rubber bands on two bases, stretch the lower one through them and then discard. </p>

    <p>  In order to weave the panda out of the rubber bands as accurately as possible, in this place the resulting extreme pigtail should be connected to the previous one.  To do this, you need to put on two pins at the same time two black elastic bands, hook all the braids at the top through the hook. </p><h2>  How to weave a panda from rubber bands: the end of work </h2><p>  So the next part turned out.  It remains to weave quite a bit, and the work will be finished. </p><p>  On the right side, throw two white rubber bands.  Pass them through two blacks to complete the torso.  To strengthen two whiskers, put two white ones, and let the previous gum through them.  Throw two more white, throw off. </p><p>  Transfer the finished part from the left to the right.  Screw one black elastic band on the right side in five turns, unfold the finished part, and put the hook under your hand to capture the black elastic band, also tighten the loop through the two white ones, throwing it to the left. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Alternately put on and drop the following pairs: white, white, black. </p><p>  Throw all the work completely from left to right, lowering the product with a push down. </p><p>  Screw one black elastic band on the left side into two girths.  Take the black elastic band, put on two bases at the same time, thread and discard.  Two white gum should be used next, they are also pulled - through black - and also thrown off. </p>

    <p>  Then four whites are taken at the same time, stretched up, thrown off.  The next two white ones are installed on both sides, stretching from right to left column.  The black gum is wound 5 times on the left side, a hook under the white loop is wound. </p><p>  2 white elastic bands are put on.  Under them, with the help of the hook, you need to transfer the work to the right side.  On the left should be black, and on the opposite side - white elastic bands. </p><p>  Black is wound on the right side 4 times, a pair of elastic bands is put on in two parts, the previous one is passed through and discarded. </p><p>  Then, in sequence, you need to put on and drop the following pairs: black, white.  Left 4 rubber bands of white color discard. </p><p>  Use two white elastic bands.  Throw them off.  Then you need to reset all the gum on both sides.  The loop must be fixed.  You need to connect the legs.  To do this, take a white elastic band and hook through two legs, securing it with a knot. </p><p>  This instruction is guaranteed to help bring the idea to life and tell you how to weave a panda made of rubber bands on a slingshot. </p><h2>  Pen accessory </h2><p>  But if there is no time or souvenirs, you need to make several, that is, it is possible to weave at least an original ornament that will decorate a writing pen. </p><p>  For such an accessory, again, you need a special fork, as well as a hook and, of course, elastic bands.  You can choose any color, but often take white and black. </p><p>  On this basis, you can learn <span>how to weave a panda keychain from elastic bands.</span> </p><p>  First, a body with a fastening is made, and then the head is braided.  In order not to get confused, if only this technique is mastered, it is better to make the body with one color.  And only then, when the problem of how to weave a panda from rubber bands on a fork is not difficult, you can weave different colors. </p>

    <p>  The first time one black rubber is taken and on the right side it scrolls two times.  Two black ones are pulled on two bases, and the first is thrown off after two.  This method needs to be repeated five times. </p><p>  One pigtail is ready, and it should be moved from the left edge to the right.  Throw again on both sides at the same time two elastic bands, and using the hook to transfer to the left side. </p><h2>  Gummy Panda Weaving </h2><p>  You should weave another pigtail, for this three times you will need to throw two elastic bands and reset them.  Then the middle from the left column is used. </p><p>  Two elastic bands are added two times, and they are also reset. </p><p>  All elastic bands should be moved to the right.  One rubber band with two turns is wound on an empty left column.  Again put on two black elastic bands on two slings at the same time.  Habitually throw off.  Those elastic bands that are located on the left side should be discarded in the center. </p><p>  The next pair is put on, on which the previous ones are thrown off - in the center of weaving. </p><p>  All work must be moved to the right side and, so as not to interfere, lower down. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to weave a gum panda keychain" class="if" height="364" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/1845387.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Then a braid is braided using three pairs of elastic bands.  Also, the initial stage is one black gum with a double girth of the left horn. </p><p>  From the left column, the entire product moves to the right.  Another braid is braided, which will take 5 rows of two rubber bands.  This is how the second fastener is obtained if you need to weave a panda without gum from rubber bands. </p><p>  The elastic is thrown twice on the left side, then two are put on, the first is threaded through and thrown through them.  This is done several more times, it turns out a pigtail.  Everything connects thanks to a pair of black elastic bands: all elastic bands need to be dumped on them. </p><h2>  Head weaving </h2><p>  The head is done like this.  Two white elastic bands are worn on both parts, and black are moved to them - in the center.  Again, white is used and discarded.  Left rubber bands go to the right. </p>

    <p>  For the eye, one black elastic is wound on the left side with 4 turns, then two white ones are used.  Now comes this sequence: four turns in black, two times in white.  The main thing is that the pigtail lies on the left side. </p><h2>  Finishing touches </h2><p>  Ear  Move the white gum to the left, on the right side, wrap the black gum three times, add a couple of black ones and discard.  Add a couple of whites, fold.  Move the work to the center, and the ear will be on the right. </p><p>  Move the work to the right and add two white rubber bands, reset, move to the left, add the white pair again, reset.  Move work to the center, freeing the left side.  Add white elastic bands, stretch and discard.  Move everything to the left side, start with two white rubber bands, repeat 2 more times.  The second part is done accordingly. </p><p>  Now the problem of <span>how to weave a</span> panda <span>figure out of gum has been</span> solved, and a new original accessory will please the eye every day. </p>
