A TV tuner for a TV: review, specifications and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The tuner is ... This is the topic of this article.  Understanding the meaning of this word is important for any modern person who is interested in new technology.  When using this term, various confusions often occur, since it has several meanings at once. </p><h2>  Origin </h2><p>  Considering the etymology, that is, the origin of the word, you should look into the English-Russian dictionary.  There, among other meanings of "tun", such as "melody", "song" and others, you can find the following - the verb "tune". </p><p>  It is suitable for the accurate description of a number of devices.  All of these devices, one way or another, are precisely for setting something up for something.  Therefore, you can translate an interesting English term as a ‚Äútuner‚Äù. </p><h2>  Oldest value </h2><p>  First of all, this name was attached to radios. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pixelrz.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="radio receiver" class="if uuid-3080781" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59230/3080781.jpg"></div><p>  They are known to be of the fm and am format, depending on the radio frequency of which such a device is capable of "catching".  Sometimes the same device can play broadcasts on both types of waves. </p><p>  So, the statement ‚Äútuner is an apparatus for listening to radio broadcasts‚Äù is one of the definitions of this concept. </p><p>  Today, such a receiver can be not only an independent device, but also one of the functions of modern mobile and other devices. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Many smartphones are equipped with a software radio tuner.  Most often, using such a device, you can listen only to channels that broadcast in the fm range. </p><p>  In an age of rapid development of technology, radio is also not left out of progress.  A new, digital way of signal transmission has appeared.  If a person wants to listen to programs in this format, then he needs to purchase a special receiver.  However, those who prefer to enjoy their favorite radio programs while at home may not buy special equipment for this purpose. </p><p>  The function of listening to digital radio is in almost all television receivers designed to watch satellite or dvb t2 broadcasts.  If you do not already have such a device, then it will most likely have to be purchased in the near future, as our whole country will completely switch to digital broadcasting in 2019.  Federal channels will gradually turn off the broadcast of their programs in an analogue way.  It is planned that the complete abolition of traditional TV will happen in the summer of 2019. </p><h2>  Tv tuner for tv </h2><p>  By the way, a device for watching television channels of digital broadcasting is also called a tuner.  In fact, it has several names (receiver, receiver).  Because of this, some people who have little knowledge of electronics issues, when they meet these terms in the press, get confused, thinking that we are talking about different things. </p><p>  In fact, all these words are used to refer to the same device designed to receive digital broadcasting.  This means that the term mentioned in the title of this article has another definition.  A tuner is the name of <span>a digital television receiver.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  It is important </h2><p>  There are two types of digital television: satellite and dvb.  The last of them is free and soon, as already mentioned, will completely replace analog.  To watch it, you need a TV tuner for the TV.  The last word here is the key.  The description of the device must necessarily say that it is designed specifically for the TV, since there are also models for the computer, that is, those that cannot work without it.  What else do you need to know? </p><p>  Also, the instructions for the device must necessarily indicate that it is designed to receive a dvb t2 format signal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="trendblog.euronics.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dvd t2" class="if uuid-3080770" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59230/3080770.jpg"></div><p>  A digital tuner with such parameters is perfect for watching television in Russia.  What do the Latin letters mean in its name?  Digital video broadcastcasting - this abbreviation is decrypted. </p><p>  This phrase can be translated as "digital broadcasting."  And t2 says that this technology has already been improved and therefore belongs to the second generation.  Such a standard for digital television was created in the nineties of the twentieth century by the union of European manufacturers of television and video equipment. </p><h2>  The triumphal procession of digital television </h2><p>  Currently, they have completely abandoned analog broadcasting and switched to the new standard of the USA, Japan and almost all countries of Western Europe.  Next in turn is the same modernization of TV in Russia, which should be fully implemented in 2019. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Other equipment </h2><p>  It should be noted that the TV tuner for the TV may be built-in.  This feature is only in the newest models of technology.  If you own such a TV, then you don‚Äôt have to buy anything else. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pctechmag.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="plasma tv" class="if uuid-3080786" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59230/3080786.jpg"></div><p>  It remains only to configure the reception of digital channels.  For this, there is usually a special automatic search mode.  So, this operation will not require unnecessary efforts and will not cause great difficulties. </p><p>  If the TV does not have a built-in receiver, then you should consider buying a digital <span>tuner dvb t2.</span>  In addition to it, you may also need a decimeter antenna. </p><p>  However, such devices are in almost every home.  After all, the showing of television programs that operate in the decimeter range began in our country for a long time.  Now on these waves will be broadcast digital TV channels.  An antenna designed to receive such a signal can be indoor (indoor) or outdoor (located on the roof of the building). </p><div class="photo" data-original="productondeal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="TV antenna" class="if uuid-3080755" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59230/3080755.jpg"></div><p>  In apartment buildings, as a rule, there are common antennas.  If your home has such a device, then you should find out if it receives decimeter channels.  If so, then it remains only to purchase a tuner. </p><h2>  Connection </h2><p>  Arriving home from an electrical store with a purchase, you will certainly come across the question of how to connect a tuner.  It‚Äôs easy to describe this procedure.  Having taken the device out of the package, you need to connect the power supply to it, as shown in the instructions.  Then insert batteries into the remote control.  After that, you need to look at what ‚Äúsockets‚Äù for connecting external devices your TV has. </p><p>  If you have a relatively modern (non-Soviet) model, then there may be three options: a comb, a tulip, or hdmi. </p><div class="photo" data-original="es.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="jack tulip" class="if uuid-3080763" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59230/3080763.jpg"></div><p>  Now you need to connect the receiver's existing connectors to the TV input.  If the kit contains a suitable cable, then the problem is solved.  If not, you will need to purchase it. </p><h2>  Music </h2><p>  The word "tuner" also serves as the name for a special device used to tune musical instruments.  It can be adapted for guitar, violin or anything else.  There are universal models. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.stringsdirect.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="guitar tuner" class="if uuid-3080744" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59230/3080744.jpg"></div><p>  In this case, the musician needs to know exactly the notes on which each individual string, key and so on should be tuned.  A microphone for this type of tuner is the main detail. </p><h2>  Models </h2><p>  Now is the time to consider how to choose a television tuner.  If the device is marked dvb t2, then it is perfect for viewing programs.  As a rule, all models perform this function equally well.  The difference is only in additional functions.  These devices can play music and video from flash cards, record TV shows on them.  One of the most useful features is timeshift - it allows you to pause while watching TV. </p><h2>  The choice </h2><p>  Below is a short list of today's most popular receiver models.  It should be noted that they all have the functions of recording and deferred viewing. </p><p>  The first in this ranking is: </p><ul><li>  Receiver Lumax dv-3206hd.  Its main distinguishing feature is the presence of a Wi-Fi receiver.  Therefore, this device makes it possible to watch not only TV, but also videos from the Internet.  In this case, the TV tuner is a means of viewing video from various sources. </li><li>  You should also pay attention to the tuner WorldVisionPremium.  It can also be connected to the World Wide Web, but for this you will need to buy an external Wi-Fi receiver.  This unit also has an RF modulator, which makes it possible to connect it to the TV through the antenna jack. </li></ul><p>  MezzoGx3235t2c provides stable signal reception and can also be connected to the Internet.  In addition, it is extremely durable and compact enough. </p><p>  Which TV tuner to choose is up to you.  Sometimes it is useful to clarify the characteristics of the model of interest in the manual. </p>
