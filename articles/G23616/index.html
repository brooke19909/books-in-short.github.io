Indeed, along with such giants as Samsung or Apple, producing expensive devices with significantly high specifications, a low-power and cheap phone will be received rather coldly.  But what if such a low-grade phone is released by a well-known company.  We are talking about the <span>Fly FS454</span> Nimbus 8, the price of which varies from two and a half to four thousand rubles, which is certainly cheap. </p>

    <h2>  Supply </h2><p>  The phone comes in a box of white cardboard.  In size, it is not much larger than the smartphone itself.  On the front side of the package is the name of the manufacturer, then, a little lower, the model of the phone, then in the lower third there is a decorative dark lilac strip and the inscription ‚ÄúNimbus 8‚Äù. </p><p>  Under the cover you will immediately see a phone lying in a cardboard tray.  After you remove the device itself, raise the tray and on the bottom of the box you will find the rest of the basic components, such as: a USB cable, a headset, an adapter for the charger and instructions for use and setting up the telephone device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Design </h2><p>  At the moment, the <span>Fly FS454</span> Nimbus 8 smartphone is available in four different colors: official black and white and more casual bright tones of green and red.  In all colors, the phone looks pretty good, but how durable the paint will be - remains unknown.  Unfortunately, no studies have been conducted.  But in any case, a good solution would be to purchase a cover. </p>

    <p>  As for the location of the various elements of the smartphone and device control buttons, they are here, as they say, according to the canon.  The power button and the so-called "rocker" for controlling the speaker volume is located on the right side of the phone.  Ports for charging and a headset are usually placed on the upper edge.  The camera and flash are located in the upper left of the back cover when viewed directly from it.  At the bottom is a four-row speaker grid. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Fly FS454 Nimbus 8: front display specifications </h2><p>  Now we will go directly to the analysis of the characteristics of the phone display.  Fly FS454 Nimbus 8 is equipped with a 4.5-inch display, which is half an inch smaller than most manufacturers.  Saving materials or the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãdesigners is a philosophical question.  Most likely, all at once.  The screen resolution is 854 by 480 pixels.  In terms of brightness, this display does not stand out, so get ready for glare in sunny weather. </p>

    <h2>  Characteristics of the filling </h2><p>  Now we will talk about the characteristics of the <span>Fly FS454</span> Nimbus 8, which relate to its filling.  And if you can come to terms with glare on the display, then with what is hidden under this display, it is much more difficult to put up.  Fly FS454 Nimbus 8 - a cheap phone, respectively, and the insides he will have from the budget category.  In more detail, the phone is equipped with the MediaTek MT6580M microprocessor - a quad-core processor with a clock frequency of 1.3 gigahertz, an ARM Mali-400 MP1 graphic core, 512 megabytes of storage memory and 4 gigabytes of main memory.  To increase the capacity of the main memory, a slot for microSD-card up to 32 gigabytes is provided. </p><p>  At the moment, these figures are extremely low.  Yes, this is a <span>budget phone</span> for three to four thousand rubles, but still.  Fly FS454 Nimbus 8 features unimportant features.  With such indicators, most applications, even the most necessary, will work with significant glitches. </p><h2>  Power Specifications </h2><p>  Now consider the characteristics of the Fly FS454 Nimbus 8, which relate to its power supply.  And if the previous reviews were more or less, then everything is not so good. </p><p>  <span>Fly FS454</span> Nimbus 8 has very mediocre reviews due to its low cost.  Including in terms of nutrition, there are a couple of complaints from users.  The lithium-ion battery Fly FS454 Nimbus 8 at 1700 milliamps / hour cannot ensure continuous operation of the device for at least 20 hours.  Its limit is seven hours of talk time and four hours of use of Internet services.  Alas, today it is a very mediocre indicator. </p><h2>  Sound and Camera Features </h2><p>  You can not do in the article without mentioning the characteristics of the Fly FS454 Nimbus 8 regarding sound and camera.  Well, the camera and speakers in the phone are not the most important components, but their quality should still be at an acceptable level so that the photos do not hurt the eyes, and the sound is the ears. </p><p>  With cameras, the Fly FS454 Nimbus 8 is relatively good.  He has two cameras: the front, 0.3 megapixels with a resolution of 640 by 480 pixels, and the main one with 5 megapixels with a resolution of 2592 by 1944 points.  The latter works in tandem with LED flash, which also serves as a flashlight. </p>

    <p>  As for the sound, then here it also does not shine with quality.  Conversational speakers, as well as the main one, produce a dry and quiet sound that does not bring any pleasure.  Yes, you can hear a call or an interlocutor, but the owners of a musical ear will have to tight.  And the same story with the headset, which comes bundled.  It is not very suitable for frequent and long use. </p><p>  After all this, it is not surprising that the <span>Fly FS454</span> Nimbus 8 reviews are much worse than about its "older brothers".  But still he is a representative of the budget segment. </p><h2>  Fly FS454 Nimbus 8: firmware </h2><p>  What is the gadget based on?  Fly FS454 Nimbus 8 is a smartphone based on the Android 6.0 operating system.  She has a specific list of protocols, tasks, and software that ensures its functionality and functionality.  But in this case, the operating system does not work correctly, as there are delays, glitches, automatic reset of the settings and a number of problems that significantly interfere with normal operation.  That is why there is a need to reflash some phone models in order to at least slightly facilitate the use of the device.  And since the Fly FS454 Nimbus 8 firmware is not without flaws, flashing this phone is already more a necessity than an alternative solution to the problem. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  What do you want to say in conclusion?  Fly FS454 Nimbus 8 is a mixed phone.  It seems to look stylish, but at the same time, the parameters of the phone are not very suitable for modern requirements.  And the key word here is ‚Äúmodern.‚Äù  If you want to introduce your mother (grandmother) to new technologies, then this is ideal.  The phone is cheap, not very difficult to learn, for the first touch-sensitive phone in life, this is very, very good.  Or, it‚Äôs up to you to choose, you can give such a phone to your child, not really worrying that it will be broken, scratched or completely stolen. </p><p>  Well, as for your beloved, there is a third option.  If you are a fairly modern, young and successful businessman, then why not get yourself an inexpensive, good looking smartphone, insert SIM cards with your business numbers in it and just answer calls from time to time?  A very good ubiquitous practice. </p><p>  But, despite everything written above, the choice is always yours.  At a minimum, you should weigh the pros and cons before buying. <strong><br></strong> </p>
