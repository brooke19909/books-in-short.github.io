    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  The case of the device is plastic.  An elegant designer edging that starts on the front side and smoothly flows into the side elements can be called a real designer find.  The brand label looks great on the left side of the case.  Top and bottom on the back panel there is a shell made of rubberized polymer material, designed to reduce the slip of the Philips Xenium W732 phone in his hand. </p><p>  Build quality is determined by experts as very high.  No backlash, no gaps, or creaking was noticed.  Body materials do not leave noticeable fingerprints.  Philips plastic scratch resistance is the highest.  At the same time, the display is protected by completely ordinary glass (unlike many other analogs coated with high-strength technological material such as <span>Gorilla Glass).</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Dimensions of the device are common for gadgets of this type.  The length of the smartphone is 126.4 mm, the width is 67.3, and the thickness is 12.3.  The second parameter, however, is larger than the "average" by analogs, but this is due to the increased size of the battery (which is more capacious on the phone than on many other devices). </p><p>  The Philips W732 smartphone is equipped with two standard sensors - movement (proximity) and light.  Experts note the high <span>reaction rate of</span> each of them.  Next to these elements, on the front side, there is an additional camera that can be used during communication via Skype and other software for video calls.  Immediately - a voice speaker.  The quality of his work is estimated by experts as high. </p><p>  At the bottom of the front of the case there are three standard buttons: "Menu", "Return" and "Home".  Each of them is equipped with a backlight, sufficiently bright.  Immediately - the device‚Äôs microphone. </p><p>  Interestingly, there are no slots in the lower end part of the case (as well as on the left).  The audio jack is located on top, next to it is a port for connecting via microUSB, as well as a power button for the device.  On the right side of the case are two keys that control the sound level.  At the back is the main camera with flash, as well as a speaker. </p><p>  If you lift the housing cover, you will see slots for two SIM cards and a microSD flash memory (the design of the phone, by the way, allows you to insert and remove them, even if the device is turned on). </p><p>  The smartphone comes in different color versions.  For example, a black-gray case is very common (in this case, the name of the device model sounds like <span>Philips Xenium W732</span> Black Gray). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The smartphone is equipped with a 4.3-inch display (actual value is 56 by 94 mm).  The matrix resolution is 480 by 800 pixels.  Manufacturing technology - a combination of IPS-LCD.  The sensor is capacitive, like most modern gadgets, like.  Supports 5 simultaneous touches.  Experts note a very high sensitivity of the sensor (comparable to that in premium phones). </p><p>  The picture quality on the Philips W732 screen is excellent, regardless of the viewing angle (under a strong tilt, the brightness is slightly reduced).  Color reproduction is noted by experts as very natural.  The pixelation level is minimal, almost imperceptible.  In general, the Philips W732 screen is characterized by specialists very positively. </p><p>  The "exterior" of the phone we studied.  The next phase of the Philips W732 study is next in line - specifications. </p>

    <h2>  Battery </h2><p>  As we said above, the Xeniums are characterized by a very long battery life.  Is this rule observed in relation to this smartphone model?  Tests conducted by experts showed that the battery lasts about 20 hours with an average intensity of operation of the gadget.  That is, it can be, for example, 25-30 minutes of conversation, 4-5 hours of communication on the Internet via Wi-Fi, the same amount through mobile channels and about half of this time is left for listening to songs.  To many, these results may seem modest.  However, as tests have shown, if the phone is used only for listening to music, then the battery will last for more than 2 days.  If you watch only videos at a high volume level and the highest brightness of the display - it will work for about 10 hours.  If you start the game, then the battery will last about 6-7 hours.  There is no question of any ‚Äúmodesty‚Äù here, experts say.  Great results.  Even users who leave reviews about the Philips W732, in general, confirm the theses of experts regarding the performance of the device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  The phone is capable of working in 2G and 3G mobile networks.  As with most other devices that support 2 SIM cards, you cannot use the services of both operators in 3G at the same time.  At least 1 card must operate in 2G mode.  There is an interesting option in the form of restrictions on "mobile" Internet traffic.  By using it, the user can significantly reduce communication costs. </p><p>  There is a Bluetooth module, though not the most modern - in version 2.1.  Wi-Fi is supported, there are functions of a router and a modem.  To communicate with a PC and other devices in wired mode, a USB interface is used.  Experts note the very high sensitivity of the Wi-Fi module.  Wireless communications, as shown by tests, keeps confidently, without failures and freezes. </p>

    <h2>  Memory resources </h2><p>  The phone is equipped with a standard 512 MB RAM module.  Although this is not much, most phone functions are performed with this amount of resource normally.  Experts note a high level of optimization of system processes in the smartphone: this is evidenced by the fact that about 250 MB of memory is freely available.  While in many analogues, its volume, as a rule, varies in the region of 170 MB. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  There are two cameras in the phone.  The main one has a resolution of 5 megapixels, additional (front) is very modest in relation to this characteristic - only 0.3.  The maximum size of photos received using a smartphone is 2560 by 1920 pixels.  Video, however, is shot in a fairly large resolution - 1280 by 720 pixels.  The flow rate is 30 frames / sec. </p><p>  Many experts noted the fact that the camera can focus at a very small distance (about 3-4 cm).  The color rendering quality is traditionally high for Dutch brand devices, and the white balance is of good quality (this is evidenced by reviews received from experts who tested Philips smartphones).  In the camera software, there is a mode that allows you to supply photos with the effect of vector animation. </p><p>  The videos are created by the smartphone in good quality, with a sufficient level of sharpness.  Some owners say that the sound quality is not high enough.  But experts, with this observation, refer to the ability to increase the "bitrate" using specialized applications available in Android directories, such as, for example, LG Camera. </p>

    <h2>  Work speed </h2><p>  The smartphone is equipped with the MTK 6575 chipset, Cortex A9 processor and SGX 531 graphics processing module (which supports technologies such as OpenGL 2.0 and DirectX in version 10.1).  These resources, experts believe, are enough to implement most of the functions inherent in the device.  Users who comment on their experience in operating the smartphone and leaving feedback on the results shown by the Philips W732, generally agree with this thesis. </p><h2>  Cards </h2><p>  The phone has a full-time GPS navigator.  There is support for the innovative EPO standard, which analyzes the movement of satellites in orbit in order to calculate the most accurate coordinates for the location of the device.  The GPS module starts up in a cold state within 3 minutes.  There are several preinstalled applications for working with navigation. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  Firmware Philips W732 - Android OS in the 4th version.  Among the pre-installed applications - address book, calendar, module for working with GPS-maps, calculator.  Philips W732 has an engineering menu that allows you to flexibly configure the device.  To start it, you only need to enter a special command on the screen: * # * # 3646633 # * # *. </p>

    <p>  There is a full-time browser, which works, according to experts, very quickly.  To fully display the pages, you will need to download a separate Flash player, since recently on Android platforms it has not been installed in normal mode. </p><p>  There is a pre-installed Kingsoft Office package.  Using it on a smartphone, you can not only open test documents and spreadsheets (as is the case with most other applications of this type), but also edit files and even create new ones in formats that can be recognized by other office programs, including Word and excel.  The application can also work with <span>cloud</span> data <span>storages</span> . </p><p>  The phone has a convenient and simple audio player with the functions of an equalizer, frequency adjustment and the effect of three-dimensional sound.  Experts note the highest sound quality.  There is a software and hardware module for receiving FM broadcasts.  You can record the radio into a file. </p><p>  There is no full-time video player in the smartphone, however, you can easily download an external (like MX Video Player) from the Google directory.  Technologically, the phone supports playing almost any file format. </p><h2>  Expert Summary </h2><p>  The keynote of many expert reviews of the device can be defined as follows: Philips Xenium W732 - a device characterized primarily by high quality performance.  Starting with voice calls and ending with the launch of games.  The smartphone is fast, without significant glitches and freezes.  The battery, designed to provide long battery life, perfectly copes with its task. </p><p>  As we said above, the Philips W732 firmware is the Google Android OS released.  According to some experts, Philips was able to successfully combine the capacious battery and the platform mentioned.  The fact is that these two technological undertakings, as many experts note, cannot always ‚Äúcoexist peacefully‚Äù at the same time.  The predecessors of the Philips W732 - w3bsit3-dns.com devices, many of which were not considered smartphones at all - showed very mediocre results in this regard.  For early Android devices, recharging every day, or even several times a day, was considered the norm.  In the case of a smartphone from Philips, this feature, as experts say, manifests itself much less noticeably than in the case of gadgets from other brands. </p>

    <h2>  User reviews </h2><p>  What do the owners of the Philips W732 say?  Many of them, like experts, note the advantages of the device over analogues in terms of the quality of the functions.  The <span>Philips Xenium W732</span> phone <span>,</span> they claim, provides fast application work and also allows you to perform many tasks in multi-window mode. </p><p>  Users praise the battery, which, given its size and capacity, of course, is not at all surprising.  Many smartphone owners emphasize that the actual battery life of the device exceeds the rates noted by experts in separate reviews.  Positive feedback from consumers was earned by the display matrix, showing a high level of sensitivity to clicks. </p><p>  The price set by the manufacturer W732 (Philips) (6-7 thousand rubles, depending on the particular store) in combination with functionality is quite suitable for most users. </p><p>  The owners of the smartphone also like the high quality of wireless interfaces.  It is known that many mobile gadgets are not too "loyal" to Wi-Fi: they do not see the network, they do not keep the signal very stable, they constantly reconnect.  Users who decide to leave reviews on the pages of the thematic forums where the Philips W732 is being discussed, note that such problems are not at all typical for this smartphone model. </p><p>  As for the camcorder, here the points of view are quite different.  There are opinions that, using high technology in the manufacture of the eyepiece, Philips could at the same time take care of the quality of the flash.  Indeed, this element, as experts have found, is not the brightest and most functional against the background of solutions from analogues.  At the same time, there are users who claim that any flaws in the flash are unambiguously compensated by the highest quality of the camera itself. </p>
