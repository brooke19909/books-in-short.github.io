    <p>  The origin of the future commander is ambiguous.  Researchers of his biography, local historians in their search are faced with conflicting data.  The appearance and nationality of Lavra Kornilov are the most discussed points in the circles of historians.  Most sources agree that his father was a Cossack family and served as a translator of the seventh Siberian regiment.  But the mother, according to one version, is a Kazakh woman who accepted the Orthodox faith as a girl, Maryam (Maria Ivanovna after baptism).  From her, Lavra passed on an eastern appearance. </p><p>  Other studies claim that his mother is from a Cossack family, among whose ancestors were Kalmyks.  And a completely different version suggests that, on the contrary, his own father was a Kalmyk, and his real name was Gavga Deldinov.  After the collapse of the family, Gavgu was adopted by George Kornilov, the brother of his mother. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Lavr Georgievich grew up in a large family, out of 12 children he was the fourth child.  He was quiet, modest, diligent and persistent in his studies.  He easily passed the entrance exams to the Siberian Cadet Corps in Omsk.  Only the French did not pass: the poor family could not find a tutor in the outback.  His industriousness bore fruit, and his every success in his studies nurtured pride in him.  However, he remained affable. </p><h2>  Years in the cadet corps </h2>

    <p>  Shy - such was the young Kornilov Lavr Georgievich.  A brief biography during the years of study in the cadet corps was dim until the senior classes.  Regarding extra-curricular life, of course.  He devoted all his strength to studying objects.  Soon Kornilov became a successful student and earned support for the official "kosh" after the first year of training. </p><p>  After graduating from the cadet corps perfectly, Lavr Kornilov received the right to choose a military school.  The most prestigious at that time was reputed to be the Mikhailovsky Artillery School in St. Petersburg. </p><h2>  Education at the artillery school and the Academy of the General Staff </h2><p>  Here he boldly, one might say, entered adulthood.  Father could not help him with money.  Lavr Georgievich worked as a tutor of mathematics, published in geographic journals, which brought him an acceptable income.  There was even enough money to help parents from time to time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Excellent marks for him are becoming the norm, but here the behavior is not at that height.  There was an unpleasant situation with a tactless officer who, if not for General Chernyavsky, could have been repulsed by non-commissioned officer Kornilov with a sword.  The student was respected, so he was forgiven for such an offense. </p><p>  He completes the last course of the school (November 1891) with a belt-junker, and in August of the following year he takes an additional course of the artillery school and receives the rank of second lieutenant.  Despite the prospect of remaining in the capital, he chooses the Turkestan military district.  In addition to the service, he is engaged in the study of oriental languages ‚Äã‚Äãand the education of soldiers. </p><p>  Perseverance and ambition push him to file a report for admission to the Academy of the General Staff.  Of course, here he proved himself at the highest level.  During his studies, he marries the daughter of titular adviser Taisia ‚Äã‚ÄãMarkovina. </p><p>  Upon completion of training, once again dismissing the prospect of service in St. Petersburg, Lavr Kornilov returned to Turkestan. </p><h2>  Expedition </h2>

    <p>  During the service as an assistant to the senior adjutant of the district headquarters, a little later as the head officer, Lavr Georgievich, dressed up as a Turkmen, entered the territory of Deidadi in Afghanistan and carried out an examination of the positions of the British troops.  He took part in expeditions to Kashgar, Afghanistan and Persia.  Along with the study of these places, he creates an agent network and establishes business ties. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In a brief biography of Kornilov Lavr Georgievich it is indicated that he made a great contribution to the development of geography, ethnography, military and geopolitical science, writing the book "Kashgar".  For her, he receives the <span>Order of St. Stanislav.</span>  This work has been appreciated internationally.  The British in the "Military Report on Kashgar" used city plans from the publication of Kornilov. </p><p>  In 1905, the General Staff published his secret "Report on a Trip to India."  And already in November of the following year, Lavr Georgievich was admitted to the Imperial Russian Geographical Society. </p><h2>  Participation in the Russo-Japanese War </h2>

    <p>  In the first month of the summer of 1904, Lieutenant Colonel Kornilov was appointed the head of the General Staff.  In a brief biography of Kornilov Lavr Georgievich indicated that he persistently rushed into the army.  In 1904, he was already the chief of staff of the first rifle brigade. </p><p>  A memorable battle, where Kornilov showed his valor and bravery of the military leader, - the battle of Mukden.  With his brigade, he covered up the retreat of the Russian army and he was surrounded.  Literally on bayonets under his leadership, the brigade broke through the environment and connected with the main parts.  For which he received the Order of St. George with arms of St. George. </p><h2>  As a military agent </h2><p>  Kornilov Lavr Georgievich, whose biography testifies to his abilities for oriental languages, besides, had an Asian appearance.  All this predicted him a further career as a military agent in China (1907-1911).  Here he meets Mannerheim and Chiang Kai-shek. </p><p>  During the service, he often travels around the country, studying the language, culture, life, history and traditions of the people who inhabited it.  He notices the numerical potential of an unformed Chinese army.  He carefully documented all the observations and sent them to the General Staff.  He was awarded high honors for his activities in China. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúNot a man is an element‚Äù </h2>

    <p>  With the outbreak of the First World War, a hectic life began, full of danger, setbacks, and manifestations of the character of a true commander Lavr Georgievich Kornilov.  In the second half of August 1914, he fought with the infantry division in Galicia under the command of Brusilov.  The soldiers idolized him, with which he aroused the envy of the general.  Even the captive General Raft called Kornilov like this: "Not a man - an element." </p><p>  In January 1915, Kornilov was promoted to lieutenant general.  Covering the retreat of Brusilov, he was wounded and after a stubborn bayonet battle of his battalion with the advancing enemy forces was captured by the Austrians.  I was able to escape from the third attempt, thanks to the Czech pharmacist. </p><h2>  As supreme commander </h2><p>  The appointment of General Lavr Kornilov as commander of the troops in Petrograd was approved by Nikolai II.  In March 1917, Kornilov arrived in Petrograd and the first thing the empress announced was an ‚Äúarrest‚Äù in Tsarskoye Selo.  But he did this more out of an urge to save the royal family.  He himself was very worried that he had this mission. </p><p>  All this time, General Kornilov worked on the creation of the Petrograd Front, placing loyal people in strategic places.  But he did not succeed.  It was not possible to agree with the Council, as well as with the soldiers of Petrograd.  He resigns from the post of commander in chief of the "crumbling army."  Further, Lavr Georgievich took command of the Eighth Army and raised the question of the ban on soldiers' committees and political agitation.  After the defeats of the decomposed Russian troops, Kornilov asked the command for permission to take harsh measures. </p><p>  On July 19, <span>the infantry general</span> Kornilov was appointed Supreme Commander-in-Chief instead of Brusilov.  He accepts this position on his terms, which included the reorganization of the army and the non-interference of the Provisional Government. </p><h2>  Failure to speak and arrest </h2>

    <p>  In August 1917, as a result of the successful provocation of Minister Kerensky (pictured above), Kornilov was declared a rebel.  Offended by a lie from Petrograd, General Kornilov Lavr Georgievich openly addresses the soldiers and people with a description of these events. </p><p>  In order to save the Kornilovites, the general takes on the unpleasant mission of Kornilov‚Äôs detention from infantry Alekseev and sends them to Bykhov prison, thereby ensuring their safety.  From September 1 to November, the arrested Kornilov and officers loyal to him stay in Bykhov. </p><h2>  Death </h2>

    <p>  After the October coup, Dukhonin released Kornilov and his officers.  Lavr Georgievich decides to go to the Don with the Tekinsky regiment, but they are being tracked by the Bolshevik troops.  He makes his way to Novocherkassk, where he forms the Volunteer Army.  Soon there was the First <span>ice campaign,</span> countless skirmishes with the Bolsheviks. </p><p>  05/31/1918 during the assault on Yekaterinodar, a shell flew into the hut, where the headquarters with Kornilov was located.  Thus ended the biography of Lavra Kornilov, whose photos were preserved in the archives. </p><p>  His grave was secretly razed to the ground upon retreat.  But by pure chance, the Bolsheviks who took this village discovered a burial place, dug up, desecrated and publicly burned the corpse of Kornilov.  Kornilov‚Äôs wife could not stand the news of this and soon went for her husband. </p>
