Resorts are valued for incredibly beautiful beaches and reasonably affordable prices.  In our article we want to talk about one of the hotels - Golf Residence 4 * (Tunisia).  Reviews, an overview of the strengths and weaknesses of the complex based on the opinions of guests vacationing here are the main goal of our topic, since very often tour operators do not provide all the information to customers. </p><h2>  Golf Residence 4 * <span>(Tunisia): reviews</span> and where is the hotel </h2><p>  The complex is located in Port El Kantaoui, near the resort center.  The distance to the beach is only six hundred meters.  The hotel has a very convenient location.  Within walking distance are all the key places in the city, tourists can visit the famous Sousse, located eight kilometers away.  The complex will appeal to children, as there is a water park nearby, as well as the amusement park Hannibal. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="golf residence 4 tunisia reviews" class="if" height="272" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1574473.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel began functioning in 1992 and since then has been hosting thousands of vacationers every year.  The hotel complex was completely renovated in 2008.  It is focused on family vacations with children. </p><h2>  <span>Golf Residence 4 *</span> (Tunisia): reviews, how to get? </h2><p>  According to tourists, getting to the hotel is not so difficult.  The airport in Monastir is only 25 kilometers away.  In addition, there are flights with Russia in Tunisia and Enfind.  Arriving at one of these airports, you should go to Sousse - by bus, taxi, lounger or train.  It is very easy to get to Port El Kantaoui from Sousse, since an incredible amount of public transport runs between cities: municipal buses (pay no more than 1.5 TND), taxis (cost about 10-12 TND), lounges.  The hotel can pre-book a transfer from the airport, it will cost much more than an independent trip. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  Golf Residence 4 *, Tunisia (reviews, room descriptions are given later in the article), offers its guests 237 rooms of the following categories: </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="golf residence hotel 4 tunisia reviews" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1574494.jpg" width="600"></div>

Reviews of tourists regarding the apartments are very mixed.  Almost all vacationers complain of noise.  The hotel is located next to the water park, from which music rattles in the daytime and people scream, and in the evening until the morning there is a night club.  In such circumstances, it is quite difficult to find quieter apartments, but the administration makes concessions and easily changes the rooms, if available. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="golf residence 4 tunisia reviews review" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1574603.jpg" width="600"></div>

In general, they are bright and spacious, the furniture in them is already quite outdated and needs to be replaced.  But the plumbing works well.  The apartments have large balconies with dryers.  Maids change linen once a week, and towels - daily.  Experienced tourists recommend leaving a tip (one dinar), this greatly improves the quality of cleaning.  Vacationers emphasize that all linen in the hotel should be replaced for a long time, since it is washed and looks untidy. </p><h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  How are meals at the Golf Residence Hotel 4 * (Tunisia)?  Reviews of tourists on this issue are always contradictory, no matter how good the hotel may be.  The main restaurant of the hotel offers vacationers full board or half board in the form of a buffet.  In addition, the hotel also has a Moorish cafe, a pizzeria restaurant, several bars: a lobby, an American and a show bar.  A local chef prepares local and international dishes.  The main institution is able to receive up to 480 visitors.  And in the a la carte restaurant you can order only foreign dishes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="golf residence 4 tunisia reviews photos" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1574580.jpg"></div>

    <p>  According to the guests of the complex, the food in the restaurant is normal, but not at all varied.  Very quickly bored with a standard set of dishes, repeated daily.  In addition, there is a trend: during the high season, the quantity and quality of food on the tables becomes larger and better.  Guests can enjoy completely different meat dishes, seafood and fruits.  Tourists are always offered pastries and sweet dishes.  The <span>All Inclusive</span> system in the hotel has been modified.  Guests can take free drinks only in the mornings.  At dinner and at lunch, they are paid separately.  The bars also present only paid alcohol. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  The infrastructure is not too developed in the Golf Residence Hotel 4 * (Tunisia).  Reviews of tourists indicate the presence of several pools, one of which is indoor and heated, and the second is equipped with a relaxation area.  The hotel has paid parking, several shops.  A car rental service is located next to the hotel.  There is a separate pool for children and a playground.  If necessary, you can order a nanny. </p><h2>  Sports and Entertainment </h2><p>  What entertainment does Golf Residence 4 * (Tunisia) offer its vacationers?  Guest reviews suggest that the hotel has its own spa, hammam, beauty salon, jacuzzi, fitness center, sauna and hairdresser.  In the afternoon, animators organize entertainment programs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="golf residence 4 tunisia reviews description" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1574586.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel has its own tour desk, which offers trips to local attractions.  In the evenings, tourists can have fun in the night club.  Tourists can play tennis, volleyball, minigolf and billiards on site. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  How far is the Golf Residence 4 * from the coast?  Guest reviews provide an opportunity to understand that you need to walk about twenty minutes to the coast.  For those who do not like such long daily walks, a shuttle runs every twenty minutes.  The coast itself is sandy and equipped with sunbeds and umbrellas.  There is also a bar serving guests refreshing drinks. </p><h2>  Hotel reviews </h2><p>  What are the impressions of tourists about the rest in Golf Residence 4 * (Tunisia)?  Reviews of guests of the complex, who recently rested in it, are ambiguous.  The hotel undoubtedly has a good location.  This makes it easy to find it if you do not intend to use the transfer.  Near the hotel there are many restaurants, cafes, shops that may be needed during the holidays.  Near the hotel there is an excellent General supermarket.  Its feature is the fact that this is the only network in the country that sells alcoholic beverages. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="golf residence 4 tunisia reviews how to get" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1574588.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Vacationers believe that the hotel is far from the coast.  It takes about twenty minutes to walk to it by walking.  The hotel shuttle in practice is not so easy to wait.  Therefore, kids and senior citizens to get to the coast is not very convenient.  The beach of the hotel is not very large, and in season it is quite crowded.  A breakwater has been built on the coast, covering the sea landscape.  Therefore, many vacationers prefer the beach located to the right of the port.  Of course, it is not equipped with sunbeds, but you can use your own beach accessories. </p><h2>  General impression of the complex </h2><p>  The hotel has good staff.  However, it is sometimes difficult to talk with employees.  Nobody knows the Russian language here, but very few speak English.  In general, with all the wishes it makes sense to contact the reception, otherwise you can wait a long time for the promised. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="golf residence 4 tunisia reviews and where is it located" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1574597.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel has an excellent pool.  In the evenings, shows are sometimes held.  But animation is offered to guests only during the high season.  After its completion, hotel staff is significantly reduced, including animators.  Active tourists visit Sousse and other nearby resorts on their own to get a new experience.  The most popular is a two-day excursion to the Sahara, which collects positive reviews from vacationers.  But it is worth considering that tourists with young children will not be able to visit such an excursion.  But adults will get a lot of impressions from such a trip. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Concluding the conversation, we can draw some conclusions regarding the Golf Residence 4 * (Tunisia).  Reviews, photos, given in the article, provide an opportunity to get a more complete picture of this institution.  According to tourists, the complex can be attributed to the category of budget places for unassuming vacationers who are not spoiled by more chic establishments.  The hotel is not bad for young people to relax, as all sorts of noisy entertainment venues are very close by.  But it‚Äôs not very convenient to relax with the kids here, because the children need rest and regular sleep, which can be disturbed by extraneous noise.  Therefore, choosing this hotel, you need to weigh all the pros and cons.  We hope that our article will be useful to those who are planning a vacation in Tunisia and are busy choosing the right hotel. </p>
