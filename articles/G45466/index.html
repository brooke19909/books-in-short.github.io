    <p>  Service.  Hotel Didim Beach Resort Aqua Elegance Thalasso 5 * is decorated quite stylishly and pleasantly, tourists note the increased attention of staff and administration.  Help where necessary.  The hotel does not speak Russian at all. </p><p>  The food is tasty and quite varied.  In addition to the main meals, barbecue and snacks with fresh pastries are regularly arranged. </p><p>  Animation.  This service is often remembered, as it is really very high quality.  The animation team conducts a new program every day, organizes contests and competitions. </p><p>  Of the negative aspects, it is worth remembering only that it will take about 1.5 hours to travel from the airport to the hotel.  This is a bit boring, especially on the way there is absolutely nothing interesting. </p><p>  Small hotel area.  With maximum occupancy, crowding is felt. </p><p>  In general, the Didim Beach Resort Aqua 5 * hotel makes a good impression and (apparently) fully confirms its status as a 5-star hotel.  It is worth going to active travelers, lovers of a quiet beach holiday and lovers of a good excursion. </p>
