Often, the boys, having reviewed all the episodes of their favorite animated film ‚ÄúTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles‚Äù, present themselves as heroes of the picture - turtles.  And this is not surprising.  Boys from a very young age want to seem bold, noble and cool. </p><p>  The cartoon itself has not lost its relevance for thirty years.  Therefore, not only children want to dress like a ninja, but also some adults.  Next, consider how to make a ninja mask from improvised means.  Of course, you can buy a ready-made suit in the store, but there it costs a lot. </p><h2>  Beginning of work </h2><p>  For those who know how to hold a thread and a needle in their hands, making a ninja mask is not difficult. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a ninja turtle mask" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/2170943.jpg"></div>

    <p>  As we know from the cartoon, the turtles are dressed in green clothes.  Therefore, to begin with, the costume itself is sewn.  Pattern trousers and shirts (turtlenecks) can be found in special books on cutting and sewing.  The main thing is to use green fabric.  The size of the clothes should correspond to the parameters of the future hero.  To simplify, you can simply buy a finished turtleneck and pants of the desired color. </p><p>  Next, you need to sew on the knees and elbows strips of red fabric.  The carapace can be made from a disposable baking dish or cardboard.  In front, you will need to sew on the yellow tissue, inside which you need to put cotton, forming a kind of muscle cubes.  Now the last step remains - making a mask.  From the cartoon, we know that the ninja‚Äôs head is green, and a yellow or blue mask is placed around the eyes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to make a do-it-yourself ninja mask? </h2><p>  Here are a few options. </p><ol><li>  Two strips of fabric are taken, each of which has dimensions of 16 X 90 centimeters.  One part must be applied to the lower part of the face so that the eyes and the upper part of the nose are visible.  The ends of the strip are tied behind the head.  The second strip must be attached to the crown.  The eyes and part of the nose should remain open.  Next, the ends of the fabric are tied in a knot on the chin.  The length of the fabric allows you to tie a second strip again, but already on the back of the head.  The main thing is to make sure that the nodules are not too tight.  The last step is to tweak the mask so that it looks like a cartoon ninja turtle. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a t-shirt ninja mask" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45228/2169803.jpg"></div></li><li>  For this method, you will need a T-shirt, which in the future is not a pity and throw it away.  It will need to be turned inside out.  On cardboard paper you need to draw an oval corresponding to the size of the head of the future ninja.  The resulting silhouette must be applied to the T-shirt so that two sides are obtained (front and back).  Next, you need to sew these two sides together without touching the lower part (the head is threaded there).  Now attach the resulting workpiece to the face and mark the places where there will be cuts for the eyes.  Then cut a triangular shape (for the eyes and upper part of the nose).  It remains only to turn the t-shirt back so that the seam is not visible. </li></ol><h2>  How to make a t-shirt ninja mask? </h2><p>  There is another way - the easiest.  For him, nothing is needed, only a T-shirt of the required color and hands. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a ninja mask" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45228/2169793.jpg"></div>

    <p>  T-shirt turned inside out.  Then put on the head (not to the shoulders).  Hands in sleeves are not threaded.  The neck of the T-shirt will be on the face.  Gently pinch the tissue near the ears.  The neckline on the face should turn into a narrow gap, from where only the eyes and the upper part of the nose will be visible.  T-shirt sleeves are tied at the back of the head.  It is advisable to tie stronger so that the mask does not blossom at the carnival. </p><h2>  Afterword </h2><p>  Of course, you don't have to wonder how to make a ninja mask.  After all, in stores you can buy a ready-made suit.  But a <span>DIY attribute</span> made by <span>yourself</span> will look more original. </p><p>  In addition, if you know how to make a ninja mask, you can create more complex types of costumes.  The most important thing is to be able to hold a thread and a needle in your hands, and use a sewing machine.  So now you know how to make a mask of a ninja turtle.  With this New Year attribute your holiday will be unforgettable! </p>
