By the way, the name of the city is a lot of confusion.  In some sources it sounds like Valletta, in others De La Valletta.  The city got its name in honor of the master Jean Pariso de la Valletta, who founded it.  Most guides still indicate the name Valletta. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="35.89890849999999" data-lng="14.514552800000047" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="11"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/1/3/3/4133.png"></div><p>  The city was founded in 1566 and is somewhat reminiscent of a rectangle, located on a rocky peninsula.  The old part of the village is protected by UNESCO, as it is the oldest surviving settlement in the world.  <span>Valletta</span> in Malta, beaches and quiet family vacations are famous for its <span>attractions</span> . </p><p>  The main street - Republican - conditionally divides the city into two parts.  All streets are located so that from the center rise up to the slope of Mount Skibarras (outskirts).  They speak two languages: English and Maltese (very reminiscent of Arabic). </p><p>  The climate in Malta is truly Mediterranean, with warm and rainy winters and dry, hot summers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thousandwonders.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what to see in Malta" class="if uuid-2532467" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2532467.jpg"></div><h2>  Ancient shrine </h2><p>  St. John's Cathedral was built in 1573 by the Maltese knights.  This purely Catholic temple is more like a fort.  This is due to the fact that in those days, the military situation was tense, so not only a religious structure was required, but also a fortification. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The cathedral has 8 chapels, which are richly decorated, and the plots are dedicated to the patrons of the knights of the state.  There are also burials of knights and a <span>painting by Caravaggio,</span> signed by the master himself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="St. John's Cathedral" class="if uuid-2532470" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2532470.jpg"></div><h2>  Art Museum </h2><p>  The museum presents one of the best expositions in Valletta and Malta.  In the halls you can see the real masterpieces of the Maltese masters: Domenico Morelli, Hubert Robert, Vittore Carpaccio and others.  Also, sculptures of mainly European masters are presented here, there is a collection of ceramics, ancient weapons and silver items. </p><p>  The building itself is also an architectural monument, since it was erected in 1571.  For many centuries it was occupied by the military, initially knights, then the commanders of the British military forces, as a result the building was named - Admiralty House. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tourister.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="map of Malta" class="if uuid-2532477" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2532477.jpg"></div><h2>  Palace Square </h2><p>  Another attraction of Valletta in Malta, which attracts many tourists.  It is located in the historical part of the city and has the shape of a square framed by four streets. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is here that the state parliament building is located.  It is located in a palace erected in the 16th century, which previously housed the residence of the Grand Master.  In some rooms you can even get an ordinary tourist. </p><h2>  St Paul's Cathedral </h2><p>  This is the cathedral church of the Anglican church near Palace Square.  The cathedral is located on Independence Street and was laid back in 1839.  The building was erected in a neoclassical style, with Corinthian columns.  The height of the building is 60 meters (including the spire).  Inside the temple there is an organ made by hand. </p><h2>  Jesuit Church </h2><p>  What to see in Malta yet?  It is recommended to look into one of the oldest temples in the city.  The church is located on the territory of the College of St. Ignatius de Loyla.  Together they form a complex that spans a whole block.  The college until the 18th century belonged to the Jesuit Order, then it was transferred to the state and the University of Malta was located here. </p><h2>  Auberge de Castille </h2><p>  The majestic palace, erected in the middle of the XVI century.  It is built on one of the highest places in the city of La Valletta.  The facade is made in the Baroque style.  Inside the palace were provided separate rooms for each nationality.  During the period when the knights of St. John left Malta, the palace became the headquarters for the French, later for the British. </p><p>  During the Second World War, the building was badly damaged, but at the end it was completely restored, now it is the residence of the Prime Minister.  It is recommended that you come to see this palace in the evening, when it is lit and looks especially elegant. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="mymalta.guide" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Auberge de Castille in Malta" class="if uuid-2532469" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2532469.jpg"></div><h2>  Main gate </h2><p>  One of the main attractions of Valletta in Malta.  They are also called Putiryal or Bib al-Belt.  The gate was erected in the XVI century, however, they were often rebuilt, but always carried a fortification function.  Now it is just a monument of architecture.  In the last century, local authorities even developed a plan for rebuilding the goal, but under the pressure of criticisms from the public and historians, the plans were never implemented.  In addition to the central, there are three more gates. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.malta.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Victoria Gate" class="if uuid-2532472" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2532472.jpg"></div><h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  What to see in Malta?  Of course, when you come to the islands you can‚Äôt devote all the time to sightseeing, because there are beautiful beaches for every taste. </p><p>  There are pebble, sand and rocky shores.  By the way, sandy beaches come with red, pink and white sand.  They are found even with an amber and honey tint in places where the rocks are bare to the globigerin layer.  Pebble beaches are mostly located in semi-submerged valleys. </p><p>  In addition, in Malta there are places for recreation with a developed infrastructure and completely "wild". </p><p>  The popularity of the beaches of Malta and Valletta does not always depend on the proximity to the resort area, but on how comfortable it is for a particular type of vacation.  For example, if surfers rest, they don‚Äôt need stones, but they really need wind.  And for relaxing with children, a small depth on the coast is required. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.alpharooms.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beaches of Valletta" class="if uuid-2532473" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2532473.jpg"></div><h2>  St. Peter's Beach in Valletta </h2><p>  The popularity of the beach is that it is completely ‚Äúwild‚Äù.  From the infrastructure there is only a staircase that allows you to go down to the sea.  Therefore, going here, grab everything you need.  But then it is here that you can fully enjoy a beach relaxing holiday.  Emerald water is always on the coast, but in windy weather it can cause garbage.  It is better to come here with children only if they already know how to swim, since almost everywhere there is a steep coast with a depth of 1 meter. </p><p>  There are regular bus services to the beach (81 and 85).  You can get there by taxi or on foot. </p><h2>  Other beaches </h2><p>  The most fashionable beaches in the city of Sliema and St. Julian's.  It is here on the coastline a huge number of hotels, shops and entertainment.  For lovers of club entertainment, St.  Julian's - with dusk, everything is just beginning. </p><p>  The beaches of Aura and Bugibba are predominantly rocky shores, which the British chose.  There are not very many hotels and shops, but quite enough for a relaxing comfortable stay. </p><p>  According to some tourist reviews, the best beaches in the city of Mellieha and its environs.  Although the village itself is located on the edge of the island and is far removed from other resorts, but there is all the infrastructure. </p><p>  The largest beach is called Mellieha Bay, it is comfortable to relax with children here.  At the mouth of the Mistra Valley there is a remote pebble beach, where there are always few people.  Not far from Chirkeva there is another wild and sandy beach - Paradise Bay.  By the way, ferries to Gozo Island leave regularly from Chirkeva. </p><p>  Another Maltese town of Marsaskada, where there is all the infrastructure, and in the area secluded mostly sandy beaches.  St.  Thomas Bay is a popular sandy beach with rocky terraces.  It has all the necessary infrastructure.  But in some places dense thickets of algae. </p><p>  The town of Birzebbuja is Malta's most modest resort.  However, in the village itself there is a beautiful sandy beach.  In the district they are mostly rocky. </p><p>  A good Pretty Bay beach with bulk sand mined during the construction of an offshore zone from a sea day.  It was simply mined too much, so a sandy beach appeared here. </p><p>  In the west of the state, in the resort of Pritti Bay, there are three beautiful, small sandy places to relax.  They are considered the most beautiful on the coast.  The beaches are far from the bustle of the city, so there are always few people here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cheapflights.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="resort beach" class="if uuid-2532474" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2532474.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotels near Valletta Malta </h2><p>  Inexpensive accommodation - Hotel 19 ROOMS, located on St.  Christopher Street, 87.
