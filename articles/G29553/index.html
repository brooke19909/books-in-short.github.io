DIY remaking</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, more and more growing interest in products made by hand knitting.  Passion for knitting is a real folk art, it passed from generation to generation.  This hobby is of great benefit, because with it, each of us can dress elegantly, cheaply and beautifully.  Moreover, new things can be created from old things. </p><h2>  Do-it-yourself new things from old things, thread preparation </h2><p>  In the wardrobe of any girl there are things that we no longer want to wear.  But throwing them away is also no desire.  The best way is to dissolve these things in order to bind something new from the resulting threads. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="new things from old things do it yourself" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/660739.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  If you dissolve an old thing, then immediately pay attention to the threads.  If the threads are old and washed many times, then you should not mess with them.  And if the yarn is high-quality and relatively new, then it is quite suitable for you to knit a new thing. </p><p>  Wash the old thing that you no longer need, and cut carefully at the seams into parts.  If there are very old places, then they can be cut out.  The knitting details need to find the top, and start to dissolve.  Of the old things, you can make quite decent threads, it is best to rewind them later in balls. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Threads thus obtained may break.  Knitting from old things and differs in that the threads of them are not very durable.  But it is possible to fasten the ends of the threads in the places of breaks by the sea knot. </p><h2>  Yarn alignment </h2><p>  Yarn obtained from old things will be flattened and uneven.  Your task is to align it, because from a flattened yarn you will not be able to knit a new thing beautifully.  In order to make this yarn suitable for knitting, you need to wind it in skeins, wash it by hand and hang it to air dry. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="from old things" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/660753.jpg" width="576"></div>

    <p>  Old <span>waste items</span> are often made of <span>wool.</span>  <span>Woolen threads</span> require a particularly tender attitude towards themselves.  They must not be washed in hot water, because they will fall off and shrink.  Wash them in warm water.  In this case, shampoo for washing hair, a simple washing powder, liquid for wool are often used as detergents.  Mustard dissolved in water is also used. </p><p>  If you washed and dried skeins of yarn, now you need to wind it into balls.  Then from these balls you will knit your product.  In the case when all the threads you have prepared, you need to decide what can be knitted from old things. </p><h2><strong> </strong>  Sweater from old things, the search for thread </h2><p>  During cleaning in the closet, you can find many old things that you no longer need.  For example, berets, hats, scarves.  They can be dissolved by receiving new threads, and something new can be knitted from them.  For example, a sweater. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY remaking" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/660783.jpg" width="375"></div>

To <span>knit a sweater</span> for everyday wear, you will not need to know any special knitting techniques.  It is enough to understand how the front loops differ from the wrong ones. </p><p>  To begin, tie a sample measuring approximately 12 by 12 centimeters.  You need to create the pattern that you plan to use for your thing.  For example, you plan to knit a sweater with an elastic band two by two, so this also knit a sample.  Altering old things with your own hands will thus be easy for you. </p><h2>  Sweater from old things, selection of models </h2><p>  If you are not a very experienced knitter, then it is best for you to try knitting sweaters of a not very complex model.  New things from old things with your own hands will be easier for you if you do not first take complex patterns and models.  If you are knitting for yourself, consider the features of your figure.  Girls of high growth with a dense complexion, as a rule, are not suitable for sweaters and cardigans knitted with complex patterns such as braids and bumps.  But for a short female figure, such models may well come in handy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="stitch things from old things" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/660785.jpg" width="354"></div>

    <p>  Before knitting, do not forget to make a full-size pattern, so it will be easier for you to navigate.  Magazines like Sabrina, Knitting, and others can help you in your search for patterns. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For a beginner knitter, this model of sweater is suitable: after calculating the loops, we knit the required number of loops on the knitting needles, we knit with an elastic band two by two twelve centimeters.  Then we pass to the front surface.  We knit with an even cloth to the armholes, then we make reductions for the armholes.  We knit to the neck, form the neck on the back and front of the sweater, and on the front of it it will be a little deeper.  Then the details of the sweater must be steamed and connected to each other using a stitch seam.  This seam is made with a special needle with a large eye.  Remember to tie the sleeves. </p><p>  As you can see, it‚Äôs not so difficult to do new things from old things with your own hands, if you show a certain ingenuity and imagination. </p><h2>  How to knit a lampshade </h2><p>  If you have the opportunity to devote some time to decorating your home, then you can try to create new things from old things with your own hands.  When you dissolve old, unnecessary things for you, then you have an idea to create something new.  There are threads, and why can they come in handy? </p><p>  The wardrobe is already full.  But there remains a home interior, which also needs to be decorated and made cozy.  A knitted lampshade for a lamp is the part that will add charm to your home interior. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting from old things" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/660796.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  To implement such ideas, reworking old things with your own hands will come in handy.  So, for lampshades it is better to take old things connected from cotton threads.  These threads will not overheat from the light of an electric lamp.  It is better if you use this lampshade to decorate a cold bulb. </p><h2>  Crochet lampshade </h2><p>  Old unnecessary things will give you the opportunity to get a lot of thread for your lampshade.  Before you start the process of knitting a lampshade, you need to know its size.  To do this, make the necessary measurements.  It is necessary to measure the circumference of the old lampshade with a centimeter. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="life of old things" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/660803.jpg" width="434"></div>

    <p>  Then draw a diagram in the middle of which there will be a circle equal in diameter to the top of the lampshade.  Crochet a chain of air loops that will be the base of the lampshade.  Then knit according to the pattern.  It‚Äôs easy to find a scheme.  You can make a lampshade of motifs. </p><p>  In order for the knitted fabric to be ready for use, it must be starched.  To do this, take a glass of cold water and dissolve a spoonful of starch in it, then combine the resulting liquid with boiling water.  In the resulting solution, you need to immerse the knitted fabric, then put it on the base of the lampshade and wait until it dries. </p><h2>  Lampshade with knitting needles </h2><p>  The lampshade can also be knitted.  It is important that the number of spokes matches the size of the thread.  In order to knit the lampshade with knitting needles, you will need to measure the upper and lower circumference of the base and then make a pattern.  She will look like a trapezoid. </p><p>  Before you start knitting a lampshade with knitting needles, you need to knit a small sample with the pattern that you will knit and wash the sample in warm water.  Thus, remaking old things with your own hands will become an occupation for you, bringing not only joy, but also benefit. </p><h2>  <span>Crochet</span> or knitting plaid </h2><p>  <span>A knitted blanket</span> for home is a great option to warm yourself in cold weather.  Plaid can be crocheted or knitted from new threads, remaking old things with your own hands is also an opportunity to create a plaid. </p><p>  First you need to decide for what purpose you will use it.  You can knit a blanket for a chair, its dimensions will be approximately 130 by 150 centimeters.  By the way, rugs are sometimes <span>sewn.</span>  <span>Sewing things from old things</span> in this case is not difficult.  Both knitting and tailoring of plaids give great scope for imagination and creativity. </p><p>  A crib can be decorated with a plaid, which is crocheted from multi-colored threads, its size will be approximately 170 by 240 centimeters.  A plaid for beds can be made of squares, the size of each square will be about two meters. </p><p>  For the product you need to take woolen or acrylic threads, then they will warm you in the winter.  Do not forget that before starting knitting you need to make a sample. </p><h2>  Knitted rug </h2><p>  To knit a floor mat, you do not need deep knowledge in knitting theory.  It‚Äôs enough just to be able to <span>crochet a</span> little <span>.</span>  <span>A knitted</span> rug will be your answer to the question of what can be done from old things in general. </p><p>  In this case, the hook will become a working tool for you, as well as threads made from old things.  For example, to create yarn, you can use t-shirts and shirts that you no longer wear.  Knitted rugs are a prime example of how you can make new things from old things with your own hands.  For knitting such a rug, bags can be used, while knitting techniques will not change. </p><h2>  Material preparation for knitted rug </h2><p>  First we collect the fabric, that is, the source material.  From this material we cut ribbons, of which we later knit a rug.  The thicker the material, the narrower the ribbons will be.  You can also sew things from old things, if there are such ribbons. </p><p>  When all the fabric is cut, we wind the resulting threads into balls.  Then we knit a rug of thread.  The mat can be round, rectangular or square. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="old unnecessary things" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/660844.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <p>  It‚Äôs very easy to knit a rectangular rug.  You need to create an air chain by crocheting, while correctly calculating the number of loops to start knitting.  Then we knit the second and third rows with single crochet.  It is necessary to ensure that the number of loops does not decrease, and does not increase.  You can knit a rug with more complex patterns.  More complex patterns include crocheted columns, arches from air loops that combine with each other in different ways.  Knitting from old things will give you the opportunity to create masterpieces for your home. </p><p>  Round knitted rugs look very original, and you can make such a rug even from old tights.  First, pantyhose need to be cut, then to make threads out of them.  The threads are connected with each other by knots, and then a rug is crocheted from them.  Its special feature is durability, that is, it can serve you for many years.  A new life of old things will be possible for you this way. </p><p>  For the bathroom, you can crochet a mat from plastic bags.  Packages are taken ordinary, the same ones that we throw in the trash every day.  You can take packages of different colors, and you can get a fantastic result in beauty. </p>
