The list of documents and the algorithm of actions have differences. </p><h2>  Current Account Value </h2><p>  Before you learn about the procedure for opening a current account, you need to find out who needs it.  Its purpose is to accept and store funds of an individual entrepreneur or legal entity.  Is everyone obligated to start it?  After all, its discovery and maintenance costs money. </p>

    <p>  All legal entities must have a checking account.  Entrepreneurs need it, since they work with organizations that cannot do without an account.  Its opening ensures receipt of funds and settlements with partners, tax authorities and social state funds.  Thus, if it is mandatory for organizations, then for entrepreneurs it depends on what activities they are engaged in. </p><h2>  What services are required for an account opener </h2><p>  The conclusion of a bank account agreement implies not only obligations, but also rights: </p><ul><li>  cash settlement services; </li><li>  for reporting in the electronic document management system; </li><li>  for currency control services if the organization or citizen is engaged in foreign economic activity; </li><li>  to dispose of money in the account. </li></ul><p>  The last paragraph has differences regarding individual entrepreneurs and legal entities.  If the first manages his own money, then the founder of the company, even the owner, formally does not have direct access.  Funds should be transferred to a personal account, after which the owner has the right to use them at his discretion. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to choose a bank </h2><p>  Opening an account is a service provided by all banks.  Is there a difference between quality and level of service?  The basic difference lies in the price and package of documents that are requested to be provided.  The cost is seriously different, even if you compare the price list in state-owned banks.  The package of documents is standard with slight differences. </p>

    <p>  To decide which institution to conclude a bank account agreement with, you should read the reviews, study the conditions laid out on the websites of financial institutions.  Today there is no need to contact the bank directly to find out what package of documents is needed and what is the cost of services.  Today, all banks, without exception, develop Internet technologies, develop applications that provide access to services around the clock throughout the year.  And many choose a financial institution based on its degree of development.  Other factors are put in second place. </p><h2>  Price issue </h2><p>  Banks charge money for services simultaneously and in a fixed amount, and depending on the volume of services used. </p><ul><li>  account opening - money is paid once; </li><li>  monthly maintenance - a fixed amount; </li><li>  replenishment of the account and withdrawal of funds by wire transfers - the commission is calculated depending on the amount of funds received and withdrawn; </li><li>  cash receipt and issue - depending on the amount of funds; </li><li>  formation of payment documentation - fixed rate; </li><li>  generation of account statements. </li></ul><p>  Banks seek to maximize the transfer of account servicing activities into a virtual plane, so a client who prefers electronic payments and reporting pays less than his colleague who uses paper documents and cash. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Preferences are written directly on sites and in contracts.  True, the procedure for opening a current account is the same, you still can‚Äôt do without going to the bank.

    <p>  Copies of some of these documents are accepted at a number of banks, if notarized.  In particular, copies of constituent documents, protocols and orders of appointment, etc. The specifics are determined by the policy of the credit organization.  The authenticity of signatures of company officials is verified and verified by one of the bank employees.  If there are changes in the management of the organization to which the account is opened, the cards with samples also change. </p><h2>  How to work with documents </h2><p>  Bank accounts are opened for legal entities and entrepreneurs in a separate division of the bank.  Most often, their service is carried out in the next room.  The application is filled in by the bank, in the same place, in the presence of the client or his representative, the submitted documents are checked and the forms are filled in according to the requirements of the financial organization.  At least the bank is visited twice: the first, when the details and requirements for documents are specified, and the second, when, in fact, the documents are executed.  Payment for opening an account and other services is made at the cash desk of the same department. </p><h2>  Do banks refuse to open an account </h2><p>  Indeed, there is a similar practice, and the main reasons are incorrect paperwork.  Sometimes banks are reinsured.  For example, discrepancies between the real and the formal address are revealed.  Account opening is denied to organizations whose accounts are blocked.  The legislation provides for other reasons. </p>
