    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Hotel High Beach 4 * (Crete) is located on the first beach line.  You can reach the sea in just a minute.  And all because the hotel is located on its own beach. </p><p>  The hotel was decided to build in Malia - this is what the ancient Cretan city of the Minoan state is called today.  It is an ideal holiday destination.  Here lovers of history and sights (which are worth only the local palace, excavations and city ruins), as well as those people who want to devote their holidays to sea recreation, will find something for themselves to their liking.  Local beaches, by the way, are awarded the EU Blue Flag for cleanliness. </p><p>  The nearest airport is in Heraklion - it is approximately 30-35 kilometers away.  Relatively close. </p><p>  The hotel is an ideal place for people who dream of peace and tranquility.  On its territory, as well as on the adjacent, peace reigns.  But if you suddenly want to plunge headlong into a busy life, you can go to the village of Malia. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The hotel itself is divided into six buildings.  In total, the High Beach 4 * fund (Crete) has a little more than a hundred different apartments.  All are decorated in a contemporary style and decorated with paintings by Greek artists.  There are Superior room apartments, VIP rooms, family rooms, as well as Junior and Honeymoon.  However, this is a separate issue.  And about the apartments, as well as the amenities offered will be discussed a little later. </p><h2>  What is in the hotel? </h2><p>  In High Beach 4 * (Crete) there is everything you need for relaxation.  On the street there is an outdoor pool and sun terrace, as well as a garden and barbecue.  In the evening, the hotel hosts animated shows and programs.  But the most interesting is not this. </p><p>  Guests can enjoy water sports, snorkelling or diving.  There is everything necessary for this.  You can also rent a bike and ride it in the vicinity.  Or take a canoe instead. </p><p>  In addition, the hotel has a SPA center with a Turkish bath, a sauna, a massage room, a jacuzzi and three freshwater pools.  You can also go to the spa for manicures, pedicures and facial and body treatments. </p><p>  Lovers of an active lifestyle will appreciate the presence of a tennis court, a billiard room, a gym, and a golf course.  Other facilities at the hotel include karaoke, darts, fishing and a library.  By the way, you can still visit the dance hall Delia. </p><p>  Guests who come here with children may not worry that their kids will be bored.  For the youngest guests there is a separate swimming pool, a mini club with nannies and carers, as well as a playground.  You can call it a small kindergarten.  There you can give the child if you need to go somewhere. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>
