No enterprise or company, of course, is able to function without financial resources. And for development it is not always enough own funds. In this case, they resort to attracting investments from outside, that is, investors.  In addition, the investment activity of the enterprise may consist in investing in various areas of the economic market by the enterprise itself. This may be either the own production of any goods, or the financing of third-party projects and developments for receiving financial dividends. </p><p>  <span>The investment activity of the</span> enterprise is ensured by practical application, is its <span>economic activity.</span>  It is aimed at attracting investment funds for the development of the company.  It is necessary to choose the right investment object and ensure the correct implementation.  All this is aimed at generating income in the future.  The investment activity of the enterprise moves in two courses: - external course - internal course.  In order for the enterprise to work stably and generate income, it is necessary to introduce new technologies.  Two factors such as innovative and investment activities of an enterprise determine the future of the enterprise. </p><p>  There are five main ways to innovate: </p><p>  - application of modern technology - new technological processes </p><p>  - the development of new markets for sales; the use of completely new raw materials </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - Launch of products with completely new properties. </p><p>  Investments should be invested in the company correctly, it is necessary to make an analysis of production and highlight the elements in which the innovative and investment activities of the enterprise would be much more profitable in the future.  Often you have to apply your talent and imagination, you need to see what a successful business will look like in a few years, and sometimes decades.  Features possessed by the investment activity of the enterprise: </p><p>  - revenue growth depends on increasing sales volumes of goods - reducing the cost segment of current operations (replacing obsolete equipment at one time, as well as replacing obsolete fixed assets) - this activity is little dependent on industry specifics, in contrast to production activities, investments are made the company is different in periods, it depends on the accumulation of financial resources </p><p>  - the <span>profit of the enterprise is</span> always calculated, for a period with some delay - the investment activity of the enterprise is always characterized by a certain risk. </p><p>  Investment activity in Russia is very well developed.  Investments come both from foreign firms and from the state fund.  Distinguish between industry, mixed, municipal and private investments.  Investments are also distinguished by the <span>payback period,</span> it can be short-term, medium-term, as well as long-term, which pay off for a long time.  There are many <span>objects of investment activity: -</span> stocks and bonds (securities), <span>financial investments,</span> deposits of legal entities in a bank, deposits of individuals in a bank, resources of nature, <span>intellectual property.</span>  Innovation and investment play a huge role in becoming a successful modern enterprise.  Changing production, the company goes to a new technical and scientific level.  All this leads to the release of new modern products that will be successfully promoted in the sales markets.  Also, the investment activity of the enterprise should include the introduction of new management, new motivation and a new organization. </p><p>  Competent investment activity of the enterprise contributes not only to the survival of the company in a tough competitive market, but also to a small extent contributes to its prosperity. </p>
