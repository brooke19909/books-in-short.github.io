Many will be surprised at such a desire, but in vain, because this headdress today is at the peak of popularity.  True, in a slightly modernized form.  When following our instructions, even a novice seamstress will be able to make a hat in literally two hours. </p><h2>  Lapel Pilot </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pioneer cap" class="if uuid-2235140" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2235140.jpg"></div><p>  To collect such a hat you need in two parts.  One of them will be the cap itself, and the other will be its lapel.  How to make such a product with your own hands?  The pioneer cap is sewn according to the pattern that is attached above.  We print out the picture and customize it to the desired dimensions.  Now you need to find the right fabric.  If you want to make a classic version of the headgear, then you will need canvas material of olive color.  But today, not monochrome, but color models are in fashion. </p><p>  We transfer the pattern to the fabric, and then proceed to the manufacture of the pioneer cap.  First you need to sew the tucks, and then connect the two parts of the headgear.  Then we sew the details of the lapel.  Now you need to assemble all the parts of the headgear into a single product.  The pilot is ready.  It should be steamed so that the lapel holds well and does not fall into the eyes.  You can attach an icon to the headgear. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Classic cap </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://ru.pinterest.com/pin/764486105468084191/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pioneer cap pattern" class="if uuid-2235156" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2235156.jpg"></div><p>  If you want to make not a modern, but a Soviet hat, then you should use this pattern.  The pioneer cap turns out to be the same that many wore in childhood. </p><p>  Why might you need such a hat?  Every year, an event called "Immortal Regiment" is becoming increasingly popular.  People who march in the column dress in accordance with the event, and the cap will complement the outfit well.  How to sew this headdress? </p><p>  We cut out the pioneer cap according to the scheme attached above.  This headgear, if desired, can be lined.  When all the parts are ready, you should start manufacturing.  First, you need to sew two side parts with the center, then iron the workpiece.  We iron the seams and attach the desired bend to the headdress.  Now either we sew a lining, or we process the edges of the cap.  If desired, the headpiece can be decorated. </p><h2>  Upgraded cap </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself pioneer cap" class="if uuid-2235359" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2235359.jpg"></div><p>  This version of the headgear is similar to the previous one, the difference will be in size and shape.  Such a pioneer cap is less and more accurate, due to the fact that the edges of the product are not sharp, but rounded.  Such a hat can be sewn for a child in a kindergarten, or in a school for a holiday dedicated to the Soviet period of our country.  How to make such a product?  The principle is as follows.  We print out the pattern, adjust it to the size, and then cut out the blanks from the canvas fabric.  Now you can start sewing.  Stitch the sides with the center.  Iron the seams and process the edges of the product. </p><h2>  How to modernize the cap </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself pioneer cap" class="if uuid-2235138" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2235138.jpg"></div><p>  According to the above patterns, you can sew not only Soviet hats.  Today the cap is an integral accessory of any fashionista.  These hats are made of dense costume fabric or drap.  Also popular among girls are fur caps.  In such a headdress, a fur lapel is successfully combined with a dense patterned fabric of the cap itself. </p><p>  Is it possible to somehow modernize the look of the Soviet cap?  Of course.  It can be painted and decorated with braid or embroidery.  If you do not want to spend a lot of time on needlework, it is recommended to buy ready-made applications.  Also, the cap can be decorated with ribbons.  For example, embroider volumetric flowers or bows on it.  Another way to decorate the Soviet headdress is to decorate the cap with the help of badges.  Moreover, they can be both modern and made in the last century.  Badges can be replaced with any brooches, rhinestones, beads or buttons. </p>
