For most, this fact does not fully fit into the head, because it seems inhumane.  But still, many are interested in the results of the experiments. </p><h2>  Crosses in the UK </h2><p>  In 2008, in the UK, scientists received the legal right to cross people and animals.  But such experiments are not allowed to all laboratory assistants, but only to those who have received a license for this.  Such experiments are carried out with the aim of creating stem cells that will be able to save people from incurable ailments, such as Alzheimer's disease, etc. </p>

    <p>  Despite such noble goals, some influential people seek to prohibit such experiments on human and animal genes, because this is contrary to morality. </p><p>  Scientists managed to grow 155 "unnatural" embryos.  But the financing of such experiments was discontinued.  Laboratory assistants do not give up hopes of obtaining the desired results, because the law is on their side so far. </p><h2>  Past experiences </h2><p>  In fact, there is no reliable information about whether experiments are carried out on the crossing of people and animals in our time (experiments of Great Britain are not taken into account).  But that they were held in the XX century, there is some documentary evidence.  Responsible for these studies was Professor Ivanov Ilya Ivanovich.  This scientist has already crossed different mammals and achieved certain successes in this.  For example, in 1901, he founded the first center in which they tried to artificially cross zebras and horses.  After about 20 years, this scientist became famous, because with his participation the musk ox was bred.  But Ivanov‚Äôs dream was to cross people and animals, in particular with monkeys. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  The experiments conducted by Ivanov </h2><p>  With his idea, the professor spoke at symposiums, where Western scientists considered such experiments blasphemy.  But this idea interested the Soviet government, so it sponsored Ivanov‚Äôs trip to Africa, where he could conduct similar experiments.  It is here, according to the professor, that there are not only many gorillas, orangutans and chimpanzees, but also natives who, with great desire, agree to be fertilized with the seminal fluid of monkeys. </p><p>  Of course, in order to get funds for crossing people and animals, Ivanov had to go through a <span>thorny path,</span> but in the end, in 1926, he and his partner-son went to Guinea.  Having settled in the laboratory of the Pasteur Institute, the scientist turned to the nursery for monkeys.  But there were kept only cubs, naturally unsuitable for fertilization.  Nobody dared to catch an adult from the jungle, since this is a risk of being torn to pieces. </p><p>  Only after the appointment of a very large prize, the most brave hunters were able to catch several individuals.  The scientist conducted experiments on insemination of monkeys with human sperm, but he wanted to do the opposite experiment so that a woman conceived from a gorilla.  But black ladies flatly refused to bear offspring of the monkey, so Ivanov was content only with the fact that only monkey females were fertilized. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  The results of the experiments of Ivanov </h2><p>  In the summer of 1927, the professor left Africa and he took all 13 females with him in order to get the result that a man should cross with a monkey in his homeland.  On the way, two of them died.  The first "halt" he made in Marseille.  Leaving his wards here, he went to Paris in order to heal his heart.  But the conditions for the monkeys were extreme, and therefore the females died one after another.  The remaining animals were sent to Sukhumi.  Here, three months later, the remaining individuals died.  It was decided to open the monkeys, and it turned out that the females were not at all pregnant. </p><h2>  Did the professor‚Äôs experiments end? </h2><p>  Despite this failed expedition, Ivanov did not stop his experiments.  A monkey was opened in Sukhumi, and many men and women voluntarily came to participate in the experiment.  Such experiments continued until the end of the 1920s, until Ivanov decided to present the results to the public.  But they refused to publish this information in Soviet magazines, then the professor sent a report on the experiments to the Pasteur Institute.  The Soviet authorities considered this action as a betrayal of their homeland, and, according to some sources, in 1932 Ivanov was shot. </p>

    <p>  What are the results of the crossing of man and animal?  Photos, documentation, samples of hybrids (if they were) never saw the light of day. </p><h2>  Is a monkey man possible? </h2><p>  Is it possible that crossing a person with a monkey will give positive results, and a baby will be born that inherits the genes from both parents?  As already mentioned, it is not known whether such experiments are carried out in our time, so it is impossible to precisely answer this question.  But anthropologists know cases when large primates abducted <span>African women.</span>  It is unlikely that a child could be born from these connections, since women were more likely to die from hunger or from sexual bullying of loving males. </p>
