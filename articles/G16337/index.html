The distance from the hull to the beach is not more than one hundred meters.  To get to the shore, you must cross the road along the sea.  But as for the inhabitants of the bungalow, they will have to first go through the territory before they get ashore.  It all depends on the location of the buildings.  Bungalows are scattered throughout. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="le president aquapark 3 reviews 2016" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1533543.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel's beach has a fine sand cover, the entry into the sea is gentle and comfortable, you can even say shallow, which is very convenient for kids.  There are umbrellas and sun loungers on the shore.  In high season, there is a bar serving refreshing drinks. </p><h2>  A bit about the resort </h2><p>  Hammamet, as a resort, is known for its beautiful beaches and the best centers of thalassotherapy.  He is considered the most respectable among others in Tunisia.  Tourists love the resort because of the opportunity to simultaneously enjoy a beach holiday, get a course of anti-aging treatments and have fun. </p><p>  The resort area extends for 14 kilometers along the sea coast.  Hammamet is conditionally divided into two parts: Hammamet Sud (southern region) and Yasmine-Hammamet (tourist new district).  The ancient tourist area is incredibly popular and brings a considerable income to the country.  Hammamet was founded more than five centuries ago.  Since ancient times, the resort is popular among people.  And now there are many different hotels built here, most of which have a four- or five-star level.  There are also three-star complexes.  The resort has an excellent infrastructure that attracts many guests. </p><p>  Hammamet is considered the most picturesque and green resort area of ​​Tunisia. </p><h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  Relaxing in the resort, you should definitely break away from the sea and see local attractions.  Be sure to walk along the old Medina and visit the Ribat, which are located on the coast.  No less interesting is the museum of the history of Hammamet. </p><p>  The port with the beautiful name Marina is the largest in northern Africa.  It is here that the new district of the Yasmine-Hammamet resort originates, which is built in the old style. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="le president aquapark 3 reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1533544.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Tourists will certainly be interested in wandering around George Sebastian’s house and garden.  The mansion is built surrounded by cypress trees.  In the garden there is an amphitheater with modern equipment, in which the International Art Festival is held annually. </p><p>  Almost every Hammamet hotel organizes trips to Tunisia, to the Cap-Bon Peninsula, to the ruins of Carthage and to the Sahara.  The city has the Carthageland Amusement Park, which has many attractions for adults and children.  The resort also has several world-class golf clubs, a zoo, an ice rink and a horse riding club. </p><p>  Although Hammamet is a more conservative resort than Sousse, it is simply impossible to get bored here.  Fans of nightclubs will appreciate the disco area, located ten minutes from Yasmin.  Here on several streets are all the most popular establishments of the resort, as well as bars and restaurants.  Among the discos, the most famous is Oasis. </p><h2>  le President Aquapark 3 *: 2016 reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, I would like to discuss the reviews of tourists who visited it in 2016 in order to have an idea of ​​the current state of affairs.  le President Aquapark 3 * (Hammamet) refers to budget hotel complexes.  It is located in a great location, on the seashore.  The hotel has a fairly large territory and is surrounded by a large tropical garden.  The complex is separated from the coast by a road.  The main building is very close to the beach to get on it, you just have to cross the track.  According to vacationers, living in the central building is convenient in every way, but, unfortunately, it is very noisy here.  In the daytime, there are a lot of people by the pool, and in the evenings loud music comes from the night club located on the ground floor.  Therefore, those who prefer a more relaxed atmosphere, it is better to choose a bungalow.  They are scattered throughout the territory, and therefore some will have to go to the coast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel le president aquapark 3" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1533545.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel has children's and adult pools, near which there is a relaxation area.  There is a sufficient number of beds, everyone has enough space.  Moreover, just around the corner is such a wonderful sea. </p><p>  Hotel President 3 * has quite spacious rooms.  The furniture in them is not new, but in good condition.  The modest atmosphere is explained by the budget level of the hotel.  All apartments are connected to a single air conditioning system, which is not very convenient, according to tourists, because it is not possible to adjust the desired temperature.  Sheets and towels are old and need replacing.  The quality of the cleaning depends on the maids themselves.  Some clean well even without a tip, and the second - poorly even with a cash bonus.  Towels are replaced almost daily, but bed changes are extremely rare. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  Food is one of the main issues that interest tourists.  It is food that causes a lot of controversy among vacationers.  In this sense, the “President” hotel (Tunisia) is no exception.  “3 stars” is a good option for those who want to get a normal room and average food for an affordable price.  However, expectations are not always met.  Reviews of tourists in 2016 regarding food are very controversial, unlike previous years.  Apparently, the savings affect all areas of the hotel. </p><p>  A lot of complaints in terms of cleanliness in the main restaurant.  The complex receives a lot of guests, the waiters can not cope with the amount of work, although they are trying very hard.  Sometimes they just do not have time to carefully clean everything.  The food itself is generally not bad.  Breakfast includes a standard set of dishes, as in all complexes.  For dinner and lunch there are more varied dishes.  There is meat, and fish, and chicken.  Of the fruits on the tables, there are usually watermelons and melons.  The hotel offers wonderful pastries.  It is served in the morning (donuts, croissants, etc.) and in the main restaurant, and after dinner (at 16.00) in one of the bars.  Soups are always offered for lunch and dinner.  Yogurts and cottage cheese are very tasty. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="le president aquapark 3 tunisia hammamet" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1533557.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  There is no separate children's menu, but among the food on offer you can always pick up something for the child.  In general, the food is not bad, given its three-star level, only tourists are displeased with the eternal lines in the restaurant for food. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  The hotel has people from completely different countries.  Previously, the complex was aimed at Europeans, of whom 90% were here, and very few Russians came.  In 2016, according to guest reviews, most of the guests are Algerians, there are a lot of them.  Not all vacationers are satisfied with their neighborhood. </p><p>  The complex has great animation during the high season.  The children actively entertain guests by organizing events on the beach and in the territory.  Very interesting evening shows and discos for kids.  As we mentioned, the hotel has a large territory, which has many sports fields.  The hotel also has its own spa center with a good range of services.  Everyone can visit the water park.  The hotel has a nightclub for locals, but tourists also visit it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="le president aquapark 3 tunisia" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1533562.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Special attention deserves the beach of the hotel Le President Aqua 3 *.  Guest reviews speak for themselves.  A beautiful sandy coast with a warm beautiful sea can conquer any tourist.  The complex has its own beach on the beach.  It has deck chairs and umbrellas.  During the high season, the coast is crowded with vacationers, and the rest of the time here is quite free. </p><p>  At the beach, guests can enjoy marine water activities.  Sometimes algae are nailed to the shore, but this in no way negatively affects the rest.  There is currently a police station on the beach. </p><p>  The hotel staff practically does not speak Russian.  At the reception during the settlement, additional funds may be required if you are offered a room that you do not like.  Twenty dollars can solve the problem of obtaining a more convenient number.  The hotel staff is trying hard, but not always coping with a large number of guests. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Le President is a good budget hotel.  It is suitable for unpretentious tourists who like to be near the sea and wish for an affordable price to get an excellent beach holiday.  A warm sea and a beautiful beach are what you need for a good vacation. </p>
