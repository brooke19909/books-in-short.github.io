Residents of apartment buildings, tired of the noise of neighbors, the bustle of the metropolis, increasingly prefer suburban complexes.  And when it is not just a complex, but a cottage village, it becomes the dream of the inhabitants.  Moreover, modern cottage villages have become a worthy alternative to independent projects.  Why, you ask?  Everything is extremely simple.  The developer in the process of working on the project tries to take into account all the subtleties, provide for the nuances, conduct all the necessary communications to make the life of residents as comfortable and convenient as possible.  Through the use of modern materials and innovative technologies, it is possible to significantly save on construction.  "Pallniks" is a cottage village in Yekaterinburg, which generated a lot of controversy and doubt around itself.  This is a great option for those who have long dreamed of their own country house, but are not ready to say goodbye to the developed infrastructure of the metropolis. </p>

    <h2>  about the project </h2><p>  4 km of the Chusovsky tract was chosen for the construction of the cottage village "Palniks".  This is a suburb of Yekaterinburg, an ecologically clean area.  The Volchikhinsky reservoir and the <span>Verkh-Isetsky pond</span> are a barrier to the harmful industries of Pervouralsk.  All residents of Yekaterinburg experienced and felt the negative impact of mining and processing industries, so the opportunity to purchase a house in an ecologically clean area is a great gift. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
