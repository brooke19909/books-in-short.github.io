If you only think and not act, then this will not end in anything good.  On the other hand, the philosopher will be harmed by political activities, distracting him from the knowledge of the world.  In this regard, among all the Roman rulers, Marcus Aurelius was an exception.  He lived a double life.  One was in front of everyone, and the other remained a secret until his death. </p><h2>  Childhood </h2><p>  Marcus Aurelius, whose biography will be presented in this article, was born into a wealthy Roman family in 121.  The boy‚Äôs father died early, and his grandfather, Annius Ver, took up his education, who managed to twice attend the post of consul and was in good standing with the emperor Hadrian, who was related to him. </p><p>  Young Aurelius was educated at home.  He especially liked to study stoic philosophy.  He remained her adherent until the end of his life.  Soon, an unusual success in the boy‚Äôs studies was noticed by Anthony Pius himself (the ruling emperor).  Expecting his imminent death, he adopted Mark and began to prepare him for the post of emperor.  However, Antonin lived much longer than he thought.  He died in 161. </p>

    <h2>  Ascension to the throne </h2><p>  Marcus Aurelius did not consider the acquisition of imperial power as some special and turning point in his life.  Another adopted son of Anthony, Lucius Verus, also ascended the throne, but he was not distinguished by either a talent for leadership or a state mind (he died in 169).  As soon as Aurelius took the reins in his hands, problems began in the East: the Parthians invaded Syria and captured Armenia.  Mark threw in additional legions.  But the victory over the Parthians was overshadowed by the plague epidemic that began in Mesopotamia and spread beyond the empire.  At the same time on the Danube border there was an attack of warlike Slavic and <span>Germanic tribes.</span>  Mark did not have enough soldiers, and had to recruit gladiators in the <span>Roman army</span> .  In 172, the Egyptians revolted.  The riot was suppressed by the experienced commander Avidius Cassius, who declared himself emperor.  Marcus Aurelius opposed him, but the battle did not come to a battle.  Cassia was killed by the conspirators, and the true emperor went home. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Reflections </h2><p>  Returning to Rome, Marcus Aurelius was again forced to defend the country from the Danubian tribes of the Quads, Marcomanes and their allies.  After repelling the threat, the emperor fell ill (according to one version - a stomach ulcer, according to another - a plague).  After a while, he died at Windobone.  Among his things manuscripts were discovered, on the first page of which was the inscription ‚ÄúMarcus Aurelius.  Reflections. "  The emperor kept these records in his campaigns.  Later they will be published under the names ‚ÄúAlone with oneself‚Äù and ‚ÄúTo oneself‚Äù.  Based on this, it can be assumed that the manuscripts were not intended for publication, because the author really turns to himself, indulging in the pleasure of thought and giving the mind complete freedom.  But empty philosophies are not peculiar to him.  All the emperor‚Äôs thoughts concerned real life. </p>

    <h2>  The content of philosophical work </h2><p>  In The Thoughts, Marcus Aurelius lists all the good that his teachers taught him and that his ancestors passed on to him.  He also thanks the gods (fate) for his contempt for wealth and luxury, restraint and the pursuit of justice.  He‚Äôs also very pleased that, ‚Äúdreaming of doing philosophy, I didn‚Äôt fall for any sophist and sat down with writers for analyzing syllogisms, at the same time dealing with extraterrestrial phenomena‚Äù (in the last sentence, we mean the removal from hobbies of fortune telling, horoscopes and other superstitions so popular during the degradation of the Roman Empire). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Mark perfectly understood that the wisdom of the ruler is not in words, but primarily in actions.  He wrote to himself: </p><ul><li>  ‚ÄúWork hard and don't complain.  And not to be compassionate or amazed at your hard work.  Desire one thing: to rest and move as the civil mind considers it worthy. ‚Äù </li><li>  ‚ÄúA person is happy to do what is characteristic of him.  And his characteristic contemplation of nature and goodwill towards his fellow tribesmen. ‚Äù </li><li>  ‚ÄúIf someone can clearly demonstrate the incorrectness of my actions, then I will listen with pleasure and correct everything.  I seek the truth that does no harm to anyone;  only those who are in ignorance and falsehood harm themselves. ‚Äù </li></ul>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Marcus Aurelius, whose biography is described above, was truly brilliant: as a prominent commander and statesman, he remained a philosopher who showed wisdom and high intelligence.  It only remains to be regretted that such people in world history can be counted on the fingers of one hand: the authorities make hypocrites, others - corrupts, others - converts into opportunists, the fourth treat it as a means to satisfy their base needs, the fifth become a humble instrument in strangers hostile hands ... Thanks to the pursuit of truth and a passion for philosophy, Mark overcame the temptation of power without any effort.  Few rulers were able to understand and realize the idea expressed by him: "People live for each other."  In his philosophical work, he seemed to address each of us: ‚ÄúImagine that you have already died, living only to the present moment.  The remaining time given to you beyond expectations, live in harmony with nature and society. " </p>
