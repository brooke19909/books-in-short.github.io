In Kislovodsk, this is the name of a part of the spa park.  The name itself evokes a feeling of something beautiful, sublime, and a dreamy mood envelops and makes you forget all the worries. </p><p>  This part of the park covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 30,000 square meters of slope.  From a height, standing on the observation deck, you can see a huge rose - a flowerbed in the form of a flower, as well as a paved path that goes into the distance, with trees planted on its sides. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  Speaking about the emergence of the Valley of Roses, it is impossible to separate it from the whole complex. <strong> </strong>  So, in 1823 by <strong> </strong>  By order of General Ermolov, a park was laid.  From the origins of the famous Narzan along the Olkhovka River, planting of deciduous trees began. </p><p>  Then there was no talk of romance, and he was simply called the boulevard or the official garden.  But it could not be otherwise, because the breakdown of the park was carried out by the lower ranks of the military, who took part in protecting these territories from the highlanders.  This was the first phase of construction. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="valley of roses Kislovodsk how to get there" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39949/1157730.jpg" width="600"></div><br>  Then they began to plant shrubs and flowers.  And at the same time, the landscaped Tsar‚Äôs platform appeared, later renamed the Valley of Roses.

    <p>  The second stage began in 1903.  The park was expanded due to Cossack lands.  And the main organizer was Albert Regel.  Through the efforts of this then-famous gardener, the park became more picturesque, the list of planted trees was replenished with ordinary ash, <span>English oak,</span> Caucasian pine and others.  And the Tsar‚Äôs platform was enriched with the composition "Russian round dance", consisting of European fir trees. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the first half of the twentieth century, landscaping of mountain slopes continued. </p><h2>  When the Rose Valley blooms </h2><p>  It is naturally better to come to these places at a time when the Valley of Roses in Kislovodsk blooms.  The peak falls in the middle of summer.  Then it is especially interesting to walk on a square platform, planted with roses of different varieties. </p><p>  Flowers of various types and colors grow in square sectors.  These sections are separated by convenient tracks.  You can approach, enjoy the look of flowers, their magnificence, variety, and breathe in aromas that also differ in their shades. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="valley of roses Kislovodsk" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39949/1157727.jpg" width="500"></div><br>  But even at another time, when roses are still gaining strength, walking in the park is very pleasant and beneficial for the body.

    <p>  Unfortunately, Kislovodsk does not have its own airport. </p><p>  By the way, in addition to the place called Rose Valley, Kislovodsk also has other interesting sights.  For example, you can get into the park by walking past the Red Stones, the monument to Pushkin and Pervomaiskaya Polyana from the Narzan Gallery, or from the Sanatorium Ordzhonikidze. </p><p>  In the city itself, overgrown with greenery, it is also best to walk.  Yes, and it is quite convenient because of the compact layout.  But for a comfortable trip, there is a fixed-route taxi and municipal buses. </p><p>  Although it is time to come here in July when the Valley of Roses blooms, Kislovodsk is ready to receive guests at any time of the year due to the enormous number of sunny days in the year. </p>
