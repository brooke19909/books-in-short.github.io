    <h2>  Features of a complete set </h2><p>  The original delivery set of the BlackVue DR400G II recorder cannot be called, but it contains everything necessary for work, including a memory card.  The memory capacity of 32 GB is enough for 10 hours of video recording in FullHD resolution. </p><p>  The BlackVue DR400G-HD video recorder itself is compact, but at the same time it is equipped with a long wire, which is enough for laying through the entire interior of the car.  Using the hook and loop fasteners provided, the wire can be neatly secured. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  The DVR is made in the original cylindrical form, but it is not equipped with a screen.  This solution is very unusual for the DVR, since most motorists are used to the fact that the recorded video can be immediately viewed on the display.  In the case of the BlackVue DR400G, you will have to watch the recordings on the tablet or iPad. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Infrared camera optics are located on the recorder case.  There you can also notice speaker holes, LED indicators and a microphone.  One of the LEDs indicates the presence of a GPS signal, the second indicates the recording status. </p><p>  On the left side is a key with the inscription BlackVue, surrounded by a luminous ring indicator.  On the right side of the system end are three connectors: an AV output, a slot for a memory card, and an input for external power. </p>

    <h2>  Registrar mount in the cabin </h2><p>  The BlackVue DR400G-HD II dashcam is inserted into a bracket attached to the windshield.  To disconnect the recorder, just hold down the Lock key and pull it towards you.  Despite the fact that the gadget is easy to remove, it holds securely in the bracket. </p><p>  The bracket itself is attached to the windshield using the double-sided tape included.  It is removed extremely hard, so it is advisable to choose a mounting location in advance. </p><p>  The BlackVue DR400G-HD II dashcam rotates around an axis 360 degrees, but it cannot be deployed in a horizontal plane. </p><p>  The gadget is compact and convenient, differs from its analogues in its original design and high build quality.  The body does not creak or crunch during deformations. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Settings </h2><p>  BlackVue dashcam settings are configured only through a personal computer.  Not all users are satisfied.  In the reviews on the BlackVue DR400G, some motorists note that this method is not the most convenient and successful, but not everything is as bad as it seems at first glance. </p><p>  The memory card is connected to USB via an adapter.  It contains an instruction manual and software that allows you to configure the recorder and work with ready-made recordings. </p><p>  A convenient installer allows you to update the firmware of BlackVue DR400G-HD II.  It is better to do this immediately after connecting the recorder to the computer.  The corresponding application icon appears on the desktop, the launch of which opens all the functionality of the gadget. </p>

    <h2>  Program interface </h2><p>  Viewing recorded files is carried out in the upper left part of the program window.  Right below the player are the control buttons and the playback speed control.  The image can be rotated. </p><p>  In the lower left part there is a calendar with marked dates in which entries were made.  To the right is the timeline. </p><p>  The latter function is very useful and allows you to find the necessary record in the device‚Äôs memory in seconds, just remember the date and approximate time of the trip. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  All video files are saved in a separate folder in AVI or MP4 format, however it is more convenient to work with them through the program. </p><p>  In the left part of the program window graphs of the G-sensor and GPS-data are displayed - coordinates and speed. </p><h2>  DVR settings </h2><p>  There are not many settings in the DVR menu, however, they differ significantly from the standard settings in similar gadgets. </p><p>  Separately, it is worth noting the data storage settings.  When you select the item "time" the memory of the recorder will be cleared of the oldest entries as they become full.  If you select "type", then new files will be written to the place of deleted old ones of the same type. </p>

    <h2>  G-Sensor Settings </h2><p>  The BlackVue DR400G integrates a motion detector and a G-sensor, the sensitivity of which is individually adjusted for each of the selected operating modes of the recorder.  Switching the gadget to the parking mode is carried out provided that the G-sensor does not record any movements for 10 minutes.  In this mode, video recording is carried out only if the car is exposed to external influences or the gadget records movement.  Any movements should be recorded for at least 30 seconds, after which the parking mode will be turned off.  The key located at the end of the recorder is designed to quickly switch to parking mode. </p><p>  According to users, it is difficult to set sensitivity parameters at random, so it is advisable to resort to the so-called advanced mode - it automatically adjusts the parameters based on any fragment from the video. </p><h2>  Third-party settings and compatibility with iOS and Android </h2><p>  Additional settings regarding notifications, both voice and sound, are made in a separate tab of the application.  In this window, you can select the color of the indicator. </p><p>  The only minus in the settings is the lack of an overlay function for the vehicle‚Äôs video number. </p><p>  The registrar's manufacturer distributes a free Android application, for iOS the program is only being developed. </p><p>  Access to videos from a smartphone opens after installing the appropriate application and inserting a memory card.  All recordings are easily played by any smartphone in the player built into the application.  You can overlay GPS tags on GoogleMaps maps.  All made recordings can be immediately uploaded to third-party resources, for example, on YouTube: the application has the corresponding function. </p><p>  For iOS, the application is not currently developed, however, you can connect the DVR using the Camera Connection Kit and watch videos.  The only problem that may arise is the inability of the BlackVue DR400G-HD firmware and tablet or iPhone to sync and open files, because they are saved in a separate BlackVue / Record folder, which is not perceived by all devices. </p><p>  Ideally, it would be convenient and useful to add a database of stationary radars of the ‚ÄúArrow‚Äù type to the recorder‚Äôs memory, given that all files and settings are stored on the memory card and there is a GPS module. </p>

    <h2>  Launch and operation </h2><p>  Turning on the DVR occurs automatically immediately after the appearance of power from the car's on-board network.  Simply put, to launch the BlackVue DR400G, just plug in the plug and wait for the status LED to fire.  Shooting begins in a few minutes.  The inclusion and subsequent work are accompanied by voice commands in Russian. </p><p>  Stopping the recording and turning off the gadget occurs when the power is turned off.  Even if the wire is pulled sharply - the recorder will smoothly and accurately finish recording, respectively, there is still a small battery in it. </p><p>  In addition to the dashcam, you can purchase Power Magic - a special <span>battery charge controller.</span>  Such equipment allows BlackVue to work even if the car‚Äôs engine is turned off.  The presence of accessories compatible with the DVR can be attributed to its advantages. </p><p>  The only drawback at the start-up phase is the delay in recording start - the recorder starts working a minute after starting.  The GPS module indicator is activated even later, after two to three minutes. </p><p>  After the DVR turns on, you can not touch it.  He calmly records and reminds of his work only with a sound notification when starting to record a new fragment and a luminous indicator. </p>

    <h2>  Image quality </h2><p>  The quality of the recorded video is very good - FullHD.  Features BlackVue DR400G-HD II allow you to record a dynamic and vivid picture with large viewing angles.  Despite the fact that the edges of the image are somewhat blurry, the real proportions of objects remain unchanged.  The numbers of cars going in the stream ahead are perfectly readable, but the oncoming stream is recorded only at a low speed.  However, no modern DVR is able to record the numbers of all moving vehicles, so BlackVue in this regard is not inferior to its counterparts. </p><h2>  Features of video recording </h2><ol data-id="aa3996acecde1"><li>  A sharp change in image when changing the degree of illumination.  Often this negatively affects the quality of the picture, but in most cases it allows you to see those details that would be spoiled on similar models of recorders. </li><li>  The device perfectly distinguishes texts located at large distances, including on various signs. </li><li>  Poor sound recording.  It is likely that the integrated microphone is not the best quality and efficiency. </li></ol><p>  When viewing the video recorded by the registrar, it is possible to note almost complete absence of sound or strong noise, but at the same time high image quality: the numbers of passing cars and texts on road signs are perfectly read.  The gadget independently divides the record into separate fragments, depending on what happens on them: movement, parking or a simple car. </p><p>  Separately, it is worth noting the night mode of shooting: on reflective numbers you can see not the headlights, but numbers and letters, no blurry spots and noise on the recording.  The image becomes even clearer if bi-xenon headlights are installed on the car. </p><p>  The DVR does not heat up during operation, remaining pleasantly warm.  The working temperature range is from -20 to +70 degrees Celsius, which is quite enough for severe Russian winters.  During operation, BlackVue does not freeze and does not fail, which only confirms its effectiveness. </p>

So: </p><ul data-id="101410633928d"><li>  Recording starts a minute after turning on the gadget. </li><li>  The battery is intended only for accurate and smooth shooting. </li><li>  Minor flaws and software bugs. </li><li>  The lack of a remote control for the DVR. </li><li>  The quality of the recorded sound is poor. </li><li>  Impossible to take photos - only video is recorded. </li><li>  High cost for a DVR of this class. </li></ul><p>  However, despite the fact that the gadget has many shortcomings, during the work, as the drivers note, you can get used to them, and they become almost invisible. </p><p>  The cost of the DVR on the official website of the manufacturer is 12,990 rubles, and this is a rather high price for a gadget of this class and with the described functionality.  However, a specific decision is made by the motorist.  The only thing to consider is the presence of a large number of fakes on the market, so you need to choose a registrar very carefully. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  At first glance, it seems that the BlackVue DR400G recorder will not be able to surprise the user, but in reality it is not so: the gadget boasts the ideal video recording quality, which is not on similar devices of other brands. </p><p>  During operation, the DVR shows its best side, while the gadget also has untapped potential.  With proper support from the manufacturer, BlackVue could become one of the best car DVRs.  To do this, just make it autonomous and equip it with a remote control. </p>
