Dozens of old manors, magnificent castles and palaces are the subject of admiration for travelers from all over the world.  A visit to at least one of them leaves a lasting impression for a lifetime, especially since the flights Moscow - Munich are direct and regular. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="48.1351253" data-lng="11.581980499999986" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="10"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/8/0/8/17808.png"></div><h2>  Neuschwanstein Castle </h2><p>  The most famous castle in the world - Neuschwanstein - is located about a hundred kilometers from Munich.  Its name translates from German as "swan rock."  Every year, hundreds of thousands of people come from all over the globe to admire the grandeur of the castle and its interior with luxurious interiors.  To get to the castle, you need to keep going to the Schwangau valley.  The local infrastructure has long turned into extremely convenient services for visiting tourists.  On-site parking is available where you can leave your or rented car.  Payment is daily, therefore, having arrived in the valley, you can already take your time and get to know the sights. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.munichcitytour.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Neuschwanstein Castle" class="if uuid-3231788" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3231788.jpg"></div><p>  Munich‚Äôs castles are usually located at the highest point, so you will have to get to Neuschwanstein on foot for about half an hour uphill, so before you travel, don‚Äôt forget to buy or immediately put on comfortable shoes.  There are many legends and myths associated with the castle.  They are told by a guide with whom you can enter the castle, as individual visits are prohibited.  One of the legends says that the famous composer Tchaikovsky, having been in the castle, was so impressed by his splendor that he conceived and wrote his ingenious work "Swan Lake" in the walls of the castle.  To get to it, just buy a ticket for the flight Moscow - Munich. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Linderhof </h2><p>  Castles in the vicinity of Munich are striking in their diversity.  For example, Linderhof Castle, located near Neuschwanstein, was built in a radically different style from the dark Gothic style.  He is called the second Versailles.  King Ludwig built it to his personal taste.  The palace turned out to be small and cozy, with a small garden and a fountain in the courtyard.  Interestingly, Ludwig, madly in love with the work of the composer Wagner, coming here, retired to a small cave and listened to his favorite music alone.  You don‚Äôt have to spend much time on this castle, but it is best to start your excursion with it, and then move it to Neuschwanstein. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.schwangau.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Schwangau area" class="if uuid-3231784" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3231784.jpg"></div><h2>  Herrenkimsee Palace </h2><p>  The castles and palaces of Munich are very different from each other in their architectural styles.  But not Herrenkimsee.  It is called Versailles.  And this is not fiction.  According to documents, King Ludwig of Bavaria acquired a large island on Lake Chiemsee, on which he decided to erect a palace, almost a copy of French Versailles.  He succeeded. </p><p>  To get to the island, you must travel to the small town of Prina.  Small ships depart from the local pier and deliver tourists to the island hourly.  Having landed on the island, you need to walk a few hundred meters. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The walls of the palace contain many valuable exhibits related not only to the Ludwig era.  For museum storage, a whole room was allocated where his majesty's personal belongings, photographs, letters were collected. </p><p>  On the ground floor there is a souvenir shop where porcelain items for sale from several to hundreds of euros are put up for sale. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.specialprivatetours.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Linderhof Castle" class="if uuid-3231789" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3231789.jpg"></div><h2>  Blutenburg Castle </h2><p>  Blutenburg Castle in Munich was built by Albrecht the Third, who reigned in German lands.  Then, of course, Munich was a small city compared to today, and in its western part the king liked the place for the construction of a hunting lodge.  Of course, by royal standards, even a hunting lodge will look like a palace, which in the end turned out to be.  After the death of the king, the building was rebuilt many times, and today we see it as a small cozy house located almost on an island - land that is surrounded by two ponds and a river. </p><p>  The inner filling of the castle will delight even the most sophisticated travelers.  Painting, interior items, hand-made by masters of that time, personal belongings of the inhabitants of the castle.  In addition, it houses one of the largest youth libraries in the world.  Here you can freely sit down and read any book.  Excursions in Bluetenburg are free.  It is best to arrive here early in the morning, because, despite its small size, it will take about three to four hours to inspect all the land. </p><p>  If you are going on an excursion, here is information on how to get to the castle of Blutenburg in Munich.  You need to take the metro to Moosach Station.  Having risen to the surface, walk about twenty minutes, and you are there.  You can also get to the S-Bahn Pasing metro station and catch bus number 56, which will take you straight to the castle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ijb.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Blutenburg Castle" class="if uuid-3231803" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3231803.jpg"></div><h2>  Hohenschwangau Castle </h2><p>  One of Munich's most magnificent castles hid between the hills near the village of Schwangau, which is famous for its magnificent landscapes.  Initially, the building played the role of a fortress, which was founded here in the 12th century and was called Schwanstein.  The castle was turned into a castle by the knights who lived in this area for more than four centuries.  Unfortunately, the clan of knights was interrupted in the 16th century, and the castle gradually began to be destroyed. </p><p>  At the beginning of the 19th century, King Maximilian II, hunting, fell into these lands and simply fell in love with them.  After some time, having bought the land together with the castle, he invited the best architects and artists of the time to restore the castle, who, under the vigilant personal supervision of the king, for several years lifted the castle from ruins.  A hunting lodge was built nearby.  I must say that the sons of the king also loved these places very much and turned them into a royal summer residence. </p><p>  The castle is still in the personal possession of the royal descendants, but no one lives in it.  Hohenschwangau turned into a museum, access to which is open to visitors all year round. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.schwangau.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hohenschwangau Castle" class="if uuid-3231805" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3231805.jpg"></div><h2>  D√ºrkheim Palace </h2><p>  The history of one of the oldest castles in Munich is rich in various events.  Its construction began in 1842 on the personal orders of the royal chamberlain Friedrich von Durkheim, and it was conceived as a building in which noble meetings will be held.  Moreover, one of the conditions for the construction was that the royal residence was to be observed from the building. </p><p>  The construction was completed in 1844, and already 15 years later the government of Prussia acquired the building to organize a diplomatic corps there.  He existed there for more than 50 years, then was moved to another place, and the complex was purchased and turned into a museum. </p><h2>  Nymphenburg Palace </h2><p>  Among the palaces and castles of Munich there is another interesting instance - Nymphenburg.  Its construction began in 1664 in the western part of Munich and was completed in eleven years.  Throughout its existence, it has expanded and increased many times. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bavaria.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nymphenburg Palace" class="if uuid-3231806" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3231806.jpg"></div><p>  The interior and interiors of the castle are considered one of the best in Europe.  The most famous hall is the Hall of Beauties, where portraits of the most beautiful women of Europe of that time are hung on the walls.  Of interest to tourists is the park, which is adjacent to the palace and is considered one of the largest royal parks in the world. </p>
