Bosch is one of the companies that produces them.  Due to increased consumer demand, the product range of devices is constantly updated.  Characteristics of new products will be presented in the article. </p><p>  Vacuum cleaners that do not depend on the location of outlets in the room, many buyers find it convenient.  The German manufacturer produces models that are compact in size, reliable and of high quality.  Almost all Bosch cordless vacuum cleaners (see a review of some of them below) have excellent suction power.  This parameter is absolutely not inferior to standard devices.  If necessary, it can be adjusted.  For this, a special switch is displayed on the housing.  The owner can set one of three modes: turbo (the most powerful), medium and, accordingly, minimal. </p><p>  Unfortunately, there were some weaknesses.  These include the duration of work on a single charge.  However, the German manufacturer achieved good results in this criterion, increasing the time interval to 60 minutes, and in some models up to 75 minutes.  For comparison, we note that devices from other manufacturers are equipped with batteries, the energy reserve of which is enough for 35 minutes of operation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bosch cordless vacuum cleaners" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2219439.jpg"></div>

For the past few years, Bosch equipment has been on this list.  There are certain criteria by which a device is selected.  Five of them can be distinguished.  Let's look at them: </p><ul><li>  <em>Design.</em>  Depending on the purpose of the application, these models of vacuum cleaners are produced in different variations.  For example, 2 in 1 devices (Handheld &amp; Handstick) are made in the shape of a cane with a detachable hand part.  Also in the assortment range there are models with a belt, with the help of which the vacuum cleaner is convenient to carry during cleaning on the shoulder. </li><li>  <em>Dust box volume.</em>  For rooms with carpeted floors, it is better to choose models that are equipped with capacious containers or large bags.  For a Bosch vacuum cleaner with a vertical design, developers use dust collectors with a volume of 0.3 liters or more. </li><li>  <em>Equipment.</em>  Before purchasing, it is recommended to pay attention to the nozzles.  For example, a rotating brush can easily cope with a lot of dirt. </li><li>  <em>Duration of work.</em>  Given that the vacuum cleaners in question are equipped with batteries, buyers should pay attention to its capacity.  For example, the duration of continuous operation can be either 16 min (a hand-held vacuum cleaner Bosch BHN20110) or 75 min (Bosch BBHMOVE1N).  The last copy is perfect for cleaning large areas. </li><li>  <em>Features of the room.</em>  Using a vacuum cleaner, you can clean surfaces of any type, but not all models provide this.  Before buying, it is worth exploring the capabilities of the device in order to clean not only the floor, but also corners, furniture, carpets. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Features </h2><p>  What features do Bosch cordless vacuum cleaners have?  First of all, pay attention to filtering.  Since these devices are designed to absorb dust, it is very important what type of air purification is used by the manufacturer.

Vacuum cleaners are equipped with both disposable cellulose and reusable filters made of fluoroplastic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Most vertical models have a plastic container as a dust bag.  It, unlike a bag, is easily cleaned of debris.  Transparent material allows you to easily monitor the degree of contamination, which favorably affects the suction power. </p><p>  The most convenient are 2-in-1 designs. They have the usual shape of the case, but are complemented by a portable vacuum cleaner (manual).  The advantages of such models are undeniable.  The manual part is quite small, so it is ideal for cleaning in inaccessible places. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bosch gas cordless vacuum cleaner" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2219442.jpg"></div>
