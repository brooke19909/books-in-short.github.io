This applies to communication, entertainment, information transfer, data.  Even obtaining loans today can be done on the Internet.  Do not know how?  Service “Zaymer”, reviews of which we will publish in this article, is engaged in issuing loans online!  In a way, this is a unique project that greatly simplifies the life of many borrowers.  Read on for how it works. </p><h2>  About service </h2><p>  The principle of operation of the Seimer is extremely simple.  A project based on a website has been created where the client has the opportunity to order a microloan for himself.  He simply chooses the loan amount, its term, and then submits an application.  In it, of course, the client is obliged to inform the company of his data (passport, as well as confirm the phone number) so that he can be identified. </p>

    <p>  In automatic mode, the site evaluates a person as a potential borrower and, in the end, determines whether it is possible to provide him a given loan or not. </p><p>  Reviews about Zaimer.ru indicate that the company approves most of the submitted loan applications, so each client has a great chance to get his money for the purposes that interest him. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A large number of ways to withdraw funds, an ever-increasing credit limit, full automation of the process - these are just the main of the most obvious advantages of the service.  Read more about this below. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  This model of work has a lot of advantages, which is why so many people use it.  In particular, the first is accessibility.  As already indicated, Zaymer (reviews confirm this) approves the majority of applications for a loan.  In numerical terms, this indicator is approximately 90% of loans issued, and only 10% - in denied.  Agree, this is a rather high ratio even for a <span>microfinance organization.</span>  Such simplicity in obtaining a loan allows you to use the service, say, in those situations where there is a need for urgent attraction of money from the outside.  Let's say you need to pay for an urgent trip to the dentist, make an unplanned purchase, pay off a debt, and so on.  The second thing to note regarding this is the ability to fix your credit history. </p>

    <p>  Customer reviews about Zaymer indicate that it allows you to get a loan even to those who have some problems with previous lenders.  In particular, it is enough to take three small loans here to get a positive mark in your history and use loans in the future. </p><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__0-vn-module__7do"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__1-vn-module__7do"></div><div class="vn-player" style="box-sizing: border-box; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; z-index: 0; margin: auto;"><div style="position: absolute; top: 0px; right: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px; font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; text-align: center;"><iframe height="100%" width="100%" hspace="0" vspace="0" marginleft="0" marginright="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay" sandbox="allow-forms allow-same-origin allow-pointer-lock allow-scripts allow-popups allow-top-navigation" src="about:blank" style="position: relative; z-index: 1; width: 100%; height: 100%; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border: none; overflow: hidden; max-width: initial; max-height: initial;" class="vn-container-iframe"></iframe></div></div></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Receiving funds </h2><p>  Another advantage that the Zaymer service possesses (reviews appeal to it not least) is the ability to receive money as soon as possible in any form available on the Internet.  And this, as you know, removes any restrictions on what time of day and where exactly the funds will be issued.  Even at night, everyone has the opportunity to get a loan. </p><p>  In particular, the client himself chooses how funds will be issued to him.  In the list of those listed on the Zaymer website (the reviews of which we are primarily interested), there are such methods of obtaining funds as transferring to a Visa / MasterCard card, withdrawing to Yandex.Money wallet, to a bank account, as well as cash payment through the “Contact” system.  As you can see, these options should be quite enough for any operation. </p>

    <h2>  Repayment of a credit </h2><p>  In addition to the variety of ways to receive funds, customer reviews about Zaymer indicate that there are also many options for making money when paying off debt.  If you believe the information on the official website, there are even more of them than options for obtaining funds, since here you also added payment through terminals and using the Qiwi system, as well as with Webmoney, which makes working with the company more convenient. </p><p>  Interest for working with a loan is calculated on a daily basis, depending on how many days you use the loan.  As the reviews on OOO Saymer show, the company allows for the possibility of early repayment of debt.  Therefore, it will be even better for you: if, for example, you made an urgent purchase and soon received a salary, then it is more profitable for you to pay off your debt ahead of schedule and thus reduce the total cost of the loan. </p><h2>  Application Procedure </h2>

    <p>  If you are interested in the service and would like to get a loan here, it is quite simple to do.  First you need to go to the official website “Zaymer”.  The reviews about Zaymer that we managed to find show that further work with the resource is very simple and understandable.  On the left you will see a slider with which you need to determine how much money you would like to receive.  Next, you need to select the period for which you need money, and click the application button. </p><p>  Your next step will be to fill out passport data (so that the system can analyze you as a potential borrower), and then confirm your phone number via SMS. </p><p>  The last action, by the way, has a dual nature: firstly, with its help, the user identifies himself through binding to the number;  and secondly, the introduction of the code that came in the message on the site will mean an agreement with the conditions for obtaining a loan and formal “signing” of the contract by the borrower.  By the way, there is information on this on the resource, so the company will evaluate this action (legally) just like that. </p><h2>  Next steps </h2><p>  After you have received a message and done everything that is necessary from you, an SMS alert will come in which it will be said whether you received a loan or not.  This is the company's decision, which is final. </p>

    <p>  Although the service description page says that they approve of 90% of the submitted applications, in fact there are also reviews about the Zymer complaints.  The types of microloans that people took that complain about the refusal, of course, do not indicate.  It may be that a person with a reputation of zero (to whom, according to the conditions, can be issued no more than 5 thousand) filed an application for the issue of 15 000 rubles, which is why he was not lucky.  In fact, there are many such situations: someone who has a bad credit history will not be given more than 1000 (if the client was not served in this office). </p><p>  However, if you approved the loan, and everything is fine with you, you can receive funds and dispose of them in the future as you like.  It is important that when choosing non-cash (or electronic) withdrawal forms, you can be sure that you will receive money literally in a matter of seconds.  This, in turn, opens up great opportunities for you as a borrower: you can pay by card in the store, or you can get everything in cash.  This is the main charm of the company "Saymer".  Reviews, at least on this, make a special emphasis. </p><h2>  Credit history </h2><p>  Another important nuance worth paying attention to is your story as a borrower.  If you have ever taken a loan, you should know that there is a special register that contains all the information about you as a person who owes money to a banking institution.  This is a true database available to all banks;  and it is conducted by different companies.  It is called the “Credit Bureau.” </p><p>  The essence of this category is that if you make a delay in a loan or, say, were unable to pay off your debts, your reputation with other banks deteriorates automatically.  That is, you should not rely on obtaining a loan again.  This is the main problem of people who have had some kind of violation when working with banks. </p>

    <p>  But the Zaymer service helps these clients, allowing them to correct their credit history.  For this, even a whole program has been developed that starts with a 1000-ruble loan.  So, if the client returns these funds (the minimum registration period is 5 days), then the next step is to offer him a doubling of the credit limit (and its growth up to 2 thousand).  Again, returning money this time, the client from the company gets the opportunity to take another 3000 rubles.  Only after that the borrower gets the opportunity to apply for a loan of up to 15 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Conditions </h2><p>  Interestingly, the company's website describes the advantages of working with Zaymer, the specifics of the procedure for obtaining and repaying a loan, but there is little information on the conditions (specifically) for a loan.  After analyzing the reviews describing the loan from Saymer, we can come to the following conclusion: the loan amount here, as already noted, starts at 1000 and ends with 15 thousand rubles;  the loan term can be a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 30 days.  As for the interest rate, it is determined for new customers at 2.34% (per day), while verified users have the opportunity to take a loan (at best) at 0.95% (per day of using borrowed funds). </p><p>  The conditions under which Zaymer operates, as we see, are not much different from what other <span>microfinance organizations</span> offer their clients <span>.</span>  This becomes clearer when you open the catalog of such companies and see all the generalized information on this subject. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Regarding what people write about the company, everything is quite clear.  Mostly, you can find complaints about high interest rates from those who took a loan at Zaymer.  Customer reviews, which were less fortunate for the reason that they have not been given a loan, describe the office on the negative side, noting the opaque selection conditions and the lack of explanation of why their profile was not chosen as the borrower. </p>
