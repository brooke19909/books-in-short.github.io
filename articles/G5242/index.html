  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Jem Sultan, son of Mehmed II: biography, photo</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Jem Sultan, whose years of life is 1459-1495, is also known under a different name: Zizim.  He participated in the struggle for the Ottoman throne with his brother Bayazid.  Having been defeated, he spent many years in foreign countries as a hostage.  He was a very educated person, wrote poetry and was engaged in translations. </p><h2>  The beginning of the biography </h2><p>  Jem is the son of Sultan <span>Mehmed II</span> and the princess from Serbia, who was supposedly called icek Hatun.  From a young age he already took part in many battles, where he distinguished himself with his courage.  Jem, like all his brothers, received a very good education.  He studied natural sciences, history and geography, and was also known as a poet and translator. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jam sultan" class="if uuid-2552777" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2552777.jpg"></div><p>  When Jem was 8 years old, Mr. Karaman was transferred to his administration.  After his elder brother and governor Mustafa died, in 1472 he became the Baylerbay of Anatolia, a Turkish province.  In 1481, after the sudden death of his father, a power struggle began between Jem and his brother Bayazid. </p><p>  At that time, both of them controlled a number of provinces.  In the sofa (the authority in the <span>Ottoman Empire, which</span> operated in the absence of the Sultan), each of the brothers had approximately equal supporters.  One of Jem's supporters was the great vizier Karamani Mahmoud.  He believed that it was his Mehmed II who wanted to see on the throne.  But the vizier was killed by the Janissaries, who supported the older brother. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Flight from brother </h2><p>  Jem-Sultan, whose photo is given in the article, had to flee to Egypt to the Mamluk ruler Kaitbey.  Jem's only daughter, AIChE, was married to his son.  There he received an offer from Bayazid to leave the claim to the throne, having received 1 million acre.  To which Jem refused and began to assemble an army.  However, by the time everything was ready for the invasion, the elder brother's troops already completely controlled the border between the countries. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ugur274.deviantart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sultan Bayazid II" class="if uuid-2552772" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2552772.jpg"></div><p>  Jem Sultan again had to take flight.  Leaving his family in Egypt, he went to the master of the Order of Malta, whose residence at that time was on the island of Rhodes.  In case of support, the knights were offered: </p><ul><li>  Non-aggression agreement. </li><li>  Duty free trade. </li><li>  Access to all imperial ports. </li><li>  Transfer of islands in the Aegean Sea captured by the Turks. </li><li>  The release of Christian hostages in the amount of 300 people. </li><li>  Payment of 150 thousand crowns. </li></ul><p>  But the master did not flatter himself on Jem's promises and began negotiations with Bayazid on the redemption of his younger brother by the head.  But Bayezid sent killers to Jem Sultan. </p><h2>  Hostage </h2><p>  Under the pressure of Europe, the master sent Jem to France, in conclusion, to the castle of Burganef, belonging to the order.  As a contender for the throne in the <span>Ottoman Empire,</span> Jem Sultan was a very profitable figure for Christian countries.  In exchange for their help, he promised an eternal peace with Europe.  In addition, the threat of a rebellious brother returning to his homeland forced Bayazid to temporarily stop preparations for the invasion of the Balkans. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="ivanchristian.deviantart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Order of the Hospitallers" class="if uuid-2552808" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2552808.jpg"></div><p>  The knights were offered a large sum of 40 thousand ducats for keeping the applicant to the throne of the Ottoman Empire away from its borders.  And then the bidding for the tidbit began, which was organized by the Knights Hospitallers.  By intrigue, a valuable hostage was obtained by Pope Innocent VIII, who transported him to Rome in 1489.  And Master Aubusson got the rank of cardinal. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  According to some sources, Jem had a good time in a foreign land.  He acted like a real prince and was known as a ladies man.  This is largely due to the exotic appearance for the Turk, which he possessed.  The prince was tall, had blond hair and blue eyes.  Although it is believed that the authenticity of none of his portraits to date is not proven. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dynastology.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pope Innocent VIII" class="if uuid-2552805" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2552805.jpg"></div><p>  Other sources report that Jem was clumsy, like an elephant, slept a lot and was lazy.  But it is known for certain that the prince made friendship with Juan Borgia, the son of a pontiff, and with him led a life that was appropriate not for a hostage, but for a prince. </p><h2>  Death </h2><p>  In 1495, the French King Charles VIII invaded Italy.  His goal was the return of Naples to the rule of his crown.  This was stated in the manifesto, which the king sent to the pope.  In case of resistance, he threatened to capture Rome and remove the pontiff.  One of Karl‚Äôs requirements for Alexander VI was the extradition of the Jem Sultan, who could lead a crusade against co-religionists.  After the siege of Rome, the pope was forced to do this on certain conditions.  While traveling to Naples, in February 1495, Jem passed away.  There are several versions about the causes of his death: </p><ol><li>  Dysentery. </li><li>  Cold. </li><li>  Poisoning on the orders of Pope Alexander VI. </li><li>  Murder in another way. </li></ol><p>  Bayazid declared national mourning for his dead brother, he demanded to give out the ashes, but they managed to bury Jem only after 4 years.  His grave is located in the city of Bursa, which he once dreamed of making the capital of Anatolia.  The prince had five children from three women. </p>
