But this time was enough for travelers from all over the world to fall in love with this amazing tropical island.  The Thai government had to make a lot of efforts to create such an infrastructure that could satisfy tourists with a wide variety of needs.  The island has many beaches and bays, covered with white sand.  They are washed by the turquoise <span>Andaman Sea.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Patong Lodge Hotel" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1083526.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Phuket Holidays </h2><p>  This Thai island is not only very beautiful, but also unusual.  Phuket is definitely worth a visit, especially for those who want to diversify their vacation.  If tourists do not like the noisy Bangkok or Pattaya, then it is better to immediately go to this island.  The fact that Phuket is an exceptional place is also evidenced by the numerous reviews left by those who have already been here. </p><p>  The island, which is called the pearl of the Andaman coast, is the largest in Thailand.  It is connected to the mainland by a dam.  Nearly eighty percent of Phuket‚Äôs territory is rainforests, which, combined with waterfalls, coconut plantations, luxurious beaches and the azure sea, have made the island an ideal holiday destination.  Phuket has several famous beaches.  Among them is the famous Laguna Beach, where wealthy people who come from all over the world spend their time, and where there are five-star luxury hotels of many hotel chains. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another beach - Surin - retained the atmosphere of a traditional Thai village.  In recent years, it has become popular with tourists.  The pristine beauty of Kamala Beach is great for solitude and relaxation.  It houses cozy three- and four-star hotels, in which there is everything you need to relax.  The <span>Phuket FantaSea</span> amusement park, famous throughout Thailand, is located on this stretch of coast <span>.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Patong Lodge Hotel 3" class="if" height="188" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1083532.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Patong </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews, it is the most crowded beach in Phuket.  There are hotels for every taste and budget, including guesthouses, a large selection of restaurants and bars, massage parlors, discos, etc. The island's nightlife is right here - on Bangla Road.  That is why Patong is even nicknamed "Little Pattaya."  Those who are looking for peace and solitude to relax in a corner untouched by civilization will not like it here.  And although the prices for services or entertainment in Patong are an order of magnitude higher than in the rest of Phuket, nevertheless, huge armies of tourists come here. </p><p>  The choice of hotels here is huge: these are real five-star ‚Äúpalaces‚Äù and small apartments for budget vacationers.
