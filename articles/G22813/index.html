    <p>  Most of the tourists in their reviews note the friendly and friendly staff, clean rooms, good functionality in the rooms and a restrained style.  Among the minuses are poor sound insulation, rare interruptions with the Internet, as well as poor views from some rooms.  In general, if you choose the best hotels in Krasnoyarsk, you should look at this hero, because there are much more positive sides. </p><h2>  Hilton garden inn </h2><p>  Hilton has long been famous for its magnificent hotels, spread over all corners of our planet.  Located in the heart of Krasnoyarsk, the hotel impresses with its refined style, as well as comfortable rooms equipped with everything necessary for an amazing vacation.  The hotel has 259 rooms, where each traveler will find a room for a certain budget and preference.  Categories range from standard to luxury, impressive in layout and luxury.  As for the equipment, the rooms are equipped with a comfortable bed, a 37-inch TV, air conditioning, free Wi-Fi and other useful accessories. </p><p>  To draw a more vivid impression of the hotel, it is worth giving guest reviews.  Initially, we start with the minuses, since they are much smaller.  Firstly, the tenants are somewhat overshadowed by the operation of air conditioners in the rooms, which cool them poorly.  Secondly, slow elevators, of which you have to wait a long time.  Finally, magnetic keys often break, which is unpleasant.  The rest is all at the highest level: friendly staff, who do not charge extra for small children, excellent breakfast dishes, good beds, as well as perfect cleanliness of the rooms.  When choosing hotels in Krasnoyarsk, take a look at Hilton. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>
