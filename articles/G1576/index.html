These were mainly kids and teenagers of the city.  The Palace of Culture is considered to be the property not of a district, but of an urban scale. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mir76.ru" data-author=": " data-source="https://mir76.ru/news/dvorec-kultury-neftyanik-priglashaet-na-programmu-posvyaschennuyu-dnyu-rossiyskogo-kino/"><img itemprop="image" alt="The first in the city of recreation center Neftyanikov" class="if uuid-2452964" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2452964.jpg"></div><p>  There are all kinds of sections, clubs, circles in order to interest even the most picky.  And not only managers took care of the young.  In a modern roomy hall with 800 seats, musical evenings for those who are older are held. </p><h2>  All the world, all the people ... </h2><p>  Half a century ago, it was not immediately in the new district of the ancient city, but it was decided to build a leisure center - the Neftyanik recreation center in Yaroslavl.  The construction of the building made of glass and concrete was attended by professional builders "Yarneftekhimstroy" and other employees of the organization, going to extraordinary subbotniks and Sundays.  Supported by colleagues and employees of Slavneft-Yaroslavnefteorgsintez.  Only in 2003, the Palace of Culture became municipal property. </p><h2>  Kids everywhere we have a road </h2><p>  Basically, the modern leadership of the DC "Oilman" in Yaroslavl focuses on kids from 3 years old and adolescents.  This is the most vulnerable part of modern society.  It is for them that dance and developing circles, musical groups were created, classes in fine arts, singing, gymnastics are held, there is a chess section. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But the older generation of citizens is still not forgotten.  The music festival "Jazz over the Volga" is regularly held in the Palace of Culture, music concerts are organized and performances of touring theaters are staged. </p><div class="photo" data-original="city-yaroslavl.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The palace welcomes guests" class="if uuid-2452966" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2452966.jpg"></div><p>  In the building of the Palace of Culture "Oilman" of Yaroslavl, mass events are held: city games of KVN teams, dance festivals, city reporting performances of creative groups.  The building has a cinema "Oil". </p><p>  The recreation center is open from 9-00 to 18-00.  The schedule includes a lunch break, but often study and games are so carried away that both students and teachers forget to eat lunch. </p><h2>  And for future generations </h2><p>  Near the palace of culture there is a small park where citizens, residents of nearby houses like to spend free time.  In the park of the recreation center "Neftyanik" of Yaroslavl, well-groomed territory, a clean pond with ducks that can be fed, many playgrounds and attractions - all this makes the rest not only useful, but also enjoyable.  For lovers of boat trips, there is a rental of boats and catamarans. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yar.gorko.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wedding place" class="if uuid-2452971" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2452971.jpg"></div><p>  The trend of the last decades is visiting wedding registrations.  Yaroslavl newlyweds began to choose this park as the place for the ceremony in the warm season. </p><p>  In winter, an urban ice rink is poured here, a ski track is laid, and ice towns are built.  Any miracle, any joy can be created with your own hands. </p><p>  In 2018, most citizens voted to reconstruct their favorite vacation spot.  The plans include replacing the cover of walking paths, clearing the area of ‚Äã‚Äãdebris, cleaning the pond, tidying up children's attractions, installing new benches for leisure walkers and many more pleasant things. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="57.58101300000001" data-lng="39.84917399999995" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/2/9/7/3/2973.png"></div><p>  The first in the city of Neftyanik recreation center in Yaroslavl has a simple address: 92, Moskovsky Prospekt. There is a public transport stop 50 meters from the building, and there is parking for personal cars.  You can get from any area by trolley, bus, minibus. </p>
