    <h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  Interesting sights can please tourists in Tajikistan.  The city of Kulyab is known for the unique mountain Khoja Mumin, which is located only 22 kilometers from it.  The mountain consists of multi-colored crystals of salt.  In its place, millions of years ago, the waves of the ancient Tethys Sea splashed.  Salt was constantly deposited on the seabed.  They, in turn, were pressed by shifting rocks.  As a result, the salt lay in layers in one place and gradually formed a natural column.  Then the deposits spread a little to the sides, and we got a real mountain.  Today, the dome of the salt mountain rises almost a kilometer above the surface, and 4 more go into the bowels of the earth. </p>
