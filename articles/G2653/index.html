  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A difficult choice: which modem is the best?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Each of us sooner or later faces a problem when it is necessary to connect the Internet in an apartment or change outdated or outdated equipment.  At the same time, each of us probably asked ourselves the question: which modem should be chosen so that it lasts as long as possible, while allowing us to avoid interruptions in connecting to the World Wide Web? </p><p>  A clear answer to the question "which modem is the best?"  Today, no, since most manufacturers supply truly reliable and high-quality products that meet all the necessary international standards and make it possible to provide a high-speed and uninterrupted Internet connection.  Therefore, to ask which <span>adsl modem is</span> better, we consider it inappropriate, and we suggest that you solve this problem from the other end. </p><p>  First of all, you must decide what you want from your modem.  So instead of pestering sellers with the question of which modem is the best, tell them about your requirements.  To do this, try to answer a few simple questions. </p><p>  Question one: do you need a modem or just a router?  As a rule, most newcomers, having heard the newfangled word ‚Äúrouter‚Äù, begin to think that the device that allows them to connect to the Internet via ADSL is called a router.  In fact, a router is just a device that organizes your local network, while you need an ADSL modem.  However, an adsl modem can also have a router function, allowing you to connect multiple computers at the same time.  It also happens the other way around: thinking that they only need a router, unenlightened buyers torment computer sellers with questions about modems.  So before you figure out which modem is the best, find out if you're looking. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Question two: are you going to connect computers to the Internet using the Wi-Fi wireless data protocol?  If so, be sure to pay attention to whether the device you are purchasing has this function.  Quite often, in recommendations for buying a modem, you can read that you need to find out which of the standards the modem supports, but this requirement is obsolete, since most modern modems support all existing standards at the same time, so there is no need to check for compliance with the protocol of your device. </p><p>  Question three: which operator are you going to be serviced with?  Knowing the company with which you intend to cooperate, you can find out which modems its representatives recommend, and also try to purchase a modem directly from the company - as a rule, you can buy it from the provider a little cheaper than in a regular computer store, or even get it for free on one of the many promotions held by Internet providers.  In addition, if you purchase a modem to use the services of a provider operating throughout the country, you can find a modem specially adapted for this service provider - it will contain all the necessary settings, and you just need to enter your login and password. </p><p>  Since, as we have already said, there is no unequivocal opinion about which modem is the best, we also advise you to consult with sellers of computer equipment to help you understand the features of a particular device, as well as select the option that suits you best in price and quality.  It is worth remembering that although the principle of ‚Äúbest quality for a lot of money‚Äù works in this area, you should not buy the most expensive modem in a shop window - often it will be enough for you to pay only half its cost and get a completely suitable device.  Among the most common manufacturers of modems, which differ in the optimal ratio of price and quality, one can distinguish D-Link, TP-Link, Asus, Zyxel. </p>
