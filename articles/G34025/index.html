Until 1997, its capital was the city of Almaty, the largest city in the region.  Its population now almost reached the mark of two million people.  Many of them need their own housing, but city property prices bite.  Therefore, many prefer to buy houses in the cottage towns of Almaty, located if not within the city, then in the immediate vicinity. </p><h2>  Obvious choice </h2><p>  Almaty is a large, hectic city located in the hot climate zone of the mainland.  Because of this, many prefer to choose housing in the best environmental conditions, where it is possible to breathe fresh air, rather than the polluted atmosphere of the metropolis.  Therefore, they are eyeing the cottage towns of Almaty with ready-made townhouses, cottages, land plots in them with the ability to build a house on their own project.  Housing prices in such towns are much lower than in the city itself, which makes purchasing affordable. </p><h2>  Town "Karasu" </h2><p>  In the northern part of the city, in the Alatau district, the cottage town "Karasu" is located.  In Almaty there is a microdistrict of the same name, in the depths of which a building place was allocated.  There are no large industrial enterprises, which guarantees the purchase of housing in the fresh air.  In this town can live not only those who want to buy or build their own house, but also those who do not want to change the usual way of life in a city apartment.  We offer for sale apartments in 232 townhouses with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãup to 77 square meters, having their own small plot of land.  Those who want to change their lifestyle can live in houses up to 154 square meters, which relies 3 acres of land. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="vse.kz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The town of Karasu" class="if uuid-3201215" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/3201215.jpg"></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  This project, like many cottage towns in Almaty, provides for the improvement of the internal territory in the form of arrangement of parking lots, playgrounds.  All the necessary objects of social infrastructure: school, kindergarten, pharmacy, shops, hairdressers, shopping centers - are within walking distance from the town.  Transport accessibility of the town allows its residents to quickly get their own or public transport from the city center or any of its areas.  Nearby is a major highway - North Ring Street. </p><h2>  Town "Zhana Kuat" </h2><p>  The cottage town "Zhana Kuat" in Almaty is located north of the city, next to the village of Pokrovka and the village of Otegen Batyra.  You can get to it via the Ili or Kuldzhinsky tracts both on personal and public transport.  The distance from the center of Almaty is eighteen kilometers, which will take about 25 minutes on the way. </p><div class="photo" data-original="krisha.kz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jana quat" class="if uuid-3201218" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/3201218.jpg"></div><p>  In this cozy place you can buy an apartment in a townhouse of various sizes, a ready-made cottage or purchase a land plot and build your own house on your own project.  All necessary engineering communications are brought to the town: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  central gas supply and sewerage; </li><li>  main and reserve wells; </li><li>  the Internet; </li><li>  TV; </li><li>  city ‚Äã‚Äãtelephone line. </li></ul><p>  There are kindergartens near the town.  But the territory development project also provides for the construction of two comprehensive schools, a kindergarten, children's playgrounds and sports grounds.  Within walking distance there are the necessary shops, pharmacies, studios and cafes. </p><p>  For a more comfortable stay in this cottage town developed internal rules of residence.  They include the appearance of houses, restrictions on the height of the fences, the presence of strangers at night, noise control, fire safety rules. </p><h2>  Town "Tau Samal" </h2><p>  The cottage town ‚ÄúTau Samal‚Äù in Almaty is located in the southwestern part of the city, near the streets of Chaliapin and Baiken Ashimov.  It is a microdistrict of six streets parallel to each other, built up by three- and four-level cottages with adjoining sections of 2 hundred square meters.  The houses are built of bricks, which ensures their durability and excellent sound insulation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Tau Samal" class="if uuid-3201213" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/3201213.jpg"></div><p>  Like many cottage towns of Almaty, Tau Samal is fenced around the perimeter with a high fence, the entry of vehicles is controlled by a security point, and streets are patrolled.  All houses in the town are equipped with video surveillance and alarm systems.  Guests are also not easy to get to the territory of the town, for this you will have to get permission.  In terms of security this town offers the best option. </p><p>  The developer foresaw the needs of residents in social infrastructure facilities by building a school, a kindergarten, and a beauty salon.  Within walking distance are still schools, shopping centers, cafes and shops.  The town took its place in the elite housing area, so the developer‚Äôs proposals are in line with the environment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="krisha.kz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kazakh &quot;America&quot;" class="if uuid-3201214" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/3201214.jpg"></div><h2>  Town "Dostyk" </h2><p>  The cottage town "Dostyk" in Almaty is located a little north of the town "Tau Samal", on Sabdenova Street.  Nauryzbaisky district of the city is considered the most promising place for acquiring housing built up with luxury real estate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.odome.kz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Town Dostyk" class="if uuid-3201220" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/3201220.jpg"></div><p>  The developer has built 144 cottages, each of which is allocated a land area of ‚Äã‚Äã8.5 acres.  All buildings according to the standard design with facades of bright colors.  Asphalt streets, all the necessary engineering communications, spacious beautiful houses, round-the-clock security, playgrounds, car wash - all this speaks in favor of acquiring housing in this particular town. </p><p>  The distance from the city allows you to live in the fresh air, and the proximity to highways - quickly get to work in the metropolis or on their own business. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Above you can see photos of the described towns.  And there are a lot of reviews about them, as they are already built and populated.  Among them, there are practically no negative ones, since the standard of living offered by all developers of the above cottage towns is not lower than in the city.  And the opportunity to live in the immediate vicinity of the metropolis, but in the fresh air, to have your own plot and place to relax - all this makes life in towns even more prestigious. </p>
