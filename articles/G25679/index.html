    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  The hotel has three buildings for visiting tourists: a five-story main with fifty-five beautiful rooms and two others - two-story, economy class, where each contains twenty-two rooms are simpler, but also calm and quite comfortable.  In addition, the Bospor Hotel (Anapa) has an excellent conference hall, very convenient for business tourism and also with amazing sea views. </p><p>  It is possible to hold coffee breaks and business meetings.  Hotel "Bospor" (Anapa) also willingly organizes celebrations in the restaurant at the hotel, which is beautifully decorated in antique style and has seventy seats.  The restaurant's kitchens are European and Russian, with a wide range of dishes on the menu. </p><h2>  For children and adults </h2><p>  Families with children of different ages willingly stop here, as pastime is organized by varied, first-class service and all kinds of help from the hotel staff vacationing parents receive at their first request.  Hotel "Bospor" (Anapa) is famous for its attentive attitude to the needs of guests. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the fifth floor of the main building there is a viewing platform with a panoramic view, where you can explore the whole city by the sea in detail and with pleasure.  Here is one of the quietest places in the city, and many guests thank the Bospor Hotel (Anapa) for a relaxing stay. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Especially often they write about the advantages of a five-story building, where the rooms are of an improved layout, with modern fixtures and beautiful interiors.  Bed linen serves quality and not a single sign of decay - almost new and always very clean. </p><p>  The daily and very high-quality cleaning of rooms was extremely pleasing to the cleanliness of guests, and constantly replenishing hygiene products - toilet paper, soap, shampoo, gel - speak of the hotel's vigilant attention to its guests.  Despite the fact that ‚ÄúBospor‚Äù is a 3 * hotel, Anapa can not always offer the best service even in four-star hotels. </p>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Very good nutrition is noted in almost all reviews.  The organization of the buffet is the highest praise.  The diet is rich: yogurts, omelets, pancakes, dumplings, sour cream, pastries, cheeses, sausages and sausages, chicken, fish, beef, lamb, jams, preserves, condensed milk, vegetables, both fresh and baked, a variety of sauces.  Everything is always fresh and tasty. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Many visitors on vacation "Bospor" (3 * hotel, Anapa) resembles the same hotels in Turkey.  There are a lot of reviews, and it will be correct if dry official information is interspersed in this article with live stories of tourists about the time spent here. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  As noted above, the ancient lighthouse is located nearby, with which the 3 * Bospor Hotel (Russia, Anapa) is connected by trails.  Anapa is a cultural recreation center, a resort town, and like all of them is noisy, but it is here - its absolutely quiet corner.  I can‚Äôt even believe that this is the central part of the resort town.  The beach is also one of the most convenient - with small pebbles, at Malaya Bay.  Any sea swam bathing is not scary.  Walking trails lead to the beautiful promenade and the museum, and if you go a little further along the streets, you can visit the city markets. </p><p>  Stairs are laid to the sea, but many use the elevator, which is very convenient for people of age or for some health reasons who cannot walk for a long time.  Even large companies that come on vacation greatly praise the Bospor Hotel (Anapa).  The address for those who want to join the regulars of these places: 1 Krepostnaya street.  The hotel room can be chosen simply without looking - any.  The views from the windows are magnificent - at least at sea, at least at the city, according to the guests in the reviews.  The hotel does not smoke, animals are also not accepted guests.  Peace unbroken ... </p>

Moreover, it is noted in the reviews that he is friendly not because it is a duty of service, but because the desire to help comes from the depths of the heart - such people.  It is very easy to distinguish.  All the smallest problems and issues were resolved very quickly.  Everyone is good at work: administrators, maids, and technical staff.  That is why foreigners like to stay here: even at the airport they write in notebooks how good Anapa city is.

    <h2>  More advantages </h2><p>  On the fifth floor of the main building there is a pool for vacationers, which serves as an excellent bonus for those who are not used to the southern sun.  In the early days, it is very pleasant to get the first gentle tan on a sunbed or deck chair for free, from time to time hiding under an umbrella and admiring beautiful views of the sea distances. </p><p>  The conference hall has already been said.  you can add only that the capacity of this hall is sixty people on forty square meters.  It offers office easels (flipcharts), a marker board, an LCD projector with a screen, sound equipment, microphones.  There are long-distance communications and wireless Internet.  Many book a hall not for business meetings, but for a banquet, they are satisfied.  Although spending the evening at the Bospor Restaurant is much more attractive. </p><h2>  A restaurant </h2><p>  Own restaurant "Bospor" is located on the seashore.  The chef is just excellent, very often makes exclusive offers, but even without them the local cuisine is famous throughout the district.  The restaurant has sixty seats, not counting the bar.  The music is lively, but there is television and the Internet for those who are bored about it. </p><p>  The reviews of the restaurant menu and the execution of dishes are described by a purely enthusiastic, separate topic.  Everyone likes it very much, since it is better not to find a place for gatherings in comfort on warm evenings.  The price tag is very pleasant, it is clearly below quality, because the food is amazingly tasty.  The restaurant staff is polite and helpful.  Portions that could not be mastered, you can easily ask to pack and pick up in the room.  They even rent cutlery and crockery if they bought food for the evening in city shops, which are very numerous around. </p><h2>  Gym and Finnish bath </h2><p>  You can relax here not only by the sea, but also in the Finnish bath, designed for ten visitors at a time.  The bath is small - only thirty square meters.  But in the three rooms allotted for it, in addition to the sauna, guests will find a TV and a pool.  You can lie on sofas, relax after the steam room at the table with friends, thus diversifying your vacation. </p><p>  For those tourists who do not want to relax from sports, the hotel has a gym for five people, which operates from nine in the morning until nine in the evening.  It‚Äôs very convenient to first train your muscles, then visit the Finnish bathhouse, take a dip in the pool, have a tasty lunch at the Bospor restaurant, and then take a walk along the promenade, overlooking either the wild steep beach on one side or the various entertainments of the city on the other.  So you can reach the beaches: it takes seven minutes to pebble, and fifteen minutes to the sandy one. </p>

    <h2>  What is included in the price </h2><p>  In addition to living in a comfortable room, the hotel offers other included bonuses.  This is food, the system of which residents choose themselves: buffet from June to August inclusive, the rest of the time - a comprehensive menu.  Guests from buildings with economy rooms receive only a comprehensive menu, but they can eat from the buffet for an additional fee.  It is not expensive! </p><p>  Free use of the summer pool, safes, fitness equipment, as well as Russian billiards.  For residents in suites in the room free restaurant service.  Free animation service for families with children.  Continuous wireless internet is also available and is included in the room rate for all vacationers.  You can also use the hotel's car park for free.  Children under four years old live and eat for free. </p><h2>  additional charges </h2><p>  Of the hotel's additional services, guests are especially often offered sightseeing services.  Anapa is a beautiful city, all its surroundings are no less good.  Special staff of the hotel will help you to plan a route and contribute to a good rest.  Also, all visitors, almost without exception, use the transfer provided by the hotel: getting from the airport or train station or leaving there after the end of the holiday is much more convenient with transport, which you do not need to worry about separately or separately. </p><p>  Hotel "Bospor" (Anapa) will take care of this.  How to get to the hotel by public transport will be described below.  In addition to the conference hall and restaurant, paid for visitors is the room-service, a sauna, laundry services, as well as all international and long-distance calls.  Extra beds for children after four years of age are given at a discount - from four years to twelve - forty percent, and older - twenty percent of the cost of the main place. </p><h2>  How to get to the hotel </h2><p>  There is a shuttle bus number 3 from <span>Anapa airport</span> to the hotel, which will take guests to the bus station, and a shuttle bus number 10 to the central market follows from the railway station.  After that you need to transfer to any minibus to Krepostnaya Street (taxi number 25, 24, 9, 2).  This will turn out to be somewhat cheaper than a hotel transfer, but much longer and troublesome. </p>
