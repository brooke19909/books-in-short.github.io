Due to the constant use of the Internet, applications and other phone features, users often connect additional paid services.  This brings financial loss to subscribers.  We are ready to help you deal with this issue.  But first, we‚Äôll take a closer look at the value and essence of the proposals. </p><h2>  What are these services? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="webjobposting.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Subscriptions are informative and entertaining." class="if uuid-3132000" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3132000.jpg"></div><p>  Before disabling the subscription to Tele2, you should understand its purpose.  At the moment, the mobile operator offers a large number of options for such services.  Basically, they are informative and entertaining in nature.  As an example, we note the following subscriptions: </p><ol><li>  Weather (the subscriber receives alerts about weather conditions on the street). </li><li>  Jokes (entertaining daily content). </li><li>  News (all reports on Russia and individual cities). </li><li>  Music services (alerts about new music trends). </li></ol><p>  This is the small and most used part of the subscriptions that are available to the subscriber.  They are connected through the targeted use of the telephone functions or through the user's negligence.  Therefore, the question of how to turn off subscriptions to Tele2 remains relevant and in demand among all mobile phone subscribers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Are they paid? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="marketingland.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Subscription fees apply" class="if uuid-3132003" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3132003.jpg"></div><p>  Now we should talk about the issue that relates to the payment of content.  Unfortunately, in most cases it is paid, and the cost can reach 15 rubles per day.  Sometimes users do not notice the connected services, which causes large financial losses.  Moreover, the subscriber can connect an unlimited number of services, which in the future can lead to zero balance.  It is important to know how to disable subscriptions to Tele2 by any means.  But to do this, you need to find out about their availability. </p><h2>  How to find out about connected subscriptions? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="setigid.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="My Tele2 application can solve many problems" class="if uuid-3132008" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3132008.jpg"></div><p>  There are several ways to obtain information about existing content.  To do this, you can use the following options: </p><ol><li>  The application "My Tele2". </li><li>  Call the support operator. </li><li>  Use the USSD command. </li></ol><p>  There are several information sources, so we will analyze each of them individually.  First of all, we‚Äôll use the instructions for the mobile operator‚Äôs application: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  If you do not have it, just open the Play Market or AppStore, and then complete the installation. </li><li>  Launch the application and enter your phone number. </li><li>  Open the main window for working with the program and go to the "Services" item. </li><li>  There you will see full information regarding all paid subscriptions on your phone number. </li></ol><p>  This method is not so simple.  You can use the lightweight option associated with a call to support the company: </p><ol><li>  Activate your mobile phone. </li><li>  Dial 611. </li><li>  Waiting for a response from the operator. </li><li>  Explain to him the whole situation. </li><li>  Waiting for a response. </li></ol><p>  It should be borne in mind that the operator can immediately turn them off at your request.  The main thing is to remind him of this and ask to deactivate all subscriptions.  And if you don‚Äôt feel like wasting time on this, you can use the special USSD command: </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="This is how the team for checking subscriptions looks like" class="if uuid-3132012" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3132012.jpg"></div><ol><li>  Activate your mobile phone. </li><li>  Type the command on it: * 189 #. </li><li>  Receive an SMS listing all active subscriptions. </li></ol><p>  There is nothing complicated in this, just remember all the methods and actively use them.  And we move on to the stage at which we will analyze how to disable subscriptions to Tele2. </p><h2>  Ways to disable paid content </h2><p>  There are several options for deactivating subscriptions.  Among them are the following: </p><ol><li>  Call to the operator. </li><li>  Disconnection through the application "My Tele2". </li><li>  Use a unique subscription identifier. </li></ol><p>  The simplest way is the first method, since to do it it is enough to do the following: </p><ol><li>  Call the operator at 611. </li><li>  Wait for an answer. </li><li>  Ask to disconnect all subscriptions. </li></ol><p>  It takes you only a few minutes and provides a guaranteed result.  More difficult is the second option, which implies the following actions: </p><ol><li>  Launch the application "My Tele2". </li><li>  Go to the "Services" item. </li><li>  Personally disable each paid subscription. </li></ol><p>  This method will take you much longer. </p><p>  You can use the third option.  Instructions for it are as follows: </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="An example of disabling a subscription via SMS" class="if uuid-3132026" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3132026.jpg"></div><ol><li>  Call the operator at 611 and find out about the availability of subscriptions. </li><li>  Request their identifier. </li><li>  Go to the ‚ÄúMessages‚Äù item on your mobile phone. </li><li>  Indicate the number 605 as the recipient. </li><li>  In the text window write: STOP and subscription identifier. </li><li>  Next, send SMS and wait for confirmation of disconnection. </li></ol><p>  Another option to disable the subscription to "Tele2" - using the identifier: </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Example of disabling a subscription via a USSD command" class="if uuid-3132019" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3132019.jpg"></div><ol><li>  Activate your mobile phone. </li><li>  Dial the command on it: * 605 # 0 # identifier number #, click on the call. </li><li>  Waiting for confirmation that the service is disabled. </li></ol><p>  Now you are informed about how to find out the subscriptions to Tele2 and disable them.  But not all issues have been resolved.  It remains to talk about such a feature as ‚ÄúTele2 Theme‚Äù, because of which most subscriptions are connected. </p><h2>  Why is this feature needed? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Example of disabling the &quot;Tele2 Topic&quot; service" class="if uuid-3132035" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3132035.jpg"></div><p>  Subscribers often complain that paid content is being activated due to pop-ups.  They appear due to the presence of the ‚ÄúTele2 Theme‚Äù function, which each time offers users various advertising texts.  It is enough to gently click once on the window that appears - and the content will immediately be in an active state.  To figure out how to disable the subscription to ‚ÄúTele2 Theme‚Äù, just use our instructions: </p><ol><li>  Activate your mobile phone. </li><li>  Dial the command * 152 * 0 #, click on the call. </li><li>  Awaiting confirmation. </li></ol><p>  As you can see, there is nothing complicated about this.  In extreme cases, you can call the operator.  Just do not forget to restart the phone after disconnecting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.incotec-software.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Customer support works around the clock" class="if uuid-3132010" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3132010.jpg"></div><p>  Now you know all the information on how to turn off subscriptions to Tele2 and how to find out about their availability.  It remains only to consolidate the knowledge gained in practice.  In the future, you will no longer pay for negligence and the imposition of the services of a mobile operator. </p>
