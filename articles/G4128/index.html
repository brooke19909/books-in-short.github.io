    <h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Despite the fact that Citrus Waskaduwa 5 * (Sri Lanka) is a new hotel, according to many tourists, the situation is partially in need of repair.  As for the rooms, they are all spacious and stylishly decorated.  True, in some places cracks are already visible on the walls.  Some guests suggest that the fault is not very high quality materials used in the construction of the hotel.  In fact, worry about this is not worth it.  After all, such trifles do not completely spoil the overall impression of the housing stock.  Almost all travelers in their reviews enthusiastically noted the magnificent ocean view opening from the windows of the rooms.  It is very close, so here you will get a unique opportunity, getting up in the morning and opening the balcony door, let in the room the sound of waves and saturated sea air. </p><p>  As for the situation, the rooms have everything you need: modern appliances, comfortable furniture, a safe.  However, according to guests, hotel employees sometimes forgot to bring a bathrobe, slippers and an extra set of towels (if you came with a child).  But it is only necessary to inform about it at the reception how the problem will be solved in the shortest possible time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="citrus waskaduwa 5 reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1612801.jpg" width="600"></div>

So, according to them, maids rarely wipe the dust and almost never look into hard-to-reach places (under the bed, behind the nightstand, etc.).  However, the guests were pleased that every day after cleaning, they find funny figurines of towels in their room.  The maids also leave tangerines and sweets on the pillows of the guests.

    <h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  As many tourists say in their reviews, the Citrus Waskaduwa 5 * hotel is a great place for a relaxing holiday.  There is no daily animation, as, for example, in hotels in Turkey and Egypt.  Instead, guests can stroll through the large and well-groomed hotel grounds, watching the huge lizards and agile badgers, play billiards, relax in the spa, and visit the gym.  The hotel also has an outdoor pool and a sun terrace.  In addition, experienced tourists are advised to visit at least a few excursions.  After all, Sri Lanka is an amazing country with an interesting culture and amazing nature.  You can book a tour both at the hotel reception and at one of the local companies. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  As guests note, from the hotel to the ocean you can literally walk in a couple of minutes with an unhurried step.  The beach here is quite spacious, few people.  Please note that you are unlikely to swim in the ocean in the truest sense of the word because of the constant waves.  Therefore, to enter the water will turn out only waist-high.  But tourists are happy to jump in the waves.  Experienced travelers also warn that it is not worth leaving things unattended on the beach, because it is public.  Therefore, to protect yourself from theft, it is advisable to constantly be on the alert. </p>
