    <h2>  Choosing an image and preparing for work </h2><p>  If it was decided to make a hedgehog costume with your own hands, first you need to think about the overall design and sensibly assess your capabilities.  If you have a purchased kit, but do not like it or do not fit, you can modify it a little.  The costume may consist of a ready-made jumpsuit decorated with soft or cardboard needles, a hat and additional paraphernalia, such as apples, baskets, autumn leaves.  More experienced seamstresses can prepare clothes for a hedgehog from scratch by carefully cutting out a jacket, pants and a shirt. </p><p>  We suggest considering several options for creating such a kit.  The first method is suitable even for those who can‚Äôt sew at all.  To create a designer image you will need a sewing machine, skills of similar work and some additional materials. </p><h2>  Preparation for work </h2><p>  Before proceeding with the manufacture of the outfit, you need to consider several points: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  kids are very mobile, so it‚Äôs worth giving up heavy and bulky suits; </li><li>  if there is overalls or pajamas of suitable colors, it is worth using ready-made clothes, making only accessories and a "fur coat"; </li><li>  Sewing is easiest from soft, non-loose fabrics, such as thin fleece or plush; </li><li>  in addition to fabric, baskets, apples and mushrooms, to create an image you will need a special make-up that is safe for children. </li></ul><p>  If a suit is needed for a girl, then instead of panties and overalls, you can sew a simple "peasant" dress with an apron.  Then the fur coat of the future hedgehog is fixed on the cape and supplemented with a prickly hat. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself hedgehog costume" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15171/336633.jpg?1392520296317" width="291"></div>

    <h2>  Create a hat and needles </h2><p>  You should start crafting a hedgehog costume by making a special hat.  To do this, you need to take an old, but suitable in size cap or panama child.  If a baseball cap has been selected, the visor must be cut off from it, if the hat is to separate the fields.  It is necessary to prepare a piece of fabric with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 50 cm <sup>2</sup> .  The color is selected in accordance with the conceived shade of the suit.  It can be gray, black, brown or terracotta <span>fabric.</span>  <span>The fabric is</span> cut into rectangles three to five centimeters wide.  Each such blank must be cut across, not reaching the edge of about 0.5 cm. The resulting parts are folded in a triangle and fixed with an iron - these will be future needles.  The thorns are sewn in a circle, starting from the very bottom of the cap, while the thread should pass through the "undercut" 0.5 cm in the middle of the rectangles.  At the top of the headgear, several more needles are made, made one at a time in the element. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="children's costume hedgehog" class="if" height="308" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15171/336632.jpg?1392520330572" width="342"></div>

Any fabric trimmings and knitting threads cut into small pieces are also suitable.  Sew the nose to the finished cone, embroider the mouth and attach the eyes.  If the hedgehog costume is carnival, you can add some sparkles or rain.  Ready muzzle should be swept up to a cap with needles (on the front side). </p><p>  The main advantage of such a suit is its mobility: such an outfit is very simple to take off and put on.  There will be no need to clothe the baby for a long time in bulky elements of the outfit, for fear of tearing any part even before the matinee.  By the way, in this way you can make faces for any animals: foxes, wolves and bunnies. </p><h2>  Hedgehog Costume - Finish </h2><p>  If desired, the outfit is decorated with autumn leaves, artificial apples, pears and mushrooms.  The simplest version of this finish is fruits and vegetables, drawn on cardboard and glued, or better sewn to a hedgehog fur coat.  You can give your baby a basket with plastic apples or mushrooms made from papier-m√¢ch√©.  To create sufficiently light fruits, use expanded polystyrene - this is such a very dense foam, which is used to strengthen walls.  All elements are cut out using a conventional pen or office knife, and then simply painted with acrylic or gouache paints.  To give greater credibility, you can glue real ponytails from apples.  Next, the fruits are fixed on the needles of a fur coat and hat with <span>silicone glue.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a hedgehog costume" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15171/336635.jpg?1392520387155" width="371"></div>

    <h2>  Sophisticated carnival outfit options </h2><p>  If you have free time, experience in cutting and sewing, as well as at least a small budget allocated for holiday <span>clothes, a</span> hedgehog <span>costume</span> can be sewn from scratch.  To do this, you need a suitable fabric for overalls and a cape-hood.  The pattern is created on the basis of the finished clothes of the child, suitable in size and image.  Clasps are made on the front with plastic zippers or standard buttons.  To prevent seams on the shelf, a hedgehog "belly" is cut out of beige or gray fleece, which is attached using ordinary Velcro.  The hood is sheathed with needles made according to the same pattern as the thorns for the hat.  Rounded ears are also made from abdominal tissue.  They are sewn to the hood with a <span>blind stitch</span> or sewed on a typewriter.  For especially lazy - needles can be made from ordinary foam rubber, which is painted in a suitable color with gouache. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hedgehog costume carnival" class="if" height="299" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15171/336631.jpg?1392520423978" width="260"></div>

    <p>  Now, young parents know how to make a hedgehog costume.  The main rule is not to limit your own imagination.  Needles can be made of foam rubber, which is used to warm windows, simply by cutting it with suitable pieces and painting with gouache.  The cape can be tailored based on the finished hood from the jacket.  Instead of overalls, you can wear ordinary trousers in a checkered box and a white shirt, which is larger in size.  In this case, a special padding pad is attached to the stomach.  The preparation time for such a costume depends on the skill of the mother and the chosen image, but with careful work and the availability of all necessary materials, such an outfit can be done in one or two evenings. </p>
