Unfortunately, very often it is used by terrorists and bandits for their dirty purposes, justifying the massacres of people with the words and messages of Allah.  Therefore, it is in our time that it is so important to understand what is really Islam and its branches.  This knowledge can protect many souls from <span>rash acts</span> and temptations.  After all, it is difficult to deceive one whose heart, thanks to the will of Allah, is perspicacious.  Various spiritual practices help to be closer to the Almighty; the most famous of them are tariqas.  In our article, we will tell you what tariffication is and how it originated.  We will also describe in detail the path of spiritual enlightenment that is widespread in the North Caucasus. </p>

    <h2>  General characteristics of the tariff </h2><p>  Many people do not immediately <span>understand what</span> tariff is.  After all, this term has a very ancient and rich history, which includes many events that influenced the life of the entire Muslim society. </p><p>  It is impossible to separate such concepts as ‚Äúsharia‚Äù and ‚Äútariqa‚Äù among themselves.  Initially, they were very closely connected, because Sharia contains a set of laws and rules that govern the life of a true believer.  Thanks to this, a Muslim can live in harmony with himself and God every minute of his existence.  He thinks, works, eats and does many other things in the way that pleases Allah.  But it‚Äôs not enough just to follow certain rules, every second you need to mentally feel your connection with the Almighty, and the tariff can help in this. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If Sharia is the foundation of Muslim society, then tariqa is a combination of knowledge and practices aimed at purifying the soul.  Indeed, only in this way can you bring yourself closer to Allah. </p>

    <h2>  What is the tariff: the meaning of the term </h2><p>  If you translate this term from Arabic into Russian, then the most approximate value will sound like a "path".  It is he who leads a person to purification from all worldly things and gives an incredible feeling of happiness and harmony from rapprochement with the Almighty. </p><p>  Islamic scholars argue that nothing in this world should drive out thoughts of Allah from a person‚Äôs head.  A Muslim can hold his hands in various deeds, but his head and heart should always be filled with thoughts and feelings of a different kind.  Many theologians remind the faithful that it is not enough to perform the prayer according to the established rules - prayer should always be sincere and without a single hint of worldly affairs and problems. </p><p>  Of course, this is not easy and not accessible to every believer, but the tariqah is able to lead a Muslim along the difficult path of purifying the soul and heart.  One who embarks on this road gets rid of bad thoughts, unworthy deeds and unrestrained emotions.  People of the tariq every second remember Allah, who is also in their hearts.  This is precisely the highest goal of the faithful, which every Muslim should strive for. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  The emergence of the tariff </h2><p>  The current meaning of the term was not reinforced immediately.  If you tried to find out what tariqa is in the 9th century, then you would have a completely different meaning for this complex religious term. </p><p>  Initially, the tariqa were followed by Sufi communities.  They were attributed to the esoteric branches of Islam, which preached abstinence, asceticism and spiritual enlightenment by getting rid of worldly passions.  Many modern Islamic scholars speak of Sufism as a kind of Muslim philosophy, which has a serious impact on the very understanding and significance of Islam. </p><p>  Especially common are tariqas in the 9th-10th centuries.  The followers of Sufism embarked on the path of spiritual self-knowledge and the acquisition of truth, which became known as the tariqa.  This path was accompanied by a combination of practical methods and spiritual exercises, which led to the purification and renewal of the soul.  The highest pleasure was the achievement of hakikata - awareness of the divine essence in all its manifestations.  The followers of Sufism were convinced that it was possible to comprehend it only by practical methods and hermitism. </p>

    <h2>  Tariff development </h2><p>  By the twentieth century, the concept of tariqah began to change significantly.  This is due to the formation of numerous communities and circles, in which the tandem of "teacher - student" has gained major importance.  The last - murid - had to completely obey his teacher, because he was the only one who could lead along the difficult path of purification.  Over time, such communities were formed throughout the Muslim world, and the tariqas acquired the significance of a school in which it was possible to study with the most enlightened murshids (teachers). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Until the thirteenth century, the tariqa became more complicated; it was surrounded by various rules and rituals.  Murid had to undergo initiation, and every moment of his life was subject to strict control and clearly regulated.  Each of the tariqas could have their own spiritual practices, techniques, and exercises.  Sufism gradually ceased to have the status of a chosen doctrine and passed to the masses.  He was carried away by many Muslims, embarking on a path of knowledge of the truth. </p><h2>  Tarikata in the XIII-XV centuries </h2><p>  Over time, schools acquired a clear hierarchical structure and a special organizational system.  Around the 13th century, they began to transform into fraternities, where discipline reigned and secret practices were used.  Usually, an enlightened one became the head of the brotherhood, and all other members of the community were considered his followers and students.  A significant difference between brotherhood and tariqah schools was precisely a clear organization and a certain set of methods.  If earlier Muslims used a wide range of practices to achieve enlightenment, then in the fraternity it was customary to follow the path that the senior mentor had already taken.  This was introduced in the rank of mandatory.  Most of the techniques were mystical and carefully guarded from prying eyes. </p><p>  By the XV century, the system of fraternities finally becomes the only version of the tariqah adopted in Islam.  It is interesting that every Muslim should accept the tariff, because this is what, according to Islamic scholars, Allah wants from a person.  Over time, the system of "teacher - student" is forgotten, it is replaced by the tandem "saint - novice."  Each founder of the brotherhood is elevated to the rank of saint and has unlimited power in the brotherhood.  As history has shown, just such a format turned out to be the most acceptable.  After all, many brotherhoods could not survive due to the lack of a clear hierarchy and the use of diverse techniques borrowed from other communities. </p>

    <h2>  XV century: a turning point in the history of tariqas </h2><p>  By the 15th century, brotherhoods finally became the only embodiment of the path of enlightenment.  In the Muslim world, twelve basic fraternities took shape, which could lead a person to spiritual purification.  Subsequently, four more communities were added to them.  All of them became the starting point for the formation of various branches.  Over time, they became independent tariffs and gained their followers. </p><p>  Each of the tariqas had its own territory of distribution and influence.  Quite often, several fraternities could peacefully exist on the same territory.  Interestingly, their structure was almost always the same.  And the differences were in the methods and dhikr, which is a special prayer, which is customary to complete namaz. </p><h2>  Characteristics of fraternities </h2><p>  By the 17th century, the tariqas had acquired a fairly clear structure, according to which the novice was no longer subordinate not only to the founder of the fraternity, but also to a greater extent the internal charter and routine.  They become dominant on the path to spiritual purification and enlightenment. </p><p>  The following points can be considered the main characteristics of communities: </p><ul><li>  unconditional submission to the founder of the fraternity; </li><li>  clear hierarchy; </li><li>  followers were divided into initiated and simple; </li><li>  initiation rituals; </li><li>  the tariqah has a special system of exercises, practices and techniques, the implementation of which is regulated by the charter of the fraternity; </li><li>  a special cult of veneration of burial places of saints; </li><li>  Zikra ritual uniting all members of the fraternity. </li></ul><h2>  Tariff classification </h2><p>  Tariqas are divided into Shiite and Sunni, but, in addition, they are all divided into three groups: </p><ul><li>  Ayar.  This tariqa practices spiritual cleansing through numerous additional <span>prayers.</span>  <span>Prayer is</span> performed up to fifty times a day and must necessarily end with a collective dhikr. </li><li>  Abrar.  This group of tariqas is fighting for purity within the fraternity and spiritual purification of all its members. </li><li>  Shuttar.  In such communities, special methods of spiritual meditation are practiced, the purpose of which is to achieve a state of religious ecstasy. </li></ul><p>  We have already said that many of the fraternities have their own region, where they enjoyed and enjoy the greatest influence.  In more detail, we decided to consider Naqshbandi, a tariq which is very common in Chechnya.  Of course, he is not the only one, but still has the most followers here. </p>

    <h2>  Naqshbandi tariq: the story of creation </h2><p>  It is traditionally believed that this brotherhood dates back to the mid-14th century.  Its founder was Bahauddin Naqshbandi, who partially borrowed some spiritual practices from the tarikat Yasaviy, combining them with the mystical teachings of other Sufi scholars.  The result was a very special area, which quickly spread to Turkey, Central Asia and the territory of the modern North Caucasus. </p><p>  From early childhood, Bahauddin was brought up in the spirit of Sufism, so he was well versed in all its subtleties.  Tarikat Naqshbandi was based on several principles that followers strictly observed.  Interestingly, the gold chain of the Naqshbandi tariqah (line of succession) dates back to the prophet Muhammad himself and has two branches. </p><h2>  Principles and principles of the tariff </h2><p>  First of all, all followers of Naqshbandi practice silent dhikr, that is, prayer is pronounced to oneself.  The founder of the tariqa believed that ostentatious piety did not bring the necessary result, and the ability to concentrate and address the Almighty without words was the sure way to purify the soul. </p><p>  Bahauddin himself formed the first three principles of his brotherhood, his successor supplemented them and brought them to eleven: </p><ul><li>  cherish time and live with benefit every moment; </li><li>  dhikr quality; </li><li>  extreme concentration on dhikr; </li><li>  understanding of the proximity of Allah; </li><li>  never look at the forbidden and avoid temptation; </li><li>  gradual estrangement from society, which at the same time brings closer to Allah; </li><li>  the ability to be among people alone with the Almighty; </li><li>  mention of Allah only by heart; </li><li>  prayer should be said only with thoughts of the Almighty; </li><li>  blocking extraneous emotions and sensations; </li><li>  constant engagement in spiritual practices. </li></ul><p>  These rules are observed to this day without change. </p>

    <h2>  Chechnya: features of the establishment of the tariff </h2><p>  When Islamic scholars speak of a Chechen Muslim society, such a thing as a ‚ÄúVainakh society‚Äù is mentioned, uniting numerous tribes and communities. </p><p>  It is well known which of the Vainakh Avliya was the first to distribute the Naqshbandi tariki in Chechnya.  As well as the names of those who faithfully served the spread of Islam in these lands.  Sheikhs and saints usually entered the political arena precisely when the future of the people was seriously threatened.  The first to bring the Naqshbandi teachings to Chechnya was Sheikh Mansur, who came from a simple family living in a mountain village.  First of all, he is perceived as a fighter for freedom, and only then he is remembered for his religious services to the people of Chechnya. </p><p>  The tarikat at this time was not yet formed and even after its establishment had its own special features inherent in this particular region.  For example, community members give little importance to the graves of saints.  They more revere the very image of their founder than the place of his burial.  Tarikat Naqshbandi in Chechnya is a special Sufism that primarily identifies the personalities and achievements of the sheikhs themselves, and the issue of continuity is already secondary to all members of the community. </p><p>  The issue of tariffs is quite multifaceted, but we tried to state it as simply and clearly as possible.
