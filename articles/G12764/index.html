Choosing a tour and, accordingly, a refuge for a vacation, many are guided not only by the opinions of compatriots, since they can transmit the most reliable information regarding comfort, level of service and the service offered.  But there are those, and there are many of them who are also interested in the <span>rating of hotels in Turkey.</span>  3 stars, 4, 5 - each of these categories includes in the list both hotels corresponding to the declared level and those for which it is somewhat overpriced.  At the same time, the prices for accommodation in both of them are almost the same, so it is logical that tourists want to get the appropriate service for the money paid.

In some of them, those who like a relaxing vacation prefer to stay, in others, on the contrary, are young people who like the proximity of noisy entertainment. </p><p>  Regardless of the star rating, all hotels provide tourists with a clean beach and fresh air, but most importantly - an oriental friendly service.  In Kemer there are not only luxury complexes, but also three-star inexpensive family hotels suitable for families with small children.  They can be located on the first line, for example, Asia Hotel or Larissa Park Hotel, or somewhat removed from the beach.  However, this drawback, as a rule, is compensated by surprisingly beautiful landscapes and fresh mountain air. </p><h2>  Prices </h2><p>  Regardless of location, all these hotels offer a full range of amenities necessary for a normal family vacation.  The predominant part of the <span>3 star hotels of</span> this resort is built on fairly large areas.  Almost all of them work year-round.  And, probably, the main thing that attracts tourists vacationing in economy class is an affordable price. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey Hotels Yildiz Boutique Hotel" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/635640.jpg" width="600"></div>  For example, the cost of a tour for two Russians in a three-star Larissa Park hotel, which is considered one of the most popular in its category rating, with the concept of all-inclusive meals and departure from Moscow in seven days starts from thirty five thousand rubles.  The price may vary depending on the season and the availability of a charter flight.  It is such reasonable price limits that are the reason why our compatriots love Turkey so much.  Hotels, Yildiz Boutique Hotel, for example, are convenient and the fact that they are fed plentifully, there are always Russian-speaking staff and, most importantly, there is a good ratio of value for money.
