    <p>  No man can imagine his life without pictures.  Each important event should be captured on photo paper.  Even those who do not like to take photographs for their own use cannot refuse them on documents.  Sooner or later, everyone goes to a photo studio in order to take a photo on their passport or make a portfolio. </p><h2>  What are the sizes of photos for printing? </h2><p>  Due to different purposes, there are several sizes of images, each of which performs a separate function.  What are the sizes of photos for printing?  Since the popularity of such a procedure is growing, accordingly, there are a lot of formats.  We are talking about small sizes - this is a photograph on a passport in a 3 by 4 format or the usual one for a 10 by 15 or 13 by 18 photo album. </p><p>  Photography is not a vital thing.  You can live without pictures, because all the memories are stored in memory.  But, thanks to advanced technologies, we still have the opportunity to look at captured moments and remember moments.  It is amazing that such ideas appear in our head. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To extend the happy moment, they take a snapshot, whether it‚Äôs a wedding or the birth of a child, they capture everything.  After that, you just need to print the received photos and put yourself in the album.  Most recently, people used film, and now digital technology has replaced it from the sales market.  A big plus of progress is that the resulting image is visible immediately, that is, there is no need to wait and think about how the photo turned out. </p><h2>  Photos on documents </h2><p>  The most common type of image is a passport photo, which has several requirements that are mandatory.  One of the main ones is a 3 by 4 photo. The size must comply with the standards, otherwise the documents will not be considered. </p><p>  When submitting a package of documents, government agencies require two photographs.  This photo is taken in a few minutes and is completely ready for further use.  In addition to a passport, they are often photographed with student documents or a driver‚Äôs license.  A 3 by 4 photo is printed, the size of which is identical to the passport option.  Although it is worth considering that sometimes a passport accepts a 3.5 to 4.5 picture. </p>

These are simple photographs that depict both people and nature.  The most popular format is a 10 by 15 photograph. A standard size that clearly shows the outline of a person or subject.

    <p>  These are far from all formats.  But the question arises, what are the sizes of photographs for printing.  There are a lot of them, for example, you can select a picture in landscape format A4, and speaking the language of the photographer, then 21 by 30 centimeters.  This size is used for large shots, usually with the aim of creating a portfolio, since it clearly shows all the features of a person.  Photo 13 by 18 is also in demand - this is a slightly smaller format.  It is usually used to design a portrait. </p><h2>  How do pixels affect photo quality? </h2><p>  Pixels are the smallest unit of size, in other words, the number of dots in a picture.  When there are few such points, the image is blurry, with fuzzy contours.  A large number of pixels makes the photo bright and clear, it can be enlarged to almost any size, for example, to make the format 21 to 30. </p><p>  The quality of the photo and its size depend on the maximum resolution of <span>the camera‚Äôs matrix.</span>  To date, there are almost no devices that take low-quality pictures.  Since even the most ordinary phones have in their arsenal a camera with two pixels. </p><p>  From this indicator it depends in what format in the future you can print the photo.  Although such a standard size as 10 by 15, in any case it turns out.  The fewer pixels, the worse the quality of the photo.  If the most ordinary photo can be easily framed in the size of 10 by 15, then, for example, it will not work to enlarge, since the picture will not be clear. </p><p>  If you want to make a high-quality professional photo, you must contact a photo studio.  The photographer, like no one else, knows how to properly direct the light, will help you choose a beautiful pose.  The professional will adjust the photo to the required format and print it on photo paper. </p><h2>  How to print a photo of the required size? </h2><p>  There are also two options for printing photos.  Although now such a service is in less demand, as many people simply <span>store photos</span> on a computer.  But, you can see that these are completely different feelings.  After all, when you hold a photograph in your hand, as if you are getting closer to the displayed moment. </p>

    <p>  In order to hold the photo in your hand, you need to print it, and you can do this in two ways: at home or in the cabin.  In a home environment, photos of a standard size of 10 by 15 are most often printed. But a larger format photo cannot always be made high-quality, because it depends on the size of the photo paper and the capabilities of the printer. </p><h2>  Why are there so many photo sizes? </h2><p>  The fact is that in life there are various events that I would like to remember for a long time.  The most common image format cannot convey the whole atmosphere.  When you take a larger photo, for example, in the 21 by 30 format, you immediately become a participant in those happy moments. </p>
