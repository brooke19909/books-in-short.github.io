One of these innovations is foamiran.  This is a soft and plastic material, from which it is very easy to make all kinds of crafts.  Children can use it for work with applications and for making gifts, for example, for women on March 8. </p><p>  Adult craftswomen make hair clips, bracelets, hoops on the head for hair, belts <span>from foamiran</span> , and also use large <span>flowers from foamiran</span> for decorating various interior items and room decor for the holidays. </p><h2>  What is foamiran? </h2><p>  The origin of the name of the material is due to the English word Foam, which translates as "foam".  It consists of ethylene vinyl acetate.  This is a decorative material having a foamy structure.  In another way it is also called foamed rubber, some because of its softness call it plastic suede.  Another name <span>is</span> revision. </p><p>  Chinese and Iranian enterprises produce foamiran.  It is produced in thin sheets, within 1 mm.  The Iranian counterpart is much thinner and better, so you can buy Chinese material for children's crafts.  And if you want to beautifully decorate the interior or arrange a room for a wedding or anniversary, then, of course, you need to take a better Iranian. </p>

    <p>  The color scheme is very extensive <span>-</span> up to 24 colors and shades that can be easily combined for a beautiful product.  There is a foamiran, which has sparkles in its structure, but such flowers will look somewhat pompous and unlike real ones.  Some needlewomen choose shades so clearly that the flowers look very natural, like real ones.  Perhaps that is why the material has gained such popularity in our country. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The properties </h2><ul><li>  Foamiran is completely non-toxic.  It can be safely given to children, without fear that the child may lick it or poison itself from the smell.  Although some reviews report that at the very beginning of work, when they just opened the bag with the sheets, the smell was a little present.  But this passes quickly and does not cause any discomfort in the future.  If you give material to a child, then you can simply print the necessary colors in advance and leave them for an hour in another place for ventilation. </li><li>  Almost does not absorb moisture, therefore, if the master made flowers of foamiran large size, then you can easily wash them with warm water and not be afraid that the product will lose its shape and will fade from moisture. </li></ul>

    <ul><li>  The material is plastic, and it can be modified by heating.  For example, to get the slightly twisted edges of the petals, they need to be heated.  After cooling, the foamiran remains in the acquired form forever, that is, the material has its own memory.  It is convenient and more practical than flowers made from paper. </li><li>  The material is easy to process.  It is easy to cut, make holes with a hole punch, emboss, and more. </li></ul><h2>  What can be done with foamiran? </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the color palette of the sheets sold for sale is quite wide, masters, for example, by making a large flower from foamiran, can tint it.  For these needs use pastel or <span>acrylic paints.</span>  But many needlewomen who do the work to decorate the living room use watercolors, gouache, and even colored crayons.  Some use eye shadow and powder for embossing. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On such a fertile material as foamiran, everything falls perfectly.  The only thing is that in these cases the product is disposable, it cannot be washed from dust and used further.  If such elements become dirty, they will simply need to be thrown away, since paints will spread from the water. </p>

    <p>  When making large flowers from foamiran with your own hands, you need to remember that PVA glue or an adhesive pencil, which is sold in office supplies, does not glue such material.  You need to buy either "Moment" type superglue or, even better, purchase an adhesive gun.  The craftswomen in their reviews about the properties of foamiran give beginners useful advice: if you glue the details, then you can not continue to work immediately.  It is necessary to leave for a day to dry and give time for a good bond. </p><p>  Also, parts of the material can be sewn together with threads, they perfectly hold the parts in the desired position. </p><h2>  What kind of work can be done from foamiran? </h2><p>  Since the material is light, soft and plastic, it is used in almost all Hand-made works.  This is designing albums for photographs, decorating caskets, making voluminous bouquets for vases, hairpins, hoops, bracelets and even bouquets for the bride for the wedding ceremony. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Recently, they began to use this material in the decoration of rooms: a wedding hall for a ceremony, an arch for newlyweds, near which relatives and friends are photographed, and decorations for stairs and gates.  Offices and beauty salons, hairdressers and halls for displaying fashion collections are decorated with large growth flowers from foamiran. </p><p>  Now not a single beautifully decorated holiday is complete without <span>decorating the walls with</span> floral arrangements.  The paintings on the wall with large flowers from foamiran look beautiful.  Consider how to make flowers from such material that for this you need to know and be able to. </p><h2>  Step-by-step instruction </h2><p>  If previously the craftswoman made flowers from paper or fabric, then she will not see anything complicated when using new material.  Everything is done in the same way as ordinary paper work.  There are some subtleties of working with a hot iron and with coloring the material. </p><p>  Consider how to make a poppy flower, for example, a poppy flower.  We start by cutting out a template from cardboard for petals.  This is completely uncomplicated. </p><p>  Then work is done on the central part of the flower.  A circle of green leaf is cut out and wrapped around a large wooden bead.  If the needlewoman will make a large flower from foamiran, then you can take a <span>foam ball of</span> large size.  It is lightweight and will not burden the product with its weight. </p>

    <p>  Then they take a skein of simple black thread and tightly wrap around the ball, making cross-dressing to make diagonal sectors.  When the ball is fully fastened, the thread is knotted at the bottom. </p><p>  Next is the work on creating a black fringe inside the flower.  This is the stamen poppy in the middle.  They are made according to the principle of brushes.  Wrap on a cardboard template and then tie in the middle.  The hinges are aligned and the edges are trimmed with scissors.  It turns out fluffy brushes, which you need to have several, so that the framing of the ball is not empty. </p><h2>  Making Petals: Master Class </h2><p>  Large flowers from foamiran are made according to patterns that are several times larger than usual.  The rest of the work is done the same way.  Attaching a pattern to a suede sheet, outline it along the contour.  Then all the cut petals are twisted.  To do this, you need to roll one element into a tube and turn it with one hand to the left and the other to the right.  Then the petals straighten, and the shape of the elements still remains wavy. </p>

    <p>  Further around the ball and sticks, the petals are wrapped and fastened so that they are not one above the other.  After installing all the petals, you need to start work on the leaves.  To do this, blanks are cut and edges are cut so that the sheet turns out to be carved.  The last step in making a large flower from foamiran will be gluing them to the base with a hot glue gun.  Everything, poppy is ready. </p><h2>  The decoration of the wedding hall </h2><p>  A room <span>decorated with flowers</span> from this material looks very nice, you can combine foamiran with silk elements.  Usually, sheets of delicate shades of pink, white and blue are used for a wedding hall or arch for newlyweds.  Designers decorate not only arches and walls; railings wrapped in ribbons or garlands with flowers look interesting.  Use not only large flowers, but also other sizes, combining elements of different colors and shapes. </p>

    <p>  Large and bright flowers add brightness and colorfulness to the room.  Additional elements are small-sized other flowers, leaves, curly butterflies or dragonflies.  A frame for photographs or a picture looks interesting, in which several roses or chrysanthemums from foamiran are glued around the perimeter. </p><h2>  Bedroom interior </h2><p>  Large flowers look very tender and elegant against the backdrop of the bed in the bedroom.  The color scheme should be in harmony with the whole environment.  It can be just a flower arrangement, or several types of art can be used.  If you look closely at the photo of the bedroom below, you can see that on the wall the picture <span>is</span> originally painted with acrylics <span>- a</span> tree with twigs and leaves.  But large flowers give the picture volume and realism. </p>

    <p>  Such beauty can be located at the head of the bed, or it can be constantly in front of people's eyes, on the front wall.  This is if there is no TV in the bedroom. </p><h2>  Curtain holders </h2><p>  Beautiful elements in the decoration of the rooms are the decorated holders of curtains and curtains.  It can be a large bouquet or a beautifully sheathed thin strip.  The floral arrangement should not stand out too much if the curtains are colored.  If these are delicate pastel shades or in general the main colors are white, black or gray, then flowers of bright contrasting shades are allowed. </p>

    <p>  You can hang such delicate elements in the living room, in the bedroom, and in the nursery in which the little princess lives.  In the girls' room, with the help of flowers made from such a convenient and easy-to-use material, you can design an entire wall or a separate part of the room where the child plays or sleeps. </p><h2>  Studio decoration </h2><p>  From foamiran, the production of large flowers is a simple process, everything is the same as with small ones, only the pattern needs to be made larger.  At the same time, a room decorated with such large elements attracts everyone's attention.  Of course, such a design is not suitable everywhere, but here in beauty salons or in the studios of professional photographers such a design will look great. </p>

    <p>  Photos against this background will turn out highly artistic.  And the studio will look more picturesque. </p><h2>  Reviews and tips from the masters </h2><p>  Due to the good texture of the material and the lightness of the products, foamiran began to be used everywhere.  It is a pleasure to work with him.  Material is easily cut, it is possible to beat out identical parts with the help of curly hole punchers.  The trace of the cut on the sheets does not remain. </p><p>  However, it must be remembered that scratches and lines drawn by some rod will draw a strip on the sheet that will be visible.  There is no way to remove it.  Therefore, you need to work with the material carefully. </p><p>  Using an iron, it is also necessary to pick up the element in time, so as not to overfill the material.  For twisting use round sticks-skewers or toothpicks (for <span>small flowers).</span> </p><p>  Start small, try your hand, only then move on to large elements.  Good luck </p>
