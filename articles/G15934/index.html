    <h2>  origin of name </h2><p>  No one knows the origin of the name ‚Äúpharaoh serpents‚Äù, but they confine it to biblical events.  In order to impress Pharaoh, the prophet Moses, on the advice of the Lord, threw his staff on the ground, and he turned into a snake.  Caught in the hands of the chosen one, the reptile became a staff again.  Although in reality there is nothing in common between how these experiments are obtained and biblical events. </p><h2>  What can you get "pharaonic snakes" </h2><p>  The most common substance for snakes is mercury thiocyanate.  However, experiments with it can only be carried out in a well-equipped chemical laboratory.  The substance is toxic and has an unpleasant persistent odor.  A "pharaoh snake" at home can be created from tablets that are sold in any pharmacy without a prescription, or mineral fertilizers from a hardware store.  For the experiment, calcium gluconate, urotropin, soda, powdered sugar, nitrate and many substances that can be purchased at a pharmacy or store are used. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="experience pharaonic snakes" class="if" height="346" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11391/432844.jpg" width="520"></div>

    <p>  In order to conduct the <span>chemical experiment of the</span> Pharaoh‚Äôs snake, you will need a burner or <span>dry fuel</span> and the above medicines.  A few tablets are laid out on <span>dry alcohol,</span> which is set on fire.  During the reaction, substances such as nitrogen, <span>sulfur dioxide,</span> hydrogen sulfide and water vapor are released.  The reaction formula is as follows: </p><p>  C <sub>11</sub> H <sub>12</sub> N <sub>4</sub> O <sub>2</sub> S + 7O <sub>2</sub> = 28C + 2H <sub>2</sub> S ‚Üë + 2SO <sub>2</sub> ‚Üë + 8N <sub>2</sub> ‚Üë + 18H <sub>2</sub> O </p><p>  Such an experiment must be carried out very carefully, since sulphurous gas is very toxic, as well as hydrogen sulfide.  Therefore, if it is not possible to ventilate the room during the experiment or turn on the hood, it is better to do this on the street or in a specially equipped laboratory. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Calcium Gluconate Snakes </h2><p>  It is best to experiment with substances that are safe, even if they are used outside a specially equipped laboratory.  "Pharaoh snake" from calcium gluconate is quite simple. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Calcium Glucanate Pharaoh Snake" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11391/432826.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <p>  This will require 2-3 tablets of the drug and a cube of dry fuel.  Under the influence of the flame, a reaction begins, and a gray ‚Äúsnake‚Äù crawls out of the pill.  Such experiments with calcium gluconate are quite safe, but you should still be careful when conducting them.  The formula of the chemical reaction is as follows: </p><p>  C <sub>12</sub> H <sub>22</sub> CaO <sub>14</sub> + O2 = 10C + 2CO <sub>2</sub> ‚Üë + CaO + 11H <sub>2</sub> O </p><p>  As you can see, a reaction occurs with the release of water, carbon dioxide, carbon and calcium oxide.  It is gas evolution that causes growth.  "Pharaonic snakes" are obtained in length up to 15 centimeters, but they are short-lived.  When you try to pick them up they fall apart. </p><h2>  "Pharaoh's snake" - how to make from fertilizer? </h2>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If you have a garden on a personal plot or a summer residence, then there are certainly various fertilizers.  The most common that can be found in the pantry of any summer resident and farmer is nitrate or ammonium nitrate.  For the experiment you will need sifted river sand, half a teaspoon of saltpeter, half a teaspoon of powdered sugar, a spoon of ethyl alcohol. </p><p>  It is necessary to make a depression in the slide of sand.  The larger the diameter, the thicker the "snake" will be.  A well-ground mixture of saltpeter and sugar is poured into the recess and poured with ethanol.  Then they set fire to alcohol, a "snake" is gradually formed. </p><p>  The reaction in this case is as follows: </p><p>  2NH <sub>4</sub> NO <sub>3</sub> + C <sub>12</sub> H <sub>22</sub> O <sub>11</sub> = 11C + 2N <sub>2</sub> + CO <sub>2</sub> + 15H <sub>2</sub> O. </p><p>  The release of toxic substances during the experiment requires compliance with safety precautions. </p><h2>  Food Pharaoh Snake </h2><p>  "Pharaoh snakes" are obtained not only from medicines or fertilizers.  For experience, you can use products such as sugar and soda.  Such components can be found in any kitchen.  A hill with a depression is formed from river sand and impregnated with alcohol.  Powdered sugar and baking soda are mixed in a ratio of 4: 1 and poured into a recess.  Alcohol set on fire. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="chemical experience of the pharaoh snake" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11391/433033.jpg" width="480"></div>

    <p>  The mixture begins to blacken and slowly swell.  When the alcohol practically ceases to burn, several wriggling "reptiles" creep out of the sand.  The reaction is as follows: </p><p>  2NaHCO <sub>3</sub> = Na <sub>2</sub> CO <sub>3</sub> + H <sub>2</sub> O + CO <sub>2</sub> , </p><p>  C <sub>2</sub> H <sub>5</sub> OH + 3O <sub>2</sub> = 2CO <sub>2</sub> + 3H <sub>2</sub> O </p><p>  The mixture decomposes into <span>sodium carbonate,</span> carbon dioxide and water vapor.  It is gases that cause soda ash to bloat and grow, which does not burn during the reaction. </p><h2>  Another "reptile" from the pill </h2><p>  There is another simple way to get a ‚Äúpharaoh snake" from drugs.  To do this, you need to purchase the drug "Urotropin" in a pharmacy.  Instead of tablets, you can also use dry fuel containing this substance.  Still need a solution of ammonium nitrate.  The drug "Urotropin" must be impregnated with them.  However, you cannot immediately apply the entire solution to the starting material, so you need to add a few drops and dry.  In this case, drying should occur at room temperature. </p><p>  After that, the pill is set on fire.  As a result, it turns out not so much a "snake" as a "dragon".  However, if you look, it‚Äôs the same experience of the ‚ÄúPharaoh Serpents‚Äù.  But due to the properties of the components, a more violent reaction occurs, which leads to the formation of a three-dimensional figure. </p><h2>  Mercury Rodanide Snake </h2><p>  For the first time, the chemical experiment of the Pharaoh‚Äôs Serpent was obtained by a medical student in 1820.  Friedrich Weller mixed solutions of mercury nitrate and ammonium thiocyanate and obtained a white crystalline precipitate.  The student dried the resulting precipitate of mercury rhodanide and set it on fire just for the sake of curiosity.  A black-yellow serpentine mass began to creep out of the burning substance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pharaonic snake how to make" class="if" height="145" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11391/433014.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  "Pharaoh snakes" from mercury thiocyanate are obtained simply.  The substance must be ignited on a heat-resistant surface.  A reaction will follow: </p><p>  2Hg (NCS) <sub>2</sub> = 2HgS + C <sub>3</sub> N <sub>4</sub> + CS <sub>2</sub> </p><p>  CS <sub>2</sub> + 3O <sub>2</sub> = CO <sub>2</sub> + 2SO <sub>2</sub> </p><p>  Under thermal influence, mercury rhodanide decomposes into mercury sulfide (gives the reptile black), carbon nitride (responsible for the yellow color of the snake) and carbon disulfide (carbon disulfide).  The latter ignites and decomposes into gases - carbon dioxide and sulfur oxide, which swell carbon nitride.  He, in turn, captures <span>mercury sulfide,</span> and black-yellow "pharaoh snakes" are obtained. </p><p>  This experience should never be carried out at home!  In addition to the emission of toxic gases, the release of mercury vapor occurs.  Mercury is toxic in itself and can cause severe chemical poisoning. </p><h2>  Safety during experiments </h2><p>  Despite the fact that most of the substances from which "pharaoh snakes" can be obtained are considered safe, experiments must be carried out very carefully.  As can be seen from the above formulas, decomposition produces quite toxic components that can lead to severe poisoning.  All experiments can be carried out at home only in a ventilated room or in the presence of a high-power hood.  Experiments with mercury thiocyanate can only be carried out in a specially equipped laboratory, observing all safety rules. </p><p>  In conclusion, we can say that by conducting the chemical experience of the Pharaoh Snakes in the classroom, the teacher can interest students in their subject.  The lesson is likely to interest even those who do not understand and do not like chemistry.  And those who prefer practice instead of boring theoretical calculations will receive an additional incentive to study science. </p>
