Creating a sleeve requires considerable zeal.  Only perfectly cut and correctly sewn in, it makes the outfit harmonious, which provides the perfect image for the owner of the new thing. </p><h2>  Clothing item history </h2><p>  For the first time, sleeves became elements of clothing in Byzantium.  Around the world, they began to be used in the design of outfits from around the 12th century.  And gradually the appearance of the sleeves began to change depending on the type and purpose of the wardrobe item, which led to the appearance of a huge number of its variations. </p>

    <p>  In the 15th century, the material situation of the owner of a thing was judged on its sleeves.  Rich people decorated them with a scattering of precious stones and elaborate embroidery.  Moreover, they were not sewn to clothes, but were laced in a special way to its upper part.  Thus, the types of sleeves on the dress could be changed in order to look different every time. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Noble ladies presented sleeves as a gift to their beloved.  And in <span>knightly tournaments,</span> admiration for the winner was expressed in an unusual way.  The audience threw sleeves into the arena, and the more there were, the higher was the status of a knight. </p><p>  The types of sleeves in those days were constantly replenished with more and more diverse variations, some of which are now forgotten.  But there are those that are very popular in modern times.  In the last century, the number of experiments on the shape and design of the sleeve was significantly reduced. </p><h2>  Types of sleeves in clothes along the length </h2><p>  Firstly, they, first of all, can vary in length.  Based on this criterion, the sleeves can be short, long and medium. </p><p>  It should be noted that the length of the sleeve did not always reflect only the season.  Several centuries ago in Russia, on this basis, they judged that a person belongs to a certain social layer.  For example, representatives of the privileged estate wore a long sleeve.  And those who rolled up, rolled them up or tucked them in were ranked among the lower strata of society, because this sign symbolized the fact that a person is engaged in hard physical labor and does not refuse the most dirty work. </p><h2>  How to distinguish sleeves by type of fastening </h2><p>  Another criterion by which the types of sleeves are distinguished is the type of fastening.  According to this classification, they can be set-in, one-piece and raglan.  The set-in sleeve is sewn into the armhole of the product in a closed loop.  The stitching line can be compared with the section of the arm at the place of its articulation with the body.  This species is most common.  A set-in sleeve can be safely called a classic one, because it is it that is most often used when sewing strict jackets, blouses and other types <span>of office-</span> style <span>clothing</span> .  At the same time, adding puffs and various pleats, you can give this strict sleeve notes of tenderness, airiness and romance. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Consider the following view.  This is a one-piece sleeve, which is characterized by the absence of a stitching line, that is, it is one with the front and back of the clothes.  The peculiarity of the pattern gives the product with a whole-cut sleeve elegance and sophistication. </p><p>  The next view with the unusual name "raglan", which is connected with the name of the baron, who first tried on such a sleeve, is sewn along an oblique line going from the armpit towards the neck.  Baron Raglan had a seriously injured shoulder, which he was always very shy of.  And such a sleeve hid this defect from prying eyes. </p><p>  The external perception of clothing largely depends on the shape of the product.  It is the sleeve that affects the overall silhouette of clothing, determining its stylistic affiliation.  Nowadays, when sewing women's wardrobe items, the considered types of sleeves are often combined. </p><h2>  Types of cut sleeves </h2><p>  All known options for sleeves, varying in cut, can be listed for a very long time.  If you take the shape as a criterion, then the following types of sleeves are distinguished (photo is presented below): flared, straight and narrowed. </p>

Also on this item of clothing may or may not be cuffs. </p><p>  The following is a description of the most common sleeve types. </p><h2>  "Flashlight" </h2><p>  Most often used in short execution.  Gives the image flirty and romantic, making the shoulder line and the entire upper <span>shoulder girdle</span> slightly elevated.  Therefore, it looks better on girls with narrow shoulders and a long neck.  Also suitable for those who have a much lower upper body volume. </p>

    <p>  For the first time, the sleeve "flashlight" was tried on by the famous actress Marlene Dietrich, known for her extravagance and eccentricity. </p><h2>  "Wing" </h2><p>  Some types of sleeves appeared a long time ago, including a ‚Äúwing‚Äù.  Such clothes began to be cut back in the 15th century.  The outfits with the ‚Äúwings‚Äù of the French court, who sewed them from thin fluttering fabrics, so that the sleeves looked like real wings, were especially fond of. </p><p>  Now this type is used when sewing <span>women's t-shirts,</span> shirts and dresses.  How the product will look, largely depends on how the ‚Äúwing‚Äù is sewn.  It can be left free, assembled on the bottom line or sewn completely. </p><p>  Clothing with ‚Äúwings‚Äù is suitable for owners of beautiful slender hands.  Also looks great on girls with a pear-shaped type. </p><h2>  Kimono </h2><p>  The name can easily determine the homeland of this type of sleeve.  Of course, this is Japan.  It is there that it is used when sewing a traditional folk costume.  In this country, kimono is the leader in popularity of long sleeves.  Outside of Japan, it is performed in short or medium length variations. </p>

    <p>  Not suitable for girls with magnificent breasts and a voluminous shoulder girdle, as they increase them even more visually. </p><h2>  Shuttlecock </h2><p>  Originally used exclusively in children's clothing, but is now widely used in the tailoring of summer sundresses and blouses for women.  It is a strip of lace or fabric sewn in such a way that creates a visual effect of soft waves. </p><p>  Gives the image femininity and mischief.  Clothing with shuttlecocks suits girls with an angular figure, as it smooths lines and rounds off sharp transitions.  At the same time, too thin miniature persons look like teenagers in similar clothes, so such girls should abandon shuttlecocks. </p><h2>  Sleeves on a wedding dress </h2><p>  Here, the main importance is attached to the combination of a sleeve with a skirt and bodice.  The length largely depends on the time of year and the desire of the bride. </p>
