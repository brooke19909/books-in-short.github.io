The area protected by the Atlas Mountains and warmed by the winds of the Sahara desert in the region of Agadir has special climatic conditions: 340 sunny days a year, moderately high temperatures in summer, unusually warm winters without wind and the ability to swim all year round. </p><p>  The famous beaches of Agadir in Morocco - one of the most wonderful creations of nature.  Only for their sake, numerous European tourists come here all year round.  The stretched 10-kilometer promenade is considered one of the best in the world.  At this modern resort, everything is created for a comfortable and varied vacation.  Thanks to modern hotels, snow-white buildings, European cafes and wide flowering boulevards, Agadir is not like the typical cities of traditional Morocco.  It is a modern, dynamic, cosmopolitan city, looking to the future. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hotelsatlas.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beaches of Agadir" class="if uuid-2312303" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2312303.jpg"></div><h2>  General information </h2><p>  Situated on the coast of the Atlantic Ocean at the very foot of the Atlas Mountains, Agadir is located north of the place where the Sousse flows into the ocean.  The city is located 250 kilometers southwest of Marrakech and 508 kilometers south of Casablanca.  The common Berber noun ‚Äúagadir‚Äù in Morocco means ‚Äúwall, fence, fortified building, citadel‚Äù.  There are several more cities with this name in the country.  The full name of the modern resort sounded like Agadir n-Yigir, literally - "the cape fortress", which refers to the closest cape Cape Reer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Agadir and Marrakech are the most important tourist centers of Morocco, and for the seaside resort it is one of the main sources of income.  The city is also the most important commercial and fishing port for catching sardines in the country.  The main city business should also include the export of vegetables, fruits, citrus fruits produced in the fertile Sousse Valley. </p><h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  There are practically no historical and architectural sights of Morocco in Agadir.  All buildings were erected since 1960, after the city was completely destroyed by an earthquake.  From antiquities, only one wall has been preserved.  But this does not mean that the city does not have its own history. </p><p>  The oldest cartographic name of Porto Mesegin, a settlement on the site of modern Agadir, can be found on a 1325 map.  But among the Berber tribes, this habitable place was mentioned as early as the 12th century under the name Mesgina or Xima.  In 1572, here, on the top of the hill, at the behest of the second Saad Sultan of Morocco, Moulay Abdallah al-Ghalib, the Casbah fortress was built.  The city beyond its walls is called Agadir N'Igir. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.planetware.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The surviving wall of the city fortress" class="if uuid-2312282" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2312282.jpg"></div><p>  In the 17th century, the city was an important harbor in trade relations with Europe.  However, there was neither a port nor a marina.  Agadir mainly sold sugar, wax, copper, leather and hides.  Europeans brought goods, in particular, weapons and textiles.  During the reign of Sultan Moulay Ismail (1645-1727) and his successors, trade with France flourished.  In 1731, the city was completely destroyed by an earthquake, and then the harbor of Agadir was closed, since another port of Essaouira successfully functioned to the north. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.dialysenour.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Evening marina in Agadir" class="if uuid-2312308" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2312308.jpg"></div><p>  In 1746, the Dutch created a trading post at the foot of the Kasbah and, under the direction of the Sultan, helped rebuild the city.  Over the fortress gates of Kasba, the Dutch inscription dating back to 1746: "Fear of God and the honor of the king."  The prosperity of the city did not last long.  In 1760, Sultan Alavit Muhammad bin Abdullah ordered the harbor to be closed.  Agadir has become a ghost town with several houses.  In 1881, the Sultan Moulay Hassan reopened the agadir harbor to trade and provide marine expeditions in the south (1882‚Äì1886) against the Spanish and English ships. </p><p>  After France acquired (1905‚Äì1911) most of Moroccan territory, the first pier near Funti was built in 1916, and after 1920 a port was built under the French protectorate in the Talbort area.  Two years later, next to Talbort, along the Tildi River Fault, the construction of the popular Yakhchech region began.  By 1930, Agadir became the most important point of the French airmail A√©ropostale, which at one time was visited by the famous pilots of Saint Exupery and Mermos. </p><p>  In the 1930s, the center of Agadir began to be built up.  The city continued to grow, and since 1950, after the opening of a new commercial port, the fishing industry, canning, agriculture and mining developed.  Thanks to its unique climate and modern hotels, Agadir has become famous as a popular resort.  By 1960, the city had over 40,000 inhabitants when an earthquake destroyed the city at midnight on February 29, burying more than a third of the population under ruins. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Reviews about Agadir </h2><p>  Morocco annually attracts many tourists with its resorts, culture, special oriental atmosphere, the originality of old cities and unique cuisine.  Agadir is not distinguished by the traditional Moroccan environment, and yet it remains the best resort in the country.  And this is a merit not only of the famous beaches.  The city is modernly beautiful and well-groomed, with many excellent golf clubs, bars, restaurants, entertainment and sports facilities.  It is a good place for sailors and boat trips along the coast.  The resort hotels and tourist centers organize interesting excursions to the urban area and longer day trips from Agadir to Morocco. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelfooddrink.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="general view of the city" class="if uuid-2312311" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2312311.jpg"></div><p>  Judging by the opinions of tourists who visited this resort, the trip leaves a stunning impression and a desire to return here again.

The remains of the ramparts remind us that once behind the walls of the fortress was a noisy and bustling city with narrow, curved streets.  Against the bright blue sky, the old walls look picturesquely picturesque, and the remains of the Kasbah walls, located on the hillside, provide excellent panoramic views of Agadir and the Atlantic coast.  By the end of the day before sunset, lighting provides the best conditions for spectacular photographs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.orangesmile.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The Great Mosque of Agadir" class="if uuid-2312283" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2312283.jpg"></div><p>  The city center has several interesting monuments.  The Grand Mosque is an Art Nouveau structure, very unique among religious buildings in Morocco.  According to holidaymakers, in Agadir, a collection of ethnic objects of the traditional Berber culture, located in three halls of the Amazigov Museum (Passage Ait Souss), is quite interesting.  Here you can see a collection of weapons, textiles, ceramics, talismans, manuscripts, precious jewelry of the indigenous people of the coast. </p><h2>  Remote tours </h2><p>  Crocopark Wildlife Sanctuary is 14 km east of Agadir.  This is the home of Nile crocodiles, which until the beginning of the 20th century were common in Morocco, but completely exterminated by hunters.  In this park you can see these terrible animals in the immediate vicinity and in almost natural surroundings.  In the park gardens a diverse exotic and local flora is represented. </p><p>  While relaxing in Agadir in Morocco, you should not miss a trip to the city of Tiznit, which is 97 km south of the resort.  Tinsit is one of the best places in the country to buy real Berber jewelry.  Located at the Anti-Atlas ridge, the city is surrounded by impressive fortifications.  Within the walls of the old city is a labyrinth of alleys and bazaars where traditional Tiznit jewelry and other handicrafts are sold.  Thursday is a weekly market day when you can experience the true exotic of local life. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.planetware.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Agadir Center" class="if uuid-2312286" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2312286.jpg"></div><p>  65 km south of Agadir is the Souss-Massa National Park, a unique abode of birds covering an area of ‚Äã‚Äã330 square kilometers.
