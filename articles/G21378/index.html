Already at the end of spring, the region is quite hot, and local residents are trying to get out to rest on the countryside.  And what could be better than basking in the gentle rays of the sun and plunging into cool water?  Since the beginning of June, the swimming season has already begun in the city, and Novosibirsk, who are alone, and who are companies and families, are sent to the coastal zones.  According to official figures, there are 15 beaches in Novosibirsk.  The most popular vacation spots for citizens are the following: Zvezda, Butrinsky Grove, Nautilus, Boomerang, Sun City, and, of course, the city beach.  In this article we will talk in detail about the most popular and picturesque of them - ‚ÄúBoomerang‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="boomerang beach" class="if" height="359" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/466306.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Characteristic of the Boomerang complex </h2><p>  The beach is located on the shores of the picturesque Ob Sea and has a length of 1200 meters.  Entrance here costs 150 rubles, and more than a hundred parking spaces are represented.  However, even taking a walk on foot from the barrier to the water is a real pleasure: birds singing, pine aroma, sun glare ... On the way, you will find many shops selling fragrant popcorn, milkshakes, beer, ice cream and soft drinks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Entertainment center </h2><p>  We want to note that the Boomerang beach (Novosibirsk) is not just a place where you can sunbathe and swim, it is also a whole entertainment complex.  It is located in a suburb of the metropolis, not far from the ObGES.  The territory of the complex is huge - as much as 99 hectares.  This is a pine forest, and the beach itself, and entertainment infrastructure.  In addition, rescuers and a medical service are constantly working here. </p><p>  It is Boomerang that can provide you the best service.  The beach, beautiful nature and all kinds of entertainment make this place very attractive for vacationers.

In winter, a ski base is especially popular.  Necessary equipment can be rented.  There is still an ice rink.  On holidays, it becomes a favorite place of entertainment for all citizens and tourists. </p>
