  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Legends of Prague: history, sights of the city, interesting facts</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The royal city of Prague is shrouded in many secrets, legends and myths.  Here, on every narrow street, inn and church, you can hear a unique ghost story.  It is believed that any legend is a real case, but strongly embellished by the next storyteller.  Enterprising Prague even counted objects in the city where you can meet with ghosts, and there were 2 thousand such places. </p><h2>  Tyn Church </h2><p>  This is a real symbol of the city - two pointed towers towering over the roofs of houses.  This temple is ancient, it is already more than seven centuries old.  The construction of the church lasted about two centuries, so the architectural styles are mixed in the building, because each ruler tried to bring something of his own to the structure. </p><p>  There is an <span>interesting legend of</span> Prague associated with the <span>Tyn Church.</span>  In the old days, a very greedy and angry mistress lived near the church.  She just plagued her maidservants.  One of the girls serving the lady was very pious, and as soon as she heard the bell of the temple, she immediately folded her hands and prayed.  Once again, when the mistress found her maid for prayer, she plagued her to death.  After that, the evil woman woke up conscience, and she went to nuns, and bequeathed her good to poor people, and part of it was given to the construction of a bell for the Tyn Church.  Now the lady‚Äôs ghost walks at night and swings the language of the bell, which she herself gave money to. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thousandwonders.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tyn Church" class="if uuid-2555959" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2555959.jpg"></div><h2>  Church of St. Jacob </h2><p>  In the old part of the city (between Republic Square and Old Town Square) there is a baroque church, very richly inlaid.  This is the second most important shrine in the city after St. Vitus Cathedral and the oldest Gothic building in the city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It was here that the count from Mitrovits rested on Chancellor Wratislav.  Besides the fact that the most beautiful sarcophagus is installed at the grave, there is a terrible legend of Prague around the burial place.  As the myth goes, after the burial of Vratislav from the crypt for a long time, rustling and terrifying sounds were heard.  At some point, it was decided to hide the sarcophagus and there they found the Chancellor in a sitting position.  Most likely, he was buried at the time when he was in a lethargic dream. </p><p>  Another legend of Prague associated with the cathedral, or rather with the withered human brush, which is located on the right side at the entrance.  According to the story, this is the hand of a thief who tried to rob a church, but was captured and could not be released without help, so he had to cut off his hand. </p><p>  Another legend says that the artist painting the main altar, during the period when there was a plague in the city, did not get sick until he finished the work.  As soon as the painting of the altar was completed, he immediately fell ill and died in speed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.prague.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of St. Jacob" class="if uuid-2555971" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2555971.jpg"></div><h2>  Royal way </h2><p>  It is unlikely that any of the tourists passed Celetnaya Street.  After all, this is a real royal path from the Powder Gate to Old Town Square.  There are many attractions on this street.  This is the house ‚ÄúAt the Golden Angel‚Äù, a house in the cubist style called ‚ÄúAt the Black Virgin‚Äù, an old mint. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There is a legend of old Prague associated with this street.  In the old days, a woman of easy virtue walking along Celetnaya Street decided to seduce the chaplain by exposing her breasts.  Outraged, he hit her with a cross on the head, and to death.  Frustrated by the deed, the chaplain died immediately.  It is believed that so they still wander this street together. </p><h2>  Velkoprzhevorskaya mill on the island of Kampa </h2><p>  This attraction is located near the Charles Bridge on the Chertovka River.  The island is not very pompous houses and a charming mill, which is associated with several legends of Prague. </p><p>  According to one legend, the mill previously belonged to a mill with an unbearable character.  She constantly entered into quarrels with neighbors, tormented workers and her husband.  In the light of this, the nickname Devil stuck to the woman.  The woman was so proud of it that she even called the artist to depict seven devils at the mill.  It is said that after the death of the mill the river calmed down, but Chertova remained. </p><p>  According to another version, the miller had a beautiful daughter, who was ready to give everything for meeting the prince.  And at some point, a person appeared in a dark robe that fulfilled all the wishes of the girl, including receiving an invitation to the ball.  However, after the ball, no one else saw the girl. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.absolutetours.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Velkoprzhevorskaya mill on the island of Kampa" class="if uuid-2555975" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2555975.jpg"></div><h2>  House "At the Golden Ring" </h2><p>  If not for the legends and stories of Prague, few would know about this house.  It is located on Tynskaya street. </p><p>  According to legend, merchants from other states have previously stayed in this house.  At some point, a careless ghost loses the ring that the local resident finds.  The truth is not clear how he learned that this is a ring of ghosts.  The story is silent about this.  However, later the ring was recognized as a symbol of protection from evil spirits and hung on a building above the entrance.  Now they must warn that it is better not to walk here at night, since you can meet a ghost who is looking for his ring. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.prague-stay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="House &quot;At the Golden Ring&quot;" class="if uuid-2555979" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2555979.jpg"></div><h2>  Museum of ghosts and legends in Prague </h2><p>  To get the most adrenaline, it is best to go to a museum dedicated to city ghosts and legends.  It is located near the Charles Bridge and is divided into two parts. </p><p>  On the ground floor there is a book, which is under the protection of the spirit of the whole city.  Many legends and myths will be told here.  In the basement, vacationers find themselves on the street of the Old City, where you can meet the Golem, gnomes and ghosts. </p><p>  Most of the emotions can be obtained on a night tour, when all the exhibits look much more intriguing and frightening. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum of ghosts and legends in Prague" class="if uuid-2555983" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2555983.jpg"></div><h2>  White Lady </h2><p>  You can believe or not believe in mystical stories, but there are so many ancient castles in the city that in some of them you can certainly find a ghost.  The most popular legend of Prague and the country is about the White Lady.  This lady was born in 1429 and named her at the birth of Perkhta.  At 20, the girl‚Äôs father forcibly gives her in marriage.  The husband turned out to be a real monster, and Perkhta decided to return home.  However, her father did not even let her on the threshold, and the woman had to return to her husband.  She had been married for 20 years, when her husband suddenly repented and began to apologize to his wife, but she was inexorable.  Then the husband shouted: ‚ÄúSo that you do not find peace even in the grave!‚Äù.  Three years after the death of her husband, Perkht also died.  And after that, periodically, the ghost of the White Lady appears in all five castles belonging to the Ro≈æmberk family. </p><p>  Many legends and ghosts of Prague teach a person not to lose hope.  Like, for example, the story of a silver fish.  According to legend, when the rich Myslyk fled from Prague, he melted all his silver coins into a fish and hid them in one of the walls of his house.  After some time, a new owner appeared in the house, but local authorities obliged him to build a new house instead of a dilapidated one.  This man had no money, and he was very upset, when he was ready to leave his possessions, he found a silver fish, which was enough to build a new house. </p>
