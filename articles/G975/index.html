It has long been called the territory in the northern Urals and the coast of the Arctic Ocean from the Yugorsky Shar Strait to the mouth <span>of the Taz River.</span>  The indigenous population of this region are the Voguls (Mansi) - the small people of eastern Siberia - and the Ostyaks (Khanty) - the general name of the Khanty, Ket, South and Selkup.  The first mentions of Khanty-Mansiysk in the written annals date back to the time of the conquest of Siberia in the sixteenth century.  In 1582, near the town of Prince Samara, a battle took place with Ermak squads, later the Samara Yam will be founded here, and later on, the village of Samarovo. </p><h2>  The modern history of Khanty-Mansiysk </h2><p>  In 1930, on the bank of the Irtysh River, twenty kilometers from the confluence with the Ob River, a workers' settlement was founded, originally called Ostyako-Vogulsk.  The newly formed national district received the same name.  Subsequently, the Ostyaks changed their name to Khanty, and the Voguls - to Mansi, the okrug and the village were also renamed.  Khanty-Mansiysk received the status of the city in 1950, after merging with the ancient village of Samarovo, and in the 1980s several large oil fields were discovered at once, which gave a rapid impetus to the development of the city and infrastructure.  Khanty-Mansiysk hotels began to be actively built after the opening of a ski center of world significance.  On the biathlon ski runs, not only championships of all-Russian significance are held, but also the stages of the World Cup, world and European championships, and summer biathlon competitions.  Khanty-Mansiysk became the chess capital of Russia, four World Chess Cups for men were held here, and the thirty-ninth World Chess Olympiad was held at the chess academy (built in 2010). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Khanty-Mansiysk Hotels" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41210/1230665.jpg" width="480"></div>
