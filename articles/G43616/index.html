In fact, there are several rather interesting approaches that will surely please any user.  Only not all of them are 100% safe.  There are some of our methods that could compromise your <span>personal data.</span>  Thus, you should not try all the options at once.  It‚Äôs better to choose what suits you best.  Let's quickly figure out how to send MMS from a computer to a phone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to send mms from computer to phone" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/849623.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  From the operator‚Äôs site </h2><p>  So, the first scenario is the use of official websites of mobile operators.  Honestly, not everyone has such a function.  So you have to try pretty hard to find the site that you need. </p><p>  As a rule, if you are thinking about how to transfer MMS from a computer to a phone using the page of a mobile operator, then you will have to go through authorization.  This is done using your mobile phone.  Next, find the item "Send MMS online" (or something like that), upload a picture, write a message, and then complete the action. </p><p>  It is worth noting immediately that sometimes this pleasure is paid.  Cash will be charged to your mobile number.  Although, as a rule, operators try to give free sending of several messages per day.  Very comfortably.  Now it‚Äôs worth knowing how else to send MMS from a computer to a phone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="send mms from computer to phone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/849622.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hostings </h2><p>  The second scenario that can only be offered to the modern user is the use of specialized hosting services.  They, as a rule, allow you to easily send MMS from a computer to a phone, as well as write messages. </p><p>  There are such sites where you have to indicate your name, and there are those where anonymous sending is possible.  Honestly, such hosting services have become very popular in the modern world.  It is they who are used to using users.  They only do this with extreme caution. </p><p>  The work of specialized sites is based on the fact that you must compose a message, upload a picture or any other document, then indicate your name (if necessary) and the number of the recipient.  After that, click on the submit button - and everything is done.  You can wait for the processing of the request and the result. </p><p>  It is worth noting the fact that MMS can be sent from a computer to a phone for free a limited number of times a day.  This is usually about 5 posts.  Enough for regular use.  So, you won‚Äôt be able to especially ‚Äúhave fun‚Äù.  But you can try to resort to other methods.  Let us get to know them as soon as possible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to transfer mms from computer to phone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/849621.jpg"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Payment for services </h2><p>  Sending mms from computer to phone can be unlimited.  Honestly, for this you will have to use paid services designed for this undertaking.  This is a very suspicious offer.  Nevertheless, some users often trust paid hosting. </p><p>  There, as a rule, they will demand from you your mobile number, recipient number, after which you will have the option to select anonymity for sending.  Compose a message, attach the necessary document, and then continue to work with the site.  Click on submit.  You should receive a special message with a security code.  Enter it in the window that appears on the monitor screen, and then wait for the result. </p><p>  As you can see, solving the task set before us today is quite easy.  Only here there are some risks.  We will talk about them a little later.  In the meantime, you should learn how to send MMS from a computer to a phone using other methods.  After all, there are still enough of them. </p><h2>  Applications </h2><p>  Well, now let's try to figure out another very interesting approach.  If you are already familiar with sending SMS messages from a computer, then there will be no problems with MMS.  After all, now we will talk about such an option as the use of special programs to achieve the goal. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sending mms from computer to phone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/849620.jpg"></div>

    <p>  As a rule, it‚Äôs quite simple to download and install something suitable for yourself.  After that, launch the application, specify the sending number, subscribe (as you want) and create a message.  You load a document into it (the "Download" button appears, or something like that), and then wait for the process to finish.  Once the message is formed, you can send it to a friend.  Click on "Submit" and wait a while. </p><p>  Usually all mms and sms sent from the program are not limited.  And applications for this purpose are free.  For this reason, many users prefer this particular scenario.  Only now finding something suitable and working well is difficult.  After all, sometimes you have to wait for a sent message for about a day.  Not a very nice result, right?  For this reason, some users prefer to use specialized paid analogues of applications to send messages from a computer to a mobile phone.  But there is another interesting move that we have not yet studied.  Let's get to know him soon. </p><h2>  Social Pages </h2><p>  For example, each user who only uses social pages has the ability to send a message or MMS to his friend for free.  For this, a cell must be entered in his profile.  What will have to be done to achieve this goal? </p><p>  In truth, there are some pretty interesting approaches here.  The first is the installation of specialized add-ons for social networks.  After you put them on your computer, it will be enough just to choose a comrade with a cell in the questionnaire, and then write a message to him.  Next - download the attached document and click on submit.  Very convenient and easy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mms from computer to phone for free" class="if" height="427" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/849619.jpg" width="600"></div>

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Nevertheless, quite often you can do without additional content.  To do this, simply log in to the social network, then select a friend there with a mobile number in the profile, and then click on "Send message to phone" (or something like that, the labels may differ).  Form SMS (mms), and then click on the send button.  That's all.  A few minutes of waiting - and all problems are resolved. </p><h2>  Communication Applications </h2><p>  If you still think about how to send MMS from a computer to a phone, then you can try to use communication applications.  For example, Skype.  There you can easily realize the idea.  It‚Äôs worth noting right away that this service is paid here. </p><p>  Log in to the program, and then select the desired contact.  By the way, a person should already have a number in his profile.  Now select "Send SMS".  Here you can download the document, as in regular MMS.  Actually, do it, and then write the text of the message itself.  Next, click on "Submit."  That‚Äôs all. </p><h2>  The risks </h2><p>  So, today we talked with you about how to send MMS from a computer to a phone in all possible ways.  Honestly, as already mentioned, not all approaches are absolutely safe.  Some of them are risky.  Let's think about the dangers that may lie in wait for us. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to send mms from computer to phone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/849617.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  The first option is a collision with viruses.  They are downloaded from hosting services (mainly from paid ones) to computers and phones of the sender.  Getting rid of them is not so easy. </p><p>  The second scenario is fraud.  They charge you a fee for unsent MMS, and they also begin to systematically write off a certain amount of money from your account.  This is also a kind of virus.  Now you know how to send mms from computer to phone. </p>
