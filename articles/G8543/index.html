    <p>  Many tourist camps are located in nearby villages, for example, in Esto-Sadka, which is part of the Krasnaya Polyana (Sochi) district.  Sights (photos show this) include not only ski slopes, restaurants and bars, but also the ruins of the ancient fortress Achips (7th century), the largest apiary in the district Mountain Garden, where you can taste fresh honey, and a small copy of the Cheops pyramid.  Made of wood, this pyramid is a tool for studying the influence of its shape on water, people and metals.  Anyone can freely enter it and become part of the experiment. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Trinity St. George Monastery </h2><p>  The Trinity-St. George‚Äôs Convent belongs to the category of ‚Äúnew attractions in Sochi‚Äù.  Krasnaya Polyana can be proud of its appearance on its land, as there are only 3 churches where you can pray for dead suicides and unbaptized people. </p><p>  The monastery was built surrounded by mountains in a very picturesque place on the territory of a closed recreation center.  In the clearing around a small pond there are 4 temples of amazing beauty and residential buildings for nuns and pilgrims. </p>

    <p>  If Krasnaya Polyana (Sochi) is chosen for ecotourism, the attractions in the summer in this region are its lakes and sources.  For lovers of hiking, hiking trips are organized during which you can enjoy both beautiful views and the cleanest air, as well as the flora and fauna of these places. </p><h2>  Ski resorts </h2><p>  The pride of Krasnaya Polyana is its international ski slopes and hotels with high-level service. </p><p>  The bases serving tourists are divided into categories, so each client can pre-select a place to stay in economy, standard or VIP class.  The ski slopes meet all world-class standards, which puts them on a par with the famous ski resorts in European countries. </p><p>  Competitions in alpine skiing, biathlon, bobsled and freestyle are held here, but this does not scare away those who decided to go skiing for the first time.  Experienced instructors will teach you to walk confidently and descend from the mountains.  Famous Olympic ski slopes - this is what Krasnaya Polyana (Sochi) can boast of.  Sights in the winter include, among other things, tracks of various difficulty levels, which attracts winter sports enthusiasts from all over the country and from abroad. </p><h2>  Dolmens </h2><p>  Mysterious ancient dolmens are located near the village of Krasnaya Polyana, the true purpose of which is still unknown to scientists.  These stone structures made of heavy monolithic slabs are more than 4000 years old, and today they are considered the best preserved in the country. </p>

    <p>  Krasnaya Polyana dolmens have entrances at ground level, they are small in size and more resemble tombs.  Since dolmens were found at the foot of <span>Mount Achishkho,</span> scientists suggest that there are many more, just other objects are still sprinkled with earth and stones due to mountain collapses. </p><p>  You can get to these places either by jeep or on foot (about an hour). </p><h2>  Rybino </h2><p>  For lovers of fishing and delicious healthy food, about 20 years ago, the Rybino complex was built, located in an inaccessible place among 3 lakes.  To get to this fish paradise, you should either travel by SUV yourself or call them from the complex. </p><p>  Spent efforts will not seem in vain.  Great fishing for <span>lake trout,</span> carp and carp makes even a beginner feel like an experienced fisherman.  Local cooks will immediately prepare a delicious lunch from the caught fish, and while it is being prepared, clients can relax and take a steam bath in a real Russian bathhouse. </p><p>  For children, a real adventure will be to visit the local small zoo, in which animals can be stroked and fed. </p><p>  Holidays in Krasnaya Polyana can be so varied that even "seasoned" travelers speak of this area as a place where dreams come true of the most exciting adventures.  For this, Krasnaya Polyana has everything you need. </p><h2>  Cableway </h2><p>  What other attractions does Krasnaya Polyana (Sochi) represent?  <span>The cable car</span> opens up a lot of interesting things.
