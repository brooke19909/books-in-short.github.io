Everything is built in, from washing machines to fryers and ovens.  This bowl and microwave ovens, which are one of the most common household kitchen appliances, have not passed.  In this article, let's try to figure out what are built-in microwave ovens? </p><p>  The main purpose of built-in appliances is convenience and space saving.  By its functionality, built-in microwave ovens are not much different from ordinary ones, but due to the fact that the oven is integrated directly into the kitchen furniture, it perfectly complements the interior of the kitchen.  Modern <span>built-in microwave ovens</span> can do a lot.  Having an expanded set of functions, a microwave oven can replace not only an oven, but also a hob.  Built-in <span>microwave ovens</span> save not only the kitchen space, but also time.  A microwave becomes indispensable when you need to quickly warm up or defrost something.  A microwave oven with grill is especially popular.  In it you can cook chicken with a delicious crispy crust.  In addition to the grill function, a microwave oven may have other, equally useful features.  In it you can stew meat, cook vegetables and bake pies.  All this can be done in the microwave without spending a lot of time.  With an impressive range of features, the microwave is much smaller than an electric or gas oven.  The modest dimensions allow you to integrate a microwave oven into almost any empty niche in the kitchen.  Cooked in the microwave products in their taste are no different from those cooked in the oven.  The only difference is the way the products are processed.  If natural gas or electricity is used in the oven for these purposes, then microwave ovens use microwave waves <span>.</span>  Products processed in this way pose absolutely no threat to humans.  To protect against radiation, the microwave housing is securely insulated and a protective net is applied to the door.  Another difference between a microwave oven and an oven or hob is that you do not have to adjust the power level of the burner.  A special program selected for the preparation of a product will itself control the process. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the modern market there has long been a tendency for a rather dynamic demand for built-in household and kitchen appliances.  Built-in microwave ovens have recently begun to enjoy no less popularity than stoves and ovens.  This can be explained by the fact that the cost of a microwave oven is much lower, and space in the kitchen will require less.  Microwaves are much more economical in terms of electricity consumption compared to <span>electric stoves.</span>  A variety of color solutions allows you to successfully integrate the microwave into any kitchen furniture.  For a light-colored kitchen, a white built-in microwave is an excellent choice.  Unlike an oven, a microwave oven will not cause excessive stuffiness in the kitchen, which means that the hostess will be relieved of the constant discomfort associated with cooking.  Built-in microwave ovens seriously and for a long time won the respect of users due to such qualities as simplicity, convenience, functionality, small dimensions and the ability to install not only in the interior of your home kitchen, but also in the office. </p><p>  Today, world-class companies are engaged in the production of embedded microwave ovens, which means that these indispensable household assistants have a great future ahead.  Quite a good demand among Russians is the use of products from such well-known companies as Electrolux, Bosch and Siemens.  In general, for most models, even from different manufacturers, the functions are similar, they can differ only in name.  Choose a microwave based on your own preferences.  If the main purpose of the microwave oven will consist only in defrosting or heating food, then there is no point in overpaying for a bunch of unnecessary functions.  Those who have seriously decided to cook in the microwave oven should pay attention to the microwave ovens, which have the grill function and there are programs that allow you to cook this or that dish. </p>
