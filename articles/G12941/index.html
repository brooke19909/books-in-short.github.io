Uniformity marking</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  How to embroider at uniform?  And what is it all about?  Not everyone who learns to sew is interested in learning how to embroider.  Some are intimidated by the variety of seams, while others prefer the process to not be too simple.  If you are new to the world of needlework, there is a possibility that you are concerned about the question of which fabric to use for hand embroidery. </p><h2>  The emergence of embroidery </h2><p>  Material is one of the key points for the project.  It will greatly influence the process of work and the final result, therefore it is natural to strive for a better option.  The fabrics used for embroidery come in a variety of threads and are made from cotton, linen and blends.  The choice will depend on what you plan to do and the embroidery technique you intend to use.  But there are so many nuances in this matter, and the choice is so wide that this can lead to confusion.  The technique of creating a pattern using various stitches is not a modern invention.  Previously, there was no uniform, comfortable for work, canvas, familiar to modern needlewomen.  What was embroidered on then?  Take a short digression into the past. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.topsimages.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Canva Aida 14" class="if uuid-3206929" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/3206929.jpg"></div><p>  The history of embroidery dates back to the Bronze Age.  In China, silk embroidery appeared around the V-III centuries.  BC .  Findings of embroidered fabrics in Greece date back to the same time.  In Europe, the earliest models use a stitch seam, chain stitch and split stitch.  In late antiquity, pieces of jewelry found on Coptic clothes and vestments were sometimes embroidered using these techniques.  Several techniques were used to make amazing medieval wall-mounted carpets, which were mostly preserved in monasteries.  The most famous of them, tapestry from Bayeux, was made using the technique of tambour stitching, stalk seam and the so-called Bayeux stitch, which is used only in Scandinavia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Of course, in ancient times there was no special canvas for embroidery and auxiliary elements to mark the pattern.  But still simple linen fabrics with uniform weaving of threads enjoy popularity among needlewomen.  Working with them is sometimes even easier than with a standard canvas from a set. </p><h2>  How to choose a fabric for embroidery </h2><p>  Like a canvas for the artist, the material is the basis of hand embroidery.  But which one to choose?  The answer may surprise you: anyone.  The most common option, which is found in cross-stitch kits - Canvas "Aida".  Its size and density depend on the plot.  Canvas "Aida 14" is the most popular and is considered the standard.  But, theoretically, you can go to the sewing or needlework store and choose what kind of fabric as the basis for your project.  Linen, cotton, muslin, which in some places are also called chintz, cambric, silk, quilted cotton, organza, twill, some synthetic fabrics, including viscose and polyester are suitable for this purpose, but it is better to avoid too elastic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cross stitch kits" class="if uuid-3206952" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/3206952.jpg"></div><p>  Usually, craftswomen do not limit themselves to just the standard materials offered by needlework stores.  Many of them prefer a special fabric - uniform, outwardly resembling canvas.  It can be of different colors and densities.  And the composition also varies.  Good options for uniforms for embroidery are materials with a looser weave.  These are muslin, cotton, linen, burlap. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Features of uniformity </h2><p>  In fact, you can use any fabric that is strong enough to withstand stitches and allows you to pass a needle and thread through it.  But there is one caveat.  Although you can use almost any fabric as the basis for your project, some parameters are more preferable for certain functions or because they are better suited to certain techniques. </p><p>  It is difficult to deduce one simple formula for a choice, but there is a way to narrow down your choice.  Tightly woven, evenly woven versions are best suited for surface work, while loose ones are ideal for hoods.  The fiber content in the fabric can even be a mixture of cotton, linen, viscose and polyester or even hemp and bamboo.  Before embroidering at uniform, it is important to choose a project and find out which fabric is best suited. </p><h2>  Material Experiments </h2><p>  Much depends on the technique.  When you are going to choose a fabric for a new project, pay attention to weaving.  The gaps between the threads should allow the needle to easily slip between them, no matter how many stitches you make.  But do not put yourself in a tight framework, choosing a specific fabric for some cases and not using ‚Äúinappropriate‚Äù for them.  Because it is more important to observe and navigate depending on the situation.  Perhaps you can break all these rules and successfully cope with the task even on fabric that is not suitable for your task. </p><h2>  Some terminology </h2><p>  Let's expand our embroidery vocabulary by learning a few useful terms to make it easier to find the right fabric.  Let's start with the most important definition: ground fabric.  This is the name of the material that you use as the base for your embroidery.  Sometimes, when the fabric is too fragile to support the seam, you can use a backing or stabilizer that you attach to the back of the ground fabric.  This additional layer makes the base more durable and able to withstand heavier seams. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="peacockandfig.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cross stitch paintings" class="if uuid-3206934" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/3206934.jpg"></div><p>  The basis is the type of thread in the weaving fabric, which runs parallel to the vertical edge and perpendicular to the weft.  Understanding what it is is important for cross-stitch.  When it is necessary to calculate the pitch for a stitch, it is usually said about the warp thread.  Crosses his ducks.  This is a type of thread running perpendicular to the edge.  He crosses the base, intertwining with him, creating a fabric on a loom.  Thus, a difference appears in the appearance and texture of the tissues.  The warp and weft can intersect in different ways and have different sizes and weights. </p><h2>  Why is it important </h2><p>  Number of threads is the number of threads per square inch of fabric in both directions.  This concept includes the number of both warp and weft.  In other words, the higher the number of threads, the denser the fabric.  Weak weaving makes the holes at the intersection of threads more obvious, which is convenient for some embroidery techniques, such as counting or cross stitching.  Dense weaving is more convenient for tight sewing, such as work on the surface.  Before embroidering on a uniform, it is important to determine where the fabric has the warp and weft, whether a stabilizer is needed and what is the number of threads in weaving.  This knowledge will help to make work faster and facilitate its process. </p><h2>  Preparation of uniformity for work </h2><p>  The smaller the weave, the easier the needle will go through, and fabrics with a denser weave can make it difficult and even pain for the fingers and hands, in the process of pulling the thread.  Before embroidering at uniform, it needs to be prepared in a special way.  In order to avoid shrinkage, it is recommended to wash and iron the fabric first.  Washing is especially useful if embroidery is part of a quilt or fabric sewn from pieces of fabric. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.scrappykatzcraftbarn.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cross stitch kits" class="if uuid-3206945" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/3206945.jpg"></div><p>  If you intend to use heavy embroidery with beads, buttons or thick stitches, you should use the appropriate stabilizer as the basis for the fabric.  This will facilitate the embroidery process with fabrics that are stretched.  Otherwise, the work may become a little more complicated, especially if it is knitwear, then the stitches can become very deformed.  Try a few fabrics to see which ones you like best. </p><h2>  How to embroider at uniform: master class </h2><p>  Another important advantage of using the studied fabrics is the low price per m2.  It costs several times cheaper than a special canvas for embroidery, and the finished work looks even more interesting.  The only thing, it is important to consider that the uniformity count after washing may decrease.  Therefore, it is so important to properly process the material before work. </p><p>  So, how to embroider at uniform?  If you carefully examine the fabric, it is easy to notice that outwardly it looks like a canvas.  Only the location of the holes is a little different.  With ordinary embroidery on a uniform, when the needle passes through holes located in adjacent corners, it will also produce a cross.  But two times smaller than on a standard canvas.  For example, the canvas "Aida 14", which was already mentioned earlier.  Therefore, to make a standard stitch, you need to count two weaves, and not one.  Another option is to embroider as usual.  Then, on the material, crosses will simply turn out to be half as much. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="uniform fabric" class="if uuid-3206937" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/3206937.jpg"></div><p>  When you are just starting to learn embroidery, it is best to use simpler and cheaper materials to practice.  For your more serious projects, it is better to buy a beautiful fabric.  Narrow your choices and choose the best quality that suits your budget.  Over time, you will develop an intuitive understanding of which fabric is best for your project. </p><h2>  How to mark the uniform </h2><p>  Another difficulty may arise when applying guidelines for embroidery.  In needlework stores, canvas can be sold immediately with a markup, but on a uniform it does not happen.  Therefore, to facilitate the process of embroidering the picture with a cross, you need to calculate how much fabric will be needed for the plot, and divide it into identical squares using a water-soluble marker.  A hint to the scheme will help you navigate. </p><h2>  How to transfer the plot to another fabric </h2><p>  The ratio of canvas and uniformity can be different.  Much depends on the manufacturer and type of fabric.  Cross stitch kits usually indicate which canvas is needed for the plot.  This value is called a count.  For canvas, this is the number of crosses or threads per inch.  It is possible to calculate how many there will be in 10 cm if you divide the canvas number by 2.54 and multiply by 10. Having obtained the desired size, it is easier to calculate how many holes you need to retreat to the fabric in order to fit the same plot on the even.  Then you need to measure with a ruler the length and width of the area corresponding to the outline of the canvas, and apply the markup.  For some specialized fabrics with uniform weaving, these calculations have already been made by other needlewomen. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cross stitch kits" class="if uuid-3206969" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/3206969.jpg"></div><h2>  Types of fabrics with uniform weaving </h2><p>  There are specialized variants of uniformity, similar in properties to Aida.  Evenweave is a type of fabric with the same number of warp and weft per square inch.  Her threads also have the same size and thickness.  Evenweave fabrics are similar in appearance to the canvas and are available in a wide range of colors.  The weave forms a balanced, even grid with visible holes between the threads.  The number of threads varies from 32 to 18 count.  This brand is popular among cross-stitch lovers due to its easy to count square pattern. </p><p>  Herta fabric is technically Aida and is ideal for beginners, because it is very easy to count the right number of crosses on it.  Hardanger fabric is a 100% 100-gauge cotton fabric.  She appeared in Norway and weaves with a double thread.  This option can be used for stitch embroidery and techniques where thread counting is required.  When using fabric for cross-stitch, you need to work through 2 threads.  As a result, 11 counts are obtained.  The pictures embroidered with a cross on such material look more accurate.  And holes in open areas are less noticeable than when using canvas. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cross stitch kits" class="if uuid-3206956" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/3206956.jpg"></div><h2>  Embroidery on a uniform for interior decoration </h2><p>  How to put the acquired knowledge into practice?  A wide range of cotton towels is also suitable for embroidery and can be used for both modern and retro designs.  Various finished products are also ideal for this type of needlework.  Embroidery can become an attractive decor for tablecloths, pillowcases and blankets.  Unusual decoration will be the plots made in this technique, on napkins, potholders and kitchen towels, overlapping with the design of your favorite dishes.  Personalize your shirt or apron by embroidering a monogram or unusual motif on them.  Any bride or new mother will appreciate such a gift made especially for their holiday. </p>
