This ancient platform in the distant past was part of the vast mainland of Gondwana.  In the Triassic period, under the influence of the external forces of the Earth, the high mountain ranges that existed on the ancient continent collapsed.  <span>Fractures of the earth's crust, the</span> formation of horsts, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions led to the formation of hilly plains, high plateaus, large hollows and new mountain peaks.  Africa is the only continent on which new mountain ranges were formed not in the zones of folded structures.  <span>The highest mountains of</span> Africa stretch on the East African plateau.  The mountain system of the Dragon Mountains was formed in the east of the southern part of the continent.  The south of the mainland is bordered by the flat-top Cape Mountains, and the Atlas Mountains stretch in the northwest.  Their northern ranges are located right at the junction of two plates of the lithosphere. </p>

The northwest coast of the mainland in the west is washed by the Atlantic Ocean, and in the east and north by the Mediterranean Sea.  In the south there is no clearly defined border with the Sahara; it is made up of the southern foothills of the Atlas mountain ranges, into which desert landscapes wedge.

The mountain system stretched from the Atlantic coast through Morocco, Algeria to the very shores of Tunisia.  It consists of the High Atlas, Tel Atlas, Sahara Atlas, Middle Atlas, Anti-Atlas ridges, internal plateaus and plains.  The highest point of North Africa and the High Atlas is Mount Tubkal, reaching a height of 4,167 m. It is also the highest North African mountain.  Atlas in this part of the mountain range is very similar to the Alps and the Caucasus.  In contrast, the Middle Atlas is a plateau-shaped peaks with cut deep gorges.  To the northeast, the Sahara Atlas serves as a continuation of the High Atlas.  South of the High Atlas is <span>the</span> Antiatlas <span>mountain range</span> - the outskirts of an ancient plate elevated by Cenozoic movements. </p>

In geological terms, the Atlas Mountains are also noteworthy in that they serve as a feeding area for the real sea of ‚Äã‚Äãgroundwater in the vast artesian basin, located under the world's largest <span>Sahara desert.</span>

    <p>  Along the Mediterranean coast, following the outlines of the coast, rise the young folded mountain ranges of the Reef Atlas, Tel Atlas up to 2,500 m high. They are a direct continuation of the mountains of Sicily and Southern Spain.  Many mountain peaks, including Tubkal, are extinct volcanoes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is interesting, but the local population of the Atlas does not have a single name for this mountain system; there are names of only individual plateaus and ranges.  The very names "Atlas Mountains", "Atlas" are not used by the local population.  They are accepted in Europe and originate in ancient myths in which they were glorified as the "Atlas Mountains", the mythological titan Atlant, or Atlas, which Perseus turned into an African mountain for refusing hospitality. </p><p>  The existence of the Atlas Mountains first became known from the travels of the Phoenicians.  A detailed description of the mountain system is contained in the writings of Maxim of Tire.  But significantly expanded the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe mountain range of the work of the outstanding German explorer of Africa Gerhard Rolf.  He, under the guise of a Muslim, crossed the High Atlas, clarified the map of mountain ranges, studied the largest oases and from the side of Algeria delved into the Sahara. </p>

    <p>  The features of the modern relief of the Atlas Mountains depend on a sharply continental and fairly dry climate.  Intensive weathering processes lead to the destruction of mountains and the accumulation of a large number of debris at their feet, among which are high ridges with fairly steep slopes and sharp peaks.  The relief is also distinguished by strong erosion dismemberment.  Mountain ranges cut through deep ravines, the surface of the inner plateaus intersects with a system of channels - a legacy of a bygone era. </p><p>  The Atlas Mountains are characterized by a Mediterranean climate.  However, it is unpredictable and depending on the height is quite severe.  Thus, the High Atlas region is characterized by a typical mountain climate with cool sunny summers and very cold winters.  <span>The average temperature</span> in summer reaches + 25‚Å∞, in winter the temperature sometimes drops to -20‚Å∞.  The nearby Atlas Mountains are notable for significant winter precipitation.  Flooding is common in this area. </p><p>  In summer, the surface of the internal valleys and plateaus are very warm, the temperature can reach + 50 ¬∞ C.  Nights, on the contrary, are quite cool and with frequent frosts. </p>

The lower parts of the slopes are covered with <span>dwarf palm</span> groves <span>,</span> evergreen shrubs, cork oak forests.  Higher slopes are covered with forests of yew and Atlas cedar.  Inland valleys, plateaus with saline scarce soils are semi-deserts and dry steppes.

    <p>  High in the mountains there are <span>alpine meadows that</span> differ in their species composition from European mountain meadows.  The peaks of the ranges themselves are devoid of vegetation and are covered with snow for a significant part of the year.  At the southern foothills of the mountains are desert zones with rare oases. </p><p>  The animal kingdom of the Atlas is represented by various species of animals in Africa and Southern Europe: daman, jerboas, hares, hyenas, jackals, wild cats and wyverns.  Magot is found on the rocks, as well as many snakes and lizards. </p><p>  The population of the High and Middle Atlas is concentrated at the foot of the mountains and in the valleys, where the land is cultivated and irrigated under plantings of olives, citrus fruits and other agricultural crops.  Grapes are grown on the terraces of the mountainsides.  The local population is also involved in cattle breeding, cultivation of hard cereal alpha - a valuable raw material for the manufacture of high-grade paper. </p>
