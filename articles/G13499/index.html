And many citizens live on credit.  Sometimes there is no money to buy, but something was urgently needed.  At such times, a loan is the only right decision.  And so the population draws up credit cards.  They are offered by various financial organizations. </p><p>  We have to consider a credit card "Conscience".  Reviews, whether it is worth discovering, how to formalize and what is the catch of plastic - all this will be described below.  In fact, everything is not as simple as it seems.  Conscience is a pretty good offer, but it‚Äôs not for everyone. </p>

    <h2>  Briefly about the map </h2><p>  What is this offer?  "Conscience" - a credit card that allows you to buy goods without overpayment.  That is, we are talking about an installment card.  With its help, purchases on credit seem extremely profitable. </p><p>  What does it mean?  A person will have to return exactly as much as he paid for the goods.  No interest rates or overpayments.  The main thing is not to have loan delinquencies.  Otherwise, the named bonus will burn out - the interest rate will appear. </p><h2>  Where to get </h2><p>  Many are interested in how and where to order a Conscience credit card.  To date, this operation has several solutions.  What is it about? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  First, the Conscience <span>credit card</span> application can be submitted online.  There is a special site on the web.  On it you can find a detailed description of the proposal and submit a request for the design of plastic. </p><p>  Secondly, the procedure is sometimes carried out in person.  To do this, a citizen will need to contact the Qiwi representative.  So far, credit cards are issued at Svyaznoy and Geobank.  But all over Russia.  The request is left in the form of a completed form of the established form. </p>

    <h2>  Registration via the Internet </h2><p>  What does a Conscience credit card provide?  Reviews, whether it is worth discovering, the pitfalls of using plastic - all this will be studied by us fully. </p><p>  Customers respond positively to ordering plastic online, emphasizing the availability of free courier delivery.  But the card will have to wait.  Sometimes a very long time. </p><p>  To leave a request for the manufacture of plastic, you will need: </p><ol><li>  Open the sovest.ru page in the browser. </li><li>  In the upper right corner, click on the "Leave a request" button. </li><li>  Fill in the appeared fields. </li><li>  Answer the operator‚Äôs call and confirm the fact of the order. </li></ol><p>  Done!  You can immediately discuss the features of delivery, and then wait for the plastic.  If you believe the reviews, the operator will call back approximately 10-15 minutes after sending the corresponding request. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Activate plastic </h2><p>  Once the card is delivered, it will have to be activated.  Without this operation, taking advantage of Qiwi‚Äôs capabilities will not work. </p><p>  Should I open a Conscience credit card?  Customer reviews emphasize that this plastic really suits many.  But it gives a lot of trouble.  Activation is one of the problems. </p><p>  The thing is that quite often Conscience is made, but they are not allowed to use plastic - the activation process does not work.  There are often reasons for this.  Only about them on the site with information about the card does not say anything. </p>

    <p>  In general, to activate the plastic, you will need to send the card number (message) to the phone 5152. After that, just make a purchase - and it's done!  No features, difficulties or complex operations. </p><p>  Usually, bona fide customers activate quickly and without fail.  But due to a system failure, the procedure may be denied.  Unfortunately, this does happen.  Conscience is a relatively new project.  And therefore, he has observed some malfunctions. </p><h2>  Who will be given </h2><p>  Not everyone can get a Conscience credit card.  The conditions for issuing plastic are loyal, but you still need to remember about them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  So, a citizen who meets the following requests can count on a successful request processing: </p><ul><li>  citizenship of the Russian Federation; </li><li>  the availability of stable earnings; </li><li>  lack of open loans and delinquencies; </li><li>  good credit history; </li><li>  age not less than 18 years (16 - with emancipation). </li></ul><p>  There is nothing extremely difficult to understand.  Every adult citizen of the Russian Federation has the right to issue plastic "Conscience". </p><h2>  Opportunities </h2><p>  Should I open a Conscience credit card?  Responses of owners emphasize that this plastic is a tempting offer.  It really allows you to buy without overpayment.  This is not a scam. </p>

    <p>  The "Conscience" installment card offers the following features: </p><ul><li>  action - 5 years; </li><li>  service - 290 rubles for 1 year and 590 for the following; </li><li>  Delivery is free; </li><li>  reissue - 590 rubles; </li><li>  restoration - 690 rubles; </li><li>  loan rate - 0%; </li><li>  late fee - 290 rubles per month + 10% per annum; </li><li>  SMS informing - free of charge; </li><li>  installment period - from 1 to 12 months; </li><li>  credit restrictions - from 5 to 300 thousand rubles. </li></ul><p>  All this is reported even before issuing a bank card.  Therefore, there is nothing surprising in terms of use. </p><h2>  Where to pay </h2><p>  A Conscience card with bad credit history is almost never issued to customers.  More precisely, in this case, plastic activation will not take place.  This is a normal phenomenon that many people talk about. </p><p>  Which bank issues a Conscience credit card?  Qiwi!  This is a fairly large organization, but so far there is not a single Qiwi bank in Russia.  But the company has many partners. </p><p>  And this is very helpful!  The thing is that plastic "Conscience" does not work at all points.  They are allowed to pay only in Qiwi partner stores.  For third parties, the card will not work. </p>

Every month the list becomes more and more. </p><h2>  About cash </h2><p>  <span>Is it possible to withdraw cash from a</span> Conscience <span>credit card</span> ?  This question worries many citizens.  After all, it is often necessary to quickly withdraw the nth amount from a bank card. </p><p>  Unfortunately, Qiwi does not allow its customers to cash out funds on Conscience plastic.  Many citizens complain about this.  The studied offer works only by bank transfer.  And in no ATMs cash according to "Conscience" will not be issued. </p>

    <h2>  About closing </h2><p>  Should I open a Conscience credit card?  Reviews about this plastic are left of a different type.  Among them are not the best opinions. </p><p>  For example, some emphasize that refusing a bank card will be problematic.  Therefore, you will have to carefully weigh the pros and cons before filling out the appropriate application. </p><p>  This is due to the fact that Qiwi does not have a single branch.  Therefore, to close the plastic, you must either independently contact the company‚Äôs representative office (it is located in Moscow), or send a request by mail.  In this case, the existing plastic will also have to be returned to the bank.  Of course, it is sent by mail.  These are certain risks. </p><h2>  Using </h2><p>  Otherwise, the plastic does not have any features.  Should I open a Conscience credit card?  The reviews of its holders indicate that this is not a scam at all.  The card really works.  Its main drawback is the ability to pay for purchases only at Kiwi partner stores. </p><p>  Using plastic is easy.  It has a special chip for contactless payments.  It is enough to attach it to the reader.  Or you can pay for purchases by the standard method - like a regular debit card of any bank. </p><p>  In some cases, you have to repeat the operation several times - sometimes there are malfunctions in the work of "Conscience" cards.  But if you persevere and be patient, you can still pay for the goods.  Even large banks occasionally experience malfunctioning plastic maintenance. </p><h2>  To take or not to take </h2><p>  So is it worth it to open a Conscience credit card?  Feedback on this proposal, as already noted, is different.  Someone is pleased with the cooperation with Kiwi, but someone did not like it. </p><p>  In general, if a citizen plans to buy a lot from Qiwi partners, it is recommended to take a closer look at the offer.  With timely loan payments, the Conscience card will be very useful.  For those who do not cooperate with Kiwi partners, this plastic is simply not needed. </p>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  We found out what the Conscience card is.  How to arrange it, what conditions does it offer, what might its holders face?  We answered all these questions. </p><p>  It is impossible to say exactly how successful the Conscience project is.  He appeared in Russia recently (at the beginning of 2017).  But since then, Qiwi bank cards have come a long way.  Their service is actively developing, and defects and failures are eliminated.  Therefore, it is recommended to look at the plastic.  The main thing to remember is that you can‚Äôt pay with them everywhere.  Then there will be no claims to the proposal.  Those who actively use the "Conscience" installment card are satisfied with their decision. </p>
