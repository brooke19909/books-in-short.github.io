How to get from Sheremetyevo to Domodedovo with the least expenditure of time and nerves?  Several options are possible here.  And their choice may depend on various factors. </p><h2>  <strong>How to get from Sheremetyevo to Domodedovo</strong> by rail </h2><p>  For a long time, the fact that traffic jams are the main obstacle when moving along the motorways of the city of Moscow is no longer special news.  The fight with them is how constant, so unsuccessful.  And the only guaranteed way to not be late for your flight to the airport is to choose a mode of transport that is completely independent of traffic jams.  This is, of course, the railway.  Many, especially those who often have to fly, have long answered for themselves the question of how to get from Sheremetyevo to Domodedovo.  Of course, Aeroexpress.  Even with transfers.  But in any case, it turns out to be more convenient and faster, especially when there is no need to call in somewhere along the route through Moscow.  Rail transport runs on schedule and does not depend on traffic jams. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get from sheremetyevo to domodedovo" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/348726.jpg" width="496"></div>

Have to go with transfers.  We analyze the route.  From Sheremetyevo "Aeroexpress" we follow to the Belorussky railway station.  It will take about forty minutes of time and will cost 320 rubles.  Here we change to the metro and follow the Koltsevaya line from the Belorusskaya station to the Paveletskaya station.  This will take no more than fifteen minutes and require expenses for one trip on the subway, depending on the form of payment.  And at the Paveletsky train station, you will again have to board the already familiar Aeroexpress.  He leaves in the direction of Domodedovo with a frequency of half an hour.  Travel time is about fifty minutes, and the cost of the trip remains unchanged, all the same 320 rubles.  And this route, according to experienced people, is optimal.  The best answer to the question of how to get from Sheremetyevo to Domodedovo has not yet been invented.  Even taking into account the fact that at night the Aeroexpress train interval sometimes increases, you will not be late for your flight. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="taxi sheremetyevo domodedovo" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/348725.jpg?1394116445802" width="493"></div>

    <h2></h2><h2>  Taxi Sheremetyevo - Domodedovo </h2><p>  This option is quite acceptable for those who are not limited in funds.  The cost of such a trip varies from two to three and a half thousand rubles.  If you share the indicated price with fellow travelers, then this is quite acceptable.  The distance between the two airports is 90 kilometers.  Travel time is 1 hour 45 minutes.  Of course, this is without taking into account traffic jams, which are not uncommon on the Moscow Ring Road, especially during peak hours.  Therefore, taxis are most often chosen at night, when the subway does not work and there are no traffic jams on the Ring Road.  At night you can not be afraid of the prospect of being late for the flight. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Domodedovo Sheremetyevo Aeroexpress" class="if" height="249" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/348727.jpg?1394116514075" width="496"></div>

    <h2></h2><h2>  Other routes from Sheremetyevo to Domodedovo </h2><p>  It often happens that on the way from one airport to another you need to visit some points of the city.  In this situation, having finished business, you should get in the direction of the <span>Domodedovo metro station of the</span> Zamoskvoretskaya line.  Contrary to its name, a fairly decent distance separates this metro station from the airport.  But it is from here that it is most convenient to leave in the direction of Domodedovo by public transport.  The road will take no more than half an hour.  Regular buses and taxis depart from the metro at intervals of 15 minutes. </p>
