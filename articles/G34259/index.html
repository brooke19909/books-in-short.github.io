  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How long to fly to Morocco from Moscow: consider all options</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Naturally, all travelers want to know how long they will need to get to their final destination.  And their curiosity, spurred by impatience, increases many times as tourists go to the resort.  Well, the interest of travelers about travel time is justified.  In this article we will try to clarify the question of how much to fly to Morocco from Moscow.  This problem seems simple at first glance.  Measure the distance between Moscow and Rabat (the capital of Morocco) with a ruler on a map, find out from the scale how many kilometers two cities separate, divide the result by 700 (this is the average speed of a modern airliner), add another twenty minutes for take-off and landing, and voila - received the result will be the time along the way.  It would seem that there is nothing easier.  But practice, as always, makes adjustments to this formula. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": Airwim, "><img itemprop="image" alt="How much to fly to Morocco from Moscow" class="if uuid-2231878" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2231878.jpg"></div><h2>  What affects the flight time </h2><p>  Now regular flights, and low-fires, and charters are used, especially for long-distance routes, Boeing or Airbus.  These <span>powerful cars</span> differ in capacity, but they develop approximately the same speed.  What then really affects how much fly to Morocco from Moscow? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The main factor is the flight.  If it is direct, then you will reach your destination as quickly as possible.  Regular flights do not delay departure at the airport, like charters.  But tickets for them are much more expensive than for low-cost fires.  Therefore, it often happens that it‚Äôs cheaper to fly with two (or even three) flights with a change than one direct one.  Morocco is a small country.  But still, the destination airport (Rabat, Casablanca, Marrakesh or Agadir) makes an amendment of +/- 15-20 minutes to calculate <span>how much to fly to Morocco</span> from Moscow.  Air carriers have different air corridors.  And not all liners, as is customary to think, fly in a straight line.  Airlines plan routes avoiding mountains that affect turbulence, as well as areas of military conflict.  Such zigzags affect travel time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.royalairmaroc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Morocco: how much to fly from Moscow" class="if uuid-2231882" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2231882.jpg"></div><h2>  How much to fly to Morocco from Moscow direct flight </h2><p>  Russian tourists from all the certainly wonderful cities of the North African country really appreciate two.  <span>These are Casablanca</span> and Agadir.  The first in its geographical location is closer to Russia.  Therefore, it will take you exactly six hours to fly to Casablanca International Airport.  In the summer, Royal Air Mark and Aeroflot compete with Iberia, KLM, Air Berlin and Air France.  In the opposite direction, thanks to the prevailing winds, travel time will be 10 minutes shorter.  Regular flights start from Sheremetyevo on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 11.05.  And after six hours, the liner will land in Casablanca (Morocco).  How much to fly from Moscow by direct flight to another popular resort, Agadir?  This city is further from Russia than Casablanca.  And fly to him from Sheremetyevo on board the Royal Air Mark for almost seven hours. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="travels.kilroy.net" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Time difference Moscow - Morocco" class="if uuid-2231897" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2231897.jpg"></div><h2>  We travel with transfers </h2><p>  There are simply no direct flights from Moscow to some airports in this North African country.  Marrakech can also be reached through Casablanca, as well as through Rabat, the capital of Morocco.  How much to fly from Moscow to the most authentic city in the country?  Marrakech can be reached on board the Iberia with a transfer in Barcelona.  This is the fastest way.  It will take only nine hours to complete the journey, seven of which will have to be spent in the sky. </p><p>  All other options are much longer.  Flight times with landings in Milan, Amsterdam, Munich, Paris will be the same, but the wait at transit airports will stretch from four to 15 hours.  You can fly to Casablanca with transfers in Rome, Brussels, Abu Dhabi, Lisbon, Barcelona.  Travel time by connecting flights will be from 9.5 to 20 hours.  Agadir can be reached via Marseille, Madrid and Casablanca, Munich in 11-22 hours. </p><div class="photo" data-original="liveandletsfly.boardingarea.com" data-author=": MATTHEW, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Flight Time Moscow-Morocco" class="if uuid-2231906" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2231906.jpg"></div><h2>  Time difference between Moscow and Morocco </h2><p>  Travelers rushing to the resorts of this North African country will enjoy a pleasant bonus.  If you start from Sheremetyevo with a direct flight at 11:05, then in Casablanca you land not at 17:05, as you might think, but at 14:05.  No, the flight time Moscow-Morocco remains the same.  Just the west of Russia and the North African country live in different time zones.  Morocco - at UTC 0, and Moscow - at UTC +3.  But there should be a small correction in this matter.  Despite the fact that Morocco is near the tropic, the country has a transition from winter to summer.  Thus, from the beginning of April to the end of October, the timers of local residents "lag behind" the Moscow chimes not by three, but by only two hours. </p>
