The device has an HD display and an economical Cortex-A7 processor.  This combination was a winner for the device for $ 280.  A powerful 4000 mAh battery, which is located inside the metal case, allows the Lenovo P780 to work for about 25 hours in a conversation on a 3G network.  Based on experience, we can say that a smartphone with traditional everyday use can last 3 days without recharging - an excellent result.

We are talking about the first <span>curved LG phone,</span> which received a sensitive touch OLED HD-display and leadership in endurance thanks to a powerful battery - 3500 mAh.  In addition, a self-healing, flexible and very durable construction is provided here.  The undoubted advantages should also include the amazing quality of communication.  This development has become one of the pioneers of a new type of phones.  It also features a curved battery.  The device is resistant to damage.  This development follows the contours of a person‚Äôs face, and also reduces the distance between the lips and the microphone as the phone approaches the ear.  The developers claim that in this way it was possible to achieve better sound quality and voice transmission.  The shape allows the smartphone to fit better in the hand, and when horizontal, the screen offers a comfortable angle for watching videos as well as games.  The case is completely plastic, but the plastic is unusual.  A monoblock is selected as a form factor.  At the same time, the back cover is non-removable.  The SIM card is inserted into the metal slide-out type, mounted on the side slot.  The connectors are located on the bottom panel along with the hole for the main microphone.  The second is at the top and is used for noise reduction.  The back wall placed a pair of separate keys for adjusting the volume and a central lock and power button.  There is also a light indicator.  Its role is played by the central key, highlighted in different colors.  Focusing the phone‚Äôs camera on the face is confirmed by a green backlight.  The LED-indication of the hardware buttons on the rear panel indicates the beginning of the countdown to the start of shooting.  A red color appears when there is no answer to several calls of a particular subscriber.  Also, the device can inform about the level of charge and missed events.  LED indicators can be customized as you wish.  The camera window, which is protected by <span>sapphire crystal, a</span> single-section LED flash and an infrared eye, was also placed on the back of the smartphone.  The latter serves to control the equipment.  It works in conjunction with a virtual remote control also built into the device.
