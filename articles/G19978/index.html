It is this feeling that overwhelms people during their stay in the unique caves of Vaitomo in New Zealand.  This is a real masterpiece of nature, over which she worked for many millions of years. </p><p>  For some time the master here was the ocean.  He diligently created bizarre growths and mystical intricacies of moves and paths.  But the water receded and left a huge system of 150 caves.  In one of them live funny fireflies that glow with a bright green-blue light in the dark, which makes the cave arch look like a real starry sky!  About this they say: "It is better to see once than hear a hundred times." </p><p>  Various events are held in the caves of Vaitomo: on Christmas night, a chapel is sung in the Cathedral Hall, and notorious extremals periodically compete in rafting over black water. </p>
