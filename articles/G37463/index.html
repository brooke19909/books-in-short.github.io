    <p>  Back to the helmets of the gladiators.  There were 4 species: </p><ul><li>  A helmet with the face of Hercules.  The simplest and most functional of all possible.  It had a simple angular crest.  Jewelery - a minimum.  Hercules medallion flaunted on his forehead, symbolizing strength, courage and thirst for victory.  The gladiator's face protected the visor from two halves that docked along the line of the nose.  The height of the helmet is 46 cm. </li><li>  A griffin head helmet.  It was adorned with a silvered image of the Medusa Gorgon.  The head of the griffin acted as a comb.  On both sides, bushings were found for attaching feathers to them. </li><li>  Helmet with embossed tulle.  Very beautiful and original.  The relief image gives some grandeur.  The plot of the image is simple: the Roman goddess between the barbarians and slaves.  Visor from two halves attached to the hinges.  It opens like a gate. </li><li>  Helmet with a raised crest.  Very similar to the previous option.  In it, the comb and visor are decorated with a relief image, and the eye protection looks more brutal.  On the sides there are also bushings for feathers. </li></ul><h2>  World of Craft - The Most Popular Multiplayer Online Game </h2><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Gladiatorial fights are a subject of interest not only to historians, but also to developers of computer games.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Gladiator equipment is actively involved in the game World of Warcraft.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">This is a multiplayer role-playing game that is popular around the world.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">World of Warcraft was released in 2004.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">The name translates as "World of Military Craft."</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">During the existence of the game, several updates have been released.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">World of Warcraft ratings break all records.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">The game even got into the Guinness Book of Records.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1">World of Warcraft uses a wide variety of weapons, mostly medieval.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">There was a place in the game for gladiatorial gear, including helmets.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">True, the game uses very modified gladiatorial equipment.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">The developers came up with a new outfit and weapons.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Gladiator helmets are presented in different variations.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Access to them depends on the level.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Below we will talk about different types of gladiator helmets.</span> </p>
