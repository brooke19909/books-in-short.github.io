    <h2>  Briefly about the hotel and resort </h2><p>  First of all, it is worth noting that Ammon Zeus Hotel 4 *, located on a private sandy beach, was built on the place where the monastery monastery used to be.  The resort itself is called Kassandra - a peninsula located in the northern part of Greece.  The hotel is located a five-minute walk from the very center of Kallithea.  This is a famous resort village that boasts pristine white sand beaches and magnificent landscapes.  Although the local beauties, the inhabitants of Greece are not surprised.  After all, "Kallithea" in Greek means "beautiful view." </p><p>  From the airport "Macedonia" you can get here by bus number 78 (fare - 1 euro).  He walks three times an hour, starting at 5:50 a.m.  The bus of the last flight leaves at 23:00.  It takes about 40 minutes to get to Thessaloniki bus station.  And from there - on the KTEL bus for 8.8 euros.  True, one can only leave from there until 21:00.  However, in any case, cheaper than a taxi (you will have to spend about 100 euros). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A few words about a topic like weather.  Halkidiki has a typical Mediterranean climate.  And here the air temperature, like water, is higher than in other <span>resorts in Greece.</span>  The weather of Halkidiki pleases visitors with the hot sun, low rainfall and very warm, mild winters.  The minimum temperature that has ever been recorded here was observed in February - 3 ¬∞ C.  In general, in winter it reigns somewhere between +15 ... + 20 ¬∞ C.  In the holiday season (which begins here in April and ends in October), the temperature varies from 23 to 34 degrees. </p>

In the hotel you can stay with them (regardless of the age of the kids).  Only extra cots are not provided.  But half-board meals for children whose age does not exceed six years are free.  A child over seven but under 12?  He then got half-board discounts.  And by the way, people who come with children under 6 years old should inform the hotel in advance.  It is better to do this when filling out an application. </p><p>  By the way, even in this hotel pets are allowed.  But only with small ones, weighing up to 4 kilograms.

Only towels are changed every three days, as is linen - this does not suit many, but you can put up with it. </p><p>  Administrators are courteous, ready to help if something interests.  Waiters in restaurants serve quickly, even though here, in high season, almost all places are occupied. </p>

    <h2>  What else do guests say? </h2><p>  If a person wants to see the sea from his balcony, then this option should be booked immediately.  Many expect to ask for apartments with a view of such a landscape already in place upon arrival at the hotel.  But not worth it, especially in high season.  Even when reserving apartments from home, it is advisable to indicate the type requirements in the special wishes column. </p><p>  By the way, if you open the balcony door in the evening, you can enjoy the sound of the surf.  True, for some people who are accustomed to silence, this is a bit unusual. </p><p>  Still, everyone is advised to go to the center of Kallithea.
