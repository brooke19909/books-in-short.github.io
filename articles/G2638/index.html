Tourist reviews are full of enthusiastic comparisons.  They say he is like Hawaii.  This is not so strange if you look at the map.  This South China tropical island is indeed located almost on the same latitude with the advertised American resort.  This is a special place, and travelers who are used to wandering around China will be surprised how much the island does not look like the mainland.  This is probably why many lovers of exotic prefer a <span>vacation to Hainan.</span>  Reviews of tourists about this are briefly summarized below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hainan tourists reviews" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/303703.jpg" width="527"></div>

    <p>  They say that this island has a special, unique atmosphere.  If you try not to choose the destinations chosen by the mass flow of vacationers, then you will be rewarded with the smiles and kindness of the locals - just like in Thailand.  In addition, unlike mainland China, exceptionally bright colors dominate this island.  Fresh air, a beautiful and clean sea and a beautiful ecological environment - this is how often reviews of tourists say about these places.  It‚Äôs not without reason that Hainan is the largest ‚Äúhealth resort‚Äù of the present Celestial Empire. </p>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hainan Holidays" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/303705.jpg" width="400"></div>  The island is similar to Hawaii also for its climate, as well as natural conditions.  Lush tropical forests and amazingly beautiful mountains, volcanoes and national parks, thermal waters that help from many diseases, including nervous ones - which are not there!  By the way, you can go on an excursion and go down to the very mouth of the fire-breathing mountain - this is evidenced by enthusiastic reviews of tourists.  Hainan is an extremely well-kept island, and this applies to any of its corners.  Everything here is provided not only for a full beach holiday, but also for those who want to gaze at the exotic.  For example, Safari Park (Haikou) will give you the opportunity to see first-hand African animals in almost natural habitat.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, the beaches on the island deserve special mention.  You can find very beautiful places with white, as on commercials, sand and secluded bays - the main thing is not to "go with the flow" and not rush to the most popular coasts.  Otherwise, guaranteed noise, din and not too clear water.  At least that's what tourist reviews recommend.  Hainan, surprisingly, in the past did not have very good fame.  In the time of the emperors, the island was a place of exile, and those who were unwanted by the authorities came here not of their own free will.  Now, in memory of this, there is a special park called ‚ÄúEnd of the World‚Äù, the stone garden of which makes you think about the relativity of luxury and transience of success.  Now tourists and locals come here to relax and unwind, especially since all the natural attractions of Hainan are recreated in the park - there are waterfalls, cliffs with many viewing platforms, picturesque bays and much more. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hainan Island tourist reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/303706.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  One of the most interesting excursions, many vacationers called "Monkey Island".  These are several rocks sticking out of the sea, where the closest relatives of a person live and breed, and you can watch them all day.  Especially they like to swim in the sea and in the pool.  The road to the island is cableway, and along the way you can see the village of fishermen sheltered on a rock.  Although other tourists advise instead of a trip to this nursery to visit Mount "Turned Deer".  There is another opportunity to see the famous macaques in the wild, as well as walk on the rocks and enjoy the scenery, as if descended from calligraphically accurate sketches of Chinese woodcuts.  About this and many other things tell us the reviews of tourists.  Hainan is truly an amazing place that cannot be inspected at a time.  But just visit him at least once to fall in love with him. </p>
