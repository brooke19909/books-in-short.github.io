  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Density of oil and its physical properties</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Modern requirements for oil quality are quite high.  Therefore, its production constantly requires perfection in order for petroleum products to meet all standards and norms.  Relevant organizations exercise control over production and the final product. </p><p>  The standardization system, which is developed by the state, is the standard that all manufacturers are equal to.  Compliance with its conditions is mandatory for everyone. </p><p>  Oil and other petroleum products is a liquid mixture having a complex composition of hydrocarbon compounds and closely boiling hydrocarbons, as well as heteroatoms of oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, certain metals and acids. </p><p>  One of the <span>qualitative indicators</span> is the density of oil.  This is the amount of resting mass per unit volume.  The density of petroleum products and its determination is a prerequisite for an easier calculation of their mass quantity.  This is due to the fact that accounting for oil in volume units is not very convenient, because this indicator can vary depending on changes in temperature. </p><p>  The density of oil is measured in kilograms per cubic meter.  You can easily determine the mass, knowing the indicators of volume and density.  The mass, unlike the volume, is independent of the temperature of the product. </p><p>  Typically, an indicator such as the relative density of oil is used.  It is defined as the ratio of the mass of oil to the mass of pure water, which is taken in the same volume, having a temperature of + 4 ¬∞.  This temperature level was not chosen by chance.  Water in this case has the highest density, which is equal to 1000 kilograms per cubic meter.  In order to determine the relative density of oil, its temperature should be + 20 ¬∞.  In this case, it can be from 0.7 to 1.07 kilograms per cubic meter. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are other <span>physical properties of</span> oil. </p><p>  Specific gravity is the weight that one unit of volume has.  In another way, this is the force with which one unit of the volume of this substance is attracted to the earth.  That is, this density multiplied by the acceleration of gravity. </p><p>  Another concept is the relative specific gravity.  The value of this indicator is equal to the numerical value that the relative density has.  We use it to calculate this indicator. </p><p>  <span>The specific gravity</span> and density of oil can change their values ‚Äã‚Äãwith temperature.  Therefore, in order to calculate the density found at one temperature for the same indicator for other temperature data, it is necessary to take into account corrections for changes in density depending on changes in temperature. </p><p>  The oil density, calculated in practice, is considered an additive quantity.  This is due to the fact that this indicator can be obtained as an average value for several petroleum products. </p><p>  Each region <span>of oil production</span> has its own physical properties of this product.  So, for example, the density of oil in the Tyumen region on average ranges from 825 to 900 kilograms per cubic meter. </p><p>  The study of the physical properties of this product is necessary not only for its rational use for economic purposes and for sale on the world market.  Sometimes this is very important in eliminating <span>environmental disasters</span> arising from the release of petroleum products into the environment and avoids many mistakes. </p><p>  So, during the liquidation of an accident, attempts are made to eliminate the oil slick with the help of arson, not considering that the physical characteristics of this product could change as a result of interaction with the environment.  Therefore, these circumstances should be considered in cases of cleaning water surfaces.  This is a very important factor that should not be ignored. </p>
