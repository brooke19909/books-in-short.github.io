Such a diverse system makes it possible to quickly, safely and comfortably get to any part of the city.  Berlin's public transport is divided between the spheres of influence of several companies. </p><h2>  Who is responsible for what? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.bild.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Berlin public transport" class="if uuid-2560095" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81922/2560095.jpg"></div><p>  Most of the services are provided by the Berlin Transport Company (BVG).  It is Germany's largest public transport company.  It began its work in early 1929, so it has many years of experience and a well-established network.  The efficient operation of the BVG provided Berliners with a convenient transportation network so that every resident or tourist can comfortably use buses, trams, a boat or subway to get to the goal.  BVG annually transports more than 906 million passengers, which is approximately 2.4 million daily. </p><p>  The second largest company in Berlin, which is engaged in transportation within the city, is S-Bahn Berlin GmbH.  She runs a city electric train.  About 40% of all services in the German capital are provided by this company.  They serve 15 lines, helping more than 1.3 million people move around the city every day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  All public transport in Berlin covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã1,000 square kilometers.  And a little over 3.4 million people live here. </p><p>  The quality of the BVG and S-Bahn Berlin services not only affects the mobile movement of Berliners within the city, they form the level of quality of accommodation here.  Travelers from all over the world, pensioners, young people and other guests of the city strongly depend on how well such an unremarkable part of the city‚Äôs life as public transport works. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the quality of public transport in Berlin is constantly improving and improving.  This is due not only to the development of technology, which simplifies some aspects, but also to the improvement of environmental standards for doing business.  For example, Berlin buses use only sulfur-free diesel fuel.  They are equipped with filters that reduce emissions of carbon monoxide and soot to a minimum. </p><h2>  Interesting statistics </h2><p>  U-bahn metro consists of 10 lines with a total number of stations 173. At night from Friday to Saturday, as well as from Saturday to Sunday and before public holidays, trains on 8 lines run every 15 minutes.  During non-working hours, the metro is replaced by buses that travel along similar routes. </p><p>  Berlin city train consists of 15 lines, which have 166 stations.  Electric trains run at night in the same way as the subway. </p><p>  Metrotram consists of nine lines that operate all day. </p><p>  The trams have 13 lines, metrobuses operate on 7 round-the-clock routes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  196 routes were created for buses, 65 of them work all day, and the interval of their movements is every half hour. </p><p>  The city has six ferry routes, three of which operate year-round, without interruptions. </p><h2>  Comfort and convenience </h2><p>  Most public transport routes have stops equipped for the convenience of people with disabilities.  At night, there are about fifty points of contact with security.  At most of the facilities and in the vehicles themselves, CCTVs operate under medical supervision. </p><p>  A stop is mandatory for all types of public transport except ferries.  Almost all vehicles have special electronic displays that indicate the names of the stops. </p><h2>  Tickets and fares </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.touristberlin.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Berlin public transport" class="if uuid-2560093" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81922/2560093.jpg"></div><p>  There are three tariff zones in Berlin: </p><ol><li>  Zone A - it is surrounded by a train ring and captures the entire city center. </li><li>  Zone B - it extends to the city outskirts. </li><li>  Zone C - captures the surroundings of the capital, such as Potsdam, the airport in Sch√∂nefeld and Oranienburg. </li></ol><p>  Depending on what your needs are, you can take yourself a combined ticket for zones AB, AC or ABC.  The standard fare is designed for adults, lower ticket prices for children from 6 to 14 years.  Children under 6 years old travel free on public transport routes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  You can buy a ticket at one of the many centers for the implementation of BVG.  You can also buy them in vending machines that are installed at stops.  The machine works without interruptions, and the menu supports six languages: English, German, French, Turkish, Spanish and Polish. </p><p>  Some buses and trams have vending machines that can also be used to purchase tickets.  In them you can buy a ticket for a single trip, for a short walk, as well as a day-pass ticket. </p><p>  Additionally, they are not required to be composted; they will be valid immediately after you pay them.  Inside the trams, machines can only accept coins, and drivers on buses will not give you change from too large bills. </p><p>  Children from 6 to 14 years old can buy a ticket at a reduced cost.  Children under six do not need to buy tickets.  Also, you do not need to pay extra for baby strollers, dogs.  An adult who has already bought a ticket takes them for free.  The exception can be made about ferries, where only 3 children under six years can pass at no extra charge.  Also, for the second dog you need to take a ticket at discounted rates.  When buying a one-time ticket, you need to take preferential tickets for both dogs.  If you go into transport with a bicycle, you need to take a ticket at a special rate. </p><h2>  Single trip ticket </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.berlin-airport.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Berlin buses" class="if uuid-2560099" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81922/2560099.jpg"></div><p>  Such a ticket will be a great solution for those who do not often travel somewhere in Berlin.  You can take the usual route in any direction, regardless of the number of changes.  The ticket will be valid for two hours. </p><p>  During this time, a person can change the bus or train and interrupt his trip an infinite number of times.  However, reverse or circular driving is not permitted.  A return trip is a return to the original station on this line.  Circular - when using other routes, a person returns to the original or neighboring station or gets to the station, from where you can get on your first trip. </p><p>  By tram, metro, bus or train, you can move freely within all three zones.  The ticket to be composted is composted immediately after the trip has begun. </p><h2>  Directions for a day </h2><p>  With such a ticket you can go wherever and as much as you like.  It will be valid all day, the date of which is indicated on it.  Once you use it, it will be valid until 3am the next day.  Day Pass is not transmitted. </p><h2>  Ticket for four trips </h2><p>  This is a specially designed offer, which is great for those who regularly use public transport. </p><p>  This offer applies exclusively to zone AB.  The ticket has four separate sections, each of which is composted before the trip.  One section applies to one trip or one person. </p><p>  Each of these sections allows the passenger to make an unlimited number of transfers during a trip in one direction, using the standard route, or if it happened in connection with the schedule.  This function is valid for two hours after you have validated your ticket.  The same rules apply as for a one-time ticket.  At a reduced cost, only children aged 6 to 14 years can purchase a ticket for travel. </p><p>  Such tickets are sold in every ticket center of the Berlin transport companies, as well as in every vending machine, which is located near metro stations and at city bus stops. </p><p>  Such a ticket is not valid for buses and trams, because for such modes of transport only validated tickets are used.  When buying a ticket for four trips in a special machine, be sure to pay attention to the fact that it consists of four sections, each of which lasts approximately one minute. </p><h2>  Weekly travel </h2><p>  Such a ticket is valid for seven days.  The countdown starts from the day that is indicated on the ticket, or from the moment of the first trip until midnight after seven days.  For example, if you validate a ticket on Tuesday at 9:30, then it will be valid until 24:00 the next Monday. </p><p>  On weekdays after 20:00, as well as on weekends and official holidays, a maximum of three children, from six to fourteen years of age, can be transported with one travel ticket for an adult free of charge.  According to current conditions, the possibility of such a free trip ends at 3 a.m. the next day, if it is not official holidays or a day off.  Do not forget that in Brandenburg and in Berlin, holidays may vary by date.  The ticket cannot be handed over to anyone. </p><p>  You can purchase such a ticket at any vending machine or at a specialized ticket office. </p><h2>  Bus ride </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.bus-bild.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="double decker berlin" class="if uuid-2560086" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81922/2560086.jpg"></div><p>  Double deckers of Berlin are large yellow double-decker buses, which are the main symbols for the capital of Germany.  More than 1300 buses ply every day, driving passengers away. </p><p>  There are 150 daily and 54 night routes in Berlin.  The total length of all bus lines is 1626 kilometers in the daytime, and at night - 751 kilometers.  The number of stops is approximately 10 thousand.  It is worth noting that the predominant number of buses on the routes is designed for people in wheelchairs. </p><p>  After 20:00 in zones B and C, you can ask the driver to stop at a place where it will be more convenient for you to get off, rather than at a classic stop.  Nevertheless, first you need to make sure the driver that such a stop is possible.  Exit through the front doors.  Only once can a bus stop in an inappropriate place.  Moreover, the driver will refuse to stop you if you select a danger zone for this, such as construction sites, icy and slippery surfaces, as well as car parking. </p><p>  At night, there are routes in order to protect the movement of stray tourists or people who like to have fun in the evening.  Routes with stops are always indicated on the official website. </p><h2>  Metro </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.lonelyplanet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="metro u bahn" class="if uuid-2560091" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81922/2560091.jpg"></div><p>  The Berlin Underground is considered the largest in Germany, as well as one of the most modern throughout Europe.  Nevertheless, it is one of the most expensive types of public transport in the country.  The metro is famous for its high level of comfort, as well as the high environmental standards that the metro service company has set for itself. </p><p>  The interval of trains is from 3 to 5 minutes.  In the subway, you can easily catch the connection for various mobile operators.  Moreover, in ticket machines you can recharge your smartphone without any problems. </p><h2>  Trams </h2><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Berlin tram" class="if uuid-2560087" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81922/2560087.jpg"></div><p>  Berlin trams are famous for being the largest network of tracks in all of Germany.  Trams are an integral part of the entire metropolitan landscape.  It is difficult for locals to imagine their favorite city without this transport. </p><p>  About 187 kilometers of tram tracks have been laid in the city.  If you add up the length of all day and night lines, the result is a staggering 430 kilometers.  Every day, trams carry out about 5300 trips, while delivering more than 560,000 people in different directions. </p><p>  There are around 789 tram stops throughout Berlin.  It turns out that each of them is located approximately every 450 meters.  The average speed of transport is 19 km / h.  Tramways run along both wide and large avenues and narrow streets. </p><p>  You can also take advantage of Berlin's electric trains.  They are no less effective and comfortable to help you get to your destination. </p><h2>  Book a taxi </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.nuberlin.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="taxi in berlin" class="if uuid-2560088" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81922/2560088.jpg"></div><p>  Taxi in Berlin is represented by a wide variety of fleet.  If you do not have the time or desire to use public transport, you can always enjoy the comfort of such a solution. </p>
