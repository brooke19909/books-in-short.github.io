All viewers understand that they were cheated somewhere, but hardly anyone can prove, let alone show how this happens.  Therefore, you should not immediately reveal your secrets to tricks with cards, because the longer the audience remains in ignorance, the more attention will be given to the lucky fakir.  And the girls will gladly give the hero their kiss in exchange for revealing the secret of mysterious manipulations. </p>

    <h2>  Easy Trick - Four Aces </h2><p>  The simplest trick with cards is when they ask the viewer to divide the deck into four arbitrary piles, after which he mixes them, and in the end he discovers that there is an ace at the top of each pile.  There is no limit to surprise and perplexity.  After all, a voluntary participant in the show knows that he himself shared the deck, shuffled it himself, took out the cards himself, and therefore what happened can be explained only by mysticism.  Although there is nothing simpler than <span>this trick,</span> because the person who volunteered to help himself will do all the necessary work, precisely following the instructions of the homegrown magician.  To show easy tricks with cards, no training is required, just have a confident look and know a few secrets. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Preparation and execution </h2><p>  So, for the successful execution of this number you need a deck of cards, a table and a volunteer assistant, and, of course, exact instructions.  First, place all four aces at the top of the deck.  Naturally, neither the guest nor the assistant should see this.  Having asked the viewer (or assistant) to divide the deck into four parts, you need to note for yourself where the pile with aces lies.  Usually it is extreme left or right. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Focus with cards" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15816/454722.jpg" width="500"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  After that, your assistant needs to remove the top three cards from the pile without aces and put them in the base, and then put three more into adjacent decks.  The same thing needs to be done with the rest of the packs (without the 4 images we need).  At the end there will come a turn and decks with aces.  The assistant will transfer the top three cards that hit this pile from the neighboring ones to the base, and put the vacated aces in their places on top of the decks.  Now you can ask one of the guests, or, again, an assistant assistant to turn over the cards located on top, and the whole breathless audience will be delighted to see that these are really four aces. </p><h2>  Self-aligning deck is another simple math trick </h2><p>  This trick with cards can be performed both by yourself and again entrust the deck to one of the spectators and only manage its actions.  But suppose that a corporate magician decided to do everything himself.  Then the deck must be prepared in advance.  All cards must be sorted by suit into four sets.  The first will be an ace, then a deuce, three, four, and so on to the king.  By stacking all the packs on top of each other, you can show the deck to guests. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Having counted exactly 21 cards, so as not to disrupt the sequence of their location (of course, no one should notice that they were divided by the score), the top pack must be placed down the entire deck.  Now you need to split the deck 9 times anywhere.  Again, you can do it yourself, or you can invite one of the guests.  After these manipulations, it is necessary to decompose the pack into thirteen piles, sequentially one after another.  Everything, the trick is ready!  Now you can invite viewers to make sure that the whole deck is packaged in dignity: aces, deuces, threes and so on. </p>

    <h2>  <strong>I won!</strong>  <strong>Pay with a kiss</strong> </h2><p>  The point of the whole trick is that the man makes a bet on a kiss, that he will guess the card chosen by his companion.  This trick with cards is not only simple, but also very easy to execute.  Enough, dividing the deck into two parts, ask the girl to put the selected card on the bottom stack and look at what card will be at the base of the top.  After that, you can calmly cut the deck several times and begin to remove and turn over the cards one at a time.  As soon as the card that was spotted appears, you can declare that the next one will be a mystery ... and tear the kiss off the lips of an astonished beauty. </p>
