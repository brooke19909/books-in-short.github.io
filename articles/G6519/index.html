This is the Troodos ski resort, rich in interesting historical and architectural sights. </p><h2>  General information </h2><p>  Many ski enthusiasts are aware of the existence of a beautiful resort in Cyprus.  It is both a recreation area and a nature reserve.  These places have a wonderful climate and a unique combination of the proximity of mountains and the sea, thanks to which tourists can combine skiing with relaxation on the coast of the beautiful sea.  Despite the small number of hotels with good infrastructure, there are many cozy bungalows and houses. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.limassoltourism.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ski resorts Troodos" class="if uuid-3121920" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3121920.jpg"></div><p>  In the winter season, lovers of outdoor activities prefer to relax on the island.  Despite the Mediterranean climatic conditions, snow falls in the mountains at this time.  An amazing combination of snowy, fluffy mountains and the sea coast, as well as fresh and clean air filled with the aroma of pine needles, attract many tourists to these paradise places. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>Troodos</span> ski resort <span>(Cyprus) is</span> open from December to March.

This is the largest mountain range located in the west of the island of Cyprus.  The height of its peak is 1951 meters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Troodos Mountains" class="if uuid-3121946" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3121946.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of the recreation area </h2><p>  The resort has a rather long history.
