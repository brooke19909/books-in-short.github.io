However, the diversity of banks confuses many with a wide range of offers and confused loan conditions.  Of course, everyone wants to overpay as little as possible.  Therefore, the desire to figure out where the lowest rate on a consumer loan is is quite logical.  Let's consider this question in more detail. </p>

    <h2>  Is it possible to get a minimum loan interest? </h2><p>  Not everyone knows that the proposed rate of the bank may be even less.  For example, if a person is a client of an organization, that is, owns a debit or savings card, then the bank is confident of its solvency.  This may be the basis for lowering the annual interest on the loan.  However, this is only possible if financial movements are displayed in the database of the credit institution. </p><p>  Therefore, when deciding where to get a profitable consumer loan, it is worth checking to see if the Sberbank or VTB 24 card is in your pocket, as these banks often lower rates by 1.5-2% for their customers.  This is very beneficial. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can also pay a little less if you demonstrate an excellent credit history.  If a bank employee sees that the borrower is trustworthy and has not violated the terms of the contract before, this can also cause a decrease in interest.  It is also worth understanding that there is a general rating of borrowers.  Any bank has access to this list.  If a potential client has never paid back loans or has shown himself in an unscrupulous manner, then he may be refused at all the subsequent issue of funds. </p>

    <p>  Some credit organizations reduce interest by 1% if the borrower brings with him a reliable guarantor who confirms his solvency. </p><p>  It is also worth considering the rating of <span>consumer loans with a low interest rate</span> from different banking institutions. </p><h2>  Sberbank </h2><p>  This bank has three consumer loan programs at once.  The first of these involves the provision of a loan without collateral.  Moreover, the client can receive up to 1.5 million rubles for a period of up to 5 years.  In this case, you will have to overpay 15%.  However, such rates do not imply collateral; therefore, to receive money, it is enough to provide the bank with a certificate confirming the solvency of the client and the presence of a permanent job. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In order to apply for a loan to citizens who are already customers of Sberbank, it is not necessary to visit the branch in person, it is enough to fill out an application online. </p><p>  There is also another program according to which a person can receive money in the amount of up to 3 million rubles if he can provide a personal car as collateral.  Or you can bring a guarantor with you.  In this case, the interest rate will be 14.5%, and the payment term is 5 years. </p>

    <p>  In addition, in Sberbank you can get a loan secured by real estate.  Moreover, the size of the loan can reach up to 10 million rubles, which can be paid over 20 years.  The interest rate will be 15.5%. </p><p>  It is also worth considering other banks issuing loans at a low interest rate. </p><h2>  Russian Agricultural Bank </h2><p>  This credit organization is very popular among the population.  The fact is that people of retirement age can get the lowest rate on a consumer loan.  For senior citizens, the percentage will be 16% per annum.  At the same time, it is not necessary to confirm that the money will be used precisely for the purposes for which the citizen takes it.  Accordingly, the funds can go for any purpose, including the purchase of an apartment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Loans in the amount of up to 500 thousand rubles are available to older people.  The payment term in this case is 7 years. </p><p>  The Rosselkhozbank also has additional consumer programs: </p><ul><li>  For gardeners.  In this case, we are talking about a loan for the construction of a summer house, bathhouse or any other facility.  The loan amount is up to 1.5 million rubles.  Cash can be paid up to 5 years at a constant interest rate of 21%. </li><li>  On engineering communications.  This loan is issued to purchase the necessary equipment for gas, electricity and much more.  The conditions are the same. </li><li>  For reliable customers.  In this case, we are talking about people who have previously issued loans at this bank and have successfully repaid them without any complaints.  In this case, the loan amount can reach up to 1 million rubles, and the rate will be 18.5%. </li></ul>

    <p>  If the client wants to get an inappropriate loan, then money can be received at a percentage of 21.5%. </p><h2>  "VTB 24" </h2><p>  Speaking of the lowest rates on consumer loans, it is impossible to bypass this bank.  At VTB 24, it ranges from 17% to 19% depending on the documents that the borrower is ready to provide.  If he brings certificates confirming that he has a permanent job and income, then the percentage will be less.  Also, a lower rate is provided for those who take a large loan for a shorter period. </p><p>  The maximum loan amount is 3 million rubles.  No confirmation of collateral is required.  In addition, in some situations, a bank employee may ask for details of close relatives and friends.  Most likely they will be called to confirm the information provided by the client when signing the contract. </p>

    <h2>  Sovcombank </h2><p>  Speaking about where the lowest credit rate on consumer loans is, it is worth mentioning this bank, which so far is only gaining popularity.  However, this does not mean that he does not deserve attention. </p><p>  In Sovcombank, a citizen of the Russian Federation can receive money in the amount of up to 250 thousand rubles, soon up to 3 years.  In this case, the interest rate will be from 12% to 18% depending on the loan term. </p><h2>  Gazprombank </h2><p>  The lowest consumer loan rate at this bank is 10.5% per annum.  However, such loans are issued only for the purchase of real estate.  For the purchase of a vehicle, loans are issued at 12%.  Also, citizens can apply for a loan to study at a higher educational institution.  In this case, the overpayment will be 11%. </p><h2>  What to look for </h2><p>  If a person managed to find the lowest consumer loan rates in Novosibirsk or any other city in the Russian Federation, then you should not immediately rush into the pool with your head. </p>

    <p>  Today reliable banks have a minimum loan interest rate of less than 12%, unless the rate reduction was due to a separate program or bonus system for regular customers.  If a little-known organization offers to issue a loan at 5%, then it makes sense to think about whether there is any scam behind it. </p><p>  It is extremely difficult to answer exactly which bank has the lowest consumer loan rate.  The fact is that in any organization the conditions may vary depending on the purpose of lending and other factors.  Therefore, before applying for a loan, you need to carefully study existing programs and check with a bank representative for possible privileges. </p><p>  It should also be borne in mind that some banks automatically connect additional options to customers.  If a card is issued, then it may also be paid.  If the client pays off only monthly payments, and does not pay, for example, SMS notification, then this can develop into penalties and additional commissions. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Before applying for a loan at any bank, it is imperative to study in detail each clause of the proposed contract.  All conditions should be very clear.  If a question arises on any item, do not be shy to ask it. </p>

    <p>  In addition, it is recommended to study reviews from other clients and check the latest information about the selected credit institution, especially if it is not a bank.  Every year, the Central Bank withdraws dozens of licenses from such companies.  Therefore, it is worth spending extra time studying detailed information. </p><p>  To apply for a loan, you do not have to leave home.  Most banks offer customers online loans. </p>
