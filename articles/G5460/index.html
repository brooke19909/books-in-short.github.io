History, interesting facts, how to get</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Everyone knows the symbol of Rio de Janeiro and all of Brazil - the monument to Christ the Redeemer.  However, there is a statue of Christ in the Portuguese Lisbon.  This attraction, the history of its appearance and unusual facts will be discussed in this article. </p><h2>  Appearance story </h2><p>  The statue of Christ in Lisbon is directly related to the statue of Christ in Rio de Janeiro.  The fact is that when in January 1500 the Portuguese discoverers sailed to the coast of Brazil, once in the bay, they mistook it for the mouth of a large river.  In this regard, they called these parts the ‚ÄúRiver of January‚Äù, which in Portuguese sounds Rio de Janeiro.  Since the opening of this place, Brazil has become a Portuguese colony. </p><div class="photo" data-original="invinoveritasportugal.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Great view from the platform" class="if uuid-2630505" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2630505.jpg"></div><p>  In 1822, Brazil gained independence from Portugal, and in honor of this it was decided to build a statue of Christ on <span>Mount Corcovada</span> .  However, due to the tightness of funds and the complexity of the terrain, the construction took more than a hundred years.  Nevertheless, the monument was opened in 1931. </p><p>  Relations between Portugal and Brazil were not interrupted even after the latter gained independence, but nevertheless they were strained.  The Brazilians and the Portuguese had much in common - language and faith, but there was no single, unifying spiritual symbol.  This was one of the reasons why the Portuguese clergy decide to erect a statue of Christ in Lisbon. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Statue building </h2><p>  This statue has become not only a spiritual symbol of the friendship of Brazil and Portugal.  The clergy put another meaning in this monument - a sacred symbol of maintaining peace and preventing Portugal from entering World War II.  For the construction of the monument announced a fundraiser throughout the country.  For the model of the statue of Christ in Lisbon, the same was taken in Rio de Janeiro. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pixabay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View of the statue from the site" class="if uuid-2630493" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2630493.jpg"></div><p>  After the end of World War II (in which, by the way, Portugal was neutral), the construction of the monument began in 1949.  In 1959, with the funds raised by the people, the construction of the statue was completed.  The monument did not exceed the size of the Brazilian prototype, but still impressed everyone with its beauty. </p><h2>  Description of the monument </h2><p>  The statue of Christ, in Portuguese - Cristo Rey, reaches a height of 28 meters, and in Rio it is two meters higher.  However, the whole monument in Portugal is much higher than in Brazil, and all because of the pedestal.  The statue of Christ in Lisbon has a total height, along with a pedestal as much as 113 meters from the level <span>of the Tagus River, which</span> runs almost at the foot of the monument.  Whereas in Brazil, the total height of the monument is 38 meters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="River View" class="if uuid-2630492" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2630492.jpg"></div><p>  Also, the Lisbon monument is distinguished by its architectural style.  For example, the drapery of the Savior‚Äôs robes is not as elegant as in Rio.  The rest of the statues are very similar - this is Jesus Christ with outstretched arms, as if addressing the world.  It is believed that with this gesture the Savior gives his blessing to Lisbon, and with it the whole of Portugal. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The upper part of the pedestal is crowned with a large observation deck, which is climbed by elevator.  From here, you will see fascinating views of the city.  The statue itself and its observation deck are very popular not only among numerous tourists, but also among local residents. </p><h2>  Statue of Christ in Lisbon and the San Francisco Bridge </h2><p>  The banks of the river, which has a statue of Christ, are connected by the beautiful April 25 bridge.  It was built in 1966, and upon completion of construction it was given a name in honor of the Portuguese Prime Minister Ant√≥nio Salazar.  It is an interesting fact that according to surveys conducted in Portugal in 2007, he was recognized as the country's greatest citizen in its entire history.  However, in 1974, the bridge was renamed in honor of the date of the military coup (April 25), called the "Red Carnations Revolution", which took place without bloodshed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="worldalldetails.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View of the statue and the San Francisco Bridge" class="if uuid-2630458" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2630458.jpg"></div><p>  The bridge has a length of about 2300 meters and a span of above water - 70 meters.  Structurally, it is a suspension bridge, in its type and color it is very similar to the bridge called the Golden Gate, which is located in San Francisco (USA).  It is for this similarity that the April 25 Bridge was nicknamed the San Francisco Bridge. </p><p>  It has rail and road links and is massively exploited by carriers.  Traveling across the bridge towards Lisbon is paid, but the city does not cost anything.  The bridge, like the statue of Christ, has also become one of the city's attractions. </p><h2>  How to get to the statue of Christ in Lisbon </h2><p>  You can get to the Savior statue by land and water.  The most common way is by bus, taking route number 101 towards Cacilhas, which takes you directly to the statue.  One of the favorite ways for tourists to get to the statue is the ferry from the river station Cais do Sodro to the pier Cacilhas, according to the ferry schedule.  Then take the surface metro to the stop Almada, and then walk to the statue of Christ on foot. </p><p>  Lisbon Statue of Christ: Av.  Cristo Rei 27A.
