Each of them has its own conditions, therefore, the interest on them will be different.  But in every financial institution there are profitable deposits suitable for high profits.  To choose a reliable organization, several factors must be considered. </p><h2>  Bank selection </h2><p>  The most profitable deposits should be made in a reliable bank.  Today, financial institutions such as Sberbank and VTB24 are popular.  Many believe that bankruptcy will not affect these organizations, and therefore they boldly carry their funds at an unprofitable percentage.  But a reliable bank is one that takes part in the state deposit insurance system. </p>

    <p>  Even if a financial institution goes bankrupt or its license is withdrawn, depositors will still receive their savings.  The maximum insurance payment is 1,400,000 rubles.  Therefore, it is best to divide the amount and invest it in several banks.  Customer reviews indicate that you need to invest only after a thorough audit of a financial institution.  Only then can you not worry about the safety of your savings. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Bet selection </h2><p>  Profitable deposits have a corresponding rate.  But a high percentage does not mean profitable.  It all depends on the size of the amount and the rate that is charged.  It should be borne in mind that the size of the percentage also depends on the duration of storage of the amount.  Typically, large financial institutions set a small rate on deposits, while small organizations attract customers with high interest rates.  But you must carefully choose the institution, as some banks do not participate in the insurance system.  It is necessary to choose medium-sized organizations whose rates are in the range of 14-18%.  The percentage is floating and fixed.  The first changes downward and can increase throughout the entire contribution. </p><h2>  Interest capitalization </h2><p>  There are 2 options for calculating the rate: </p><ul><li>  at the end of the entire period; </li><li>  after a specific time, for example, every month. </li></ul>

    <p>  The latter method is also called capitalization.  It can be performed every month, as well as once a quarter, a year.  These are the most profitable deposits, since the amount on which interest is accrued increases.  If capitalization occurs frequently, then it is more profitable for customers.  The reviews show that it is this option that most people choose. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Deposits with replenishment and withdrawal of funds </h2><p>  Income deposits are: </p><ul><li>  urgent; </li><li>  poste restante. </li></ul><p>  The latter option is considered more convenient.  A customer can always demand their money.  But for such a service a small percentage is charged.  In practice, it is clear that the yield is determined by the amount of the deposit and the term of placement.  It is best <span>to open a contribution</span> for a long period. </p>

    <p>  Fixed-term deposits are savings and savings.  You can put money on the second type, but not on the first.  If a fixed-term deposit is opened, after which the client wishes to take it back, that is, the probability of losing interest or the entire amount.  The reviews show that both of these contributions are in demand. </p><h2>  Currency selection </h2><p>  The client needs to determine the currency.  Low rates are offered on foreign currency deposits, so many clients use ruble programs.  The best choice would be a projected currency with little inflation.  Experts believe that it is desirable to divide the contribution into several currencies.  Some organizations issue multi-currency deposits. </p><p>  Profitable deposits are also made in precious metals.  Often used platinum, palladium, silver and gold.  This is an excellent choice if you place a contribution for a long period, because the prices of materials are only rising.  Before concluding a transaction, you need to familiarize yourself with the contract.  Banks take a small percentage for conversion operations, this will be known from the contract. </p><h2>  Sberbank </h2><p>  To invest, you can choose <span>Sberbank.</span>  Profitable <span>contribution</span> is called ‚ÄúSave Online‚Äù.  The rate on it is 6-7.7%.  To open a deposit, an investment of 2,000,000 rubles is required.  For example, you can make a deal for a year with a rate of 7.3%.  When this period passes, the account will be 2 150 745 rubles.  This result is obtained with capitalization of interest.  If desired, interest can be charged every month. </p>
