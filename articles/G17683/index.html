La Gomera is an integral part of the archipelago.  Despite its modest size, it is visited by many tourists.  The island is interesting for travelers with its pristine nature.  Green landscapes with steep slopes are amazing.  The complex terrain of the island incredibly complicates communication between settlements.  Most of the land has still retained a virgin state. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="28.1033035" data-lng="-17.21935780000001" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="8"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/9/6/9/17969.png"></div><h2>  A bit about the island ... </h2><p>  La Gomera Island has an area of ‚Äã‚Äã369.76 square meters.  km  It is also called the island of Columbus, since the navigator visited it in 1492 to replenish food supplies.  La Gomera is of volcanic origin.  Its highest point is Mount Garakhonai, whose height reaches 1487 meters. </p><p>  Indigenous people have long been engaged in agriculture.  They grow fruits and vegetables not only for their own needs and for export.  Bananas, avocados, papaya grow well in the lowlands.  Animal husbandry is no less developed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tui.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="San sebastian" class="if uuid-3239338" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3239338.jpg"></div><p>  La Gomera Island is located just thirty kilometers from Tenerife.  Most often, tourists come here during a one-day excursion.  Sightseeing tours of the island do not allow you to see the main attractions.  Therefore, it is better to spend several days reviewing the most interesting places.  Difficult roads do not allow you to quickly travel around the best corners of the region. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Main city </h2><p>  The main city of the island of De La Gomera is San Sebastian.  However, the status of the capital does not make it noisy and crowded.  It is a quiet and sleepy place that catches your eye after Tenerife.  The town was not always so quiet.  In the fifteenth century, the governor ruled here, whose wife tried to restore her cruel orders, as a result of which a rebellion broke out.  The governor was killed, and his wife and children hid in the fortification of the tower of Torre del Conde, which is now one of the main attractions of the island of La Gomera.  Now the tower is considered a symbol of the city.  The wife of the governor also went down in history.  Residents even say that she had a short but passionate affair with Columbus during his visit to the island. </p><div class="photo" data-original="people-dont-have-to-be-anything-else.fandom.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Los Organos" class="if uuid-3239349" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3239349.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to San Sebastian, the island has several more villages and resorts.  All of them are very quiet and calm.  If you want to stay for a few days on the island, you should settle in one of the hotels of the capital.  In this case, you will have the opportunity to see the sights of San Sebastian.  Most of them are connected with the navigator Columbus. </p><h2>  Tower </h2><p>  One of the attractions of the island of La Gomera is the Count's Tower.  The ancient fortress is recognized as the most important object of the region.  It is a prime example of fifteenth-century Spanish military architecture.  The Count Tower was built in 1477 by the Spaniard Hernan Perasa.  The complex was necessary to protect the colony from Aboriginal people.  Over the centuries, the tower has experienced many events: assaults, military clashes and sieges.  There are many bloody stories associated with this place.  Despite all these events, the tower is perfectly preserved.  Now it is part of the historical heritage of the archipelago. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.tenerifenews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dominican Monastery of the Apostle Peter" class="if uuid-3239355" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3239355.jpg"></div><p>  The Count Tower is located in the very center of a small coastal park.  It is open to the public.  Inside the building there is a small museum, in the exposition of which there are geographical maps and other exhibits. </p><h2>  Ascension Church </h2><p>  On the island of La Gomera (Canary Islands), you should see the Ascension Church, which is considered the largest temple in the region.  The building is of interest to tourists for its stunning architecture and ancient history.  That is why the church is a popular attraction. </p><p>  The temple was erected by the Spaniards at the beginning of the 15th century.  He is an excellent example of European architecture of the time.  Despite the great age, the church is perfectly preserved in its original form.  Christopher Columbus brought fame to the temple, because it was within its walls that the navigator prayed for the success of his journey.  Ascension Church is a valuable historical and architectural monument, which is part of the archipelago's heritage. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lagomera.travel" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="La Gomera Island Travel Reviews" class="if uuid-3239368" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3239368.jpg"></div><p>  If you are interested in ancient architecture, you can visit the Dominican monastery of the Apostle Peter, built in the 17th century.  Its main feature is a luxurious altar. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Well of Columbus </h2><p>  Most of the attractions of the island are somehow connected with the name of Columbus.  In San Sebastian, you can take a look at the Columbus well.  Locals tell the legend that it was in it that the legendary traveler collected water before the expedition. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.landolia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="La Gomera Island Canary Islands" class="if uuid-3239370" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3239370.jpg"></div><p>  There is a monument near the port in the courtyard of an old mansion.  The well is outwardly unremarkable.  It looks like a hole in the ground with a fence.  Despite the unsightly view, the well is popular among tourists.  After all, everyone wants to touch the era of discovery. </p><h2>  National park </h2><p>  One of the main attractions of the island is the Garahonai National Park, which is a relict forest with amazing trees.  It is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  It is believed that the forest appeared more than 20 million years ago.  Once such plantations covered the entire territory of Europe.  But the remnants of the forest survived only in Madeira and the Canaries.  It has a warm and humid climate.  Very often fog falls in the forest.  The park covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã4000 hectares.  On its territory runs several hiking trails.  During the walk, tourists have a great opportunity to admire the natural beauties.  It is worth saying that the park is very unusual.  The trees in it are fancifully intertwined and go far into the sky.  Sunlight hardly penetrates through the thickets.  The park is twilight.  On the surface of the earth there are many lichens and moss.  A green carpet adorns the landscape. </p><h2>  Los Organos </h2><p>  The natural landmark of Los Organos is located on the north coast of the island.  The rock has a very unusual appearance and is composed of basalt formations.  Sheer cliffs rise from the sea for 800 meters.  Externally, the rock resembles a pipe organ.  Such a bizarre shape is the result of a volcanic eruption.  Lava froze, and over time, due to erosion, she began to look very unusual. </p><div class="photo" data-original="somoscanarias.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="La Gomera Island Canary Islands" class="if uuid-3239381" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3239381.jpg"></div><p>  Since the attraction is a sheer cliff, you can admire it only from the sea.  Therefore, you should go on a boat excursion.  Sea voyage makes a lasting impression.  The waters of the raging Atlantic Ocean are noisily breaking on a steep cliff, turning into white foam.  By the way, this tour is considered the most popular on the island.  During the trip, people can see not only the rock, but also admire the stunning valleys and small bays, as well as see dolphins and whales. </p><h2>  Island beaches </h2><p>  According to tourists, the island of La Gomera is interesting not only for attractions and natural beauties, but also for beaches.  The length of the coastline of La Gomera reaches 90 km.  Here, among the high cliffs, you can find very picturesque bays.  A total of 20 beaches on the island. </p><p>  The largest beach is Santiago.  Its length reaches 1.5 km.  The beach is well equipped and can surprise demanding tourists.  It has a gravel coating.  There are never waves, so the beach is good for a relaxing holiday.  During the high season, many couples with children relax on the coast. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thespainscoop.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="La Gomera Island Attractions" class="if uuid-3239385" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3239385.jpg"></div><p>  San Sebastian Beach is no less attractive for relaxation.  It reaches a length of 600 meters and a coastline of 55 meters.  The breakwater protects the coast from the tides, so the rest here is always comfortable. </p><p>  Among tourists, the popular beach "La Cueva", surrounded by rocks.  Its length reaches 220 meters.  Its peculiarity is that it has a black sand cover of volcanic origin, which adds exoticness to the place. </p><p>  Also, vacationers love the beach of Vallehermoso.  On its territory there is a beautiful marine park.  The coast is equipped with all accessories for a comfortable stay. </p><p>  If you like sports, it's worth a visit to San Marcos Beach.  There are always strong waves, so the coast was chosen by surfers.  The beach is located in a cozy bay. </p><p>  In the eastern part of the island is the beach of La Calera, which is covered with black volcanic sand.  This stretch of coast is considered one of the most beautiful in the region. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  According to tourists, the island is worth a visit for its stunning nature and its less picturesque beaches.  Of course, La Gomera is a calm and provincial place, but it is not without charm.  The greatest admiration for everyone is the Garakhnoai park.  According to tourists, he should be on the list of any traveler.  The reserve is a unique place worthy of the attention of tourists.  The gloomy forest resembles a fabulous place.  You certainly haven‚Äôt seen anything like this in your life.  No less impressive is Los Organos.  If you want to carefully consider the rock, go on a boat trip.  Its full scale can be considered only from the sea.  The unity of the elements is impressive. </p><p>  Experienced tourists recommend renting a car.  Only in this case you will have time to see the most beautiful corners of the island.  Bus communication due to the difficult terrain is not so developed.  You will spend a lot of extra time traveling by public transport. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thespainscoop.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="La Gomera Island" class="if uuid-3239386" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3239386.jpg"></div><p>  Having visited the island, be sure to visit several beaches.  Due to the volcanic origin of La Gomera, on the coast you will find many beautiful places.  Black sand beaches look especially exotic. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  The island has something to see and where to visit.  But life here is not as noisy and varied as in Tenerife.  From local resorts a little provincial.  But that does not make about.  La Gomera is less attractive, because not everyone loves nightclubs and parties.  The natural landscapes of the island are much more interesting than nightly entertainment. </p>
