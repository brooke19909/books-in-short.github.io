    <p>  Many patriots did not believe them, they began to argue that this is an informational election throw of misinformation in order to obtain additional votes.  We tried to understand objectively the problem.  Have manure taxes really been introduced in Russia?  Was such an innovation a surprise for entrepreneurs?  About everything about it in order. </p><h2>  Manure tax - myth or reality? </h2><p>  When the inscription “the law“ on manure ”appears on some resources, this refers to the Federal Law“ On Production and Consumption Wastes ”already adopted by everyone in our country, adopted in 2014.  Further we will call it the Law. </p><p>  The matter is not even in himself, but in the amendments to him, which equated manure from animals and bird droppings to <span>waste products</span> of the 3rd and 4th hazard class.  What does it mean?  And the fact that manure is now considered not very dangerous in the sense that it does not harm right away, but also not safe, so that it is so easy to throw tons of it into the street. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In fact, the so-called “manure tax” does not exist in Russia.  Licensing of activities is being introduced, and this is somewhat different.  But we’ll talk about this in more detail below. </p><h2>  All evil in the world under good intentions </h2><p>  Lawmakers and ministers scare the numbers.  Like, millions of tons of manure from farms harm our ecology.  The producers of pigs feed chemical "poison" that enters through the "harmful waste" into the soil, thereby polluting it.  We don’t know how others do, but we have several questions: </p><ol><li>  If lawmakers care so much about the soil and do not allow chemicals in manure, then why are they allowed to feed the animals with this very “poison”?  Why in the shops on the shelves is the meat of birds that were stuffed with chemicals?  That is, it is possible to feed people with such “chemical carcasses”, and is it dangerous to throw waste after them without special treatment? </li><li>  Why a license?  It turns out, in order to protect our environment, it is necessary to get a bunch of permits?  Why not create state-owned waste management centers to support agriculture? </li><li>  Why before crises and budget deficits for many years manure was always fertilizer, and now it suddenly became a “hazardous waste”?  And the volume of production in agriculture at the same Soviet time was much higher than now.  Of course, chemistry appeared.  But why then various checks of Rospotrebnadzor, veterinarians, etc.?  Why should manure from all producers be called “one comb” hazardous waste? </li></ol><h2>  Money doesn't smell </h2><p>  Many experts have one conclusion - “money is odorless”.  Manure production tax is needed to pump money from entrepreneurs.  The fact is that the goods of enterprises that sell manure as organic fertilizer are in great demand.  Humus is especially appreciated in Central Russia.  This is a whole industry in the economy.  Many small individual entrepreneurs live on this.  In addition, livestock is becoming more profitable.  In addition to milk and meat, many enterprising farmers sell more manure.  Apparently, this decided to nip our state and impose additional requisitions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Has trouble crept unnoticed? </h2><p>  But we can’t say that the Law fell like snow on his head.  He was accepted back in December 2014.  It was assumed that the manure tax in Russia (a license must be obtained by enterprises that conduct relevant activities) will appear from January 1, 2016.  But manufacturers by this time did not prepare for new requirements and bombarded the Ministry of Natural Resources of the Russian Federation with letters of explanation. </p><h2>  Are you crazy? </h2><p>  Many politicians and even regional leaders perceived the law as anti-people.  But we will not enter into discussions on this subject.  We will only say that on July 1, the licensing situation did not improve.  An example of Tatarstan is indicative.  Out of 800 agricultural enterprises, not one has received a license.  From Naberezhnye Chelny, one company filed an application, but it was refused due to an insufficient package of documents. </p><h2>  What to do with a single cow? </h2><p>  But the so-called manure tax in the Russian Federation will not affect <span>personal subsidiary plots.</span>  This is for now.  About what will happen tomorrow, God alone knows.  Taxes on air, pipe, wind, thunder no longer seem from the realm of fiction.  But for now, the grandmother, who has only one or two ladybugs on her private household, can sleep peacefully.  No dung tax threatens her.  Licensing is required only for legal entities. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Issue price </h2><p>  The problem is that, according to experts, an impressive amount will be needed for manufacturers.  From 100 thousand to 1.5 million rubles.  - to small producers for waste collection, and from 400 thousand to 20 million rubles.  - for large ones that will utilize this manure. </p><h2>  What do you need money for? </h2><p>  Of course, the factor of corruption and bureaucracy does not count.  But maybe the spread in the amount of specialists from 100 to 400 thousand rubles, this suggests.  For large entrepreneurs, it reaches 20 million. But why do we need money?  We will answer - to implement the requirements of the Law significant expenses will be required: </p><ul><li>  For education.  Now, every tractor driver in the village who transports manure must undergo courses in order to be allowed to work with hazardous waste.  Some machine operators, of course, will be greatly surprised by this.  Like, they drove all their lives, and now this is a dangerous production.  Naturally, such courses will be paid.  For example, in the Belgorod region they cost in the region of 6-10 thousand rubles.  But how much their price will be in other regions and for how long documents will be issued is unknown. </li><li>  On the equipment of transport.  The law provides for special signs and containers. </li><li>  Sanitary and epidemiological conclusions on facilities for the collection, storage and disposal (disposal) of waste. </li></ul><h2>  Is cattle a dangerous profession now? </h2><p>  All agricultural producers began to fill up departments with all kinds of letters. </p>

    <p>  What to do in this situation?  Storage of manure for more than 11 months necessarily falls under a license, without which a penalty is provided.  In addition, judging by the Law, any transportation will also fall under it.  That is, if the enterprise has a temporary storage a few kilometers from the farm, then it also does not have the right to transport pigs waste without special permission. </p>

    <p>  The Law spells out "registration of a license for the collection, transportation, processing, recycling, disposal, disposal of waste of I-IV classes."  This means that an <span>auxiliary worker</span> on a farm with pigs must also undergo training in working with hazardous production.  After all, he can collect manure from cows or pigs.  And the Law says so: “collection”. </p><p>  The tractor driver also has no right to transport him even to the place where the special operator will come for him, if the company does not have a license, and the employee has permits. </p><p>  All these actions are actually illegal and are fined.  And their sums are impressive.  From 10 to 30 thousand rubles for an official, from 100 to 250 thousand for a legal one.  How the inspection services will react is not yet clear. </p>

    <h2>  Gave manure - got an article? </h2><p>  If the farmers suddenly sell (and even give, judging by the Law) manure to another person, then criminal liability may be brought for this.  This refers to illegal business <span>(Article 171 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).</span>  The Law says so that a license is necessary "when a legal entity sells ... manure, litter, other organic substances and materials to third parties on a contractual (including free) basis." </p><p>  Conclusion: even gratuitous transfer of manure should be licensed.  And implementation without permission is illegal business.  It is clearly seen from the Law that the “implementation” also includes a “gratuitous basis”. </p><h2>  Who is to blame and what to do? </h2><p>  And again, our two questions.  Who is to blame?  This, of course, is all of us, citizens of the country.  Our deputies do not arrive from Mars.  We select them during the election.  But what to do?  Here are a few options: </p><ol><li>  To unite by several small entrepreneurs in a single "holding" to obtain their own license. </li><li>  Conclude a special contract with the operator who has it.  They will introduce a tax on manure.  In all likelihood, in this case it falls under the category of “environmental tax”.  Its amount depends on the costs of a particular operator and is not regulated anywhere.  That is, if they tell the farmer 5 thousand rubles per ton, but there are no other companies that have licenses, then they will have to pay as much as they say.  Fines will be more expensive.  Now an interesting question.  In this case, will the price for the end consumer decrease or increase? </li><li>  Put under the knife all the livestock and declare the company bankrupt.  So the manure tax in Russia will ruin many unprofitable agricultural enterprises. </li><li>  Do not have a license and violate the law.  About the consequences we said above. </li></ol><h2>  Manure tax in the Russian Federation: how to get a license </h2><p>  There is no license specifically for manure.  It is provided for hazardous waste. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="manure tax in Russia how to get a license" class="if" height="447" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1447373.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  But let's say that before you start running around the authorities and departments (and this is not easy), you need to prepare the technological base: </p><ul><li>  Prepare specially equipped and specially marked vehicles. </li><li>  Prepare and include the waste disposal facility in the state register of such facilities.  And these are all kinds of approvals of environmental assessments, inspections of SES, the Ministry of Natural Resources and so on.  In general, the matter is not easy.  The case is quite expensive.  It is only necessary to store manure for at least 12 months on a site equipped with hard surface. </li><li>  Obtain a personnel certificate for the purpose of admission to work with hazardous waste. </li></ul><p>  In addition, after obtaining a license, it is necessary to keep records of manure, carry out <span>environmental monitoring,</span> special treatment, store a certain amount of time (cow manure, for example, from 12 months) and much more. </p>
