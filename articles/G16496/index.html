    <h2>  Film, tape and pencil </h2><p>  In order for the clothes for the Monster High doll to be created with your own hands to be truly beautiful, you need to sew it according to the correct patterns.  After all, it is in the design work that the entire complexity of the work of the fashion designer is the construction of the correct patterns, after working with which the clothes will sit just amazingly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Monster High dolls are unusual in composition.  They have a thin waist, arms and legs, a small body with a chest and a fairly large head.  Such disproportionateness distinguishes the collection of these toys from the like.  Therefore, the clothes for the Monster High doll are also unusual.  With their own hands, it is difficult to build patterns for them if you do not use a little trick: cling film, paper tape and a pencil. </p><p>  The doll body must be wrapped with cling film.  Then, with small pieces of <span>masking tape,</span> glue it.  Directly on the pasted tape to draw a pattern - armholes of the sleeves, neck.  To cut the film together with scissors with nail scissors, divide the resulting structure into separate parts.  Those bends that are obtained on a paper structure should be carefully cut and deployed on a flat surface - in these places you will get tucks or additional parts.  Patterns are ready.  With a cut of fabric, it is necessary to provide allowances for seams, bending of the bottom of the product.  For a thing to turn out beautiful, it would be good to observe the direction of the shared thread in all equally located parts of the garment. </p>

    <h2>  Correct details </h2><p>  It is not enough to design the clothes themselves; you still need to think about how to put them on the doll.  Since the heads of Monster High dolls are too large compared to bodies, it is impossible to put on dresses over your head.  So dresses, blouses, half-loops should have convenient fasteners.  It is best to place them on the back, and to fasten the cuts, use thin strips of Velcro.  The sewn clothes for the Monster High doll with your own hands can, of course, be fastened with buttons, but then they should be small enough to look harmoniously on an elegant toy.  Also, as fasteners, you can use small dress hooks and eyelets or buttons.  This type of fastener is most suitable for overall clothing - fur coats, coats, jackets. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Grace in everything </h2><p>  Clothing for a Monster High doll, made with its own hands in stages, will look elegant and beautiful if it is sewn with small stitches.  Yes, in factories for the production of toys all doll clothes are sewn in a thread on sewing machines.  But at home it‚Äôs more convenient to sew a dress for your pet manually.  Moreover, the Monster High dolls are very elegant, all the details of clothing for them are small, thin.  And therefore, a thin needle with a thin thread is the most suitable tool for such work.  Seams can be the most different that are used in manual sewing, but they should be as small as possible and extremely accurate.  It is most convenient to sew doll clothes with an overcast seam - so the details of the clothes are gathered together, and the seam will not be strewed.  Many needlewomen sewing outfits for dolls, including for Monster High, use a machine in their work.  But this is the highest level of skill, because you need to feel the fabric and own the machine, like a professional dressmaker. </p>

    <h2>  Clothes decor </h2><p>  Monster High dolls are special characters in the puppet world.  All of them, according to the plan of their creators, are students of the school of monsters, their parents are famous characters in scary tales and horror films.  Therefore, the appearance of the pupae is appropriate.  But if you wash away all the frightening decor from them, then they will be cute toys.  But Monster High is loved for their dissimilarity to the others.  Therefore, the clothes for the Monster High doll, sewn with their own hands, should be appropriate.  Decor for dresses of a certain style does not have to be intimidating.  In the official wardrobe of Monster High dolls, you can find sets of clothes for all occasions - from walking with a dog to a wedding.  For example, the pattern of a blouse for a toy can be made according to the proposed template, the grid is a school student‚Äôs notebook in a box. </p>

    <p>  To work on the <span>clothes of dolls,</span> you can use any fabrics, ribbons, braid, leather or leatherette.  The only condition is that all elements and details must be harmonious with the size of the toy.  However, it can be very different - sewn clothes for the Monster High doll with their own hands.  A master class in tailoring a doll‚Äôs wardrobe, which you can easily find, will tell you in photographs or video all the stages of creating a particular dress.  For those who are just trying their hand at modeling, you can use the existing experience for Monster High.  A pattern, by the way, can be done; there is a neatly tidy dress that isn‚Äôt very interesting for the doll to be "tired of," and each part is steamed, spreading the increments to the seams, then the pattern is transferred to paper. </p>
