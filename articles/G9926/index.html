The Taiwanese company HTC did not stand aside.  In January 2013, she introduced the world to a model called the <span>HTC One</span> 32GB.  This smartphone was just a discovery and was recognized as the best of those that were on the market from January to August 2013.  We bring to your attention a review of HTC One 32 GB, which will describe the characteristics of the smartphone, as well as its appearance and equipment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc one 32gb" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/542273.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  External characteristics </h2><p>  Taiwanese company developers have always been successful in designing their smartphones.  Sometimes it even seemed that the company was pouring the largest amount of money into the design department.  And now the company has presented a very interesting model to users for review.  The entire phone case is made of aluminum.  And if before the developers tried to correct the flaws with plastic inserts, now the gadget is a monolithic aluminum case in which the battery, display and smartphone screen are placed.  The whole design is designed in a very interesting manner. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As for the color scheme, buyers have the opportunity to purchase three options for a smartphone: silver, black and gold (HTC One 32GB Gold).  On the back of the phone, you can notice for a long time everyone loved the Beats Audio inscription, as well as a four-megapixel camera.  The front of the HTC One 32GB is no less interesting than the back.  Above and below the smartphone are speakers for conversation.  Bottom between the back and home buttons, the company name flaunts on the screen.  Above is the <span>front camera.</span>  As for the keys, the power button is located, as usual, on the upper end part, and the sound setting is on the left.  On the right side is a slot for a SIM card.  Below there is a USB connector. </p>

    <h2>  Sound </h2><p>  The HTC One 32GB review could not be considered complete, if not to mention the sound quality from the speakers.  So, he's just gorgeous.  As a rule, smartphones are unable to reproduce sounds well, but what this phone does is simply amazing.  It seems that the sound does not come from the phone, but from the speakers of the computer.  In the headphones, the music does not get worse, but rather, on the contrary, especially if you turn on the ‚ÄúBits Audio‚Äù function, which allows you to feel every musical instrument that has been involved.  As for the conversation, you can hear your interlocutor not only in a room isolated from noise, but even on a crowded street.  Moreover, the speaker volume can be left at 70%.  In this case, the interlocutor will be heard so well that one would think that he was next to you. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Smartphone screen </h2><p>  Phone HTC One 32GB has the same screen as its predecessor - HTC One X. That is, its diagonal is 4.7 inches.  The screen itself is covered with red-hot <span>Gorilla Glass</span> 2, which allows you not to worry about the appearance of unwanted scratches on it.  As for the display, the smartphone is at a very high level.  <span>The screen resolution</span> is as much as 1920 x 1080. That is, the pixel density is 468 ppi.  On such a screen, you will not just not notice the dots; you cannot even find them under the magnifying glass.  The display itself is made using Super LCD 3 technology. In bright sunshine, any text remains readable, even with all kinds of variations with the angle of the smartphone. </p>

    <h2>  Cameras and Photos </h2><p>  It would seem that now the HTC One 32GB review will only praise this phone, but it wasn‚Äôt there.  The camera is the weakest link in this gadget.  And if you want to buy a smartphone as a camera, this one is unlikely to suit you.  The fact is that the developers of the company wanted to make a revolution and move from quantity to quality, reducing the number of megapixels to 4, but at the same time improving the quality of the received image.  It turned out, frankly, not really.  Yes, the camera from a smartphone from Taiwan was better at evening shooting, but as soon as the sun rose, all the charm immediately disappeared.  The image detail immediately began to limp, and the quality of the images noticeably deteriorated.  In other words, we can conclude that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãworking on quality is good, but not yet thought out to the end. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  As for the front camera, it is 2 megapixels.  Of course, they are quite enough so that your face can be determined when you communicate with your Skype companion. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc one 32gb black" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/542271.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Operating system and software </h2><p>  The operating system on which the HTC One 32GB smartphone runs is Android 4.1 with the ability to upgrade to 4.2.2.  At the same time, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 with a clock frequency of 1.7 GHz is used as a processor.  As for RAM, it is 2 gigabytes, which is quite enough for the phone to work quickly, as well as to pull heavy toys. </p><p>  The features of this gadget include HTC Sense, which is characteristic only for smartphones from Taiwan.  You should also pay attention to the fact that the HTC One 32GB phone has a program that allows you to use the smartphone at a certain distance as a control panel for almost every electronic and household appliances.  In addition, there are several programs that simplify the work with the interface and improve the reproduced sound.  Perhaps this is why the sound in the speakers of the phone and in the headphones is heard at a very good level. </p><p>  Do not forget about the smartphone battery, whose volume is 2300 mAh.  This volume may be enough for a sufficiently long period, if you do not load the smartphone at full capacity.  Otherwise, it is best to always keep the charger near. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc one 32gb reviews" class="if" height="417" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10393/544691.jpg" width="469"></div></h2><h2>  What comes with the HTC One 32Gb </h2><p>  As is customary, a high-tech smartphone manufacturer from Taiwan does not use ordinary cubic containers as a box, but special branded packaging with truncated corners.  This gives the product a certain charm.  So, by opening this box, you can find the phone itself, a headset from HTC, a USB device that allows you to connect the gadget to a personal computer for end-to-end Internet connection or file transfer, as well as documentation and a charger.  It is worth noting that the battery of this smartphone is lithium, and its volume is 2300 mAh, which is quite enough for the device to last 1-1.5 days with an average load.  Earlier, the Bits Audio headphones were bundled with the phones of this company.  Now the company has refused this, citing the fact that this allows to reduce the total cost, and therefore the price of the smartphone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc one 32gb gold" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/542307.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  HTC One 32GB.  Price </h2><p>  As mentioned above, this phone has several options in color.  So, if black and silver smartphones cost about the same, then the gold version will be more expensive by 30-40 dollars.  In different stores in the country, the cost of this phone may be different.  But if you try to give a price range, then the HTC One 32GB Black can be purchased for about 450-500 US dollars, while the price of a gold version of the smartphone will start already at $ 500. </p><h2>  Expert opinion and customer reviews </h2><p>  This model of smartphone is perhaps the first phone from HTC, which collects almost only positive reviews from both one and the other.  So what are the pros and cons of HTC One 32GB?  Customer reviews agree that its advantage is primarily with the price / quality ratio.  Not everywhere for $ 500 you can find a smartphone with such characteristics as this creation of Taiwanese developers.  Also noted is the operational work of the smartphone, good playback of video files and, of course, amazing sound that is equally good both from the speakers of the phone and in the headphones. </p><p>  Among the minuses of this smartphone model, only one is called - a 4 MP camera.  In fairness, it should be noted that HTC has never been a leader in the production of smartphones with amazing cameras.  And for the idea, which is based on improving the quality of the recording, developers can only be praised. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc one 32gb phone" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/542303.jpg" width="350"></div>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  The result of this review can be considered that the HTC One 32GB phone is a great option for purchase.  It combines both good technical and excellent visual characteristics at the same time.  It is unlikely that there will be another smartphone on the market, similar to this one, which for the same price can offer a similar list of functions and features.  Of course, the camera on this smartphone leaves much to be desired, but to call it disgusting does not turn the tongue.  The quality of images is inferior to competitors, but still remains at a fairly high level.  Therefore, think carefully before making the final choice.  Still, most people around the world have recognized that this particular smartphone is one of the best of its kind to date.  The HTC One 32GB review proved it. </p>
