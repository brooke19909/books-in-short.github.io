The suburban real estate market takes this into account.  Developers working in conditions of fierce competition are increasingly going to the outskirts of the city and its suburbs, mastering the available territories that are still there. </p><p>  One of such projects was a new building near the metro "Devyatkino" - LCD "Okhtinskaya Duga".  <span>The residential complex,</span> belonging to the economy class segment, is located in the Vsevolozhsk district, near the village of Murino. </p>

    <p>  Active construction of several residential complexes is ongoing on the territory of this settlement and in its environs.  LCD "Okhtinskaya Duga", whose developer is the company "Zapstroy", is the smallest of them.  It is designed for a certain contingent - students and young families, in connection with which it offers only small-format apartments. </p><h2>  A few words about the developer </h2><p>  Zapstroy has been operating on the market for the twelfth year.  He is engaged in the construction of both commercial and residential real estate.  The latter refers to the economy class segment.  The company has a good reputation, is considered a responsible and reliable developer.  Pleases buyers with low apartment prices, as well as the fact that he builds houses efficiently and in record time.  In addition, the developer is one of the few such on the St. Petersburg real estate market who insure their liability.  In this regard, the purchase of an apartment from the developer may not cause the buyer any concerns. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Currently, Zapstroy has eight successfully completed projects.  From customers and buyers, the developer receives only positive reviews.  Neither the deadlines for the commissioning of the objects, nor the quality of the real estate being built, have any complaints. </p><h2>  About the complex </h2><p>  Residential complex “Okhtinskaya Duga” (St. Petersburg) consists of three apartment buildings of different floors, which are being built in three stages.  All of them are planned taking into account the concept of unity of architectural style and are modern buildings that are in perfect harmony with the surrounding area.  A distinctive feature of the project is that all houses are constructed from panels manufactured by Kirishi House-Building Plant CJSC, which is well known in the real estate market for the quality of its products.  Moreover, the company is a regular partner of the developer of the residential complex “Okhtinskaya Duga” - the company “Zapstroy”, which explains the quality and speed of completion of the facilities of the latter.  The first floors of all houses are allocated for commercial real estate. </p>

    <p>  LCD "Okhtinskaya Duga" is located, as already mentioned, near the metro station "Devyatkino", which is an undoubted and fat plus of the complex under construction.  Thus, houses being built are great for those who decide to combine life on the outskirts with working in a megalopolis, as real estate owners will definitely not have problems getting to work. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Residential complex “Okhtinskaya Duga”: construction progress </h2><p>  Work on the construction of the complex began in 2014.  Today, the first stage house is almost ready.  In the second half of 2016, more than 620 apartments will be commissioned.  As for the houses of the second and third stage, the deadline for their construction is scheduled for 2018.  However, company experts say that this long-awaited event is likely to happen sooner. </p><p>  As for the progress of construction, all work is carried out in strict accordance with the schedule, no delays are recorded.  The developer periodically posts on its websites all information available on this issue.  Moreover, it allows everyone to visit the construction site and evaluate the pace of construction and the quality of the facility. </p><h2>  Ecology of the area </h2><p>  The question of the environmental situation in the region worries every potential client.  The Vsevolozhsk district, which provided its territory for the construction of the housing complex of the Okhtinskaya Duga residential complex, is considered relatively favorable in this regard.  There are no large industrial enterprises in this region, with the exception of the paper processing plant, and therefore the air here is quite clean.  The damage caused by the enterprise is fully compensated by the presence in the area of ​​multiple forests, one of which begins in the immediate vicinity of the complex under construction. </p>

    <p>  Okhta also flows near the LCD; not far from it, the Izbuchechny Stream, which is well-known to all Petersburgers, also murmurs gaily.  There are well-maintained forest areas in the area, and two ski resorts are located nearby. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Transport </h2><p>  Transport accessibility is ensured by the presence of a 1.5 km roundabout, as well as the Devyatkino metro station, not far from which there is another metro station - Grazhdansky Prospekt.  In addition, in the village of Murino, near which work is underway, there is a bus station and a railway station, from which electric trains run to the <span>Finland Station</span> .  Travel time is half an hour. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Quite often you can find negative reviews about the Okhtinskaya Duga residential complex regarding the fact that the developer is not involved in the construction of infrastructure facilities near the complex.  These people can answer the following: the developer focuses on the rapid commissioning of residential meters, and therefore tries to correctly select a place for future construction.  This is exactly the case with the Okhtinskaya Duga residential complex. </p>

    <p>  There are several new buildings near the complex.  Some of them have already been commissioned, and infrastructure facilities are already operating next to them.  In any case, you can buy essential goods, as well as products, next to the house.  In addition, the village of Murino also has social and commercial facilities: a kindergarten, school, pharmacy, dispensary, large shops and even a sports complex.  Well, supermarkets, entertainment centers, sports clubs, restaurants and cafes can be found near the metro.  Fortunately, if necessary, you can even walk.  In addition, there are three schools and several kindergartens.  However, you can go to Vsevolozhsk, because the bus stop is located next to the buildings. </p><h2>  LCD "Okhtinskaya Duga", St. Petersburg: apartments </h2><p>  As already mentioned, only studios and 1- and 2-bedroom apartments can be purchased in the complex.  Since the housing offers economy class housing, all the rooms are quite compact, due to which, in fact, it was possible to achieve reasonable prices. </p><p>  As for the planning decisions, the buyer, unfortunately, will not find much variety.  "Dvushka" are generally presented in a single version.  Studios and odnushki will please with three layout options.  The apartments, as already mentioned, are quite compact.  The largest quadrature the studio has is 31.8. </p>

    <p>  LCD "Okhtinskaya Duga" is not the only complex that focuses on such small apartments.  St. Petersburg today is literally being built up with houses with small living quarters, which is apparently due to their low cost.  It is quite understandable - albeit small, but on the other hand, own and modern comfortable housing. </p><p>  As for the studios in the Okhtinskaya Duga residential complex, they all have combined bathrooms, but are equipped with fairly spacious loggias and hallways.  In one and two bedroom apartments, either premises or niches for a pantry or dressing room are equipped.  Regardless of the format, each apartment has either a loggia or a balcony.  By the way, in any type of room, access to it is provided through the kitchen.  The apartments are for rent with a rough finish, which involves the presence of screeds on the floor, installation of all communications, a glazed balcony and a wooden front door. </p><h2>  Prices </h2><p>  Experts call the cost of apartments in the Okhtinskaya Duga residential complex one of the most acceptable among similar offers in this segment.  How much will such “economical” housing cost the buyer?  For the studio you will have to pay from one and a half to two and a half million rubles, for "odnushka" with an area of ​​32 to 38 "squares" - from two to three million.  And for the "kopeck piece" (57-71 sq. M.) - from 3,600,000 to 4,300,000 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="new building near metro devyatkino lcd okhtinskaya arc" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1283846.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Since the apartments have not yet been commissioned, it is not yet possible to find either grateful or indignant reviews about their quality from the residents.  But since the developer constantly conducts kind of excursions to the buildings being built, and the first house is almost 95 percent ready, some potential buyers have already made up a certain opinion about their future housing.  Almost everyone says that the apartments, albeit small, but incredibly well-planned.  Any of them simply admire its ergonomics and functionality.  True, almost everyone complains about the poor finish.  In order, as they say, to bring home to mind, you still have a lot of work to do.  However, many people find in this a certain positive - the ability to carry out repairs on their own will save significantly.  By the way, in any case, you can contact the developer, who for an additional fee promises to provide the services of specialist finishers. </p>

    <p>  People call the cost of apartments quite acceptable, but some, as we have already mentioned, are unhappy that the developer is not involved in the construction of infrastructure facilities.  And, of course, everyone unanimously admires the location of the complex.  Nevertheless, the fact that a metro station is located just over half a kilometer from the threshold of the house cannot but rejoice. </p>
