The lion's share of the reasons for their appearance lies in the unwillingness of a small group of people (most often representing the interests of the authorities) to share information with a wide range of people (for example, society).  Therefore, the question: “Where is Hitler’s grave?”  - is still open to historians. </p><p>  <strong>Official version</strong> </p>

The bodies of the dead were doused with gasoline, burned and buried in the garden.

    <p>  Four days later, Soviet soldiers dug up their remains.  Investigative measures were taken at the Berlin morgue, where it was decided to store the bodies.  By comparing the data of Hitler’s dentist and the dead man’s jaw, the investigators confidently stated that the deceased was indeed Adolf Hitler. </p><p>  However, even now the official authorities refuse to give an exact answer to the question: “Where is Hitler buried?”, Referring to <span>state secret.</span>  It is believed that the remains of the Fuhrer are in Moscow: the jaw is in the FSB archive, and part of the skull lies in the State Archive. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Removal of the remains</strong> </p><p>  Historians, based on documents from the declassified archives of the MGB-KGB-FSB, count at least seven places where Hitler was buried.  The fact is that the special services, under pressure from the political elite, constantly transferred the remains of Hitler, Eva Braun and the Goebbels family from place to place.  The last time they were buried in a military town near Magdeburg, Germany. </p>

Moreover, everything happened with the knowledge of the Soviet leadership and in complete secrecy.  The exhumations were preceded by serious preliminary preparation, observation posts were even put up.

    <p>  The excavated remains were brought to the landfill, which was nearby, frayed into dust, burned and scattered ashes in the wind. </p><p>  <strong>An unofficial version of where Hitler is buried</strong> </p><p>  Adherents of the unofficial version believe that in 1945, doubles of the German leader and his wife were killed in Berlin.  The difference in the testimonies of the prisoners and the information about the nine-month operation of the Soviet special services in Germany on the search for Hitler give reason to doubt the correctness of the official version. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Some researchers write in their books that Hitler "paid off" from the Allies, transferring to them an amount equal to now $ 100 billion, and German developments in the field of rocket science and nuclear fusion.  In return, he and many other Germans (called the figure of 100 thousand people) were allowed to flee to Argentina and live there until 1964.  It was in this year that the Fuhrer passed away and was buried in an unknown place.  There is still no exact and unambiguous answer.  It is safe to say that many people earned a lot of money and fame in the next "investigation of the century." </p><p>  <strong>Hitler's books</strong> </p>
