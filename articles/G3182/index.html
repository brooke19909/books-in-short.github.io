Many believed that they would completely disappear from store shelves.  However, this did not happen.  The reason for this was the increased demand for models with a button keyboard.  Many people for various reasons do not want to switch to smartphones.  Some do not like the large size, others do not want to delve into the wide functionality. </p><p>  Nowadays, you can often meet people with two phones.  As a rule, the second is necessary only for making calls.  The requirements for it are not very large - the duration of the battery life, the excellent sound of the speaker and microphone, a clear screen.  This is exactly how the Nokia 515 Dual Sim is.  Reviews of the owners of this model in most cases are positive.  They note that the device not only perfectly copes with the main tasks, but also in terms of functionality practically does not lag behind modern smartphones. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 515 reviews" class="if" height="355" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1572593.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What is the Nokia 515 Dual Sim? </h2><p>  In 2013, buyers saw a new product from Nokia.  The model with the index 515 interested a large number of people.  It is a cross between a simple push-button telephone and a modern gadget.  The similarity with budget devices is in the form of a case and the presence of a traditional keyboard.  But the expansion of communication and functionality equates the Nokia 515 phone with smartphones. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  According to the reviews of the owners, this model has many advantages, the main of which are the optimal size, convenient shape, and a chic camera for such devices.  And this is not all advantages.  About them will be told a little later. </p><p>  Given the functionality, you can find a large number of competitors.  For example, Nokia Lumia.  The cost of these devices is almost the same (within 9,000 rubles), but the touchscreen smartphone has more advanced software.  But in the segment of push-button phones, this model has no competitors, since it is simply impossible to find a device that has such a nice and fresh design. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 515 dual sim" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1572595.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  General characteristics </h2><p>  Familiarity with the phone will be incomplete if you do not consider its technical characteristics.  The manufacturer claims the high quality and reliability of the Nokia 515. Owner reviews 100% confirm this information.  There are no comments either on the assembly or on the materials used. </p><p>  So what is hidden under such an attractive shell?  The mobile device is designed to work with two <span>SIM cards, type Micro-SIM.</span>  Case dimensions: 114 √ó 48 √ó 11 mm.  With such dimensions, the phone weighs only 101 g. The screen is quite large.  It is proportional to the keyboard.  The diagonal of the display is 2.4 ∫.  The type of matrix is ‚Äã‚ÄãTFT.  Resolution: 240 √ó 320 pix.  The number of pixels per inch is 167. The display shows 16 million colors.  The device is equipped with a lithium-ion battery.  Type: BL-4U.  Its capacity is 1250 mAh.  The amount of internal memory is 256 MB.  There is a slot for a microSD memory card, with a maximum size of up to 32 GB.  The resolution of the camera is excellent - 5 Mr.  There is an LED flash. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Construction and housing </h2><p>  The advantages of the classic push-button phone were perfectly beaten by the manufacturer.  He supplemented them with high-class materials that were used in the assembly of Nokia 515. Reviews of the design and housing are striking in their unity.  All owners are satisfied with both quality and design.  The company's decision to release the phone in several color options was correct.  This makes it possible to call it universal, since the device is perfect for both men and women.  If Nokia 515 Dual Sim (Black) looks strictly and solidly, then the white copy (White) is very impressive. </p><p>  Particularly praised was the body material - anodized aluminum.  Its use makes the model similar to the Nokia 6700.  However, in the new device, the use of plastic is minimized to a minimum - there are small splashes in the finish.  Owners are pleased that fingerprints do not remain on the case.  Ergonomics at the highest level.  The phone is easy and convenient to use without fear that it will slip out. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 515" class="if" height="288" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1572601.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Screen Reviews </h2><p>  What about the display?  Of course, many owners note it is not very large.  Especially the screen is inferior in comparison with modern smartphones.  However, this is explained very simply - the concept of the phone.  If you do not pay attention to size, you can see many advantages.  All owners noticed excellent color reproduction, good viewing angles.  The screen does not fade in the sun.  Image is not grainy, acceptable quality.  It was possible to achieve such characteristics due to the rejection of the QVGA-matrix - it was replaced by a modern technological module. </p><p>  The owners of this model noticed that the screen does not scratch over time.  The manufacturer installed protection on it - <span>Gorilla Glass</span> 2. It is widely used in smartphones and has already received a large number of positive reviews. </p>

    <h2>  Nokia 515 camera features: owner reviews </h2><p>  The camera is the main advantage of this model.  If buyers still doubt about functionality, then all opinions are unanimous on this issue.  The phone is equipped with a 5 MP camera.  It does not provide autofocus, but there is a flash.  Thanks to her, you can take high-quality pictures in low light.  Not many button devices have such features.  <span>Of</span> course, there are competitors, for example, <span>Samsung S5611.</span>  It is similar in characteristics, but inferior in battery capacity (only 1000 mAh) and has a plastic case. </p><p>  Owners of Nokia 515 highlight a wide range of options.  Thanks to them, you can change the settings, take several pictures in a row, activate portrait mode, and more.  I really liked the opportunity for customers to center the focus.  There is no front camera in this model, but with this option you can take a photo of yourself on your own.  To do this, you need to deploy the device with the back side and, listening to voice prompts, adjust the lens. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 515 dual sim black" class="if" height="407" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1572605.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Battery Reviews </h2><p>  All phones of the Finnish manufacturer are famous for their long battery life.  The Nokia 515 model was no exception. Owner reviews indicate that with active use, the battery will be discharged only after 5-7 days.  In talk mode, the device will last about 10 hours, this time will be reduced by half if you use the Internet (2G / 3G).  Compared to some smartphones, such indicators are considered simply excellent.  And if the phone is in standby mode, then a full battery discharge will occur only after 30-33 days. </p>
