What is the rest there?  And the prices, especially for the summer-autumn season of 2017?  In this article, we will try to impartially and objectively cover the holidays in Gudauta, a resort town located just 77 kilometers from the Russian Adler.  Reviews about this Abkhazian town are mixed.  Therefore, we tried to group positive and negative feedback so that the reader could get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat awaits him in Gudauta.  Whether you go to the resorts unrecognized by most countries of the Republic of Abkhazia is up to you.  So far, we can say this: those who are nostalgic for the USSR will like their vacation there.  With all the ensuing pros and cons.  If you are accustomed to high-quality service, then you are a little to the south, in the rapidly developing Batumi.  Abkhazia, however, recalls the long-forgotten times when vacationers were unpretentious and did not require too much from life.  When the most appreciated were cordiality and pristine nature. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest in gudauta" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1924737.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is Gudauta located </h2><p>  This resort is often called climatological.  Why?  Yes, because the Caucasus Mountains here recede from the sea at a distance of twenty kilometers.  As a result, flat terrain are ignored by showers and thunderstorms, such frequent in the summer in Gagra and Sukhumi.  <span>Gudautu</span> is distinguished from other resorts in <span>Abkhazia</span> by a large number of sunny days, drier air.  A river flows through the plain, giving the city its name.  Goodow brings to the Black Sea coast a small rolled pebble.  To the east of the city center by the harbor is sand.  So you have a good beach holiday in Gudauta.  The location of the resort can be attributed to the pluses.  Near the Russian border, drive from Adler for about two hours.  Passport control pass many reviews characterize as purely symbolic.  Russians in Abkhazia are tolerated; one can count on hospitality and mutual respect. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gudauta recreation center" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1924775.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Back to USSR </h2><p>  Historically, in Soviet times, Gudauta remained in the shadow of other Black Sea resorts.  Sukhumi and Gagra completely overshadowed it from most vacationers.  Gudauta residents grew citrus fruits and tobacco.  But nevertheless, in this small town, the population of which barely totals eight thousand people, a health and beach holiday was possible.  In Gudauta during the Soviet era, two sanatoriums were built, a small hydropathic center.  And if someone has been to this resort twenty or more years ago, we are in a hurry to please you: nothing has changed since then.  When you get to Gudauta, you are as if transported by a time machine during the years of the Soviet Union.  Only the private sector provides more offers.  Rest here will cost you less than in Gagra and Sukhumi, and, of course, it will be more economical than in Russian or Georgian resorts.  But to go here with exaggerated requirements for the service is not worth it. </p><h2>  Cons Gudauta location </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the mountains of the Caucasus in this place recede a dozen or two kilometers from the sea, the terrain cannot be called plain.  The city itself was founded at the mouth of Gudow.  And so that the river is not demolished by the flood of the building, the settlement is located on a plateau.  And so the streets in Gudauta are more like steep stairs.  This must be remembered when going to this resort with a small child.  Older people should also take a more responsible approach to finding housing in Gudauta.  Holidays on the beach are possible, you just need to check all the rental offers with a resort map.  But the undoubted advantages also include the fact that it is easy to get to Gudauta.  It lies on the way from Russian resorts to Sukhumi.  The city has a train station and a bus station.  You can get to the resort by Abkhaz minibuses, crossing the border on foot. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest in gudauta reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1924746.jpg" width="600"></div>

Yes, the resort infrastructure has remained at the same level as it was 25 years ago.  But nobody canceled private enterprise.  And the number of small family hotels has increased significantly.  It should be borne in mind that not too many tourists go to Abkhazia and Gudauta.  The recreation centers are therefore happy to welcome guests in any season.  And they are designed for different wallet sizes.  The private sector is also striking in its diversity.  It can be either a mini-hotel with cottages equipped on a turnkey basis, or sheds, as in the good old days, with a toilet in the yard and a summer shower.  What guest houses are praised by tourists who visited Gudauta in 2017?  This is "Meka" on the street.  Narta, 116, "Lyudmila" on the street  Gumistinskaya, 25, hotel "San Siro".  For early booking, you can get a pretty tangible discount. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Abkhazia Gudauta recreation center" class="if" height="411" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1924753.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Wellness rest </h2><p>  Many older tourists remember Gudauta by its sanatoriums.  They were departmental, and one of them - the military, was not at all accessible to mere mortals.  But, despite the fact that the entourage in the city remained Soviet, everyone can now enter the sanatorium.  Vouchers are distributed by tour operators or directly, via the Internet.  Many reviews of tourists staying in the private sector turned out to be negative solely due to the fault of the host country.  Therefore, the best accommodation in the resort of Gudauta is a holiday home.  At a minimum, you will be provided with a guarded territory and a parking lot.  In the dining rooms of sanatoriums, guests are provided with three meals a day.  True, the staff assigns the treatment of cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases mainly to the subtropical climate and healing mineral waters.  But, in principle, many tourists were satisfied with their stay in the boarding houses ‚ÄúZolotoy Bereg‚Äù and ‚ÄúChernomorets‚Äù, in the sanatorium ‚ÄúSvetly Put‚Äù.  These institutions have their own beaches, more comfortable than municipal urban. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gudauta vacation by the sea" class="if" height="322" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1924743.jpg" width="554"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Holidays in Gudauta are very reminiscent of the Soviet.  There are few cafes in the city, decent restaurants - even less.  Tourists recommend choosing boarding houses or private mini-hotels with full board.  You can also find accommodation where guests are provided with a kitchen with a full set of dishes.  But the central market, reviews warn, does not please visitors with cheapness.  Fruits and vegetables are sold at Sochi prices.  But in the city there are many dining rooms and light snack bars.  The food in them is simple, without frills, but cheap.  Those who came to the resort without excessive requirements liked it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gudauta vacation by the sea" class="if" height="376" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1924740.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach, sea </h2><p>  In this regard, only praise is heard about Gudauta.  True, the city beach is not cleaned at all.  And local cows love to sunbathe on it.  In general, tourists recommend looking for places to swim away from the city center.  The fact is that the concepts of sanitation are very conditional here.  The city is cut by a network of canals along which sewage flows into the sea.  Living next to such a cesspool is not entirely pleasant, and swimming at the drains is simply dangerous.  But far from the center you will be struck by the purity of the water.  The beaches here are always deserted.  From the strength of fifty people in a visible space, no more.  But entertainment on the water, alas, is present only on the city beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gudauta Holiday House" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1924758.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment and excursions </h2><p>  In Gudauta, rest by the sea is very calm.  Families with children will enjoy it here.  Although beaches and pebbles, the sea is very warm, and on the outskirts of the resort is also clean.  You can take a walk in the city park with your baby.  But adults will be interested in Gudauta.  After all, near the city there are such attractions as the medieval temple-fortress of the 10th century Lykhny, the defensive complex of Abakhvats (13th century).  Go to New Athos Mountain by minibus for only fifteen minutes.  An interesting promise is an excursion to the cottage of Stalin.  Since there is little entertainment in Gudauta, vacationers go after them to Sukhumi (37 km) or to Gagra (43 km).  But around the resort there are many natural beauties.  And the most important of them is Lake Ritsa.  The road to this pearl of Abkhazia leads along a mountain serpentine, so you should trust an experienced local driver.  Near Gudauta lies the picturesque Bzyb Range, along which many hiking trails are laid. </p><h2>  Holidays in Gudauta: reviews </h2><p>  Summarize all of the above.  Gudauta captivates with the sincerity and hospitality of the locals.  However, reviews warn of cases of theft, including from cars and rented rooms.  Prices for some foods are really low.  You can eat in canteens and cafes, no one has recorded poisoning.  But do not expect special restaurant delights here.  Prices for imported fruits (watermelons, melons) at the height of the tourist season are the same as in Russian resorts.  But what vacationers in Gudauta certainly liked was semi-empty beaches.  But they are unequipped.  The maximum you can count on from amenities is a canopy and a dressing room.  As in Soviet times, the level of service in the private sector leaves much to be desired.  But if you go to Abkhazia for the sake of the sea and beautiful nature, then you will enjoy your stay in Gudauta.  Moreover, housing can be rented from 500 rubles per day. </p>
