    <h2>  Different cards - one principle </h2><p>  The thing is that the first thing customers pay attention to is that this financial institution produces several types of banking plastic.  The manufacturing and reissue procedure in one case or another will be similar.  But the conditions of use differ.  Therefore, it is important to know which <span>bank cards</span> Sberbank offers. </p><p>  At the moment, the following types of plastic are distinguished: </p><ul><li>  debit </li><li>  credit; </li><li>  salary; </li><li>  gift. </li></ul><p>  Most often, the population works with debit cards and credit cards.  <span>The salary card is</span> usually replaced by the employer.  Therefore, a citizen should not think about this process. </p><h2>  Validity </h2><p>  Each bank plastic has its own ‚Äúlife expectancy‚Äù.  The validity period of a Sberbank card varies from 1 year to 5 years.  As a rule, most often there are cards that are valid for 36 months.  After the specified period, the plastic must be changed.  How to do this will be described later. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The life of a bank card is indicated on the front of the plastic.  There should be a year and a month of expiration.  This information helps citizens to orient themselves on issues related to the replacement, renewal and reissue of cards. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="apply for a Sberbank card" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1473065.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Scheduled replacement </h2><p>  In total, there are several options for translating ideas into reality.  More precisely, the reasons why it is necessary to come to the Sberbank with an appropriate statement.  Card replacement is done according to plan.  This is the first reason. </p><p>  Planned reissue is a procedure that is usually performed even without the participation of the owner.  A citizen is made new plastic, which can be picked up at the same branch of Sberbank where the primary card was issued. </p><p>  If a planned replacement is not needed, it is necessary to notify the financial institution not later than 45 days before the plastic expires.  Then, if necessary, you can independently replace the card. </p><h2>  Unplanned replacements </h2><p>  The next scenario is a situation in which the action of the Sberbank card did not end.  There is such a thing as an unplanned reissue.  This is quite normal.  In fact, this is an independent statement by a citizen about the manufacture of a new bank card tied to an old account. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to renew a sberbank card" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1473066.jpg"></div>

A card is replaced if: </p><ol><li>  A citizen independently at any time decided to reissue a bank card.  There is no need to explain the reasons. </li><li>  With the loss of bank plastic.  Then you need to implement the idea as soon as possible. </li><li>  If the bank card was stolen.  First you have to block the plastic.  In the same way as in the case of loss. </li><li>  There was a change in personal information (F. I. O. citizen).  For example, upon marriage or divorce. </li><li>  The card was "eaten" by an ATM.  It is a common case.  Especially if the citizen forgot the PIN code from bank plastic. </li><li>  Card lock.  There is both voluntary blocking and forced blocking. </li></ol><p>  It is under such circumstances that you need to think about how to change a card at Sberbank.  In reality, there is nothing difficult in this. </p><h2>  Initial production </h2><p>  But before you prepare bank plastic, you need to think about how it is made out initially.  The thing is that, depending on the type of card, this or that list of documents will be provided.  In the case of debit plastic, the following papers may be required: </p><ul><li>  SNILS (optional); </li><li>  identification. </li></ul><p>  They are required to come to any branch of Sberbank and write a statement of the established form for the issue of a debit card.  After 10-14 days, you can pick up the plastic.  Now it‚Äôs clear how you can first draw up a Sberbank card.  Customers also have the right to implement their ideas with the service "Card delivery to your home."  This is an order of plastic on the Internet using the official website of a financial organization. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="validity period of a sberbank card" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1473067.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Primary registration of a credit card </h2><p>  But if it comes to <span>how to apply for a Sberbank card,</span> which is a credit card, then the process of contacting a financial institution changes slightly.  The thing is that initially you can implement the idea by: </p><ul><li>  Sberbank Online service; </li><li>  Sberbank official website; </li><li>  personal visit to the nearest office of a financial company. </li></ul><p>  But it is necessary to provide a certain list of securities, different from what was needed when making a debit card.  To apply for a credit card, Sberbank asks: </p><ul><li>  identification; </li><li>  statement of established form; </li><li>  certificates confirming income; </li><li>  employment record of a citizen; </li><li>  papers indicating marital status. </li></ul><p>  And if you need to contact Sberbank for a reissue?  Replacing a credit card requires the same papers as in the case of primary plastic manufacturing.  And this must be taken into account. </p><h2>  Auto Reissue </h2><p>  If a citizen has not informed about his unwillingness to cancel the automatic issue of bank plastic, then there is no need to worry at all about how to renew the Sberbank card.  It has already been said that it is made automatically.  All that remains for the citizen is to come and collect his plastic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to change a card in a savings bank" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1473068.jpg"></div>

    <p>  It is important to pay attention to the fact that such a solution is not convenient for everyone.  After all, you need to pick up a bank card directly in the department where the plastic was originally issued.  If you want to get it elsewhere, 45 days before the expiration date, the citizen must inform about it in writing. </p><h2>  Card lock </h2><p>  Before engaging in re-issuing a bank card, you must block previously existing plastic.  Without this operation, it will not work to realize the idea.  What needs to be done for this?  Contact Sberbank!  Replacing the card and blocking the old plastic can occur simultaneously. </p><p>  In any case, you can terminate a previously issued card: </p><ul><li>  by contacting Sberbank in person; </li><li>  through the "Mobile Bank"; </li><li>  using a telephone hotline; </li><li>  personal actions. </li></ul><p>  In the case of personal treatment, everything is simple.  A citizen comes to any branch of Sberbank, then writes a blocking application.  An identity card is enough for this.  If there is - a contract for the manufacture of plastic. </p><p>  By personal actions, you can block the card by means of a 3-times incorrectly entered PIN code.  In this case, an automatic lock occurs.  If a citizen worked with an ATM, then the plastic will be ‚Äúeaten‚Äù. </p><p>  To think about how to change the Sberbank card in another city or branch before the plastic expires, you can call 8 800 555 55 50. Next, the operator is informed of their intentions.  The owner names his passport details and secret word.  After the operator makes sure that he is talking with the real owner, he will lock the plastic. </p><p>  An SMS request through the Mobile Bank is the most common scenario.  It is necessary to send to the number 900 SMS format "LOCK 4 last digits of the card, after a space - the reason for blocking."  The reasons may be as follows: </p><ul><li>  0 - loss of card; </li><li>  1 - theft; </li><li>  2 - ‚Äújammed‚Äù by an ATM; </li><li>  3 - other reasons. </li></ul><h2>  Reissue Methods </h2><p>  Suppose that plastic from Sberbank is already blocked.  Replacing a card or reissuing it during an unscheduled operation can be done in the following ways: </p><ul><li>  personal appeal to the branch in which the plastic was made primarily; </li><li>  a visit to any branch of Sberbank; </li><li>  through the website using the "Home Card Delivery" service. </li></ul><p>  A citizen himself has the right to choose one or another method of action.  It is recommended to personally contact any branch of Sberbank.  One in which it will be convenient to further reissue banking plastic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank card action" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1473920.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Personal visit </h2><p>  What is the procedure for contacting Sberbank?  Replacement of the card is, as already mentioned, on the basis of a statement from a citizen.  To submit it, it is enough to determine the type of debit card in the service plan.  Next, come to the bank with an identity card and write an application for reissue or renewal of the blocked plastic.  There is nothing difficult or special about this. </p><p>  It is worth paying attention to the fact that employees will ask if a citizen ever had a Sberbank bank card.  If the answer is yes, then the person will be asked if he wants to tie the plastic to an existing account. </p><h2>  On the internet </h2><p>  And how to re-issue, if it comes to the use of Internet technology?  On the official website of Sberbank, you need to select the "Card reissue" function.  Sometimes it is called "Home Delivery Cards".  Next, an application of the established form is formed and sent.  It indicates: </p><ul><li>  F. I. O. of the future owner; </li><li>  passport details of the applicant; </li><li>  information about the registration of a person; </li><li>  reason for reissue; </li><li>  the department where you want to pick up the plastic. </li></ul><p>  Accordingly, new cards of Sberbank will be where the citizen indicates.  It will be enough to come to the department at the appointed time with an identity card, and then pick up a bank card. </p><p>  In the case of a <span>credit card,</span> everything happens in a similar way.  Only a citizen should bring with him the documents that are necessary for the initial receipt of a "credit card". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to change a sberbank card in another city" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1473062.jpg"></div>

    <p>  It turns out that the validity period of the Sberbank card is not so important.  After all, every citizen at any time is able to block the plastic and re-release it.  There is nothing difficult in the process. </p><p>  At the moment, ordering bank plastic debit type via the Internet is not possible.  Therefore, you have to act only in person.  But credit cards can be issued through the official website and Sberbank Online.  Now it‚Äôs clear how to renew the Sberbank card or block it. </p>
