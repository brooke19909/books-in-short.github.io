    <p>  Egypt, Sharm el-Sheikh in particular, has recently become very popular with Russian tourists.  Sufficiently high service of hotels, only four hours of flight, a dry and warm climate all year round, an abundance of entertainment ... This is where Naama Bay - “Arab Las Vegas” is located, which made Sharm el-Sheikh so popular.  Prices here, I must say, are also very affordable, despite the fact that thousands of tourists come here every year.  For example, for eight days in a three-star hotel with a flight from Moscow, you can pay twenty eight thousand rubles.  In some cases, last minute packages are much cheaper.  In short, life is in full swing here all year. </p><h2>  Sharm El Sheikh </h2><p>  A map of this resort town, which presents not only hotels and entertainment venues, but also attractions, is a necessary attribute for easy orientation in it.

But for the most part, travelers give this five-star hotel complex a high rating, which fully corresponds to the category of the hotel.  Of course, those who previously stayed in European hotels believe that 5 stars is a bit much for him, but based on the low requirements for Egyptian service, even discerning tourists agree to a rating of five with a minus.  For many, the prices for vacations in this Egyptian resort seem low, which is the biggest plus. </p><p>  The overwhelming majority likes the hotel’s convenient location - close to the beach and many sightseeing places of Sharm El Sheikh.  Positive reviews are left mainly by young couples and newcomers who are coming to Egypt for the first time. </p><p>  In matters of service and cleaning in the rooms, opinions of vacationers differ.  Most of them note the helpfulness of the staff, although some speak poorly about the workers, noting their impudence and extorting tips.  Nevertheless, many vacationers, on the contrary, note the friendliness and openness of the administration, which always goes towards the guests and offers their help in every possible way. </p>

    <p>  Such a dispersion of opinions is probably associated with different shifts of employees, some of which are conscientious in the performance of their duties, while others are not.  A lot of good impressions of the picturesque pier, and the proximity to the magnificent lagoons overlaps the negative impression of an inconvenient entry into the water. </p><p>  According to most, the main advantage of the hotel is the kitchen and menu.  The guests were pleasantly surprised by the variety of dishes and portion sizes.  Every evening there were seasonal fruits, fresh watermelon or melon.  During the rest, the local cuisine does not have time to get bored. </p><p>  In addition, the indisputable advantage of the hotel is the thoughtfulness of food.  Own pastry shop, cook shows, etc. contributed to creating a pleasant experience. </p><p> There are no particular complaints about the <span>work of animators.</span>  And although some complain about noise or loud music, but these are only those tourists whose rooms overlooked the pool. </p><p>  But there is one drawback, which is noted by almost everyone who was relaxing in this hotel - the need for cosmetic repairs and a large number of adjacent rooms. </p><p>  As for the incredibly beautiful Red Sea, in the opinion of the vast majority of tourists, for its sake and the amazing coral reefs, you can forgive all the minor (and not even very) flaws. </p>
