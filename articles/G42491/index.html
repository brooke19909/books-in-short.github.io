Over the centuries since its foundation, this state has constantly expanded and strengthened, despite the invasion of enemies.  Many prominent and noble people participated in its management.  One of the rulers who influenced the history of the Russian state was Prince Yuri Vsevolodovich.  What kind of person was he?  What is his biography?  What has he achieved over the years of his reign?  You can find answers to all these questions in this article. </p><h2>  Early years of the prince </h2><p>  Yuri was born in Suzdal on November 26, 1188 in the family of <span>Prince Vsevolod</span> Yuryevich, nicknamed the Big Nest and his first wife, Maria Vsevolzha.  He was the second son of Vsevolod.  Rostov priest Luke baptized him in the city of Suzdal.  At the end of July 1192, Yuri was mounted on a horse after the so-called ceremony of shearing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="notofthisworldiconsandbooks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Prince Yuri Vsevolodovich" class="if uuid-2573699" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/79436/2573699.jpg"></div><p>  At the age of 19, the prince had already begun to participate in campaigns with his brothers against other princes.  For example, in 1207, on a campaign in Ryazan, in 1208-1209.  - to Torzhok, and in 1209 - against Ryazan residents.  In 1211, Yuri marries the daughter of Vsevolod, Prince of Chernigov, Princess Agathia Vsevolodovna.  They were married in the Assumption Cathedral of the city of Vladimir. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Family of Prince Yuri Vsevolodovich </h2><p>  Agafia gave birth to a wife of five children.  The first-born was Vsevolod, born in 1212 or 1213, the future prince of Novgorod.  The second son was Mstislav, who was born after 1213.  Then Agafia in 1215 gave birth to a daughter, who was given the name Dobrava.  She subsequently married the Volyn prince.  After 1218, their third and last son, Vladimir, was born.  And in 1229, another daughter of Theodore was born.  But due to the invasion of the Mongol-Tatars, all children, except Dobrava, died in 1238.  Thus, Yuri Vsevolodovich, Grand <span>Duke of Vladimir,</span> was left without an heir. </p><h2>  Relationship with brother </h2><p>  Since 1211, Yuri‚Äôs relationship with his older brother Konstantin has become tense.  The cause of the conflict and civil strife between the two siblings is the decision of their father Vsevolod to give the city of Vladimir to his second son.  After the death of the prince, Constantine tries to return him to himself.  Then the enmity between the brothers begins.  Having become the Grand Duke, Yuri Vsevolodovich with his army several times fought with Konstantin and his squad. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yuri Vsevolodovich, Prince of Vladimir" class="if uuid-2573784" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/79436/2573784.jpg"></div><p>  But the forces were equal.  Therefore, none of them could win.  After 4 years, the feud ends in favor of Constantine.  Mstislav took his side, and together they managed to capture the city of Vladimir.  Konstantin becomes its owner, but after 2 years (in 1218) he dies.  And again the city returns to the possession of Yuri Vsevolodovich.  In addition to Vladimir, the prince also receives Suzdal. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Politics of Yuri Vsevolodovich </h2><p>  By and large, the policy of Vladimir-Suzdal Prince Yuri Vsevolodovich was a continuation of the policy of his father.  He, too, was not a lover of military battles, but tried to have peaceful relations with his neighbors.  Prince Yuri preferred more diplomatic negotiations and various tricks that helped to avoid conflicts and strained relations.  In this he achieved good results. </p><p>  Nevertheless, Yuri Vsevolodovich still had to organize military campaigns or participate in battles.  For example, in 1220 he sent his army led by Svyatoslav against the Bulgars who were in the Volga region.  The reason for the campaign was the seizure of Russian lands.  The princely army reached the Bulgarian lands and conquered several villages, and then won the battle with the enemy himself.  Prince Yuri receives a proposal for a truce, but only on the third attempt the Bulgars manage to conclude it.  This happened in 1221.  From this time on, Russian princes began to enjoy great influence in the territories adjacent to the Volga and Oka rivers.  Then begins the construction of the city, which is now known as Nizhny Novgorod. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.comintour.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="One of the cities of Russia" class="if uuid-2573686" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/79436/2573686.jpg"></div><p>  Later, Prince Yuri Vsevolodovich is fighting the Estonians near Revel.  The Lithuanians help him in this, who later outsmarted him and began to conquer the lands of Russia, ruining them.  Around the same time, the prince had to participate in the conflict with the inhabitants of Novgorod, which he successfully resolves. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In 1226, Yuri Vsevolodovich fights with the Mordovian princes for the territory located next to the built Nizhny Novgorod.  After several of his campaigns, the Mordovian princes attack the city, thereby starting a long-term conflict, which took place with varying success for the two sides.  But a more serious threat was approaching the Russian lands - the army of the Tatar-Mongols. </p><h2>  The invasion of nomads in Russian lands </h2><p>  Back in 1223, during the Mongol invasion of the northern Black Sea coast, the princes of the South Russian lands turned to Prince Yuri for help.  Then he sent along with the army his nephew Vasilko Konstantinovich, but he only managed to get to Chernigov when he learned about the sad outcome of the battle on the Kalka river. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.diomedia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Defense of the city of Vladimir in 1238" class="if uuid-2573680" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/79436/2573680.jpg"></div><p>  In 1236, the Tatar-Mongols decided to go to Europe.  And they do it through the lands of Russia.  At the end of next year, Batu Khan goes to Ryazan, captures her and moves towards Moscow.  After some time, the khan comes to Kolomna, and then to Moscow, which he burns.  After that, he sends his army to the city of Vladimir.  So quite quickly the Mongol-Tatar hordes captured the Russian lands. </p><h2>  The death of the prince </h2><p>  Having learned such sad news about the successes of the enemy, Yuri Vsevolodovich, Prince of Vladimir, after a meeting with the boyars goes to the Volga to gather his army.  His wife, two sons, a daughter and other people close to Yuri remain in Vladimir.  In early February, the Mongol-Tatars begin a siege of the city, which they captured on February 7.  They rush in and burn Vladimir.  The family and relatives of the Vladimir prince die at the hands of opponents. </p><p>  Less than a month later, namely March 4, Prince Yuri Vsevolodovich enters the battle with enemies.  The battle takes place on the river Sit.  Unfortunately, this battle ends with the defeat of the Russian army, during which Prince Vladimir himself dies.  The headless body of Yuri was found by Rostov Bishop Cyril, who was returning from Beloozero.  He transferred the remains of the prince to the city and buried him.  Through time, the head of Yuri was found. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bishop of Rostov near the body of Prince Yuri" class="if uuid-2573716" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/79436/2573716.jpg"></div><p>  In 1239, the remains of Yuri Vsevolodovich were transferred to Vladimir and buried in the Assumption Cathedral.  Thus ended the life of the <span>Grand Duke of</span> Russia. </p><h2>  Board Results </h2><p>  Historians relate to the rule of Prince Yuri Vsevolodovich differently.  Some admit that he made a great contribution to the expansion of Russian lands.  Others consider his rule to be bad, since he could not protect Russia from the invasion of nomads, thereby allowing them to rule in Russian lands.  But at that time, many principalities could not resist the formidable and powerful enemy.  Do not forget that during the reign of Yuri several large cities, cathedrals and churches were built.  He also led a successful policy until the invasion, which speaks of his talent and diplomatic abilities. </p><h2>  Some facts about Yuri Vsevolodovich </h2><p>  Several interesting facts are connected with the life of Prince Yuri: </p><ul><li>  It is noteworthy that his daughter Dobrava lived the longest out of the whole family of the prince, because she married Volyn prince Vasilko in 1226 and lived for 50 years. </li><li>  The fortified city of <span>Nizhny Novgorod</span> was built in just one year.  Its first settlers were artisans who fled from Novgorod.  Yuri Vsevolodovich patronized them, having involved in the construction. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="into-russia.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fortress of Nizhny Novgorod" class="if uuid-2573742" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/79436/2573742.jpg"></div><ul><li>  The beginning of the reign of Prince Yuri Vsevolodovich is considered to be 1212, although in 1216 it was interrupted and continued in 1218 until death in 1238. </li><li>  Although the prince preferred diplomatic negotiations to military operations, nevertheless he personally participated in 6 campaigns: in 1221 against the Volga Bulgaria, in 1224 against the Novgorod land, in 1226 against the Principality of Chernigov, in 1229 against Mordva, and again against Chernigov in 1231 principalities and finally in 1238 against the Mongol-Tatars. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.picture-russia.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sith battle of 1238 in the picture" class="if uuid-2573796" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/79436/2573796.jpg"></div><ul><li>  According to one chronicler, Yuri Vsevolodovich was a devout person, he always tried to follow God's commandments, respected priests, built churches, did not pass by the poor, was generous and had good qualities. </li><li>  In 1645, Prince Yuri was canonized for his contribution to the development of the Christian faith in Russia, as well as for mercy to his enemies. </li></ul>
