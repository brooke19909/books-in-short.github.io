Initially, it was the winter houses of the Shamshurins and Natyaganovs, then a postal station, and in 1726 a water crossing across the lake was established here.  The first mention of the settlement is found in notes of travelers of the 18th century.  Numerous larches growing on the nearby Larch cape gave the name to the settlement that originated here - Listvyanka.  Lake Baikal from the moment the village emerged becomes navigable, which was also greatly facilitated by the merchants Sibiryakov, Shigaev, Shishelov, Dudorovsky, Potapov and others. </p><h2>  Gate to Baikal </h2><p>  Listvyanka quickly grew, new marinas, warehouses, offices, hotels appeared.  She became the main marina on the great lake.  It is often called the gateway to Lake Baikal. </p><p>  The construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway revealed serious difficulties in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe lake, which led to the decision to build the first ferry railway crossing in Russia.  For transportation of trains in England at the shipyard "Armstrong &amp; Co." were ordered icebreakers ferries "Baikal" and "Angara".  They continued to serve even after the construction of the Circum-Baikal Railway, until 1918.  The ferry was destroyed during the Civil War. </p><p>  Nowadays, trips around Lake Baikal are carried out on comfortable luxury liners equipped with the latest navigation systems, which are highly maneuverable, such as the two-deck ship Alexander Vampilov. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Baikal magic </h2><p>  Going on a trip around the lake is a dream of many.

Everyone knows the history of its creation in the village of Listvyanka.  Baikal is famous for such monuments of nature and history.  The church, according to legend, was erected with the money of the Siberian merchant Xenophon Serebryakov.  At the beginning of the XIX century, he happened to suffer a disaster while sailing across the lake.  He desperately prayed to St. Nicholas, the patron saint of sailors, for salvation, promising that if he could survive the storm, in gratitude he would build a temple on the shore of Lake Baikal.  And a miracle happened!  Serebryakov set up a chapel at the source of the Angara, and after the death of the merchant, his wife built a church in the village of Nikola.  In 1848, the church was moved to Listvyanka.  In 1956, the temple was returned to Krestovaya Pad due to the construction of the Irkutsk Hydroelectric Power Station. </p>

It is here that you can see a natural phenomenon created by the power of the wind.  These are the famous stilted trees standing on their roots at a height of 3 meters above the surface of the earth.

    <p>  During the dives, the amazing underwater world of Lake Baikal opens: canyons, vertical walls, stepped slopes.  In May, when the ice begins to melt, a unique opportunity arises to observe accumulations of seals.  They let people close enough to themselves, which gives a lot of pleasure to lovers of underwater shooting.  Ice diving on Lake Baikal leaves an incredibly vivid impression.  It seems to open the veil over the mystery of a completely different world with its intricate underwater ice formations, caves, grottoes and hummocks up to 8 m thick. </p><h2>  Baikal City </h2><p>  Tourism is the basis of the economy in Listvyanka.  Its further development is planned with the attraction of foreign investment.  A tourist center corresponding to the international level may appear in the village.  According to the authors, the Baikal City project includes a cable car connecting Listvyanka and the Baikal port, fashionable hotels, ski resorts, a water park, restaurants, a congress hall, a casino, entertainment centers, and nightclubs.  Listvyanka has the prospect of becoming a resort of world significance. </p>
