Knowledge of them came from legends, epics about heroes.  So, few people know that our ancestors carried out the reckoning from the creation of the Star Temple.  It was an ancient calendar. </p><h2>  What does Star Temple mean? </h2><p>  The reckoning according to such a scheme lasted until the 18th century.  At the same time, a ban on its use has never been introduced.  The reckoning began in the Star Temple from the moment when the power of the Great Race - Russia - won, and made peace with the empire of the Great Dragon - China.  This continued until the reign of Peter I. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Star temple" class="if uuid-3009039" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/3009039.jpg"></div><p>  Then the Russian tsar reckoned the chronology from the moment of the conclusion of peace in the Star Temple.  In addition, with the adoption of Christianity by Russia, a calendar borrowed from Byzantium began to be used in parallel.  Subsequently, the original Slavic calendar was replaced by Western counterparts. </p><h2>  Slavophil's point of view </h2><p>  The Slavophiles claimed that this was a consequence of the popularization of the Norman theory of the origin of the state in Russia.  They continue to oppose Gumilyov‚Äôs view of Russia, arguing in favor of the independence of the Russian people in the process of its formation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, one creation of the Star Temple, an ancient system, indicates that the Russian state has much deeper roots than is commonly believed.  Even before the arrival of Rurik, there was statehood, a culture with customs. </p><h2>  Historical facts </h2><p>  It is noteworthy that the existence of the Star Temple is proved by modern historians.  Its chronology begins on September 23, 5508 BC.  And in December 1699, Peter I, by his decree, replaced the old reckoning with a new one - the calendar from the Nativity of Christ.  According to the calendar of the Star Temple, it was 7208. </p><h2>  Questions </h2><p>  The most important question remains - what happened on September 23, 5508 BC?  A number of sources claim that the creation of the Star Temple refers to Russia's victory in the war with China, the empire of the Great Dragon.  It is noteworthy that initially the name "China" spread to the south of Tartaria, and only then it passed to "Manchuria".  The territory of the latter refers to the area around the Amur River. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Ancient Slavs" class="if uuid-3009038" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/3009038.jpg"></div><p>  To understand this issue, it is worth paying attention to the fact that the Chinese call the Cupid the "Black Dragon River".  There is a legend that the good Black Dragon once lived here, defeating the White Dragon, which interfered with the population.  The Black Dragon continued to dwell here, in honor of him, and was called a reservoir. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Antiquity of Russian History </h2><p>  The self-name of China - "Zhungguo", as well as "Manchuria" have a similar hieroglyph - "Ja", it is intertwined with "Yahweh", the name of God in Hebrew.  For this reason, there is speculation about where the Star Temple is located. </p><p>  The place of conclusion of a peace treaty between Tartaria and Manchuria could be China-Ja or Kitezh.  But there is one caveat.  Almost in the center of Tartaria is the archaeological fortress of Por-Bazhyn.  According to ancient descriptions, Kitezh was "two hundred fathoms in length, and one hundred fathoms in width."  That is, it was a rectangular area of ‚Äã‚Äã100 to 200 fathoms.  This description corresponds to the fortress of Por-Bazhyn. </p><p>  It is known that Kitezh stood on Lake Svetly Yar, which served as protection for him from enemy attacks, persons with malicious intent.  According to current information, when Khan Batuy conquered Kitezh, he discovered that there were no fortifications in Kitezh.  Residents did not even stand up for their prayers. </p><p>  Khan's troops went on the attack, but suddenly fountains of water surged out from under the earth, which flooded both the population and the attackers.  The attackers stopped the attack, and watched in horror as the whole settlement went under the lake.  Only the cathedral dome with a cross remained on the surface.  And he also went under water, leaving only waves on the surface. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Kitezh grad" class="if uuid-3009040" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/3009040.jpg"></div><p>  Por-Bajin stands on Lake Tere-Khol.  Studies have shown that the fortress was once flooded.  And even in the not so distant past, water manifested itself here unusually.  So, in the 1950s, the height of the lake above sea level was 1333 meters, but ten years later it suddenly fell by 300 meters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Subsequently, such fluctuations were noted more than once.  To trace the connection of this story with the phenomenon under consideration, it makes sense to pay attention to the genetic group R1a, a marker of the Eastern Slavs.  It turned out that in the amount of 53% it was detected in the southern Altai people living 700 km from Por-Bazhyn.  The Altai people here call themselves ‚ÄúAltai-Kizhi‚Äù.  Many remains have been found here dating back 20,000 years with the group R, the ancestor of R1a. </p><p>  Thus, Por-Bazhyn is located around the remains of the Eastern Slavs.  And here is the famous island of Kizhi.  All this is evidence of the antiquity of Russian history.  And the story of the conclusion of peace must have taken place in it. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Thus, the concept of peace in the Star Temple is associated with the cessation of war between the warring peoples.  These were the Slavic Arians who fought with the ancient Chinese.  They made peace in the Star Temple on the day of the Autumnal Equinox. </p><p>  The Slav-Aryans won, which was reflected in the image of the white knight on the horse, which struck the Dragon with a spear - this will become the emblem of Moscow in the future.  But, when years after the creation of the world in the Star Temple in Russia, Christianity was adopted, this symbol began to be interpreted as George the Victorious, who struck the serpent.  According to legend, once the lot fell to give the snake the king‚Äôs daughter, and then George pierced the snake, saving her from death. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="George and the Serpent" class="if uuid-3009035" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/3009035.jpg"></div><p>  After that, the locals converted to Christianity.  Someone interpreted this as a symbol of the church and paganism.  But these interpretations hardly explain how this story relates to Russia. </p><p>  After all, this symbol has long been used in this country.  Slavophiles claim that Christians used this symbol for their own purposes.  Hanuman (Prince of Rasseniya) and Ahriman (ruler of Arimiah - China) laid the foundation for the creation of the Star Temple.  It is important to keep in mind that in ancient times, "China" was translated as a "fence." </p><p>  This tradition has survived to this day, because the Moscow Kitay-Gorod is so called because of the walls surrounding it, it is not connected in any way with Chinese culture.  And according to legend, in a sign of peace in the first year of the Star Temple, a wall was erected between two ancient peoples to mark the borders.  The "fence" was called "China."  It was from this event that the calculus for the Star Temple of Slavic ancestors began. </p><p>  Then Az-Vesta (the first message) was written on 12,000 cowhide.  It was written on parchment, as well as on gold.  It was destroyed by Alexander the Great, a Slav by origin, who fell under the influence of Aristotle.  The Slavophiles claim that later on the world spread a distorted version of the Avesta - Zend-Avesta, and it was Zarathustra who distorted it, adding her own speculation. </p><h2>  The view of historians </h2><p>  Historians disprove these views of the Slavophiles, citing the facts that 6000 years BC neither Russia nor China existed, nor their titular nations.  In those days, there was a Middle Neolithic, while the culture of linear tape ceramics flourished in Europe, the Yangshao Culture flourished in China.  Representatives of the latter were proto-Chinese tribes, and these were not Chinese.  The culture of linear tape ceramics, in turn, was not Slavic or proto-Slavic.  There is no exact view of the "ancestral home" of the early Slavs.  There are only a few versions. </p><p>  Nestor‚Äôs ideas in The Tale of Bygone Years gravitate toward the Danube version.  It states that the Slavs lived in the Roman province of Norik, which was located at the Danube.  Later they crossed to the Vistula and the Dnieper.  It was a slow process. </p><p>  For about 500 years, the ancient Slavs remained in the Carpathian region, and only in the 7th century settled the Russian plain.  But most scientists are of the opinion that the original homeland of the Slavs is Pripyat, Vistula.  There is also a point of view uniting both of these versions. </p><p>  The very first Chinese state was Shan.  It existed from 1600 to 1027 BC in the north of the Great Plain of China.  The territory of this entity was limited.  For this reason, official history denies the possibility that 6000 years ago contacts were possible not only between Russia and China, but also directly to the Slavs and Chinese. </p><p>  In addition, history has not preserved any evidence of the ancient war of China and Russia - not a single written, archaeological evidence remains.  There is really no mention of this event in the folklore of both countries. </p><h2>  Rebuttal </h2><p>  From the point of view of neopagans, the symbol of St. George the Victorious is a symbol of the victory of the ancient Slavs over the ancient Chinese.  But official data say that his image on a horse belongs to the late period. </p><p>  Until a certain moment, he was portrayed only in armor, armed.  And such an image is present in St. George's Cathedral and many other structures of the 13th century.  The most ancient Russian image of St. George - on the icon in the Moscow Kremlin - dates from the end of the 11th century.  And there he is depicted without a horse and a serpent.  One of the ancient drawings of the 12th century shows it together with Fedor Stratilat, who also affects the serpent on horseback.  Such they appeared on a stone slab in Kiev, which dates back to the 12th century. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Early George" class="if uuid-3009033" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/3009033.jpg"></div><p>  George was killed in the 4th century AD.  His cult begins about a century later.  Until that moment, there was not a single image of this saint.  His cult on Russian lands appeared only after Russia converted to Christianity in the 11th century AD.  And then it was not too widespread.  He became the patron saint of princes much later. </p><p>  For this reason, before the beginning of the second millennium AD there were no images of the war on a white horse in Russia.  They previously appeared in the West, where they appeared on reliefs, miniatures, murals, paintings.  For example, in Rome, George appears from the 6th century in places of worship dedicated to himself.  And, of course, Catholics did not worship the symbol of confrontation between the Chinese and the Slavs. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that Christianity came to Georgia earlier than to Russia.  And in the 4th century, George was already considered her patron. </p><h2>  In China </h2><p>  In addition, if you believe the version of the devastating war between China and Russia, after which a new reckoning began, then traces should have remained in China.  However, the Chinese did not have such a new reckoning. </p><h2>  About Russian Chronology </h2><p>  In addition, officially in Russia the chronology was carried out ‚Äúfrom the creation of the world‚Äù, and in 7000, according to the surviving information, a panic began in the country.  And if the reckoning began from the moment of the peace treaty, there would be no logic in this.  After all, hardly anyone will decide that one hundred or one thousand years after May 9, 1945, the end of the world will happen. </p><p>  According to available data, in 6967, the birth of the Antichrist was expected from the creation of the world in Russia.  So, at the onset of 7000 (1492), Metropolitan Zosima sincerely believed that the world was about to die.  Joseph Volotsky considered the issue of the term of the end of the world in the Book of Not Heretics. </p><p>  There he refutes any possibility of such an outcome, considering the year and the end of the world to be unconnected phenomena.  It is noteworthy that after Peter I introduced the new calendar, counting the years ‚Äúfrom the creation of the world‚Äù was still common among the Old Believers.  However, the word "peace" in Slavic traditions dates back to the 11th century, and its original Indian root means "sweet".  Later, ‚Äúpeace‚Äù was understood as ‚Äúspace‚Äù, and not as ‚Äúconclusion of a peace treaty‚Äù. </p><h2>  About the thesis </h2><p>  Among the Slavophiles, the myth is widespread that Peter I, having introduced a new system of chronology, actually "stole 5000 years of history from Russia."  But the surviving documentation of those years completely refutes this thesis.  Peter I never imposed a ban on the use of the old calendar ‚Äúfrom the creation of the world‚Äù, he did not ‚Äúcross out history‚Äù. </p><p>  And in reality, those 5,000 years of the history of Rus that the emperor ‚Äúdestroyed‚Äù did not exist.  The decision to introduce the chronology adopted in Western culture is quite logical.  After the decree was issued, the countdown began from the birth of Christ.  This replaced the Byzantine tradition. </p><p>  After all, this ancient state was defeated in 1453, and its chronology was not widely used practically anywhere except in Greece.  And Peter I sought to bring European influences into the country.  He changed fashion, education, management. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Peter 1" class="if uuid-3009037" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/3009037.jpg"></div><p>  The Julian calendar, which Peter I took, was once compiled by Alexandrian astronomers led by Sozigen.  It was introduced by Julius Caesar on January 1, 45 BC.  e.  He modified the obsolete calendar in Rome, taking as a basis the knowledge of Hellenistic Egypt.  And it was he who was accepted by representatives of the Orthodox faith.  This explained the choice of Peter I precisely, and not the Gregorian calendar. </p><p>  The latter was used in Catholic traditions.  In addition, the Julian calendar was also used by Protestant countries, which feared the influence of the Vatican.  The Vatican tried to persuade the Gregorian chronology of the followers of the Orthodox faith. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Nativity" class="if uuid-3009034" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/3009034.jpg"></div><p>  Thus, the choice of the calendar by Peter I was also determined by the cultural characteristics of Russia, following the traditions of Orthodoxy.  The Slavophiles point of view is also widespread that initially in the Russian language there was no word ‚Äúyear‚Äù, there was only the word ‚Äúsummer‚Äù.  And the ‚Äúyear‚Äù was introduced by Peter I, communicating with foreigners, taking the word God from them!  However, the dictionaries and the ‚ÄúTale of Bygone Years‚Äù itself, written in the 12th century, contain many references to the word ‚Äúyear‚Äù.  This ancient word is also contained in many other original Russian documents that existed long before the coming to power of Peter I. </p><p>  While, according to research, the word "summer" meant "time of sunlight and heat."  It is also an ancient form that has maintained the same meaning for many centuries.  In addition, in Holland, where Peter I spent some time, the word God was never associated with the ‚Äúyear‚Äù in the Russian sense.  They have the same meaning in the word jaar.  So the statement of a number of Slavophiles that the emperor also introduced the word "year", replacing the original Russian word "Years", is erroneous. </p>
