    <h2>  About the map "Corn" </h2><p>  Today, one of the most profitable and convenient payment tools is the Euroset card.  "Corn" is produced by this company.  There are currently three types of such cards.  The most popular and common type is MasterCard PayPass.  This Euroset card has a built-in security chip.  In addition, it is registered and it can be used with all types of readers.  Another advantage of the MasterCard PayPass card is the receipt of interest on the balance of funds in the account.  Of course, the amount of accumulated interest is not very significant, but nevertheless, this option is a pleasant bonus. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

Cards with a percentage on the balance are becoming more popular every day.  To activate this feature, you must visit the Euroset salon and apply for the activation of the function.  In fact, the option on the "Corn" card interest on the balance is a deposit for a period of 91 days.  It is similar to a bank deposit.  The balance of the card is credited if there is no less than 159 rubles in the account.  Interest <strong> </strong>  about 5-8 per annum. </p><p>  It should be emphasized that 8% is accrued provided that the amount on the card exceeds 3 thousand rubles.  If there is less cash, the interest rate is reduced to 5. By the way, it will be said that until November 10, 2015, there was a 10% discount on the card balance on the card.  But today the conditions have changed. </p><h2>  What is the interest on the balance on the Corn card? </h2>

    <p>  In essence, the client makes an investment in Pervobank.  This financial institution collaborates with the Euroset company, which draws up Corn cards under its brand.  This bank is known for its good reputation and deposit rating.  It will be useful to say that Pervobank has combined its assets with Promsvyazbank, which rightfully occupies one of the leading positions in the Russian Federation.  Such facts indicate that the owners of "Corn" can be sure of the stability and reliability of their contribution. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It should be noted that interest on the balance is credited to the Corn card, along with bonus points when making purchases from Euroset partners.  The bonus program provides for the return of 1.5% of the cost of production due to the purchase of goods for accumulated bonuses at a discount.  This offer allows you to collect additional funds and then use them for purchases. </p><h2>  Benefits for Cardholders </h2><p>  Each holder of the Corn card can use the advantages that Euroset provides to the holders of this product.  So, the client is provided with free SMS-informing, insurance at a rate of 8% per annum, the ability to cash up to 3 thousand rubles a month without collecting a commission.  In addition, it should be emphasized that the "Corn" card is valid for 6 years from the date of registration.  Also, each client can buy foreign currency at the exchange rate of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation and make money transfers without commission from one bank to another within the Russian Federation.  All these advantages make it profitable to use the product "Corn" (card).  You can make it online on the official website. </p>

    <p>  Holders of the "Corn" card can transfer up to 150 thousand rubles a month to similar cards.  There is also the opportunity to participate in the “Double Benefit” promotion and receive a significantly larger number of bonuses for subsequent purchases of goods with discounts.  It should be noted that on the card you can connect a credit limit.  At the same time, it must be emphasized that the cardholder will have to choose and leave active either the credit limit or receive interest on the account balance on the Corn card. </p><h2>  Short review of minuses </h2><p>  Despite these advantages, this product has several disadvantages.  A not very convenient feature of the card is the ability to replenish an account without charging a commission only at Euroset stores or at TNK car stations.  In addition, the established limits on the use of funds do not allow the use of the "Corn" card as the main reserve.  When withdrawing more than 3 thousand rubles per day, a commission of 1% is charged. </p><p>  The "Corn" bonus card program is beneficial for those consumers who make a large number of purchases.  Points are awarded when purchasing a particular product at certain points of sale.  But, despite a number of minuses, the "Corn" card compares favorably with similar products of other companies.  It quite effectively acts as a backup <span>credit card.</span>  In addition, when activating the service of calculating interest on the balance of the account, you can earn a little and get passive income.  The amount accumulated in this way will not be too significant.  But interest is accrued with a guarantee of the ability to withdraw them. </p><h2>  bonus program </h2>

    <p>  Each holder of the "Corn" card immediately after its registration becomes a member of the bonus program.  How does it work and what are its features?  Everything is very simple: the more the cardholder makes purchases with its help in the Euroset partner points of sale, the more points accumulate in the bonus account.  Each purchase in such stores returns 1% of the cost of goods to the owner of the Corn card. </p><p>  Among the Euroset partners participating in the bonus program are Ozon, ru, Booking.com, Ostrovok, Ebay, Aliexpress.com, Kari, Nike and other companies. </p><h2>  Credit cash on the card </h2><p>  Holders of the "Corn" card have the opportunity to get a loan according to a simplified procedure.  To do this, you must visit one of the Euroset stores and apply.  If there is a positive decision on granting a loan, then in 10-15 minutes the money will arrive on the card, in addition, the client will receive a text message on the mobile phone with a notification about the crediting of a specific amount. </p><p>  Such loans are provided by two banks: HomeCredit and MFI MILI.  HomeCredit lends to the cardholder "Corn" in the amount of 10 to 100 thousand rubles, for a period of up to 36 months.  Moreover, the interest rate is 29.9% per annum.  Mili provides an opportunity to borrow from 3 to 30 thousand rubles for a period of up to 30 days.  Moreover, interest rates range from 0.2% to 2% per day.  In addition, to get a loan from MILI, you must be a member of one of the social networks. </p><p>  To repay the loan, you can use the Euroset salons, the capabilities of the cardholder’s personal account or the mobile application.  These options are the most convenient and profitable.  In addition, you can pay the loan through ATMs or cash desks of banking institutions.  In this case, a fee will be charged.  However, it is possible to obtain a microloan. </p><h2>  Credit limit on the "Corn" card </h2><p>  Holders can use the advantageous option.  Namely, use the credit limit and turn your card into a full credit version.  In addition, customers get the opportunity to take advantage of the grace period provided by the "Corn" card.  Interest on the loan is not accrued for up to 55 days.  To use the credit limit, you must visit the Euroset salon or fill out the form on the official page of the Corn card.  It usually takes no more than 30 minutes to get a decision. </p>

    <p>  Credit limits are provided by banking institutions such as Renaissance Credit and Tinkoff Credit Systems.  It will be useful to say that connecting the limit is a faster and easier procedure than obtaining a full loan.  Moreover, the maximum amount is 300 thousand rubles.  To connect a credit limit, it is enough for the cardholder to meet the age requirements of banks and have a permanent job.  You can pay off the loan in the salons of the Euroset company, in the personal account of the card holder, using the application for mobile devices, in bank cash desks and ATMs. </p>
