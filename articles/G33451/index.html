And the trouble of collecting a dowry for a newborn is always accompanied by a mass of positive experiences.  Future mothers are trying to choose the best and most beautiful clothes for their child, not stinting on the necessary accessories.  And the underpants in the shopping list occupy the very first positions. </p><p>  But why, in preparation for the appearance of the crumbs, not do needlework and, putting your love in each product, not sew the outfit yourself?  Pregnant women will definitely like this process and bring a lot of pleasure.  Moreover, it‚Äôs easy to sew vests with your own hands! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="baby underwear pattern" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1195142.jpg" width="455"></div>

    <h2>  Materials and Tools </h2><p>  As a rule, for the very first baby clothes, they choose a flannel, chintz, a bike or knitwear such as interlock and cooler.  It is these materials in their composition that have exclusively cotton fiber without synthetic impurities, and very good vests for newborns come out of them.  The pattern for such products is also very easy to build, and to create it you will need a sheet of paper, a ruler and a pencil. </p><p>  For sewing products you will need an overlock or a sewing machine with a zigzag, threads, a knit trim for processing sections, buttons or buttons and, if desired, various lace. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Common Measurement Values </h2><p>  How to make a <span>baby's undershirt</span> template <span>?</span>  <span>The pattern</span> should be a shirt with a smell and one-piece sleeves and be appropriate in size.  To do this, use standard measurements: </p><ul><li>  the width of the half of the shelf is 14 cm; </li><li>  sleeve length - 15 cm; </li><li>  neck depth - 1 cm for the back and 5 cm for the front; </li><li>  the width of the half sleeve at the wrist is 11 cm; </li><li>  the length of the entire vest is 30 cm. </li></ul><p>  Children's measurements may vary depending on the weight and height of the baby.  Therefore, starting from the smallest values, it is necessary to sew a large undershirt, adding to the measurements of 2-3 cm (excluding the deepening of the neck). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY vests" class="if" height="419" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1195143.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Building a template for baby's underwear </h2><p>  The pattern is built on a sheet of paper in half size with the expected cut in the middle of the back and front.  The rear and front panel of the vest is distinguished by the depth of the neck and an additional five centimeters in the middle section on the front shelf for the smell of a shirt.  To build a drawing, take a sheet of paper and do the following: </p><ul><li>  indicate a right angle with rays 30 cm down and to the side; </li><li>  on the horizontal line mark the middle (the border of the sleeve and ¬Ω the width of the shelf); </li><li>  at the very corner indicate the neck for the back and for the shelf; </li><li>  6 cm from the point on the horizontal line, perpendicularly down, and 8 cm from the point of the border of the sleeve and the shelf and connect the marks with a line, determining the seam of the sleeve; </li><li>  from the last point they go down at a right angle and draw a side cut (if desired, it can be slightly expanded to the bottom); </li></ul><p>  At this stage, you can consider the basis for sewing the underpants ready. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Increase the size of the vest </h2><p>  How to sew a different <span>size baby's undershirt?</span>  The pattern in this case does not require changes.  Just when transferring to the fabric, it is necessary to circle the template along the contour, departing from the borders of the workpiece by 2-3 cm. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="baby's undershirts" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1195157.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It may also be necessary to slightly expand the neckline, depending on the baby's physique.  As a rule, the neck is made wide enough so that the tissue does not rub the delicate skin of the baby. </p><h2>  Modeling </h2><p>  If desired, you can slightly change the pattern of the baby's undershirt.  Patterns of such a shirt can be with a fastener on one side or with a smell like a kimono in ties.  Naturally, this option will be more convenient, since it involves almost a double front part of the vest.  While the usual model is constantly swinging open, as it rests only on the tape at the neck, the ‚Äúkimono‚Äù will be more practical, and the baby‚Äôs chest will always be closed. </p><p>  In the version with a lateral fastener, the baby's undershirts are made with a big smell.  The front shelf consists of two parts (in mirror image) with a cut from the shoulder to the bottom and a fastener for a button, tie or button directly on the shoulder of the shirt, both on the inside of the smell and on the outside.  With such a cut, no matter how the baby is spinning, the baby's undershirt will always close its body and will not open. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a vest" class="if" height="454" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1195151.jpg" width="570"></div>

    <h2>  Product Processing </h2><p>  With a cut it‚Äôs clear, but how to sew the undershirt so that it is pleasant to the body and does not cause the baby discomfort?  Such things are usually processed with a seam outward.  That is, the processing of slices is performed on the face of the product.  Thus, all possible spiky elements are excluded, since the sections of the canvas and the markings do not touch the child‚Äôs body. </p><p>  In order for such a product to have a presentable appearance, it is best to use an overlock.  Quite often, professional seamstresses use a sewing machine called a carpet block for sewing such things.  This is an indispensable knitting machine.  However, if there is no such sewing equipment, you can get by with a conventional straight-line machine and process the slices <span>with a linen seam</span> or zigzag. </p><p>  The bottom of the undershirt and sleeves, as well as the section of the shelves, can be treated with an <span>oblique inlay</span> from a thinner fabric or knitted braid. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="baby gown sizes" class="if" height="451" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1195158.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Decorative processing </h2><p>  It is clear that every mommy wants the baby to have beautiful clothes, and therefore many refuse conventional flannel and chintz clothes in favor of brighter and more colorful market clothes.  However, if you sew your gowns with your own hands, you can dream up a little and make the items smart using lace and ribbons. </p><p>  For example, from chintz seam with embossed pattern and embroidery, you will get an excellent collar and cuffs for a little fashionista, and soft knitted lace can easily turn into a frill on the chest of the baby's undershirt.  Also, do not forget about such decorative elements as patches, applications and thermal transfers.  Thanks to the decoration, it is easy to make original vests.  Although the shirts are small, they can become a real work of art in the hands of a loving mother. </p>
