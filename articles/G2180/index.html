Every day, local fishermen bring fresh fish to the restaurants of the complexes. </p><p>  Cambrils has an area of ​​more than 35 square meters.  km  Conventionally, the town is divided into three parts: port (with hotels and entertainment centers), historical (with medieval quarters and old houses) and Villa Fortuni - a territory built specifically for vacationers.  Cambrils combines modern tourism and national traditions.  People of different incomes come to the resort to relax. </p><p>  The city is located on the Mediterranean Sea, so there is a mild climate without sudden temperature changes.

    <p>  Opposite Cambrils there is another resort area - Montbrio del Camp, it is known for healing thermal springs.  Hotels usually offer trips to Barcelona.  Yachts for boat trips also depart from Cambrils. </p><h2>  Best Maritim 3 * (Spain): reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, we turn to the reviews of vacationers who have already managed to visit it in order to understand how they evaluate this budget complex.  According to tourists, the Best Maritim 3 * hotel (Spain) has an excellent location, being on the coast.  Only a bicycle path separates the hotel from the beach.  The complex will certainly appeal to beach lovers.  It is convenient to live here even with the youngest children, since you don’t need to go anywhere far.  Everything that tourists need is located either in the hotel or in the immediate vicinity. </p><p>  What rooms does Best Maritim 3 * (Spain) offer?  Guest reviews regarding the apartments are approximately the same.  Based on them, some conclusions can be drawn.  Some of the rooms in the hotel are freshly renovated, while others would be nice to refresh.  All are clean and well maintained, but furnished with slightly outdated furniture.  The beds are equipped with good orthopedic mattresses.  For children, the hotel gives out clamshells, which many do not like.  Of course, they are good, but still this is not a bed. </p><p>  All appliances in the apartments are new, plumbing is in good condition.  The hotel is built in the shape of the letter "P".  Naturally, there are rooms in noisy places and in quieter ones.  Guests do not recommend lodging in apartments, near which there are extracts from the restaurant, because the buzz from them interferes with them all day and ends no earlier than 23.00.  Good views from the rooms overlooking the pool. </p><p>  Three-room apartments are very spacious and comfortable, but the bedrooms have no windows.  More precisely, they exist, but they go to completely unexpected places (on the next balcony or in the public corridor). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="best maritim 3 superior spain costa dorada" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1519622.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Maids are cleaned daily.  There are disputes regarding its quality, but in general there are no serious complaints.  Towels are also changed daily.  The bedding is also beautiful, without flaws. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  The food at Best Maritim 3 * deserves special praise.  Reviews of tourists say that the food in the hotel corresponds to four stars.  The main restaurant serves a varied buffet.  For breakfast, food is usually simpler.  But at the same time, all kinds of drinks are served free of charge, including champagne.  For dinner and lunch, a noticeable variety appears on the tables.  Especially delicious are seafood and meat cooked with you on the grill.  Very often themed nights are organized in the restaurant: Mexican, Catalan, etc. At lunch and in the evening, drinks are not included in the price of the meal, they must be paid separately.  In general, the food is very tasty and good.  When leaving for excursions, you can order a lunch package, but its quality is much different from the food in the restaurant. </p><p>  The hotel is always crowded with people, not even in high season.  The restaurant sometimes does not cope with the influx of people, so in the evenings there are lines.  The waiters are fast and always happy with the visitors. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  As we mentioned, the hotel is located on the coast.  To get to the beach, you just need to cross the bike path.  The sandy coast of the resort is beautiful and wide, with a gentle entry into the sea.  The water is very clean and warm, sometimes algae nails to the shore, but there are very few of them.  Sun beds and umbrellas on the coast are paid, since the beach is municipal.  However, all vacationers are located in the hotel's free recreation area by the pool, taking up towels in the early morning.  And go swimming in the sea.  In such a simple way, you can avoid unnecessary expenses. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="best maritim 3 spain cambrils costa dorada" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1519624.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the daytime and evening, the hotel has an unobtrusive animation.  Everyone can visit water aerobics, play darts and board games.  Children really like the evening mini-disco. </p><p>  There is a stop right in front of the hotel.  From here you can leave by bus to the nearest cities or to Barcelona.  At the same time, it is completely optional to purchase a tour from local guides.  Also nearby is Salou Station, which can be reached on foot.  Good transport interchange makes it possible for those tourists who want to see the nearest resorts to travel actively, and not just spend time on the coast. </p><p>  Near the hotel there are several shops where you can buy wine, groceries and everything you need for tourists.  There are also cafes and restaurants here for those who want to try the food of not only the chef of the main restaurant.  According to vacationers, the town is very quiet and calm, life in it freezes after 22.00. </p><p>  There are several excursion bureaus near the hotel where you can book a trip.  There are local guides at the hotel.  The cost of excursions is very different, it is difficult to say where it is more profitable to purchase them.  In general, you can independently see Salou, Barcelona and other cities using public transport services.  So, for example, a trip to Barcelona will cost only 9 euros, which is much cheaper than group tours. </p><p>  The hotel staff deserves special attention, thanks to which the institution has a decent level of service.  Literally a few people speak Russian at the hotel, and even that is bad.  Most of them understand English well.  Therefore, one can always explain.  The language barrier is not observed.  The staff is attentive and responsive, trying to help at the slightest hint.  There is no need to ask for something several times.  It is thanks to the employees that such a positive opinion is formed about the hotel. </p><p>  The hotel complex can safely be considered a good option for a budget holiday.  Perhaps this is due to the occupancy of the hotel.  There are always many tourists here, even in October and September.  Among the guests of the complex there are many Europeans (Germans, French), Russians can be met not so often. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Good reviews at the Best Maritim 3 * hotel (Spain) give reason to recommend it as a great economy class complex for those tourists who cannot afford a more expensive tour or do not want to overpay extra money.  I would like to note that the hotel has its pros and cons (we talked about them in the article).  What is worth paying more attention to, tourists decide.  However, the great popularity and high attendance of the complex speak for themselves.  Moreover, the complex is located on the coast, which is very important for a beach-sea vacation. </p>
