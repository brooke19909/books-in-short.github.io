This historical center of Moscow is relatively small in area - eighteen square meters.  km or about two percent, if not less, of the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe capital. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The garden ring arose at the end of the sixteenth century and at first was an earthen rampart, fortified with an oak wall.  When the dangers of raids from the south and west disappeared, then gradually they began to tear it down.  The remains burned in the fire of 1812.  When all the rubble was dismantled, ring roads lined with front gardens were made on the freed up square.  In the 30s of the last century, gardens were cut down, and in the 40s and 50s the entire Garden Ring was already an asphalt highway, on which stood three famous Stalin's skyscrapers. </p><h2>  Moscow - city center </h2><p>  Moscow is a huge city, and everyone living in it will find what it considers the center.  But the most natural way to look for it is about zero kilometer.  It always started from the Central Telegraph.  And now, for roads, this sign is installed in front of the Resurrection Gate, which connects Red Square with Manezhnaya. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="center of Moscow" class="if" height="376" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1209913.jpg" width="600"></div>  The second zero sign also stands on Red Square.  If you draw a line that connects the Mausoleum and GUM, then this zero mark will be in the center.

On it stands the newly reconstructed GUM, the Historical Museum and the restored Resurrection Gate.  After passing through them, we find ourselves in the Alexander Garden and the hotels Moscow and Four Seasons (three stars).  Bypassing them, you can look into the underground shopping complex Okhotny Ryad.  And here, just a stone's throw, or rather three minutes, is the five-star National Hotel.  He stands at the intersection of Mokhovaya and Tverskaya streets near <span>the Okhotny Ryad metro station.</span>  <span>Nearby</span> are the hotels Aquarelle and Budapest. </p><h2>  Up Tverskaya </h2><p>  Right next to it is the equally sophisticated but brand new Ritz-Carlton Hotel.  Moving up, we will meet the Inter-Continental, and even higher - the Sheraton Palace. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow center streets" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1209923.jpg" width="600"></div>  These are modern five-star hotels.  Hotels in the center of Moscow are densely located.

    <p>  On one of the oldest streets - Tverskaya - from the 12th century, a highway passed that led to a neighboring principality.  It became the main one in the seventeenth century.  And under Peter the Great, she became the road leading to the new capital.  It has always stood the most beautiful houses and shops.  Eliseevsky deli was built one hundred and fourteen years ago.  He immediately attracted attention with luxurious Empire-style interiors, fine wines and exotic freshest products that were sold there. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotels in the center of Moscow" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1209926.jpg" width="600"></div>  An interesting fact: slightly spoiled products were eaten by the store employees every evening.  It was strictly forbidden to take them out or throw them away.  Both guests and residents of the capital love to visit it.  It is impossible not to mention the nearby Filippovskaya bakery, which was the first to bake rolls with raisins.  It has a coffee room.  The hotel, which is called "Suite", is attached to the building.

    <h2>  Subway </h2><p>  In the 30s, the first metro line opened.  And immediately in Utesov‚Äôs repertoire appeared the song ‚ÄúThe Old Cabman‚Äù.  There are about two hundred stations in the modern metro. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Metro stations" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1209935.jpg" width="600"></div>  In order not to get confused in them, each carriage has their scheme.  Stations are designed according to the radial-ring principle.  The actual ring line is one.  All other radial, often having branches.  The three oldest lines - Sokolnicheskaya, Zamoskvoretskaya and Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya - were opened in the prewar years.  During the war, Muscovites used them as bomb shelters.  The center of <span>Moscow metro</span> covers completely.  It‚Äôs easy to get to any object of interest by metro and most importantly - quickly.
