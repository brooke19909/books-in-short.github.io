It is used all over the world.  This method of transferring money has proven itself and is in demand everywhere. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.justbudget.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sending money" class="if uuid-2519883" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92093/2519883.jpg"></div><h2>  Why are money transfers convenient with cards? </h2><p>  Transferring funds through online transactions is considered the most convenient method of <span>transferring money.</span> </p><ul><li>  It does not take much time. </li><li>  No need to meet in person. </li><li>  The location of the person does not matter. </li><li>  Convenient storage of funds. </li><li>  It does not require a mandatory visit to the bank. </li><li>  It makes it possible to quickly make foreign transfers. </li><li>  It has the function of storing data for repeated operations. </li></ul><p>  To transfer money, you need a personal plastic card, access to the Internet or an ATM. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lifehacker.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Exchange of funds" class="if uuid-2519872" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92093/2519872.jpg"></div><p>  To obtain a card, you must submit an application on the official website of the bank or come to the office.  Soon the bank will inform that the card is ready.  Having your own debit card, you can easily and quickly make financial transfers.  Each client receives his personal data, pin code, etc. for the opportunity to use the services of the bank. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Types of money transfers to a card </h2><p>  You can transfer money from card to card in several simple ways: </p><ul><li>  Using an ATM of a serving bank.  The ATM will allow you to transfer both cash and non-cash.  If the client has difficulties with the transfer, the operator will tell you in each bank branch how to use the ATM correctly.  If the client is well versed in transfer operations, he can find a separate ATM in the city and quickly make a money transfer.  To begin with, the program will ask for an individual password for entry and only then will it give the opportunity to do all the necessary actions. </li><li>  Using the online application of the servicing bank.  For online operations, it will be more convenient to use the mobile application.  To do this, download the application of the servicing bank and go through a quick registration.  This is convenient because the owner’s card data is attached to the application itself, which speeds up the transfer process.  In addition, the owner has his personal password, which protects him from the actions of unauthorized persons. </li><li>  Online via the Internet without an application.  Without using the application, you can transfer money in another easy way.  On the Internet you can find a special independent resource for translations according to the standard scheme. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="smashfreakz.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Online application" class="if uuid-2519880" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92093/2519880.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Using payment systems on the Internet.  There are a large number of payment systems on the Internet, such as Yandex Money, WebMoney, QIWI wallet, PayPal, etc. Thanks to them, you can also transfer money.  First you need to create a wallet itself and send your passport data for moderation.  If the check was successful, you can make money transfers.  The nuance of this method may be a high percentage of the commission for transfers, but in most cases it depends on the amount of the transfer. </li><li>  Through an operator in a bank branch.  <span>How to transfer money from card to card</span> will tell the operator in any branch of the bank.  A bank employee will independently conduct the operation through a computer.  The client will only need a confirmation code, which will be sent to his phone in an SMS message. </li></ul><h2>  How to transfer money (Sberbank) </h2><p>  Sberbank is a huge international corporation.  He has long earned the trust of customers and offers many financial services. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.systemair.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank of Russia" class="if uuid-2519881" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92093/2519881.jpg"></div><p>  <span>Transferring money from a card to a Sberbank card is</span> not difficult.  On the official website, as well as in the mobile bank application, many services are provided, including transfers.  For this, a personal account is created that will allow you to perform various operations at any convenient time. </p><p>  In the "Payments" section, there are several subsections: </p><ul><li>  Make an operation between your accounts. </li><li>  Transfer finances to another bank. </li><li>  Transfer to a card or account to a client of Sberbank. </li><li>  Pay for mobile communications, taxes, internet, etc. </li></ul><p>  To make a transfer through the application, if both cardholders are Sberbank customers, you need to select the “Sberbank Client” section in the menu, and then decide on the transfer method.  There are several options: </p><ul><li>  Make a transfer indicating the card number of the recipient. </li><li>  Transfer money using a phone number. </li><li>  Transfer account finance. </li></ul><p>  A common option is the transfer section by card number.  It is proposed to enter the card number and the transfer amount.  After which the sender will receive an SMS with a code.  Only after entering the password will the transfer be successfully completed. </p><h2>  Financial transfers by phone number </h2><p>  A convenient option will tell you how to transfer money to Sberbank by phone number.  To transfer funds you should know the cellular number of the addressee.  In this case, his card should be tied to the phone. </p><p>  You should use your personal account.  In the “Payments” section, you need to select “Transfer to Sberbank customer”.  Next, enter the recipient's phone number and transfer amount.  Then you need to verify the data and confirm the operation. </p><h2>  How to transfer money from a Sberbank card if the recipient is a client of another bank </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.kptv.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Maps online" class="if uuid-2519845" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92093/2519845.jpg"></div><p>  Transaction time when transferring funds from a card to another bank can take about 10 minutes.  In any case, faster than in the department, where the transfer may take several days.  I must say that the maximum transfer limit is limited to 30,000 rubles per attempt.  For a Visa Electron or Maestro card - 50,000 thousand rubles.  and transactions are not canceled in case of an error.  Also, one should not forget about the commission, which is 1.5% minimum. </p><p>  The transfer is carried out via the Internet or an ATM.  In the section of the mobile bank, select the option "To a card in another bank" and enter the recipient's data.  Further actions take place according to the usual pattern: entering the amount, receiving a password, sending funds. </p><p>  If the client does not use a mobile bank, he can choose any other online service where such operations are performed.  Additional features of Sberbank money transfers: </p><ol><li>  USSD team.  This method also allows you to quickly make a financial transfer to the card by phone number, even if the mobile balance is at zero.  This is a short command consisting of the amount and addressee of the recipient.  Sberbank code 900 and the number 12, which means a digital command, must be indicated before the card data.  Example: * 900 * 12 * 9xx1234392 * 500 # (where 9xx1234392 is the payee card, and 500 is the transfer amount).  Next, the call key is pressed. </li><li>  Auto translations.  Sberbank provides a unique opportunity for automatic payments with the establishment of a specific date and time.  Thanks to mobile banking, a client makes money transactions without visiting a bank branch.  The program itself for the given settings sends finances.  Such a function can be turned off at any time when the need for translations will no longer be. </li></ol><h2>  What is necessary for the transfer </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.iqualifyuk.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Money transfers" class="if uuid-2519493" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92093/2519493.jpg"></div><p>  Sending funds is possible under certain conditions. </p><ol><li>  Customer must be aware of limit restrictions.  Suppose you can send only a certain amount per day. </li><li>  If money has already been left from the sender’s account, it will be impossible to return the funds back without the help of the recipient.  Therefore, it is so important to be attentive to the personal data of the recipient. </li><li>  For online operations, you need to connect to a mobile bank. </li><li>  In some cases, the bank requires you to pay a commission on the transfer.  If there are not enough funds in the account (taking into account the commission percentage), it will be impossible to conduct the operation. </li></ol><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Sending and receiving money through online transactions is available anywhere in the world with the Internet.  The fastest way to make a transfer is to use the services of a bank online.  Everyone can issue their own account with a passport. </p>
