  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Plant cell structure</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The structure of the plant cell is slightly different from the cellular structures of the animal organism.  First of all, this is due to the plant‚Äôs way of life and a unique way of feeding - with a few exceptions, all plant organisms are autotrophs and are able to independently form <span>organic matter</span> from inorganic ones.  In most cases, organic elements are formed by photosynthesis.  Interestingly, the oxygen released is only a by-product of photosynthetic reactions. </p><p>  <strong>Plant Cell: Shell Structure</strong> </p><p>  The presence of a solid cell wall is one of the features of plant cells.  Therefore, it is necessary to consider the structure of the plant cell from this component.  It is this structure that creates mechanical protection around the protoplast.  In addition, the wall is a certain source of ions, as well as an antibacterial barrier.  In young cells, only the formation of the primary membrane can be observed.  The main components of the structure are cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin fibers.  As for the thickness, this indicator will vary for different species. </p><p>  In the process of life, the <span>cell wall</span> may thicken.  The formation of the secondary and tertiary walls occurs by superimposing subsequent layers on the primary membrane.  Quite often there is a deposition of lignin or suberin in the cavities between the cellulose fibers - such a cell can no longer grow or stretch. </p><p>  <strong>Plant cell structure: the main elements of protoplast</strong> </p><p>  The protoplast of the cell consists of a nucleus, cytoplasm and other organelles.  It should be noted that cell organelles can be divided into membrane and non-membrane. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The cytoplasm is a multicomponent system in which the main stages of metabolism and transport of substances occur.  The substance of the cytoplasm contains a network of microfilaments - thin fibrillar proteins that cause the movement of structures.  There are microtubules, as well as centrioles, which are involved in mitotic <span>cell division.</span> </p><p>  Another group of important organelles is ribosomes, which are a non-membrane structure.  Each ribosome consists of a small and a large subunit.  By and large, these organelles are nothing more than a complex of protein elements and specific ribosomal RNA.  Similar structures take part in protein synthesis processes. </p><p>  <strong>Plant Cell Structure: Characterization of Membrane Organelles</strong> </p><p>  Most of the components of a plant cell are composed of membranes. </p><p>  The nucleus is a small spherical or elongated formation, which consists of the nucleolus, nucleoplasm, chromatin and nuclear membrane.  The main function of the nucleus is the transmission of hereditary information, as well as RNA synthesis. </p><p>  <span>The endoplasmic reticulum</span> is a system of canals and tanks.  There is granular EPS (its surface is covered with ribosomes) and smooth EPS.  The functions of this organelle are very diverse.  On the ribosomes, protein components are synthesized, which then undergo modification already inside the EPS tanks.  In addition, the structure is responsible for the transport of substances. </p><p>  Vacuole is a membrane structure containing cell sap.  <span>This organelle</span> maintains osmotic balance and provides turgor to the cell.  In addition, unnecessary substances are collected inside the vacuole, which are then thrown out through the formation of bubbles.  Sometimes useful reserve substances dissolve in the cell sap. </p><p>  Plastids are an integral part of the plant cell.  In most cases, they are represented by chloroplasts.  Plastids consist of two shells, and the inner one forms protrusions - thylakoids.  It contains photosensitive pigments.  It is in chloroplasts that such important processes of photosynthesis take place. </p><p>  The plant cell also has other organelles - these are mitochondria (responsible for cellular respiration), <span>the Golgi apparatus</span> (provides redistribution and transport of substances inside the cell). </p><p>  Nevertheless, the main structural features of the plant cell are visible - it has a strong cell wall, a plastid system and a vacuole. </p>
