A huge number of both simple budget phones and powerful devices can satisfy the needs of the most fastidious user. </p><p>  The A7 smartphone, located between two extremes, namely in the middle class phones, is capable of boasting very interesting features.  A catchy look, large dimensions and an impressive screen size are only advantages that are visible to the naked eye.  All the most interesting is hidden inside. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  It is worth noting a very interesting design of the device.  If before the Galaxy A7 you did not have to deal with smartphones from the A line, then it will be difficult to recognize the hand of Korean masters in this gadget.  Given that the previous models were much smaller, the device retained its relationship with its predecessors. </p>

    <p>  To begin with, it is striking that the device is quite thin and does not have removable panels, only SIM card slots.  Although this is already a common practice in many phones and, most likely, it only adds a highlight to the design of the smartphone. </p><p>  A strange feature of the phone is that although it is monolithic, it is made of metal.  However, you can feel this material only in cold weather, because on top of the phone is covered with the most ordinary plastic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the bottom of the device‚Äôs display, as always, sheltered touch buttons for control and one mechanical.  Even lower in the Galaxy A7 is a headphone jack with an input of 3.5 millimeters and a hole for a USB cable.  <span>The volume control</span> on the device is located on the right side panel. </p><p>  Above the display you can see the standard company logo, earpiece, sensors and camera. </p><p>  The reverse side of the phone has the same logo, flash and main camera.  In addition, there is a speaker near the camera. </p><p>  In general, the smartphone has a very interesting design that sets it apart from the general background. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The Galaxy A7 smartphone has a surprisingly large 5.5-inch screen.  Compared to its predecessors from the A series, this is the largest display. </p>

    <p>  Absolutely deservedly such a display can be considered one of the best in phones.  In addition to the impressive diagonal, the device has Full HD resolution, that is, 1920 x 1080 pixels.  And on this dignity is just beginning. </p><p>  The Galaxy A7 screen has a deep and realistic image.  The saturation of colors, the smallest elaboration of shadows and brightness can only please.  Moreover, the viewing angle in the device is 180 degrees.  The company equipped the display of its device with anti-glare. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  And most importantly, the screen uses Super AMOLED technology, and this allows you to adjust the display profile for yourself.  There are three options for modes: "main", "photo" and "movie". </p><h2>  Filling </h2><p>  From the very beginning, an excellent processor with eight cores is striking.  The cores of the Galaxy A7 have different capacities, four cores at 1.5 GHz and, respectively, four at 1.1 GHz.  The phone is equipped with an Adreno 405 video accelerator. </p><p>  Such a filling will allow you to work with many modern applications or acquire demanding games without any difficulties. </p>

    <h2>  Memory </h2><p>  The device‚Äôs RAM looks very mediocre, just two gigabytes.  Although with a similar filling this is more than enough. </p><p>  Samsung Galaxy A7 Phone <strong> </strong>  It has 16 gigabytes of internal memory, although only 12 gigabytes are available.  The rest of the space is occupied by the device‚Äôs operating system. </p><p>  It is possible to supplement the existing memory with a microSD flash card in the size of 64 Gigabytes.  The device without braking works with a card so large.  It is installed in one of the SIM card slots.  Therefore, the user will have to choose what is more important to him - memory expansion or work with two SIM cards. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  In the Galaxy A7, camera features will delight fans of the photo.  Both the main and the front ones have high characteristics. </p><p>  The front camera has acquired five megapixels, which is a pretty good indicator.  Resolution also does not lag behind and has 2592 X 1944 pixels.  In general, it is ideal for both web communication and ordinary photos. </p>

    <p>  The main camera will appreciate the possibility of shooting in Full HD and a standard resolution of 1920 X 1080 pixels.  Unfortunately, it only shoots 30 frames per second, which looks very strange with the presence of such a filling. </p><p>  The camera has 13 megapixels and shoots with a resolution of 4128 X 3096 pixels.  Photos are very high quality and bright.  In addition, the camera has an LED flash, auto focus and HDR support. </p><p>  Simple and intuitive settings, as well as the ability to start shooting directly from the lock mode, facilitate the work with the camera. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Equipped with Samsung Galaxy A7 LTE-battery size of 2600 maH.  Given the special features in the form of non-fixed panels, a battery of this size looks very mediocre. </p><p>  The presence of a large and saturated display, powerful filling and many useful little things implies the presence of a battery with a larger capacity. </p>

    <p>  With minimal work with the device, the battery should last for a day.  When using the Internet, applications, downloading video, the time is reduced to about 8 hours. </p><p>  The phone has a mode for a more gentle waste of energy, which allows you to extend the operation of the device.  If absolutely necessary, you can reduce the brightness settings on the screen and reduce battery consumption by disabling some applications. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  The small speaker on the rear panel produces a very solid sound.  Even at the maximum level of settings, it will be very audible, without unpleasant crackling.  The headphones that come with the device also get no complaints about sound quality. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  The phone hides the standard system in the form of "Android 4.4.4" under a proprietary shell.  The device has nice features in the form of a multi-window mode, simple gesture control and other useful features of Android. </p><p>  In the near future, smartphone users will have the opportunity to upgrade their system to version 5.0. </p>

    <h2>  Communications </h2><p>  The smartphone is equipped with functions familiar to all in the form of mobile Internet EDGE and GPRS, work with Wi-Fi networks and bluetooth.  In addition to the everyday set, there are also interesting functions in the form of LTE data transmission.  The device also has an NFC chip. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  In addition to new items in the form of LTE functions, Galaxy A7 is able to function in GSM and UMTS networks.  Work on the LTE network is pretty good (both signal strength and data processing speed). </p><h2>  Multimedia </h2><p>  The Galaxy A7 phone has all the necessary additional functions, players for audio files and programs for playing sound, working with the radio and voice recorder. </p><p>  The Android system will complement the existing multimedia functions, adjusting to the need. </p><h2>  Navigation </h2><p>  For navigation, the smartphone uses GLONASS and GPS.  Connection to the satellite takes about 20 seconds and determines the location of up to 7 meters.  Pretty good indicator for the phone. </p><p>  However, launching navigation indoors is most likely to fail.  A phone with certain difficulties receives a signal, and this is not enough for optimal operation of the device. </p><p>  In general, the device has useful and workable navigation functions for orientation on the ground. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the phone is a little short in its functions to many of Samsung's flagships, the impressions of the work remain only positive. </p><p>  Most users are quite satisfied not only with the filling of the device, but also with its interesting design.  Of course, there are flaws that create petty dissatisfaction with certain features. </p><p>  Owners of the device express a lack of understanding as to why such a small battery was chosen.  In most cases, all negative reviews are limited to this. </p><p>  Most owners are quite happy with their Galaxy A7 device.  Reviews boil down to the fact that the advantages completely cover the minor flaws of the smartphone. </p><p>  Before buying a <span>Galaxy A7, a review of</span> recommendations from personal experience will be useful information.  It should be studied exactly what difficulties and shortcomings people encountered. </p><p>  You should always remember: after reviewing the reviews, there is a chance to get useful tips.  For example, information about stores selling the Galaxy A7, the price of which may be slightly lower than most. </p><p>  But still, the user will have to do the final review for the Galaxy A7. </p>

    <h2>  Advantages </h2><p>  Modern mid-range phones are often not surprised by their capabilities.  But the Galaxy A7 immediately catches the eye with the main advantage in the form of a 5.5-inch display, a unique gamut of saturated colors and a size that has few analogues in a number of similar smartphones. </p><p>  An undoubted plus is the ability to choose the appropriate display mode.  Each of the modes showed good results during testing. </p><p>  In addition, the phone for its dimensions is very thin, which will be a tangible plus when working with it.  The phone has a metal case, but weighs only 141 grams.  All this provides comfortable use. </p><p>  Although the filling can not boast of high performance, having 8 cores and only two gigabytes of RAM, it will successfully cope with most of the tasks. </p><p>  The device is equipped with a powerful 13 megapixel camera.  In addition to high-quality images, there is the ability to record Full HD-video. </p><p>  The operation of the device on a modern version of the system with the further possibility of updating in the form of "Android 5.0" creates a large selection of applications for installation. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  The weakest point of the phone can be considered a battery with a capacity of only 2600 mAh.  Given the inability to <span>replace the battery</span> with a more powerful one, this is a big drawback. </p><p>  The camera, despite all the advantages of shooting in the daytime, shoots very mediocre at night.  The presence of an LED flash does not absolutely correct this drawback. </p><p>  It is worth noting the difficulty of choosing the installation of flash cards.  The problem is that the phone has only two cells.  And the user will have the choice to install two SIM cards or one communication card and a USB flash drive.  A similar problem can be solved in a very risky way by sawing a flash drive.  Although this may damage both the flash drive and the cell under it. </p><p>  Turning to the telephone connection, I immediately want to note a Wi-Fi that is not able to support the highest transmission speed.  Most likely, this is a consequence of the SnapDragon615 chip. </p><p>  It will be difficult to connect to the indoor navigation satellite.  The signal simply does not pass through the walls. </p><p>  And a smaller, but also unpleasant feature can be considered a phone cover.  The metal of the device is hidden under the most ordinary layer of plastic.  Given that the phone is metal, it continues to heat up significantly during continuous operation. </p><p>  Not a particularly nice minus for the Galaxy A7 is the price.  Given that this is not the flagship of the company, the cost of the device can be unpleasantly surprising.  Having examined in detail the functions and features of the phone, we can conclude that some re-evaluation of this device by the company is necessary. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The bundle of the phone is slightly different from the usual one.
