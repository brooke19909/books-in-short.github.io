For example, a birthday, a children's party in a garden or school, an outdoor party or even a wedding. </p><p>  In this article, we have collected the 4 best workshops that will help you make a huge flower from corrugated paper with your own hands.  And yes, we have instructions for even the most-laziest and most-most impatient! </p><div class="photo" data-original="honestlywtf.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="corrugated paper flowers" class="if uuid-2966645" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110118/2966645.jpg"></div><h2>  Why is it worth making such flowers? </h2><p>  So, to make a huge flower from corrugated paper with your own hands is not difficult at all, and its advantages are obvious: </p><ul><li>  The main thing, as we have already noted, is the simplicity of manufacture. </li><li>  Rapidity.  Even if half an hour is left before the holiday, you will still have time to make these decorations. </li><li>  Profitability and a small set of necessary materials. </li><li>  Compact and lightweight materials when folded.  They can easily be delivered to the desired location and assemble already in place. </li><li>  Since the flowers themselves are very voluminous, not so many are needed to create the feeling of a holiday. </li><li>  Virtually no special tools.  The glue gun specified in many instructions, in its absence, can be easily replaced with a PVA tube. </li></ul><h2>  A small digression: so crepe or corrugated paper? </h2><p>  On the Internet, disputes over whether corrugated and crepe paper are one and the same material or are they completely different things? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  We can say with confidence that these are two names of one product.  Paper may vary in quality or density, but here it is called corrugated or creped - it does not matter.  In order to make a huge flower from corrugated paper of complex design, it is important to make sure that it has the mark ‚Äúfloristic‚Äù on it.  It is denser and stretches better than plain paper for children's crafts.  Although, in principle, for some types of flowers, the simplest and cheapest paper from the stationery store is quite suitable. </p><h2>  Huge flowers made of corrugated paper.  Master class number 1 </h2><div class="photo" data-original="kojo-designs.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="corrugated paper flower" class="if uuid-2965689" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110118/2965689.jpg"></div><p>  Such products look good from all sides.  These large corrugated paper chrysanthemums can be placed on the wall or hung from the ceiling. </p><p>  We will need: </p><ul><li>  corrugated paper in one, two or three colors - your choice. </li><li>  scissors. </li><li>  rope, lace or wire. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Description of how to make chrysanthemum from corrugated paper" class="if uuid-2965707" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110118/2965707.jpg"></div><p>  How to do it: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  If you have paper in three colors, we leave one package as it is, cut the second one off by about a third of the length of the first package, and the third one that will serve as the middle - half the second.  The flower with a contrasting core looks most advantageous, but it can also be monophonic. </li><li>  We cut the long and medium packs of paper in a semicircle at both ends, cut the smallest piece with fringe on both sides. </li><li>  We unfold and spread the middle and small sheets in the middle of the large. </li><li>  Folded together, we bend the accordion. </li><li>  Clamp the middle and tie it with a rope or wire. </li><li>  We straighten the petals and fasten the parts of the fan together to give a round shape. First of all, you need to fluff the middle as much as possible, and then straighten each petal, bending it to the center. </li><li>  We did a great job! </li></ul><p>  Now you can attach the flower to the wall with pins or masking tape.  Or hang on a tape to the ceiling. </p><p>  If desired, the shape of the petals can be made not round, but triangular, introducing a variety of appearance. </p><h2>  Master class number 2.  Pion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.smilemercantile.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Giant Corrugated Paper Peony" class="if uuid-2965756" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110118/2965756.jpg"></div><p>  In this workshop we will try to make huge flowers from corrugated paper - peonies. They are made using a slightly different technology, a little more time-consuming, but the result is definitely worth your effort. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  These giant growth flowers from corrugated paper will definitely not go unnoticed among guests, they will be an excellent background for photos and selfies. </p><p>  We will need: </p><ul><li>  1 roll of floral corrugated paper; </li><li>  regular corrugated complementary color; </li><li>  yellow corrugated paper strip; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  large paper plate; </li><li>  glue gun. </li></ul><p>  How to do it: </p><ul><li>  We unfold the floral paper and fold it in half horizontally.  Cut across into 7-9 equal parts, depending on the planned number of large petals. </li><li>  We take one of the received pieces of paper.  The opposite side of the bend is cut off part of the sheet to the shape of a petal - round or sharp - to your taste.  Also, do not be discouraged if the petals come out slightly crooked.  Firstly, even in living nature there are no identical forms, and secondly, slight irregularities simply will not be noticeable in the finished flower. </li><li>  Gently squeeze the base of the petal and gently glue it with a glue gun.  Press the joint until the glue dries. </li><li>  We begin to gently straighten both petals from the center to the edge.  Be careful, as you may accidentally break it.  You should also not smooth them too much. </li><li>  Repeat with the remaining sheets of paper. </li><li>  Now take a paper plate and begin to attach the petals to it in a circle, keeping closer to the outer edge. </li><li>  We make 6-8 similar smaller petals from another roll of paper.  We also attach these petals to the plate inside the ring of large petals.  Try to glue them vertically, pressing the base to the plate. </li><li>  The smallest of the pieces of paper is first folded several times along, then once across.  Cut the petals from the opposite side of the fold.  Quite a lot of such leaflets will be needed - about ten to twenty. </li><li>  Slightly spread out the small petals and give them a shape.  Glue the petals in the middle of our flower in a chaotic order, leaving a little space in the center for the core. </li><li>  From yellow paper, cut a strip and cut one edge along the fringe.  Then we turn like brushes and glue.  Now it needs to be disheveled and placed in the center of the composition. </li><li>  We straighten all the petals and give them the final shape. </li></ul><p>  You can place these growth flowers from corrugated paper both on the walls and attach them to some vertical stick, tying it with a green ribbon.  They look beautiful. </p><h2>  Master class number 3.  How to make huge flowers from corrugated paper: an option for the lazy </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.uncommondesignsonline.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="huge paper flowers" class="if uuid-2966029" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110118/2966029.jpg"></div><p>  If you still want to make a huge flower from corrugated paper with your own hands, and the previous option seemed too laborious for you, that is, a faster way that does not require special time and effort. </p><p>  We will need: </p><ul><li>  corrugated paper in two contrasting colors; </li><li>  duct tape; </li><li>  wire; </li><li>  paper or cardboard for patterns, but you can do without them, cutting out the petals on the eye; </li><li>  glue. <div class="photo" data-original="www.uncommondesignsonline.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern of flower petals" class="if uuid-2966236" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110118/2966236.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  How to do it: </p><ul><li>  First of all, we make patterns of petals of 3 different sizes.  The largest is about 35 centimeters long and 15-20 centimeters wide. </li><li>  On the obtained patterns, cut out the petals.  The more there will be, the more magnificent the resulting flower will be.  Again, do not pay much attention to accuracy, cut out how it works. </li><li>  A strip of paper of contrasting color is cut with a fringe on both sides and fastened in the middle with wire.  Try to take the wire more genuine, since it will also serve as a kind of flower leg. </li><li>  Fluff the paper strips to make a shaggy ball. </li><li>  Fold the petals 3-4 pieces like a fan and fix with tape at the base.  The flower will be more magnificent if the petals slightly come on one another. </li><li>  We attach the obtained fans to the base of the flower using tape: first small, then medium and at the very end - large. </li><li>  We fix the whole structure around the wire well with adhesive tape, otherwise our flower may fall apart, and it will be insulting. </li></ul><p>  So, another huge flower made of corrugated paper with your own hands made! </p><h2>  Workshop ‚Ññ4: and for the very lazy </h2><div class="photo" data-original="hellocreativefamily.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lush corrugated paper flower" class="if uuid-2966407" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110118/2966407.jpg"></div><p>  Again too complicated and time consuming?  Well, we have the option for the very, very lazy. </p><p>  We will need: </p><ul><li>  corrugated paper of your favorite color; </li><li>  lace, rope, elastic, tape or anything else that could be used to bind paper; </li><li>  scissors. </li></ul><p>  What do we do: </p><ul><li>  We unfold the sheets of paper. </li><li>  We stack them in a pile.  The author of this workshop used 10 sheets for each flower. </li><li>  We fold the sheets with an accordion. </li><li>  We dress in the middle with what is at hand. </li><li>  Trim the ends on both sides. </li><li>  And now just bend each of the layers up and to the center, trying not to tear them. </li><li>  Repeat the action until the sheets run out. </li><li>  And literally in minutes our gigantic volumetric flower is ready. </li></ul><h2>  Petal shape </h2><p>  The shape by which you can cut the tips of the petals depends on what kind of flower you ultimately want to get.  So, the triangular tips are more reminiscent of a dahlia, the sharper triangle is a daisy, and the soft square is a rose or peony. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cartefini.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="giant paper peony" class="if uuid-2966713" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110118/2966713.jpg"></div><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Now you know exactly how to make huge flowers from corrugated paper: more complex or very simple.  But no matter what path you personally take, your guests cannot fail to appreciate the scale and admire your skill. </p><p>  And if we all practice a little bit, then soon we will be able to make such amazing and complex flowers, as in the photo above. </p>
