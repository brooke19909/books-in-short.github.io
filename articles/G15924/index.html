    <h2>  Expedition Breadfruit </h2><p>  From school history, it was also known that James Cook, having visited it, discovered a <span>breadfruit.</span>  With this message, he excited the minds of the planters so much that the special bounty ship was equipped with seedlings.  Translated, this word means "generosity."  The idea was good, but the team rebelled.  Against the western viewers, the island of Tahiti, before the tourist boom that swept the world in recent decades, was more familiar with the numerous adaptations of this particular plot.  The famous "Bounty Rebellion" with Marlon Brando in the title role contributed to the popularization of the "islands of love."  Question: ‚ÄúWhich country does Tahiti belong to?‚Äù  - then, in the XVIII century, when this rebellion was actually there, did not arise.  The main thing is that he had nothing to do with Britain, which included the three-masted ship and its rebellious crew.  That was in 1788. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  "Islands of Love" </h2><p>  Why is the topic related to Tahiti so loved by Western filmmakers?  Because the natives from the islands of Oceania, considered white people to be gods who allowed everything.  Crowned only with flowers, they sailed to meet ships far into the sea and, surrounded, escorted to land. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="which country does tahiti belong to" class="if" height="254" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/520085.jpg" width="600"></div>  Further events developed quite rapidly.  Some sailors from the Bounty expeditionary vessel remained on the island, and many of them were later executed by the returning representatives of the English Themis, led by Captain Bly.  Before the arrival of Europeans, the island was densely populated, Aboriginal tribes fought among themselves for power.

    <h2>  Dynasty ruling centuries </h2><p>  After the death of Hapaya, a rather powerful leader, his son Pomare established his authority over all of Tahiti, and several more neighboring islands.  Pomare II converted to Christianity.  And in those days when Queen Pomar IV ruled the country, the whole territory subject to it became a French protectorate, although before that the influence of England was very high.  It happened in 1842.  The question ‚Äúto which country does Tahiti belong‚Äù was removed from the agenda.  English missionaries were expelled from these territories in 1830.  Although the first to visit the blessed island were the Spaniards who arrived there in 1606.  But they were looking for gold, and local beauties and beauties did not hold them for long.  The ships of the British Samuel Wallis, who visited here in 1767, and the legendary James Cook, in 1774, sailed away from here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="which country does tahiti belong to" class="if" height="344" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/520086.jpg" width="600"></div>  According to historians, they did not leave the flags of their states on the islands.  And after they sailed, the question did not arise: ‚ÄúNow which country does Tahiti belong to?‚Äù  Only children with lighter skin and dangerous European diseases remained, which significantly reduced the population of the islands.  And now it has not reached that figure - 200,000 people.  The French destroyed not only local customs and traditions, but also agriculture.  Of course, the natives rebelled, but the uprisings were very brutally suppressed.  In 1880, under Pomar V, the Community Islands turned into a French colony, the center of which is the island of Tahiti.  What country was he in then?  He was part of French Oceania, which was later renamed Polynesia.

Obviously, this is an entity that has all the attributes of power, the right to make independent decisions on its world order, but which is part of another state.  French Polynesia is both a constituent country of France and an overseas community, which includes about 130 beautiful islands belonging to 5 archipelagos.  The total occupied area is 4,167 square meters.  km  The main of all this splendor is the Tahiti coral atoll.  Which country owns it now, if since 1998, French Polynesia has its own legally elected president and legislative bodies?  Despite this, all the citizens of the island are French citizens.  The community received relative freedom along with internal autonomy in 1977.  His rights expanded significantly in 1984. With independence, the island begins to intensively develop and today is one of the best and most beautiful resorts of world significance. </p>

    <h2>  In the center of the ocean </h2><p>  Despite millions of tourists and the island's apparent prosperity, an armed rebellion broke out in Papeete, the capital of Tahiti, in the fall of 2006, provoked by high prices and low living standards of the indigenous population, although thanks to tourism it is much higher than in any region of Oceania.  Distant France owns the beautiful Pacific island of Tahiti.  Which country is located in close proximity to this paradise?  And how far is Russia from it?  From Moscow to Papeete 15 723 km.  Near the community of islands there is nothing but the ocean.  True, several large countries own the islands in the neighborhood, which are also part of Polynesia.  Until the states themselves fly and fly.  The coast of Australia is closest to all - 5390 km, to Tokyo - 9485 km, to California - 6520 km.  7 952 km to Santiago de Chile.  The question arises: "Tahiti, where is it?"  The exact answer is that in the central part of the Pacific Ocean, south of the equator, the coordinates are 149.5 ¬∞ west longitude and 17.66 ¬∞ south latitude. </p><h2>  The largest and most beautiful </h2>

The remaining 4 archipelagos that make up French Polynesia are called Tuamotu and Tubuai, the Marquesas Islands and the Gambier Islands.  Each of them has its own flag, while the banner of French Polynesia exactly repeats one of the symbols of power of the V Republic.  Therefore, the question arises among many who have come to rest, ‚ÄúWhat country does Tahiti belong to, because it has its own flag.‚Äù  And the coat of arms, and the anthem, and, as noted above, the president, and government.  True, the language is French, but Tahitian is also there.  Nowadays, when Catalonia, Scotland, Transnistria and Novorossia also have their flags, this says something.  Probably, France is very far away - from Paris to Papeete there was a distance of 15 716 km, and you can quickly overcome it only by plane, because the Pyrenees stand in the way.

    <h2>  A bit of geography </h2><p>  The <span>Society Islands</span> themselves are administratively divided into Leeward and Windward.  The latter include Tahiti.  In addition, the island itself is territorially divided into Tahiti Nui and Tahiti Iti, respectively, Big and Small Tahiti.  Because the territory of the island resembles a figure eight, and the two parts are interconnected by a small isthmus.  Both of them are extinct volcanoes.  Tahiti is home to 70% of the total population of this country.  The island's capital, which is located on the northwest coast, is the main city of all of French Polynesia. </p><p>  The country is advertisingly beautiful, it has everything: mountains and the sea, and tropical forests.  And all this is painted by nature in unnaturally bright colors.  There are beaches with white and black fine sand, the most beautiful of which is the beach of Venus. </p><h2>  Unique features </h2>

Tahiti is one of the ten most beautiful islands on the planet, along with Fiji, Hawaii, the Philippine islands and other world pearls, each of which has its own zest.  There are several in Tahiti.  One of them is a unique black pearl, which is mined only here.  The capital's attractions include the Black Pearl Museum.  And the island itself is called that way - the Black Pearl.  And not a single article about this island is complete without mentioning the name of the <span>French artist</span> Paul Gauguin, who sang it like Levitan Russia.  The canvases of the French post-impressionist create a special world, and in this regard, the question "which country Tahiti belongs to" can be answered with confidence - the country of Paul Gauguin.  These two names are inextricably linked.  No one has done as much for Tahiti as Gauguin.  And for the artist, the island became absolutely everything.  He died in 1903, among the local natives, who sincerely mourned him.  And this world-famous genius, thanks to the Tahitian cycle, has its own museum in Tahiti, located on the site of his former hut, which was all painted with his brilliant brush, but burned down.

You can ask a lot of questions, the answers to which will be very interesting and informative.  For example, why is black pearl growing only here?  Why did Gauguin not leave Tahiti, even being seriously ill?  But the question "in which country is Tahiti" is posed incorrectly.  The preposition "c" implies some kind of space in the country.  Tahiti is not located in France.  <span>This is autonomy</span> with very great powers, located thousands of kilometers from it.
