A variety of entertainment programs, interesting and exciting experiments, cognitive experiments that anyone can put into practice, and which are similar to the real wonders of science and technology - all this makes visiting the center bright and unforgettable.  Due to the fact that there are almost no such organizations as the "Joule Park" in Omsk, there are always a lot of people in the center, often there is a long queue.  Another minus of the institution is a lot of noisy entertainment that can scare preschool children, so for the smallest it is better to choose other types of recreation. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Joule Park in Omsk is one of the few entertainment centers for children and parents to relax together, where you can not only have fun, but also learn a lot of interesting things.
