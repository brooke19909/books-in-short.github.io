    <p>  In addition to the main dining room, this hotel also has a public restaurant.  Everyone can visit it, and not just the residents of the hotel itself.  In the evenings, very pleasant unobtrusive and not particularly loud live music plays in this institution.  Prices in a restaurant located on the territory of Legian Village, according to vacationers, are quite high.  Almost the same standard dishes in a cafe, working near this hotel, are, as vacationers note, somewhat cheaper. </p><h2>  Beach Hotel Reviews </h2><p>  <span><span><span>Guests of Legian Village Hotel 3 *, reviews about which are good, can reach the sea in about 5-7 minutes.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The beach of this hotel, unfortunately, most of its residents do not like.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Firstly, the sea here is almost always turbulent.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Excitement is generally a feature of Kuta resort.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>No wonder there are many surf clubs.</span></span></span> </p><p>  <span><span><span>Among other things, the sea in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Legian Village Hotel is also quite dirty.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>From the neighboring islands, a huge amount of garbage is nailed here.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Bottles, packs and even diapers can swim in the water on the beach of the hotel.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Therefore, in most cases, guests of Legian Village prefer to swim either in the hotel pool or visit other, cleaner and more attractive beaches in the village.</span></span></span> </p>
