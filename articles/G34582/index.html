Its population is about five thousand people.  Since the beginning of the last century, the tourism industry has been the main source of income for citizens. </p><p>  Like other coastal resorts, the city of Stresa in Italy attracts tourists with stunning landscapes, natural, historical and architectural monuments.  We suggest you get to know this city better. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="45.89958350000001" data-lng="8.539329599999974" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/2/4/4/7/12447.png"></div><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The first mention of Stresa in Italy appeared in annals dating from the 10th century.  In the XV century, it was already a fishing village belonging to the Visconti family.  Later, the settlement became the property of the Borromean clan.  Thanks to the efforts of representatives of this one of the richest families in the country, who in the 17th century acquired and began to ennoble Isola Bella, to unite nearby villages, from a small fishing village, Stresa turned into a prestigious holiday destination for European aristocrats. </p><p>  They built numerous villas of extraordinary beauty here.  By the beginning of the 20th century, the flood of tourists forced the local authorities to begin the construction of luxury hotels such as Regina Hotel, Grand Hotel, Hotel Royal.  Around the same time, a tunnel through the Alps was built, and there were even more willing people to visit Stresa. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.lagomaggiore.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stresa in Italy" class="if uuid-2990278" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2990278.jpg"></div><p>  One of the legendary guests of the city was the great Ernest Hemingway, who wrote here in 1948 part of his novel ‚ÄúFarewell to Arms‚Äù.
