The presence of improved product properties makes the enterprise more competitive and increases production efficiency. </p><p>  Of great importance in the system of production of quality products is the <span>life cycle</span> or quality loop. </p><p>  A quality loop is a model of interconnected methods of activity that affect the characteristics of products at different stages - from determining needs to meeting these needs. </p><p>  The quality loop is the interconnection of the components of the full cycle of manufacturing services or products that affect the <span>properties of the goods.</span> </p><p>  When managing the properties and characteristics of products, orientation is placed on the consumer, a <span>systematic approach</span> and the involvement of all levels of the product life cycle. </p><p>  The cycle of product development is formed by the management components that make up its basis.  In accordance with ISO international standards, the quality loop is a product development cycle in the form of a vicious circle. </p><p>  The system of product brands should be developed taking into account the activities of the enterprise, and cover all stages of the <span>product life cycle.</span> </p><p>  In the life cycle, the following stages are distinguished: </p><ol><li>  Market research, marketing; </li><li>  Creation and development of requirements; </li><li>  Creation of products; </li><li>  Provision in material and technical terms; </li><li>  Preparation and production technology; </li><li>  Production; </li><li>  Inspection and control; </li><li>  Storage and packaging; </li><li>  Product implementation; </li></ol><p>  10. Operation and installation; </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  11. Technical assistance; </p><p>  12. Disposal. </p><p>  The loop <span>of product quality</span> communicates with the manufacturer and consumers, as well as ensures interconnection with objects that provide management. </p><p>  Regulation of the improvement of product properties occurs cyclically, that is, it passes through stages.  This cyclicity is called Deming's circular cycle.  <span>The Deming cycle</span> consists of four stages: </p><ol><li>  Planning; </li><li>  Exercise; </li><li>  The control; </li><li>  Interaction management. </li></ol><p>  In the circular cycle of Deming laid the foundation for the implementation of the <span>basic management functions,</span> which are aimed at providing the proper conditions for creating quality services and worthy of their application. </p><p>  Therefore, in the control system, while ensuring a systematic process, it is necessary to combine quality rings with the Deming circle.  This will determine the main stages of actions and the complexity of the process throughout the entire product development cycle. </p><p>  There are three areas in the system of features that affect the stages of the quality loop: </p><ol><li>  Quality assurance is all the planned and additional activities in the structure of the quality system that are necessary to implement the necessary level of confidence and reliability that the object will meet the conditions for quality. <br><br>  li&gt; </li><li>  Quality management - these are the types and methods of activity that are used to fulfill the conditions for the release of quality goods.  They are aimed at managing the process and at eliminating the causes of fraud at all stages of the quality loop, in order to achieve economic efficiency. <br><br>  li&gt; </li><li>  Quality improvement - these are measures that are carried out to increase the effectiveness, efficiency of activities and processes, to obtain profit for the organization and benefits for consumers. </li></ol><p>  The quality loop is an important link in the system of properties and characteristics of goods and services.  It indicates the relationship of the manufacturer with the consumer and other components of the chain, which ensure the proper quality of products.  Therefore, for the normal functioning of all processes, which are based on a quality loop, an integrated and effective approach and management is required. </p>
