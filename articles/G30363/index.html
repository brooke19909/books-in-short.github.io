    <p>  Speakers Defender Hollywood 35 BK legitimately attributed to the budget class, they are designed primarily for use in an apartment or small office.  In the absence of alternatives, of course, they can also be adapted for placement in a catering institution - if its visitors are not too picky in assessing the quality of sound accompaniment.  The speakers in question are certainly capable of reproducing high-quality sound, but it is not quite correct to compare their capabilities with the best mid-range models, as well as with Hi-End devices. </p><p>  The market for low-cost audio equipment, according to many experts, is among the most promising segments.  This is largely due to higher prices for equipment of more expensive categories.  At the same time, users, while making decisions about saving, nevertheless expect to get a product when purchasing audio equipment that can satisfy their basic needs for good sound.  That is, those manufacturers who can offer devices to the market lower in class, but comparable in quality with more advanced devices, have the right to count on an increase in market share. </p>
