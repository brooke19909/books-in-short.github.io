    <h2>  Several advantages of winter holidays on the Promised Land </h2><p>  Holidays in Israel in December has a number of features that must be taken into account when going on a similar trip.  Moreover, many tourists claim that it is at this time of the year that the country opens up on a completely different side than in the summer months, when the suffocating heat makes it impossible to appreciate the beauty of these places and historical cultural monuments. </p><p>  If you go to Israel in December, you will be able to go around all the holy places and spend there as much time as you need.  It cannot be said that tourists at this time in Jerusalem, for example, are few, but the number of routes for pilgrims is increasing, which eliminates the hustle and long wait at the entrance to certain places. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Do not forget that almost all beaches are empty in winter.  However, this does not mean that you will not be able to sunbathe and swim.  In Eilat, our compatriots often spend the first half of the day on the beach and only after lunch go on various excursions.  Many said that they came from vacation with a great tan. </p><p>  In December, Israel hosts a huge number of holidays, which can be visited by all tourists, without exception.  They have the opportunity to take part in colorful processions, which will undoubtedly significantly diversify any holiday. </p><p>  Tour operators claim that in the winter months the cost of trips to the Promised Land is significantly reduced.  They become more accessible to the average Russian, so they are being bought up much more actively.  After all, everyone wants to have a good rest, without spending a significant amount of money from the family budget. </p><h2>  Weather in Israel in December </h2><p>  Naturally, every tourist who is going on vacation to overseas beaches is interested in weather conditions in a given month.  Especially when it comes to a period that is considered a low season. </p><p>  December in Israel is characterized by large differences in day and night temperatures, a decrease in the number of sunny hours and an abundance of rainfall, accompanied by strong winds. </p><p>  Do not forget that weather conditions are very dependent on the region where you will go on vacation.  For example, in Tel Aviv or Haifa it is always quite windy.  Here you can not do without a windbreaker and a <span>warm tracksuit.</span>  Especially if you plan on long <span>evening walks.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It rarely rains in Jerusalem in December, but it can be offset by snowfall.  It often goes a couple of days a month, and then nighttime temperatures in the city drop to + 10 ¬∞ C. </p>

    <p>  In the Mediterranean Sea in the first winter month it is always very humid and it often rains with thunderstorms and can last 10-12 days per month. </p><p>  Few people know that in December in Israel you can go skiing.  An excellent center for winter recreation is located on Mount Hermon.  Here during this period of the year, zero temperature reigns, which allows you to enjoy an active holiday from the heart. </p><h2>  Temperature in December </h2><p>  Most often, our compatriots leave for the first month of winter in Eilat.  This resort retains the warmest weather with minimal rainfall.  The average air temperature usually does not fall below +24 <sup>o</sup> C. This allows you to bask on the beach and take sun baths. </p><p>  The sea temperature in Israel in December does not always favor swimming.  For example, in the same Eilat, water in the first month of winter often does not rise above +22 <sup>o</sup> C. For some tourists this is an acceptable border, but for others it is quite uncomfortable. </p>

    <p>  Most of our compatriots try to go to Israel in December to the Dead Sea.  However, you won‚Äôt be able to buy it; the water temperature usually ranges between eighteen degrees of heat.  And this is too little for sea swims.  But in winter, at the <span>resorts of the Dead Sea,</span> tourists have the opportunity to swim in pools with heated sea water and do body wraps with healing mud. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The temperature in Israel in December on the beaches of Tel Aviv also does not allow swimming in open water.  The sea does not warm above 18-20 degrees Celsius, moreover, it often storms in the first winter month, and rescuers do not serve until spring.  But the air temperature allows you to sunbathe, because in Tel Aviv it rains infrequently, in addition, there are many sunny days. </p><h2>  Things necessary for a winter holiday </h2><p>  If your vacation is planned for December, then take care of things that must be in your suitcase: </p><ul><li>  rubber boots; </li><li>  raincoat; </li><li>  windbreaker; </li><li>  some warm sweaters. </li></ul><p>  Do not forget about the waterproof case for the camcorder and camera.  With all these items, your December holiday will not be spoiled by any whims of nature. </p>

    <h2>  Tours in Israel in December </h2><p>  Many Russians plan to go on a tour of Israel in the first winter month, taking advantage of last minute packages.
