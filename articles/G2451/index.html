There are thousands of options for making such jewelry.  Creating bows is easy, even schoolchildren or novice masters can do such work.  The ability to make bows with their own hands will be necessary for parents of not only girls, but also boys.  After all, a bow tie is nothing more than a simple bow. </p><p>  Products are used in sewing clothes and decorating hoops, hairpins, elastic bands for hair.  You can decorate gift wrapping with bows.  In the article, we consider several options for the independent manufacture of such simple crafts.  Photographs and diagrams will help you better understand how to properly position the fabric or satin ribbons so that the work looks neat and original. </p><h2>  Large satin ribbon bow </h2><p>  Lush bows with your own hands can be made of satin and tulle ribbons.  Cut a strip of fabric is not necessary.  Production begins with a simple winding on the palm of your hand or any object that is suitable in size.  The width of the selected size will correspond to the width of the ribbon bow.  With your own hands you can create a multilayer product or thinner.  This will already depend on the number of revolutions of the tape around the base. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.chicaandjo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lush ribbon bow" class="if uuid-2487044" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2487044.jpg"></div><p>  When several turns are made, the workpiece is carefully removed from the palm of your hand and adhered to all layers with your fingers so that the bundle does not creep out.  In the middle you will need to tie the edge of the ribbon.  However, the craftsmen make a reduction in width in this place by cutting all the layers with triangles from below and above.  The cuts are shallow so as not to cut the workpiece in half.  Then in a bottleneck a strong knot is tied, and all the loops are distributed in a circle.  It turns out a magnificent spherical bow. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Felt decoration </h2><p>  If you are planning to make a bow out of fabric with your own hands, then you will not find material better and more convenient than felt.  Such small bows can be attached to a girl‚Äôs hairpin, for any gift, decorate them with a hat or hoop.  The work is performed according to the drawing given below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern of bows" class="if uuid-2487047" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2487047.jpg"></div><p>  You can transfer the diagram of these two parts to paper and then, using a template, redraw it onto a fabric.  A part with pointed edges and a long narrow rectangle in the center is the bottom of the craft.  A bow will be attached with a thin central strip.  The other part of the pattern is folded in half so that the narrow edges are connected on the back side in the center. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="felt bows" class="if uuid-2487031" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2487031.jpg"></div><p>  After folding the upper part in half with a thin rectangle from below, the whole small bow turns around with its own hands.  The end is hiding from the back.  To fix the parts in this craft use a glue gun, although the felt is well sewn and thread.  With such a bow, you can dream up a little, for example, cut out two parts of felt of different colors or draw a thin strip for wrapping separately from a bright fabric, as in the sample in the photo. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Leather craft </h2><p>  If you have a piece of soft skin, it is very easy to cut a bow with the help of a sharp knife according to the pattern below.  After cutting the skin, it remains only to tie a neat knot in the center. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="leather bow" class="if uuid-2487011" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2487011.jpg"></div><p>  If you want to fasten a bow to a rubber band for hair, then you can simply insert it into the center of the workpiece before tying a knot.  Such a bow can be attached to a bag and even shoes, creating a new image. </p><h2>  Flat bow </h2><p>  This option for making bows from ribbons with your own hands is made from a single piece of a strip of fabric.  Laying of the layers begins with the longest and lower part.  The edge of the tape should remain in the middle so that it is not subsequently visible on the finished product.  Be careful to keep the layers symmetrical.  If you have a bad eye, you can draw segments of the desired length on a sheet of paper and lay out the tape according to these standards.  The last edge folds inward.  You can do the crafts in another way.  To do this, the tape is folded in half, and the work starts from above, then the ends of the fabric are connected from below at a central point. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flat bow" class="if uuid-2487023" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2487023.jpg"></div><p>  Then a separate small piece of tape in the center turns the craft.  The work starts from below and ends at the same point.  You can use both a glue gun and a thread with a needle.  The edges of the tape must first be fused with the fire of a candle or lighter so that the threads do not subsequently crumble.  Such a bow can be used when packing gifts, for hairpins or hoops.  Such an option would look great on a boy‚Äôs shirt, acting as a bow tie. </p><h2>  Original bow </h2><p>  You can create such an unusual bow from ribbons with your own hands.  Using a glue gun, they fasten together ribbons twisted by rings.  Three identical preforms are made and then sewn together for strength.  How to arrange the details, look carefully at the photos below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="original ribbon bow" class="if uuid-2487020" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2487020.jpg"></div><p>  Then you need two strips of tape.  At one end, a dovetail is incised; the other remains normal.  The pointed part is attached from the bottom with glue, and a flat one wraps all the layers in the center.  The edges on the back are fastened with a glue gun.  All fasteners can be made using threads.  Do not forget to melt the edges of the tape so that the finished product looks neat. </p><h2>  Tulle elegant bow </h2><p>  Do-it-yourself master-class of bows has some similarities with the first option in the article.  Light transparent fabric should be wound several times around the palm of your hand or any other flat object.  Then the winding is removed and held by the fingers in the center. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thehairbowcompany.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tulle bow" class="if uuid-2487061" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2487061.jpg"></div><p>  The edges of the fabric hide from below.  Then a separate strip is cut, which wraps all the layers in the center.  For beauty, a brooch in the tone of the fabric or other decorative elements is attached in the middle.  The knot is tied tight.  The edges of the harness can be made short and hidden behind the crafts, or can be made long so that they hang from the bottom of the bow.  If in the first case the loops were straightened, then here you do not need to touch them. </p><h2>  Bow with lace insert </h2><p>  Such a bow can be made both from fabric and from a wide ribbon.  All parts are mounted on thin strips of double-sided tape.  A strip of fabric of the desired length is cut out.  Lace is laid out diagonally on the front side and also attached to the adhesive tape on the back side.  The edges of the fabric are bent in the middle and attached in the center. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.howtoinstructions.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a bow" class="if uuid-2487003" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2487003.jpg"></div><p>  A small piece for wrapping a bow is cut from a separate piece of fabric or ribbon.  Its edges are hidden in the middle by folding fabric.  After wrapping the bow in the center, the edges are sealed at the back. </p><p>  The article gives samples and methods for making bows from ribbons with their own hands.  They are easy to make, as well as products from fabric, leather, felt.  Try it, you will surely succeed! </p>
