And this is no wonder.  Because all <span>exact sciences are</span> focused on computing.  However, this does not mean at all that everything in this kingdom is boring and boring.  Not at all!  Despite the seriousness of the doctrine, surprising and interesting facts about mathematics appear.  And you can find them in almost any corner of the globe. </p><h2><br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="interesting historical facts about mathematics" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16531/396991.jpg" width="398"></div>  Surprisingly, but a fact </h2><p>  Consider the most interesting facts about mathematics relating to our country, as well as <br>  Western states.  As you know, our zero does not belong to the set of natural numbers.  But not everyone thinks so: in the West it is referred to as natural numbers. </p><p>  Or here is another example.  Many of us live and do not suspect that "now" flies away from them quite quickly - 86,400 times a day.  This numbering unit was not given a name, but it was found out how long a moment lasts: about a hundredth of a second. </p><p>  As it turned out, some nations are very superstitious about one or another number.  For example, in Japan and China there is nothing with number four, since this figure represents death itself.  Therefore, it is not accepted to use it even in hotels. </p><p>  In Israel, they reject everything that is connected with Christianity in one way or another, therefore they do not write the plus sign in mathematical calculations, but only use the inverted letter "T". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  And in gambling (roulette in a casino), the number 666 is the sum of all the values ‚Äã‚Äãthat are present on the reel. </p><h2>  Entertaining examples </h2>

You forgot?  Not scary, recall: the amount will be 54.

    <p>  Those people who are friends with the exact sciences know that if you add all the values ‚Äã‚Äãfrom 1 to 100, you get a very impressive number - 5050. </p><p>  You can make a simple calculation and see what happens if you enter the first 3 digits of your phone number (without an operator) in the calculator, multiply them by 80, add 1, then you need to multiply all this by 250, add the last 4 digits of your number twice, subtract 250, divide by 2. The answer will be an amazing number.  It will amaze you, we assure you! </p><h2>  Shnobel Prize </h2><p>  Everyone knows what the Nobel Prize is, to whom and for what it is awarded.  But besides her there is another unusual reward.  It is called the Shnobel Prize.  Who can become a laureate?  She is awarded at the same time as the Nobel Prize, but, unlike the famous prize, Shnobelevskaya is awarded for those brilliant projects that at the moment they cannot translate into reality.  Or they will never do it, because they are absurd.  In 2009, this award was presented to veterans who proved that a cow with a nickname gives more milk than one that does not have a name. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Experiment </h2>

Among the subjects were representatives from the Munduruku tribe and American schoolchildren who did not know how to count.  They were given a look at a certain number of points, and after some time they were asked to indicate where the numbers are from one to ten.  It turned out that for most people, the smallest values ‚Äã‚Äãhave great distances.

    <p>  As it turned out, in the field of cooking, too, there are places to be interesting facts about mathematics.  For example, a cake can be cut in two ways into eight even pieces. </p><h2>  Useful Tips </h2><p>  Many people do not know how to verify the authenticity of euro banknotes.  But this is relatively easy to do.  It is necessary to take a letter from the serial character and substitute a number in its place (serial number in the alphabet).  Then you need to add the resulting number with the remaining values.  And after that add up the numbers of the result until one value comes out - 8. It turns out that such interesting facts about mathematics can help verify the authenticity of notes. </p><p>  If we take several figures (among which there will be a circle) with the same perimeters, then after a series of calculations it turns out that the circle has the largest area.  It is impossible not to notice that if we calculate the perimeter of the circle and other figures, then it will remain in the minority.  Yes, it has the smallest perimeter. </p><h2>  <span>Interesting historical facts</span> about mathematics </h2>

At a time when our ancestors were just starting to count, they used a system of 20 characters, using fingers and toes.  After this trend has changed.  For example, in Babylon, people counted not only the fingers, but also the phalanges, which gave out the number twelve.

    <p>  Something else relates to the ‚ÄúFun and Interesting Facts about Mathematics‚Äù section.  As far as everyone knows, the Romans were a smart people.  They were good at counting.  However, there was one flaw - the number "0".  It is now used everywhere, but in Rome it was not.  Do not believe?  But in vain!  Confirmation of the above is the fact that zero cannot be written down by any of the known Roman numbers! </p><h2>  Interesting facts about great mathematicians </h2>

But, having a talent in mathematics, he couldn‚Äôt enter the Zurich Polytechnic School because he was unable to score the required number of points in other subjects.  By the way, such developmental features were noted in many geniuses.  Soon, having tightened his knowledge of the necessary disciplines, Einstein was allowed to attend classes at this school.

    <p>  There are other interesting facts about famous mathematicians.  At American University, graduate student <span>George Danzig</span> was able to solve two problems that previously were considered unanswered.  The fact is that the future mathematician was a little late for the lesson.  Then he wrote off these tasks from the board, deciding that they were homework.  They seemed complicated, but George managed to close the question in a few days, over which scientists have been thinking for more than a year. </p><p>  As it turned out, mathematics can be learned not only at school or at the institute, but also at home, looking at wallpapers.  In any case, it turned out at <span>Sophia Kovalevskaya.</span> <br>  It turned out that as a child she looked in her room at sheets with lectures on integral and differential computing.  And the thing is that the nursery simply did not have enough wallpaper.  And thank God! </p><p>  Surprisingly, with the help of mathematics, you can find out when the last day of stay on earth will come.  Abraham de Muavre (a scientist from Britain) was able to achieve this through <span>arithmetic progression.</span>  He noticed behind him that he begins to sleep 15 minutes more every day.  What came of it?  Abraham made a progression, which indicated the date when he will sleep 24 hours a day.  It turned out on November 27, 1754.  It was on that <span>day</span> that <span>the mathematician</span> died. </p>
