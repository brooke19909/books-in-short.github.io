Even under the empire of Rome, a theater was located on its territory, where they not only staged plays, but also raised important political topics. </p><h2>  Freedom Center </h2><p>  Subsequently, the place was taken by the nobility and the nobility.  On land, they built magnificent estates.  So, 36 towers belonging to the Uberti family were built.  Representatives of this genus were called gibellins.  They supported the emperor.  But in 1260, merchants, merchants and artisans - Guelphs, who condemned the ruler and promoted the power of the pope, broke all the buildings.  Since then, it was believed that this land is cursed and it is forbidden to build on it. </p>

    <h2>  New old palace </h2><p>  One of the most important objects is the house, which currently serves as the town hall.  This is the work of the Italian architect Arnolfo di Cambio.  The first stones were laid in 1298.  After completion of construction, the government of the communes (prior) occupied the construction.  Its representatives were the heads of workshops and manufactories.  They moved here from the Bargello building.  Therefore, the previous cloister began to be called the old palace, and the part of the building, where the windows face the Signoria square in Florence, is new. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  From the assessors went the first name.  The area in front of the building was called Priori Square. </p><p>  In the 15th century, the house was rewritten for della Signoria.  The transformation was caused by the fact that the ruling link declared itself lords.  But such a nickname lasted until 1540.  Then Cosimo I, a representative of the Medici line (oligarchic clan), settled in the palace.  The structure was dubbed the Palazzo Ducale, and the site under the walls - the square of the Grand Duke.  But the rich man did not like living here.  He soon moved.  The building, which was considered new, automatically became old, which is why it received the following name - the Palazzo Vecchio, which bears to this day. </p><h2>  Greek heroes in the art of Italy </h2><p>  Thousands of cities and squares survived revolutions and <span>important historical events.</span>  Florence, Piazza Signoria is no exception.  The sculptures, which the whole city is proud of, set as their goal not only to exalt fine art, but also to create a certain <span>associative series.</span>  The rulers who were going to decide the fate of the republic in the Palazzo Vecchio, had to tune in to justice. </p>

The honor of showing David to the world was in Signoria Square in Florence.  The photo of this marble man is the most popular among all pictures of works of stone and metal.

The demigod is located next to David, on the right side of the entrance to the palace, which separates the Signoria square in Florence from the city.  The plan of this composition is ambiguous. </p>

    <p>  The project brought popularity to Baccio Bandinelli.  After the author of David left the city, the championship in art was given to him.

    <h2>  Image of independence </h2><p>  One of the first statues that adorned Signoria Square in Florence (Italy) was the work of Donatello Judith with the Head of Holofernes.  The legend of the plot gained great popularity in the Renaissance.  The myth says that the army attacked the peaceful village.  One beauty decided to help her native land.  She changed into the best outfit and went to a military camp.  There, under the spell of Judith, the commander-in-chief of the army fell.  The couple retired, and when the commander fell asleep, the beauty killed him.  Thus, the village was saved.  In art, a brave maiden is portrayed with a severed head in her hand. </p><p>  Piazza della Signoria in Florence has the goal of conveying various ideas to the authorities.  The heroine has become a symbol of patriotism and independence.  At first it was intended for the Medici garden, where it was decorated with a fountain.  But in 1495 there was a coup, the oligarchs were overthrown.  The sculpture was stolen and put on the square.  When the rulers again headed the republic, everything that the people took was returned.  The only thing that was not taken back was Judith with the Head of Holofernes.  She became the embodiment of the struggle of the people against power. </p>

    <h2>  Two masters of one project </h2><p>  Another gem is the <span>Neptune Fountain.</span>  The author is Bartolomeo Ammanati, one of the most hardworking sculptors.  The year of birth of the pedestal is the 1570th.  The composition is located in the center and visually leads the Signoria square in Florence.  Interesting facts related to the statue make you smile.  At the opening, the audience was unpleasantly surprised by the work of the master.  Residents chanted: "Ammanati, Ammanati, how much marble has spent." </p><p>  The main character is the god of the oceans.  He leads a chariot drawn by sea horses. </p><p>  Complemented by the ensemble of Dzhambolony.  Bizarre creatures of bronze on the edge - his works. </p><p>  Daily fountain was used for domestic needs.  In 1720, authorities hung a sign on the wall of the palace, which can be seen today.  It said that from now on everyone who will wash, throw garbage or bathe in the fountain must pay a fine. </p>

    <p>  Italy is famous for carnivals.  Hosted by masks and the Signoria square in Florence.  So, in 1830, one of the statues (throwing a suit over) was stolen by vandals.  Her fate is still unknown.  Over the year, the city installed a copy in its place. </p>
