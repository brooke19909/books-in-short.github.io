In this case, the <span>Sennheiser</span> RS 170 wireless <span>headphones</span> will be the ideal solution. They will allow you to listen to music late at night so as not to disturb anyone.  Of course, models with wires give a better sound output, but sometimes the cable is not a very convenient element. </p><p>  The article will help determine whether it is worth buying these headphones, and also thanks to it you can deal with the negative and positive features of the described equipment.

    <h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Headphones are an indoor monitor and wireless device.  The impedance is 32 ohms, which is a normal indicator for playing music from a computer, phone or player.  The sensitivity of the Sennheiser RS ‚Äã‚Äã170 is 110 dB.  Headphones weigh a little - only 216 grams.  The sound is surround and clear.  There is practically no distortion, as the manufacturer claims. </p><h2>  Wireless connection </h2><p>  Sennheiser has long been standing on its feet in the headphone market.  The RS 170 model is powered by new technologies connected to the W1 IEM adapter.  Unlike other devices of this company, which were produced in the middle and upper class, with a closed and open design, they work most stably.  Previous models functioned due to FM signals, that is, radio communications, which did not allow far to move away from the adapters.  Thanks to this connection, it was possible to constantly listen to hissing, interference, and sound distortion.  Due to the improvement in wireless communications, the Sennheiser RS ‚Äã‚Äã170, which is reviewed in this article, does not have similar playback problems. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thanks to the use of bluetooth, it became possible to use cheap technologies that allow achieving improved performance.  This option is suitable for almost all consumers.  2.4 GHz technology is considered advanced.  The signal is transmitted in a compressed form, and this indicates that the composition is reproduced with maximum accuracy.  Due to the fact that the digital type module, interference and noise are eliminated to the maximum.  Thanks to this, you do not need to configure the device for too long. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sennheiser rs 170 headphones" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1529605.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  detailed information </h2><p>  The device Sennheiser RS ‚Äã‚Äã170 has a convenient and thoughtful design. The instruction in Russian will allow you to better familiarize yourself with all the details and determine the operating modes.  These headphones will not cause discomfort during prolonged use.  The cups are attached to the body for the light of two joints.  All of them join the headband.  Last adjustable.  Headphones fit snugly to the ears, so the sound insulation is at a good level.  At the same time, the ear pads are not made of hard material, due to which they do not press.  There is also padding around the headband.  The case is made of durable plastic. </p><p>  There are five buttons on the headphones that are responsible for volume, song switching, activation of operating modes (‚Äúsurround sound‚Äù, ‚Äúbass enhancement‚Äù, ‚Äúprocessing‚Äù).  The device is capable of changing the quality of reproduced tracks.  Thanks to 3D technology, they will sound many times better.  Due to this, the sound stage will become more accurate and deeper. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The transmitter for these headphones has been greatly modified.  He got a streamlined body with a pin at the top.  The device is capable of working with both 3.5 mm and 6.3 mm interface.  The use of an automatic transmitter is also allowed.  The latter is used for direct connection to an amplifier, player, console, TV or speaker systems. </p><p>  To maintain battery life, the manufacturer introduced the use of two AAA batteries.  For each cup, one must be purchased.  Charging time directly depends on the time period of use and the volume at which you watch TV or play music.  Testimonials from people make it clear that the batteries are holding well enough, but you can‚Äôt even indicate an approximate time ‚Äî in each case, your own.  When not using the device, you can always put it on charge. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sennheiser rs 170 wireless headphones" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1529603.jpg" width="487"></div>

    <h2>  Sound quality </h2><p>  At first, the sound quality is poor.  But after a certain interval, it becomes better.  The Sennheiser RS ‚Äã‚Äã170 headphones are useful in that you can do absolutely all the housework with them without dragging the player along.  The connection is quite strong, so there is no need to be afraid of a sudden break. </p><p>  During the first use, the device does not seem entirely successful: the bass is heard poorly, the notes are distorted, the high frequencies are too weak.  In order to achieve the maximum positive effect, you must use the <span>settings of the equalizer</span> or the device that sends the signal. </p><p>  The Sennheiser RS ‚Äã‚Äã170 can be used with a home theater system or other modern Hi-Fi systems. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sennheiser rs 170 reviews" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1529621.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  These headphones are different from others that are in the same price category.  With what?  Find out their advantages. </p><ul><li>  High-quality and reliable connection. </li><li>  The bass is strong and impressive. </li><li>  Good build quality. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sennheiser rs 170 headphones reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1529630.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Like other devices, Sennheiser RS ‚Äã‚Äã170 headphones, reviews of which can be read below, have their drawbacks.  There are few of them, but you need to know about them. </p><ul><li>  The slightly overpriced Sennheiser RS ‚Äã‚Äã170 (about 10 thousand rubles).  Most likely, the "cheating" is due to the fact that the model is wireless. </li><li>  The case has a middle class. </li></ul><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The acute question of buying headphones is in young families in which a child has recently appeared.  Because of this ‚Äúproblem‚Äù, it‚Äôs very difficult in the evening to relax by the TV or just relax to the pleasant music.  Especially if the couple lives in a one-room apartment.  In this case, you do not need to be lazy to go shopping for household appliances (if possible) and look for options for yourself.  Buyers in reviews do not recommend focusing on wired models.  A cable of three meters makes it difficult to move around the room, and they can be hooked and dropped an object, making too much noise. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sennheiser rs 170 review" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1529618.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  At one time, Sennheiser RS ‚Äã‚Äã170 headphones, reviews of which confirm the following fact, were almost the only ones on the market that could transmit a digital signal.  In addition, they received the function of surround sound and had a closed acoustic design. </p><p>  On the head, the device sits well.  Thick ear pads do not press on the skull, and also do not allow the headphones to slip.  For several hours of continuous use, pain from the device does not appear. </p><p>  Consumers claim that the sound of Sennheiser RS ‚Äã‚Äã170 earphones matches more expensive models.  The frequencies of different ranges are heard well, no complaints.  Basses are not very prominent, but they are not ‚Äúlost‚Äù either.  It is better not to listen to symphonic music, as some instruments can be heard poorly enough.  However, such problems are present in more expensive models. </p><p>  In order to easily control the headphones, you will have to get used to it a bit.  The volume button is not in a convenient place, so at first consumers turn off the headphones.  But after a couple of weeks of active use, the hands themselves get used to the arrangement. </p><p>  The quality of the assembly, construction and materials does not cause complaints.  In order to avoid various interference, the reviews recommend increasing the sound in the signal source.  And already adjust the volume on the device.  In this case, the signal will definitely not be interrupted.  In general, the headphones are good, and everyone who has ever dealt with them recommend them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sennheiser rs 170 instruction in Russian" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1529639.jpg" width="500"></div>
