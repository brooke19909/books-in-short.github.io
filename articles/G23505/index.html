The funeral ceremonies of some well-known criminal authorities and influential figures of the former Soviet Union will also be highlighted, as well as a little touch on their life and biography. </p><h2>  The funeral of criminal authorities </h2><p>  The dangerous nineties are long gone.  Since the late eighties and two thousandths, more than 250 thieves in law and more than a thousand criminal authorities have gone into a different world, not to mention the simple bandits who died in disassembly every day. </p><p>  Since many of these figures enjoyed great authority and respect in their circles, after their death, friends and relatives tried to identify the status and position in society of these people and perpetuate their memory.  Most of the monuments are installed on the most expensive sections of cemeteries.  The monuments depict not only the deceased themselves, but also the attributes and objects of their luxurious life.  There were even special private cemeteries for criminals like those located in Rakitki, near Moscow.  In the nineties, bandits bought up whole land so that after the death of the "boys" remained together. </p><h2>  Biography of Chubarov </h2><p>  One of the most pompous and striking monuments to business and crime figures, which in the nineties was considered an interconnected activity, is a monument to Boris Yakovlevich Chubarov.  There is little information about Chubarov, but it is known that he was an influential businessman who owned several profitable organizations.  Boris Chubarov is a criminal authority who had great influence and capabilities in criminal circles and was nicknamed "Borya Gazirovka."  Chubarov was given such a nickname due to the fact that he earned his first money from the sale of sparkling water.  In the early 90s, he also made a profit from urban slot machines. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, to find out the details of the biography of the authority of Boris Yakovlevich Chubarov is not possible.  The only thing known is the date of birth of Chubarov - July 2, 1946 and the date of death of the businessman - June 13, 2004.  In Novosibirsk, he contacted thieves in law and other representatives of crime.  According to unofficial data, a Novosibirsk businessman died of cirrhosis.  According to rumors, the monument was erected by his own son, who now runs the business of his late father.  This monument is a tribute to the deceased. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="authority of Chubarov Boris Yakovlevich" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63800/2145588.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Criminal authority business </h2><p>  From open sources you can find out that Boris Chubarov was officially the founder and director of the large Liner-2 limited liability company, whose sphere of interests included the <span>hotel and restaurant business.</span>  <span>Restaurants</span> owned by Chubarov were famous and popular in Novosibirsk. </p><p>  Also, the authority owned a network of bars and various drinking establishments.  The most stable and largest profit Chubarov brought hotel business in Novosibirsk.  The authorized capital of LLC Liner-2 amounted to more than forty million rubles.  However, many people in the city know that Boris Yakovlevich Chubarov was a criminal authority who was respected in certain circles and could solve many issues.  Of course, his criminal connections helped in promoting his rather profitable business. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Monument to Chubarov Boris Yakovlevich </h2><p>  In the center of the Kleshchikhinsky cemetery in Novosibirsk, among the very close simple grave fences and tombstones, which almost no one watches, you can find a spacious plot, clearly divided into sectors.  Immediately you can pay attention to the huge size of the tombstone, on which a cross is installed, perfectly distinguishable against the sky.  This is rarely seen, it is a monument to the authority of Chubarov Boris Yakovlevich.  In Novosibirsk, such monuments on graves are not very common.  This style can be called the cemetery "aesthetics of the new Russians."  The sculpture is quite large and overly pathos.  The grave of authority stands out against the background of simple gravestones, which are often not looked after by anyone. </p><p>  There are legends about the monument on the grave of authority of Boris Yakovlevich Chubarov in Novosibirsk.  Everyone who saw this monument was interested in who the director of the hotel and restaurant complex was. </p><p>  Monument to authority Chubarov Boris Yakovlevich in the photo is presented below. </p>

    <p>  In the sculpture itself there are no frills - there is a man with a stern expression on his face, a little overweight, his tie went astray to the left.  It looks very realistic.  A Mercedes from a huge piece of granite looks like a real one.  Apparently, it was the deceased's favorite car brand.  There are no pompous epitaphs on the tombstone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chubarov Boris Yakovlevich authority biography" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63800/2145581.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  According to reviews of authority by Boris Yakovlevich Chubarov, he was a very respected person in the business community of the city.  Many people are interested in knowing who the man was, on whose grave there is the most noticeable monument at Kleschikhinsky cemetery in Novosibirsk.  The unusual nature of the monument attracts the eyes of people who come to visit the departed. </p><h2>  Chubarov family </h2><p>  According to official information, Chubarov lived with his family in the city of Novosibirsk throughout his life.  His wife, <span>Tatyana</span> Vladimirovna <span>Chubarova</span> , was born on September 18, 1951.  According to official documents is an individual entrepreneur.  After marriage, they lived on Sorge Street, apt.  178. The family has two children: a son and a daughter.  My son‚Äôs name is Leo, born on October 15, 1971, and also lives in Novosibirsk.  Daughter - Evgenia Borisovna, was born on July 2, 1980.  Both Leo and Eugene are engaged in business and are registered as individual entrepreneurs.  The field of activity of Chubarov‚Äôs daughter is health services and trade.  The son manages the hotel and restaurant complex of the late father "Liner-2", several large LLCs are registered for him.  Thus, all representatives of the Chubarov family are entrepreneurs in the service sector. </p><h2>  Crime of the nineties </h2><p>  The collapse of the Soviet Union led to dire consequences for the younger generation, which in the early nineties had to decide on their priorities and values ‚Äã‚Äãin life.  After the collapse of a huge state in the former republics of the Union, catastrophic difficulties arose in the economy at the same time.  Young people had no prospects of obtaining jobs officially from the state.  In such difficult conditions, young people themselves had to choose their sources of income in order to feed themselves and their family.  At that time, becoming a wealthy man by legal means was almost impossible. </p><h2>  The fate of the bandits </h2><p>  The group included young men who were accustomed to relying solely on forceful methods in resolving all business issues, living according to special criminal "concepts."  During the period of the active phase of their activity, the participants in the organized crime group became known for their cruelty, compared with which modern representatives of organized crime behave more adequately.  Gang fights on city streets, the abduction of influential businessmen, extortion, misappropriation of another's business, contract killings, torture against businessmen and their families - all these terrible events for the nineties were quite commonplace. </p><h2>  Grandfather Hassan's funeral - how it went </h2><p>  The last grandiose funeral of criminal authority took place in Moscow at the Khovansky cemetery, when they said goodbye to the influential thief in law Aslan Usoyan, nicknamed Ded Hassan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chubarov Boris Yakovlevich authority monument" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63800/2147058.jpg"></div>

    <p>  It was a large funeral, attended by at least one and a half thousand people.  In general, the ceremony was pathos and solemn, as required by the position of the deceased - an authoritative thief in law.  Aslan Usoyan was lying in a luxury coffin, which is varnished and made of mahogany.  Thanks to the efforts of make-up artists, a terrifying wound on the face left by the killer‚Äôs bullet, almost imperceptibly.  An old man in a papakha, who probably knows the religious and national traditions of the Yezidis, to whom the authority Aslan Usoyan belonged, led the ceremony at the Khovansky cemetery. </p>

    <p>  It is impossible to get an ordinary person.  But the influential friends of Ivankov discovered the grave of his mother, so the authorities of the capital gave permission for the burial of Jap.  The funeral was attended by hundreds of criminal authorities and thieves.  He also erected a chic monument on the grave. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crime boss Chubarov Boris Yakovlevich" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63800/2145592.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Graves and monuments of criminal authorities stand out noticeably against the background of old, groomed fences and graves of ordinary people.  Authorities even after their funeral are especially respectful.  In cemeteries, they get only VIP places: on the central aisle or at the very entrance to the cemetery.  Some monuments have special lighting, even in winter you will not see either snow or rust, and in summer everything is laid with fresh flowers.  An example of this is a monument on the grave of authority to Chubarov Boris Yakovlevich. </p>
