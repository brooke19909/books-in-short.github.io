According to one of the guests, it is simply impossible to go hungry from here, because each portion is simply amazing in its size.  Despite the mass of satisfied customers, there are Pavlin guests who are not quite satisfied with the quality of service.  Claims primarily relate to musical accompaniment.  According to the guests, it is equal to zero here.  The restaurant‚Äôs musician is so negative about his work and the music in general, that it seriously affects the mood of the guests.  The guest also noted that the musical equipment here is also not very high quality.  As a result, a pleasant evening was spoiled by a discontented musician and illegible music. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vse-cafe.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cafe peacock bryansk airport" class="if uuid-2588681" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44442/2588681.jpg"></div><h2>  Contacts </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="53.2723925" data-lng="34.31619599999999" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="15"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/5/0/5/8/5058.png"></div><p>  There is a cafe "Peacock" in Bryansk at "Aeropark".
