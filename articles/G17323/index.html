    <h2>  Ecological situation </h2><p>  For the construction of his project in Volgograd - "European Park" - the developer chose the most favorable region from the point of view of the environmental situation.  The complex is located at a distance of about 15 km from the city center.  There are no industrial enterprises near it.  On the contrary, it is surrounded by a green mass of trees.  And at a distance of about 1 km, the wide Volga River flows, on the banks of which it is so good to relax on a hot day or take a walk in the evening. </p><h2>  Infrastructure: internal and external </h2><p>  The new building of Volgograd - "Park Evropeysky" - under the project is provided as a "city in the city."  All the infrastructure necessary for life will be located on the first non-residential floors of houses: shops, pharmacies, beauty salons, leisure centers.  After a busy day, it‚Äôs good to stroll along specially equipped walking paths, sit on benches, and watch the children play in new children's and sports grounds. </p><p>  The project does not include either a school or a kindergarten.  But this is not necessary, since such educational and educational institutions are present in large numbers in walking distance from the "European Park" in Volgograd.  Children of the residents of the complex will be where to study and play sports.  They will also be able to access the nearest pool. </p><p>  Close enough are several large shopping centers and hypermarkets.  School graduates can continue their education at the next educational institution of the next level.  Also quite close are medical facilities, resorts, cardiology and perinatal centers. </p><h2>  Apartments: layout and cost </h2><p>  As already noted, the "European Park" in Volgograd presents an apartment in a wide variety.  There are one, two and three rooms.  Their area also varies.  Each person and each family will be able to find suitable housing for themselves according to their desire and budget size.  There are very small apartments - only 21 m <sup>2</sup> .  There are also large ones with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã91 m <sup>2</sup> . </p><p>  They are surrendered by the developer with the completion of finishing, that is, glued wallpaper, installed plumbing, interior doors and flooring.  This helps to significantly save the money of buyers, who, as a rule, are mainly invested in the purchase of real estate. </p><p>  As for the cost of one square meter of living space, it is quite acceptable.  It starts with about 26 thousand and ends with 50 thousand. Thus, a little more than 1 million rubles will have to be paid for a one-room apartment.  A two-room apartment will cost a little more - about 1.5 million rubles. </p><h2>  Reviews about the complex </h2><p>  Reviews about the "European Park" in Volgograd were divided into two unequal parts.  In the first group, significantly larger than the second, negative reviews.  They relate to too long construction periods, because of which many people were nervous, lost part of the payments they were due to, collected rallies and forums of dissatisfied people.  Many apartment buyers do not like the layout and footage.  In their opinion, the apartments are very small and resemble Khrushchev‚Äôs.  Also, many interest holders are dissatisfied with the repair performed by the developer.  Many are already redoing it according to their ideas and desires. </p>

    <p>  Positive reviews are mainly related to the location of the residential complex: near the Volga River, away from the noisy city, industrial enterprises.  People have a place to rest, swim in the hot summer.  In this case, you do not need to go somewhere, just walk a few meters.  And the ecological environment plays an important role, especially for families with small children. </p>
