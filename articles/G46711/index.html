You can make a flowering tree yourself, using various techniques to make flowers, leaves, a tree trunk and branches.  Using even the simplest patterns for weaving flowers and leaves, you can achieve that the finished composition looks spectacular and rich. </p><h2>  What materials are needed to make sakura </h2><p>  To create a beautiful product from beads, you should be patient, spend a lot of time and prepare the necessary materials.  Do-it-yourself sakura is created from beads using the minimum amount of material: </p><ul><li>  Glass beads with a painted center in pink. </li><li>  Copper wire of larger and smaller diameter. </li><li>  Wire cutters or scissors. </li><li>  Auxiliary materials for additional decoration. </li></ul><p>  The presented set is used exclusively for weaving flowers.  The barrel can be made from various types of materials: wire, paper, tree branches.  For decoration use threads, ribbons, polymer clay. </p><p>  To complete the work quickly and efficiently, it is worth preparing the workplace correctly.  It is better to choose a table that is well lit and covered with a tissue napkin.  For beads, it is advisable to choose convenient containers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="moziru.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rough sketch of a tree" class="if uuid-2557370" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2557370.jpg"></div><h2>  Proper preparation </h2><p>  To make the blossoming Japanese <span>cherry from beads</span> not bring inconvenience, it is worth making the appropriate preparation.  It consists of several elementary stages: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  First, you should buy materials and prepare a workplace. </li><li>  In order not to get lost in the process of making the composition, it is worth considering the design and draw a sketch. </li><li>  Choose a pattern for weaving flowers, sheets and buds.  Try to make one element to evaluate your skill level. </li><li>  Make a tree base - a trunk.  Outline the location and density of branches. </li><li>  Make one branch and try on a future tree.  If everything suits you, then you can continue to work. </li></ol><p>  Sakura from beads will be made much faster if you make a conditional schedule that indicates the allotted time for work.  Some craftswomen do not need a schedule, but with a large workload, the distribution of time by the clock will not hurt. </p><h2>  Flower making </h2><p>  Weaving a sakura flower can be done in several ways, since the patterns for an element can be radically different.  For those who have never been involved in this business, we offer a detailed written guide to the work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tolko-poleznoe.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="weaving pattern" class="if uuid-2557375" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2557375.jpg"></div><p>  Weaving with a step-by-step photo of sakura beads is sometimes used if some moments are incomprehensible or confusing.  The simplest option for weaving a sakura flower is this: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Cut a piece of wire about 1 meter long.  On the one hand, bend 20 centimeters of wire. </li><li>  String five beads on a wire.  Pass the wire through the last bead to form a ring.  It should be located at a distance of 1.5 centimeters from the bend of the wire. </li><li>  Form 10 more such rings at a distance of 1.5 centimeters between them.  Bend the wire so that the sixth circle is in the middle of the weave. </li><li>  Screw the wire at the base.  So a flower is formed with part of the branch. </li></ol><p>  You can create large flowers.  Each element will consist of several petals of the correct form.  Sometimes several bead weaving techniques are combined in one composition. </p><h2>  What elements can complement the product </h2><p>  You can visually revive a tree using additional elements from beads in the process of composition formation.  In nature, blooming sakura has no leaves, but it‚Äôs worth adding a little color to the beadwork.  To do this, imitated leaves of green beads. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sakura with additional elements" class="if uuid-2557383" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2557383.jpg"></div><p>  Leaflets can be made as follows: </p><ul><li>  Cut wire 10 centimeters long. </li><li>  String three green beads. </li><li>  Pass the wire through the extreme. </li><li>  Get a petal from a triangular shape. </li></ul><p>  If the flowers will have a clear shape, and their number will be small, then several buds can be made.  The buds are made on the basis of tight weaving.  Photo of sakura from beads, where auxiliary elements are used, look much more attractive than the usual composition of flowers only.  But you need to work longer. </p><h2>  Algorithm for assembling branches of flowers </h2><p>  Talking about how to make sakura from beads, you need to mention the desired splendor of the product.  Harvesting a certain number of flowers, leaves and buds is necessary, depending on the preferred density of branches.  You should definitely consider their appearance.  Flowering branches can descend in tiers or be erect. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sprig of sakura" class="if uuid-2557378" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2557378.jpg"></div><p>  At a distance of 1.5-2 centimeters, flower blanks are woven together and attached to the base.  As a result, a full-fledged branch is formed, into which several opening flowers or buds are woven.  To dilute the pink color, it is worth adding a few leaves. </p><p>  You need to attach branches with flowers to the trunk well, as they can fall off under the weight of the beads.  Fixing is duplicated with a glue gun.  a more complex option is fastening in non-hardened polymer clay. </p><h2>  Methods of forming a complete composition </h2><p>  When the branches are formed, you can begin to fix the finished elements to the trunk.  The barrel itself can be made as follows: </p><ol><li>  Make a rigid base of wire or cut a branch from a tree. </li><li>  The wire base can be wrapped in satin ribbon.  If the bark of the branch is beautiful, then it is enough to open it with varnish. </li><li>  Flowering branches are attached to the branches of the main trunk. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="minskis.deviantart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="barrel manufacturing option" class="if uuid-2557376" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2557376.jpg"></div><p>  In order for the sakura from beads to be a composition that resembles a bonsai, you need to consider the method of fixing the tree in an upright position.  For this, a container is decorated.  If there is no time to make a container, you should buy a clay pot, which will be proportional to the size of the tree. </p><p>  To attach blooming sakura from beads, sea stones are used to fill the container.  Sometimes the basis is sand or soil, which is decorated with shells, gravel, beads, artificial grass. </p><h2>  Secrets about making a composition </h2><p>  To create a unique composition that will be distinguished by aesthetics and attractiveness, it is worth knowing a few basic weaving.  This will help to avoid frequent errors in the manufacture of the product: </p><ul><li>  To make the flowers more vibrant, it is worth using several shades of pink in the weaving process.  Mix bugles from several packs in one container.  In the process of weaving, colors are chosen randomly. </li><li>  For leaves, a color is selected that will be in the same contrast band with a hue of colors. </li><li>  Leaves should not be too many so that they do not muffle the beauty of flowering Japanese cherry. </li><li>  If, after assembly, the composition seems incomplete, then additional leaves, flowers and buds can be attached with a glue gun. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.kr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="full composition with sakura from beads" class="if uuid-2557377" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2557377.jpg"></div><p>  Bead Sakura for beginners can be a difficult project.  In order for the final result to be good, you need to adhere to the instructions for manufacturing and assembly.  Given the tips, it‚Äôs easy to avoid annoying mistakes. </p><h2>  The simplest scheme for creating blooming sakura </h2><p>  Sakura from beads can weave in different patterns.  For beginners, it‚Äôs worth choosing simple options.  If you correctly arrange all the elements in one composition, you get a beautiful tree. </p><p>  A popular option is to weave branches that resemble a sprig of fern.  For this, several rings are formed on one section of the wire.  By twisting, a branch is formed where the element ends with a ring, and the rest are opposite each other. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="interesting sakura design" class="if uuid-2557381" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2557381.jpg"></div><p>  Several of these twigs twist together, but at different levels.  A large branch is formed, which is then attached to the trunk.  The crown can be raised up or down - it all depends on the imagination of the needlewoman and the general idea. </p><p>  There are options for the lazy, using which, you can do without weaving.  It is enough to make a trunk with branches on which large beads or pink coins will be attached.  Location should be chaotic. </p>
