The cruiser "Dmitry Donskoy": project 65</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Various modern historians investigate the nature, background and consequences of the unrest that took place in Soviet times.  Meanwhile, there is still a huge amount of outstanding information.  In a number of sources, for example, the cruiser Dmitry Donskoy appears.  1955 dates from the uprising on the ship.  According to the records, it was brutally suppressed. </p><h2>  Reality and distorted facts </h2><p>  The level of secrecy in the Soviet years was very high.  In this regard, there is not enough concrete information about the uprising.  Moreover, the consequences of the event are different.  For example, you can find such entries: </p><ul><li>  In Vladivostok, the uprising swept the Soviet cruiser Dmitry Donskoy.  The unrest was suppressed. </li><li>  The uprising was cruelly suppressed in the Pacific Fleet (cruiser Dmitry Donskoy, 1955, Vladivostok).  More than 50 people were shot. </li></ul>

    <p>  A more detailed study of this information pops up a lot of questions.  Difficulties in establishing the truth arise due to the fact that many information was disseminated with significant distortions.  Meanwhile, other sources said that the Soviet cruiser Dmitry Donskoy was absent in Vladivostok on the indicated date.  The ship was listed in the Pacific Fleet, but at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries.  According to the factory records, on August 31, 1951, the cruiser Dmitry Donskoy was enlisted in the Navy.  The USSR at that time was solving the problem of enlarging the fleet.  In April 1953, the ship was laid at the plant them.  A. Marty, in Leningrad.  At the end of September of the specified year, he was given the new name Vladivostok.  In autumn, he was launched and towed to pontoons to Severodvinsk.  September 2, 1959 the cruiser was removed from construction and excluded from the lists of the Navy with technical readiness of 28.8%.  Thus, there could not be a ship in Vladivostok. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Prerequisites for the construction </h2><p>  As mentioned above, after the completion of World War II, the country's leadership set the task of replenishing the fleet.  In accordance with the order of the People's Commissar of the Navy, a commission was formed in early 1945.  She was engaged in the preparation of materials on the main characteristics and type of future ships.  Based on the results of the commission‚Äôs work at the General Staff, plans were developed for a ten-year period.  In accordance with them, by 1955, the following should be present in the fleet: </p><ol><li>  Squadron aircraft carriers in the amount of 6 units. </li><li>  Destroyers - 358 units. </li><li>  Battleships - four units. </li><li>  Small aircraft carriers - 6 units. </li><li>  Heavy cruisers (40 units).  Of these, equipped with 220 mm (10 units) and 180 mm (30 units) guns GK. </li><li>  Submarines - about 500 units. </li><li>  Light cruisers with 152 mm guns GK - 54 units. </li></ol><p>  Such a number of ships suggested the effective use of naval forces in open and closed waters.  Despite the lack of production and financial resources, the logic in this regard was obvious.  With its implementation, the capacity of the domestic fleet would exceed the performance of <span>the British Navy.</span>  By its strength, he would take second, and by the number of submarines - first place.  The plan took into account military experience.  It was supposed to build fewer battleships in comparison with the pre-war period.  In addition, aircraft carriers were included as an integral element of the Navy. </p><h2>  Plan changes </h2><p>  On October 27, 1945, a meeting was held in the Kremlin.  It turned out that Comrade  Stalin had his own views on the further development of the forces of the Navy.  In particular, he proposed to significantly reduce the number of battleships, and increase the number of heavy ships by increasing their main guns to 305 mm.  Stalin considered it inappropriate to build aircraft carriers in the next decade.  He did not see the need for the creation of cruisers with 180 mm guns.  Along with this, Stalin agreed to the construction of light ships in the maximum quantity.  The final program was approved after discussing the proposals of the head of the country.  The new plan involved the construction of: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Heavy cruisers - 4 units. </li><li>  Destroyers - 188 units. </li><li>  Light cruisers - 20 units. </li><li>  Submarines - 367 units. </li></ol><p>  The plan also provided for the laying of two battleships.  The exclusion of aircraft carriers from the program was due to the unavailability of domestic industry.  The new plan acted as a continuation of the prewar.  In this case, the main emphasis was on the construction of large artillery ships.  This was not consistent with the experience of the recent war. </p><h2>  Development </h2><p>  In accordance with the order of the People's Commissar Kuznetsov, in the autumn of 1943, the development of a project of a new type of light cruiser began.  In September, the first edition was approved.  Unlike project 68, the armament was doubled by 137-mm and 100-mm anti-aircraft artillery.  In addition, new sonar and radar instruments were introduced.  According to the plan, it was planned to replace torpedo three-tube devices with five-tube ones, and to install 4 bomb launchers.  As for the cruising range, it was supposed to be 8 thousand miles.  The maximum speed was planned at 35 knots.  The standard displacement in this case should not have been higher than 10 thousand tons. </p><h2>  Second edition </h2><p>  According to the plan for 1946-1955, it was supposed to create 30 and lay 4 light cruisers.  Initially, several stages of the implementation of the task were provided.  First of all, it was planned to complete the construction of 5 ships under the 68-K project, then it was planned to build 7 cruisers under the 68-bis project.  After that, it was planned to start creating a new series.  Among them was the cruiser Dmitry Donskoy.  Project 65 suggested better speed, less displacement.  It was planned to equip the ships with new power plants.  In 1945, an operational-technical task was issued.  Savichev was chosen as the chief designer.  Among the new requirements was a change in the composition of artillery anti-aircraft weapons.  Instead of the 37 mm twin 12 guns, it was planned to install four quad 45 mm and 4-6 twin 25 mm submachine guns.  The plan was to strengthen the reservation and reduce the displacement to 8-8.5 thousand tons.  As one of the requirements was general stabilization for the use of weapons in conditions of 8-point unrest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Soviet cruiser Dmitry Donskoy" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1239322.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Difficulties </h2><p>  Before the construction of such a giant as the cruiser Dmitry Donskoy began, project 65 underwent many changes.  In total, about 40 of its options were proposed.  For some of them, the displacement was 13.5-15 thousand tons.  In fact, these indicators corresponded to the parameters of large light cruisers.  After some time, the pre-sketch development was suspended due to the problem of determining the proper technical appearance of the ship.  It was supposed to have qualitative differences from its predecessors with an acceptable displacement of no more than 15 thousand tons. According to the proposal of TsKB-17, the project was completed in two versions.  By order of Stalin, however, in 1947, work was stopped.  The efforts of the developers reoriented to plans 82 and 68 bis. </p><h2>  The cruiser "Dmitry Donskoy": project </h2><p>  In March 1949, work on the sketch ended at PPM-17.  Without waiting for government approval, the designers began technical design.  But in the fall, Stalin proposed increasing the speed of the ship to 35 knots and reducing the displacement to 36 thousand tons. In accordance with this, a project was developed as soon as possible in the pulp and paper mill.  Until the end of the year, work on it was completed.  During the process, the power of the power plant had to be increased by 30%, the composition of anti-aircraft and universal artillery was changed, vertical reservation was reduced, etc. Due to the increase in the speed of Project 82 ships, it became necessary to build light cruisers.  In October 1950, an operational-tactical mission was received.  In accordance with it, it was planned to build a light cruiser 65 of the project, the speed of which was supposed to be 35-36 knots.  For subsequent work, 2 options were approved with different weapons, displacement and armor.  The pre-sketch design was completed in 1951.  But further work was not carried out. </p><h2>  Modification </h2><p>  March 16, 1976, the heavy cruiser "Dmitry Donskoy" was included in the ships of the Navy.  In December 1982, he was transferred to Zapadnaya Litsa from Severodvinsk.  In mid-September 1989, the ship moved back.  The Sevmash enterprise was modernized and overhauled.  At the end of June 2002, the cruiser Dmitry Donskoy successfully passed the test.  According to their results, he was again enrolled in the Northern Fleet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="submarine Dmitry Donskoy" class="if" height="256" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1239323.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Underwater cruiser "Dmitry Donskoy": photo, general description </h2><p>  The ship was one of 6 built and the only remaining in service.  He performed the role of a kind of bridge between nuclear ships of the 3rd and 4th generations.  The cruiser Dmitry Donskoy was equipped with the new Bulava complex.  It was on this ship that an arms test took place.  Missile cruiser "Dmitry Donskoy" is considered the largest in the world.  Its total displacement is 49.8 thousand tons. The ship is 172 m long and 23.3 wide.  The nuclear submarine cruiser "Dmitry Donskoy" is capable of carrying 20 3-stage ICBMs, the starting mass of which is 90 tons in 1996-1997.  due to lack of funds, three ships of the same series, which served only 12-13 years, were withdrawn from the Navy.  Two more - TK-20 and TK-17 (Severstal and Arkhangelsk) remain in service.  The main ship in this series is the nuclear-powered cruiser Dmitry Donskoy.  For over 10 years, he was under repair at the Sevmash enterprise.  Here he went through re-equipment and modernization. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Underwater cruiser Dmitry Donskoy photo" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1239324.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Armament </h2><p>  Initially, it was planned to install the Bark complex on the Dmitry Donskoy submarine cruiser.  It was designed in KB them.  Makeeva.  The complex included missiles with warheads of a separable type.  They should have been equipped with an inertial-satellite guidance system.  It provided greater accuracy.  But four tests of the complex were unsuccessful.  In this regard, the composition of the arms was revised.  As a result, it was decided to install the Bulava-30 complex, made by the Moscow Institute of Heat Engineering, on the Dmitry Donskoy armored cruiser.  He was supposed to have significant superiority over the American counterpart "Trident II". </p><h2>  Completion of work </h2><p>  In 2008, the bulk of the planned activities for the conversion of the ship was completed.  In December 2004, the act of completion of sea trials was signed.  In accordance with the approved program, test launches of Bulava missiles were carried out from the cruiser.  Currently, the ship is serving as part of the Navy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1239325.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Historical background: the original plan </h2><p>  Vice Admiral A.A. Popov acted as the founder of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbuilding an ocean cruiser.  He commanded a detachment of corvettes and clippers.  The experience that was gained during the creation of the first armored cruisers with metal hulls and the alteration of the Minin ship, he embodied in two versions.  Along with this, Popov requested a description of the qualities of the latter from Admiral Aslanbegov.  The essence of all the proposals that were collected were summarized as follows: </p><ol><li>  The artillery on the ship should have a larger caliber, but installed in a smaller quantity. </li><li>  The cruiser must be made in the form of a frigate, not a corvette.  It must have a sealed battery. </li><li>  It is necessary to increase the dimensions: length up to 91.5 m, width - up to 17.1 m. </li><li>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãmust be increased to 16-17 knots. </li><li>  Power must be increased to 1000 nominal liters.  from. </li><li>  The number of torpedo tubes must be reduced to four. </li><li>  Double Mars Rey should be discarded. </li><li>  Coal stock should be increased to 1.2 thousand tons. </li></ol><p>  Using his high position, Popov achieved approval of projects without their coordination with the chairman of the technical committee.  In early March 1880, Lieutenant Colonel Samoilov was appointed the builder of the ship.  Captain Potapov became his assistant.  At the end of May, preparatory work began, an order for materials was sent.  Since December 18, Kuteinikov became a builder.  March 28, 1881 the cruiser received its name "Dmitry Donskoy."  The ceremony of its official laying took place on May 9. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="armored cruiser Dmitry Donskoy" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1239320.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Some facts of construction </h2><p>  Steering steam drive was installed on the <span>battle cruiser</span> Dmitry Donskoy.  Suddenly, he fit him in size.  The helm was placed aft (by tradition).  A machine telegraph was installed on the front bridge.  To create the necessary working conditions for a screw in free water, a special tiller of "parallelogram motion" was invented.  It was a rather complicated technological task.  But she was resolved. </p><h2>  Test </h2><p>  The cruiser Dmitry Donskoy was launched on August 18, 1883.  During the final stage of the work, bureaucratic difficulties arose due to conflicts between the two state ports.  As a result, the events lasted for 2 years.  In May 1885, tests and acceptance of technical equipment, mine weapons and artillery began on board.  Until August, the cruiser Dmitry Donskoy went to sea only three times.  Its average speed was 16.16 knots, and the power of cars was 5972 liters.  from. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  In the fall of 1885, the cruiser went to the Mediterranean Sea.  For two years he led a special detachment there.  In 1887, the ship was included in the Pacific Squadron, commanded by <span>Rear Admiral Kornilov.</span>  By May 1889, the Donskoy returned to Kronstadt.  Here he underwent a small re-equipment and on September 21, 1891 went out again to the Mediterranean Sea.  Here he led a detachment of Zabiyaka clipper, Minin frigate and Uralets <span>gunboat</span> .  In March 1892, the detachment was disbanded.  The cruiser "Dm. Donskoy" was sent through the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãMarmara to Constantinople and further to the Black Sea.  Since July 1892, the ship was based in Vladivostok.  Here he was the main force of the squadron.  In February of the following year, the ship left for Port Said.  Here, Captain Hessen was to be replaced by N. A. Zelenaya.  The cruiser was to lead the Russian squad invited by the American government to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the discovery of America.  March 16th began swimming.  Due to the unsuccessful picture of the winds, the Donskoy was late for the collection of ships and immediately entered New York.  In September, he returned to his homeland.  His boilers and machines were seriously worn out and required immediate repair.  By 1894, the work was completed.  In 1895, artillery was replaced on the cruiser with Kane's ammunition.  By October 29, 1895, all tests were completed.  The cruiser "Donskoy" went to the Mediterranean Sea with the "Rurik".  At that time, a conflict began over the Black Sea straits.  February 14, 1896 the ships were sent to the Far East.  On April 9, they entered Nagasaki.  This period of service lasted for 6 years.  In 1900, Donskoy took part in the maneuvers of the army and navy near Port Arthur, which subsequently went into a real battle. </p><p>  On December 12, 1901, the ship returned to Kronstadt.  Here he was re-equipped for the Pacific squadron.  In particular, 6 out of ten 120-mm guns were replaced with 75-mm weapons.  In 1903, the <span>cruiser Almaz</span> and Donskoy were to accompany a detachment of destroyers.  However, the training camp lasted longer than planned, and the ship joined a separate detachment commanded by Rear Admiral Virenius.  At the initial stage of the war, he was able to pass only the Red Sea and received an order to return. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="missile cruiser Dmitry Donskoy" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1239321.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Tsushima battle </h2><p>  The cruiser Dmitry Donskoy was included in the 2nd Pacific Squadron in 1904.  <span>Captain 1st rank</span> Lebedev commanded the ship.  Having traveled with the squadron around the metro station of Good Hope, on May 14, 1905, he joined the battle under the flag of Rear Admiral Enquist in the Korea Strait.  During the battle, at one point, the cruisers ‚ÄúVl. Monomakh‚Äù and ‚ÄúDm. Donskoy‚Äù covered their Aurora with their sides, which had lost control.  Moreover, they themselves were under fire from Japanese shells.  Russian cruisers were able to damage several Japanese ships.  At this time, the high-speed ‚ÄúPearl‚Äù, ‚ÄúOleg‚Äù and the repaired ‚ÄúAurora‚Äù left the battle, developing maximum speed.  As a result, the slow-moving Donskoy was left alone.  Managing to avoid mine attacks, the ship waited for the night and with a nine-node move with extinguished lights went to Vladivostok. </p><p> Of all the cruisers of the 1st rank, only the Donskoy was able to come closest to the ultimate goal of navigation.  About.  Even for a long time, he stopped to withdraw the command from the destroyer "Violent" going down to the bottom.  At that time, the fast-moving ships of Japan appeared on the horizon: Tsushima, Niitaka, Otava, Akashi, Takachiho and Naniva.  In addition to them, 4 destroyers were approaching the Donskoy.  They quickly took a lone ship into the environment.  The Russian command refused to surrender and continued to fire on two sides.  The cruiser team managed to knock down 2 enemy ships (Otava and Naniva).  But the ship itself could not go any further.  He suffered such damage that the pumps could not cope with the water entering through the holes.  At night, the crew and its mortally wounded commander were transported to the island.  By morning, the cruiser Dmitry Donskoy sank without releasing its flag.  Ivan Nikolaevich Lebedev died a few days later in Japanese captivity. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  As you can see, the fate of the ship is quite complicated.  In fact, he received a rebirth at the turn of the 20-21 centuries.  However, the lack of funding made it difficult to restore it.  Therefore, it was launched almost ten years later.  Unfortunately, inaccurate information is often found in various sources.  However, a number of historians are actively researching and clarifying the facts.  Today, the cruiser is the largest missile carrier in the world.  It is significantly modified, it has the latest weapons and equipment.  The ship passed all the necessary tests and is serving in the ranks of the Navy. </p>
