According to experts, living matter is one of the most ‚Äúpowerful‚Äù earth geochemical forces.  It develops at the intersection of the hydrosphere, lithosphere and atmosphere.  Under adverse conditions, life processes stop or slow down to such an extent that there are no visible manifestations of life.  Thus, the state of suspended animation develops. </p><p>  Living matter has its own specific characteristics. </p><p>  First of all, it is characterized by a huge amount of free energy.  In an inorganic world, short-lived lava flows that have not yet had time to congeal can be equated with living matter (in terms of energy). </p><p>  One of the main features is the <span>speed of chemical reactions.</span>  They in living matter, unlike inanimate matter, proceed thousands of times faster. </p><p>  A distinctive feature is the composition.  Living matter includes independent compounds (enzymes, proteins, and others).  These chemical compounds show stability only under favorable conditions.  To a large extent, this feature is also characteristic of mineral components. </p><p>  Living matter makes an arbitrary movement.  V.I. Vernadsky, believing that this movement is largely self-regulating, singled out two of its special forms.  Passive is formed through reproduction and is inherent in both plants and animals.  The directed movement of organisms (characteristic more for animals than for plants) creates an active form of movement.  Living matter is also distinguished by the desire to fill the whole space. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A characteristic feature is the great chemical and morphological diversity.  Living matter, unlike inanimate, cannot be only a liquid or gaseous medium. </p><p>  In nature, there are dispersed bodies - individual organisms.  They make up living matter.  Moreover, it is not on the planet in one morphologically pure form - in the form of populations of organisms representing one species - it always represents biocenoses. </p><p>  The continuity of the alternation of generations provides a genetic connection of modern living matter with what existed in past eras.  In this case, a characteristic feature is the evolutionary process.  In other words, reproduction is carried out not by the principle of absolute copying of past generations, but by biochemical and morphological changes. </p><p>  There are five main functions of living matter. </p><ol><li>  The energy function is the absorption of solar energy during photosynthesis, and the decomposition of saturated substances - the absorption of chemical energy. </li><li>  During the life of certain species, selective accumulation occurs.  This function is called concentration.  It can be carried out by a massive increase in the concentration of components in the medium or by the specific accumulation of one or another element, regardless of the medium. </li><li>  The destructive function is the mineralization of abiogenic organic substances, the decomposition of inanimate inorganic products, and the involvement of the formed components in the biological cycle. </li><li>  The environment-forming function is the conversion of physical and chemical parameters of the environment. </li><li>  Due to food interactions, a significant mass of elements moves in the horizontal direction and against <span>gravity.</span>  Thus, the transport function is performed. </li></ol>
