    <p>  When calculating the payment, the amount that the taxpayer spent on treatment is taken as a basis.  The deduction is calculated at a rate of 13% of the indicated amount.  The maximum payout limit is limited to the amount actually paid.  If a person had several expenses for which a deduction is provided, he himself decides which of them to inform the Federal Tax Service. </p><p>  The maximum amount of deduction is 120 thousand rubles.  The specified restriction applies to all types of payments (pension contributions, training).  Costs that exceed the specified limit relate to expenses for expensive treatment.  There are no state restrictions on them.  The deduction is calculated based on the total amount of expenses spent on medicines. </p><p>  There is a list of services for which expensive treatment applies.  The list for 3-NDFL (dentistry and other areas of medicine are related here) is presented in the PRF Resolution of No. 201. </p><h2>  How to get paid? </h2><p>  This process consists of several stages: collecting and submitting documents to the Federal Tax Service, checking certificates by inspection, receiving funds.

    <p>  Sometimes the FTS may also request a license from a healthcare organization.  What papers need to be provided if costly treatment was carried out under a social insurance contract?  The list for 3-PIT (reimplantation and other areas of medicine are affected): </p><ul><li>  insurance policy; </li><li>  premium receipt checks; </li><li>  the recipe marked "for the Federal Tax Service"; </li><li>  TIN certificate; </li><li>  payment documents. </li></ul><h2>  The timing </h2><p>  You can receive payment for periods when tax has been paid.  At the same time, you can submit data and return funds only in the year following the year of payment.  That is, if the treatment was in 2014, then the deduction can be obtained in 2015.  You can collect certificates for a maximum of 3 years after treatment. </p><p>  The taxpayer must provide all of these documents to the Federal Tax Service at the place of residence in person or draw up a <span>notarized power of attorney</span> for a relative.  If there is no time for going to the tax office, you can send a package of documents with a valuable letter.  But if one of the certificates is missing, then the documents will not pass the verification.  This process can last three months.  The Federal Tax Service shall notify the payer of the revealed violations in writing.  After that, he has 5 days to provide the missing documents.  The decision on the results of the audit is sent to the taxpayer within 10 days from the date of its completion.  Another month is allocated for the transfer of funds to a bank account. </p>
