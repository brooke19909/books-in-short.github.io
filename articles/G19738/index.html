Very often, a pumpkin is used for this, which is transformed in various ways.  From this vegetable you can make many different bizarre figures.  In the article, we will consider step-by-step master classes of pumpkin snails.  The process of creating such crafts will be an interesting pastime for both children and their parents. </p><h2>  Secrets of creating a good craft </h2><ul><li>  It must be borne in mind that crafts made from fruits, vegetables and berries have a short shelf life, and each culture has its own characteristics.  For example, juice begins to stand out from juicy cucumbers and soft tomatoes.  In this case, it is best to use more "long-term" root crops and vegetables.  These are pumpkin, zucchini, potatoes, cabbage, carrots, onions and others. </li></ul>

    <ul><li>  Before creating crafts, all vegetables and fruits must be thoroughly washed and dried.  Only after that they can be used as material for creativity.

For this purpose, special varieties are ideal, the fruits of which have a uniform brown color and more expressive forms.  Too large representatives of the <span>pumpkin family are</span> not suitable for drying at home.  It is better to choose a medium copy, holistic and firm to the touch.  To craft a pumpkin snail, it is recommended to avoid even small fragments of mold or rot.  A peduncle must also be present.  Only under such conditions will the vegetable tolerate the drying process well.

    <p>  1. Dampen the vegetable with a rag and give it a warm shower.  Make sure that the water jet is not too assertive, otherwise it will damage the skin.  After that, gently pat the pumpkin with a dry towel.  Leave it in a dark room with low humidity for one hour.  Then again wipe the vegetable and clean it in the same room for the same period of time.  If after that the peel is completely dry, then you can begin to work. </p><p>  2. You can dry the pumpkin for snail crafts at room temperature.  It is necessary to clean it of pulp, seeds and stuff it with newspapers.  Within two to three weeks, it is necessary to periodically change the "stuffing".  This has always been done before, but a similar method is not reliable.  The fact is that there is a high probability of spoiling the vegetable in such conditions. </p><p>  3. Today you can dry the crops in a short time using kitchen appliances.  An oven, air grill or microwave is suitable.  It is optimal to bake a pumpkin in the center of the cabinet at a temperature of eighty degrees.  During the drying process, periodically turn the pumpkin clockwise to prevent burning. </p><p>  Cut patterns can be on the skin of dried or raw pumpkin.  But in the latter case, the vegetable will quickly deteriorate and subsequently lose shape.  Dried pumpkin will please the eye for a long time.  And they will tell you how to craft a pumpkin snail crafts, step-by-step instructions of our master classes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  What do you need for crafts? </h2><p>  To make a snail, you need to take two pumpkins: one round, the other oblong (halves are also suitable).  You will also need a knife, marker, a pair of wooden skewers and white tennis balls.  These materials can be replaced at your discretion. </p><h2>  How to make a craft? </h2><p>  In general, pumpkin is a very malleable material, so it is very easy to craft from it.  However, working with sharp tools is not recommended for young children. </p><p>  1. If you put a round pumpkin on its side, then it strongly resembles a snail shell, so it is perfect.  With a knife, cut the bottom off the prepared vegetable, remove the inner pulp and seeds.  Check for stability. </p><p>  2. At the top, which will be the wall of the sink, cut a spiral.  It should have a twist effect, like a snail's house. </p><p>  3. Do the same on the opposite side of the pumpkin. </p><p>  4. The second oblong vegetable will be used as the head of the slug.  Cut one side so that the pumpkin becomes stable and looks like the head of a snail that crawls out of its house. </p><p>  5. Both vegetables can be fastened with skewers so that they do not stand apart, but stick together.  This item is optional for making a pumpkin snail, you can skip it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>
