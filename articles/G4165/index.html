    <p>  In Greece there are many resorts, each vacationer can choose according to his taste - sandy or rocky, secluded or crowded.  Today, the topic of our conversation will be one of the most picturesque corners of Greece - Agios Nikolaos.  It is developing more and more every year, but at the same time its unique and amazing atmosphere is preserved.  In the afternoon, this is an ordinary Greek town, not much different from others, with a measured and even somewhat sleepy life.  But at night life boils here. </p><p>  Many consider Agios Nikolaos a fashionable resort.  This is not entirely true.  Here everyone can choose a vacation for themselves. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Agios Nikolaos is located in the east of Crete.  From its capital - Heraklion - the resort is 76 kilometers away.  A distinctive feature of the town is an almost perfectly <span>round lake</span> located in its very center.  It is called Vulismeni.  It should be noted that this lake is freshwater. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Attractions Agios Nikolaos" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/471708.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  Climatic conditions typical of Greece are dry and hot summers and rainy but mild winters.  There is almost no wind - the mountains reliably protect the town.  The hottest month is August, the ‚Äúreal‚Äù winter begins in early December and ends in April.  In May, the tourist season is already beginning in the city. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The city of Agios Nikolaos has a long history.  It is believed that it arose in the third century, after the unification of two cities - Lato Geter and Lato Pros Camaro.  The new city began to develop actively, and by the 6th century it had become the central city of the bishopric of Camara.  Initially, the city was named Lato Pros Camaro.  Only in the 9th century did it get its current name.  It is believed that it was given in honor of the church of <span>St. Nicholas.</span> </p><p>  Soon the city was conquered by the Genoese.  It was they who built the Mirabella fortress here in 1206.  She did not stand long, unable to withstand the attacks of the Turks.  Then there was an earthquake that completely destroyed the fortress.  From this moment begins the decline of the city, dragging on until the second half of the 19th century. </p><p>  For the revival of his hometown, local residents undertook.  Their work was not in vain, and in 1905 he became the center of the province of Passiti.  The beauty of these places could not sooner or later attract celebrities here.  It just so happened that after Jules Dassin and Walt Disney visited here, a tourist boom begins in the town. </p><p>  Agios Nikolaos is getting bigger and more beautiful every year.  Today, here you can choose housing for your wallet, taking into account your own preferences. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Agios Nikolaos what to see" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/471707.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sightseeing: Agios Nikolaos and surroundings </h2><p>  Any resident of this sunny city will advise tourists to first get acquainted with local monuments and famous places and visit Lake Vulismeni.  This is the pride of the locals.  If you believe the legend, once there took water procedures Aphrodite and Athena.  Old-timers believe that this lake has no bottom.  Around it is a small park where various entertainment events are held. </p><p>  This is the charming city of Agios Nikolaos.  A map of its sights will help you <span>plan the route</span> correctly so you don't miss out on anything interesting. </p><h2>  Highlands of Lasithi </h2><p>  Let's talk more about the main attractions.  Agios Nikolaos is truly unique in this regard.  The Lasithi Plain is located at an altitude of 800 meters above sea level.  Most tourists easily climb this climb to visit the Dikteyska cave.  According to legend, Zeus the Thunderer himself was born in it.  Here you can see the <span>monastery of Kera Kardiotissa</span> which houses the miraculous icon of the Virgin. </p><p>  Tourists will certainly be interested in a visit to the village of Pesa.  It produces the best wines in Crete.  The village of Trapsano became famous for its pottery. </p><h2>  Church of Panagia Kera </h2><p>  Often tourists are interested in what (first arrived in Agios Nikolaos) what to see in this city.  Lovers of ancient architecture are advised to visit the most famous architectural monument of the Byzantine era, which is located 20 kilometers from the city in a luxurious olive grove, near the entrance to the village of Kritza.  Panagia Kerah (the most famous Byzantine church in Crete) was built from the 11th century to the 14th and was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, her mother Anna and St. Anthony. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Agios Nikolaos map" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/471706.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The rich interior of the church is decorated with frescoes and faces of saints.  In addition, Panagia Kera is famous for the miraculous icon of the Mother of God, which, according to believers, heals of many diseases. </p><h2>  Archaeological Museum </h2><p>  All history buffs wishing to explore the sights of Agios Nikolaos are advised to visit this museum.  Its exposition is located in eight halls.  But even if it weren‚Äôt so big, it would be worth coming here for the sake of a single exhibit - the skull of an ancient Roman athlete.  It is dated to the 1st century.  Decorated with a golden crown.  It was found during excavations of an ancient Roman cemetery. </p><p>  In addition, museum workers are rightfully proud of the collection of artifacts that belong to a variety of eras - from the Neolithic to the time of the Roman Empire.  No less valuable are such exhibits as the clay statue of Myrtle, which was discovered by archaeologists in Myrtos, and a huge vessel made in the form of a shell from the Minoan palace of Malia. </p><h2>  Archaeological Museum </h2><p>  Locals are very sensitive to the history of their native land.  Every tourist who first came to the city of Agios Nikolaos needs to know that it is useful for everyone to see the exposition of the folklore museum - both adults and children. </p><p>  Its organizers had the only goal - to tell locals and visitors about the history of the island of Crete and their hometown. </p><h2>  Folk Museum </h2><p>  In the center of the exposition is a house of a Cretan peasant with a typical design, which is recreated in the smallest details.  In addition, here you can see a unique collection of old suits and agricultural tools of the past.  Postcards and photos of previous years complete the collection. </p><h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  It should be noted right away that the resort area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe town is well equipped, the beaches here are very comfortable.  Agios Nikolaos can hardly be called suitable for relaxation alone - during the bathing season, the coastlines are completely occupied by vacationers.  Here you will be offered all kinds of water activities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="greece crete agios nikolaos" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/471705.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  No less popular is the area of ‚Äã‚Äãcafes and bars at the marina.  It is very cozy here - you can sit under the shady crowns of trees, enjoying delicious dishes of fresh seafood. </p><p>  After <span>sunset</span> , clubs and discos open here, turning this area into the center of the <span>nightlife</span> of Crete. </p><h2>  Excursions from Agios Nikolaos </h2><p>  The city is very favorably located on the island, this allows you to travel to anywhere in Crete, as well as to mainland Greece.  But first, we suggest you familiarize yourself with the surroundings of Agios Nikolaos.  Around it are preserved the ruins of the ancient Greek cities of Spinalonga and Lato, which is of particular interest.  According to legend, the city of Lato is named after the mother of Apollo and Artemis.  Here, the agora, the remains of the theater and the temple, shops, and workshops have been preserved in good condition. </p><p>  In the east of the island we recommend visiting the city of Sitia.  It is famous for its fortress, and if you drive further east, you can sunbathe on the famous palm beach of Vai. </p><h2>  The color of a magnificent resort </h2><p>  Sunny Greece, Crete, Agios Nikolaos are always welcome guests, provided that they do not violate local traditions and customs.  The Greeks have a hot temper and a surprisingly sentimental character. </p><p>  In the period from two in the afternoon to six in the evening, local residents rest.  At this time, it is undesirable to call or visit shops and cafes - they may be closed for a break. </p><p>  The local population is accustomed to a calm and measured life.  In restaurants and cafes, you can expect an order for quite some time.  This may seem to someone a sign of disrespect.  In fact, this state of affairs is quite normal. </p><p>  Locals abide by many customs, which are somewhat different from existing in the country.  For example, on Easter they fry a young lamb on a spit, and shooting from rifles announces the beginning of the holiday. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beaches of Agios Nikolaos" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/471703.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  After meeting with a foreigner, the townspeople will definitely take an interest in where he came from.  And this is not just curiosity.  Over its long history, the city has experienced many military incursions, so every foreigner makes them feel apprehensive.  At the same time, this does not prevent local residents from being responsive and welcoming hosts - they quickly penetrate the foreigner with confidence if they feel his positive attitude. </p>
