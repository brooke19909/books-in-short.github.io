    <p>  The name of the bridge was taken from the exchange, located on the arrow.  Initially, the trading port was based here, at the mouth of the Malaya Neva.  Of course, the growing Vasilievsky island needed a reliable crossing.  The construction of the first bridge, designed by engineer Mazurov, was completed in 1894.  He was 25-span and made of wood.  The incredibly complex structure was 328 meters long.  The adjustable span was located in the middle. </p><p>  Plans to build a permanent bridge 70 meters downstream never materialized.  First, due to the outbreak of the First World War, and then the revolution.  In Soviet times, the bridge was called Building and remained wooden until 1960. </p><h2>  Restructuring </h2><p>  In 1930 and 1947, the bridge was overhauled, but increased traffic made further use of the wooden bridge impossible.  The supports were constantly rotting.  As a result of one of the reconstructions, the bridge became narrower, which aggravated the transport situation.  In addition, it was badly damaged by ice drift in 1957.  The need for a new bridge has become a rather acute urban problem.  The old structure not only made travel difficult, but also spoiled the look of the city.  At that time, the appearance of Mytninskaya embankment underwent significant changes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 1960, a new bridge was built entirely of welded metal elements.  His two flights were divorced.  Simultaneously with the construction of the bridge, the landscape of the Neva Delta was changed.  The Vatny island and the channel of the same name on the Petrograd side were completely bombarded.  Thanks to this change, a large area appeared in front of the bridge.  The new design is located 70 meters downstream, as expected before the revolution.  Now the bridge overlooked Dobrolyubov Avenue, bypassing the narrow Zoological Lane.  The new location allowed transport to move freely from the Petrograd side and vice versa. </p><p>  The authors of the project - engineers Levin and Demchenko, architects Noskov and Areshev - made changes to the eastern tip of Vasilyevsky Island and a general view of the Makarov embankment.  A parapet was built that was absent from the time of the trading port.  The exchange bridge in form is a copy of the Palace.  Thanks to this, a new, unique panorama of the city was created. </p><p>  The structure was installed on reinforced concrete tubular piles with a diameter of 56 cm. The new bridge, like the old one (wooden), had five spans.  The width of the supports of the new design was 9 meters.  A more ordered and symmetrical view of the embankments of the Big and Small Neva has become a new symbol of the city.  The architecture of the bridge has been somewhat simplified.  When creating the project, traffic safety standards were taken into account.  In general, the new bridge has become more functional.  At the same time, architects did not forget about the monumentality inherent in the whole appearance of the city.  The supports are faced with pink granite.  The railing of the bridge consists of darts and is decorated with Neptune's tridents in the spans.  In 1989, the ferry was finally returned to its old name - Exchange Bridge.  A photo of an old, elaborate wooden structure is the only thing that recalls the past.  The townspeople quickly got used to the new design. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="exchange bridge wiring" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27471/670271.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Bridge today </h2><p>  At the moment, the Birzhevoy Bridge in St. Petersburg is one of the important crossings between Vasilievsky Island and the Petrograd Side.  Recently completed the installation of electric backlight.  Finally, about 670 lamps, searchlights, mainly LED, were fixed on the <span>bridge piers.</span>  The power of the equipment was 25.4 kW.  The illumination isolated and highlighted a discreet bridge with a concise design.  He became part of a single ensemble of Neva embankments.  Thanks to modern technology, supports and railings look great at night.  Many old-timers note with satisfaction the fact that the Birzhevoy Bridge has become very beautiful.  Its layout began to resemble Palace Bridge even more. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Exchange bridge swap" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27471/670270.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Bypass Birzhevoy bridge </h2><p>  During festive events, the Birzhevoy Bridge, like Tuchkov, is often blocked, and vehicles are bypassed.  The increasing traffic intensity made the bridge a problem point on the city map.  The ferry is the shortest route from the center to Vasilievsky Island and the Petrograd Side.  It is possible to go round the closed section along the Troitsky or Blagoveshchensky bridge. </p><h2>  Transport route </h2><p>  A trolleybus number 7, connecting the Krasnogvardeisky district with the Petrograd side, follows the bridge.  The initial stop is on Stakhanovtsev street, the final stop is at Petrovskaya Square.  The 10th bus goes through the Petrograd side and the Birzhevoy bridge from Krestovsky Island, then along the Palace Bridge and the city center towards the Baltic Station.  Minibuses 191 and K209, following through the bridge, connect the Nevsky district with the city center.  A 5M minibus connected Vasilievsky Island, the Petrograd side and the center. </p><h2>  Exchange Bridge Divorce </h2><p>  The schedule for the exchange of the Exchange Bridge is during the navigation period (from May to November) daily from 02:00 to 04:55.  Crossing has become a favorite destination for tourists.  The episode of the exchange routing is shown in the comedy "The Incredible Adventures of Italians in Russia." </p>
