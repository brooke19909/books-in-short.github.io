    <h2>  A bit of general information </h2><p>  Let's tell a little about the place where we offer to spend your vacation.  Shatsky Lakes is a group of three dozen reservoirs of large and small sizes.  They are scattered between the banks of the <span>Western Bug</span> and Pripyat rivers in two districts of the Volyn region (Ukraine).  This is practically the border of Ukraine, Belarus and Poland.  Ponds with amazingly clear water are hidden in the forests, where there are numerous motels, camps and recreation centers.  In 1983, authorities created the Shatsky Natural National Park to protect a unique natural complex.  Its total area is 32,500 ha. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="shatsky lakes photo" class="if" height="298" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/908587.jpg" width="479"></div>

    <h2>  The inhabitants </h2><p>  If you like a quiet, measured rest - Shatsky Lakes will give it to you.  You can sit for hours with a fishing rod on the shore (by the way, it is not necessary to bring it with you, as you can rent it).  Indeed, in the water column there are more than thirty species of fish (pike, loach, perch, eel, crucian carp, roach, catfish, bream, carp, whitefish, pike perch, trout fish, common carp, etc.), crayfish.  You can go on a quiet hunt for mushrooms and berries (just do not get lost!).  Swans, wild ducks and geese nest near ponds, but it is forbidden to hunt them.  And it’s also impossible to burn bonfires anywhere: this is a nature reserve. </p><h2>  Handsome Svityaz </h2><p>  This is the deepest karst lake in Ukraine.  Its maximum depth is 58.4 m, which is more than that of the Sea of ​​Azov.  But at the same time, the water is clean and clear.  The total area of ​​the reservoir is 25.2 square meters.  km  In the center of the lake there is a large island. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="recreation center shatsky lakes" class="if" height="298" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/908588.jpg" width="479"></div>

Shatsky Lakes is an ideal place for family vacations, for children's recovery.  The purest air and water, nature, entertainment favor relaxation and recovery. </p><p>  But do not limit yourself to stopping only at Svityaz.  It is optimal to go here by car to wander from a reservoir to a reservoir, because they are so different. </p><h2>  Legends and traditions </h2><p>  People made up various legends about this lake - sad and romantic, heroic and fantastic.  They fascinate with colorful language and make you believe in a miracle.  Some of them inspired creativity.  For example, Adam Mickiewicz wrote two poems: “Svityaz” and “Svityazyanka”. </p><p>  Ancient legends tell that once upon a time there was a beautiful princely castle on the site of the lake.  But its owner left his land to help his neighbor in the war.  The insidious enemy took advantage of this and led the army to the walls of this stronghold.  Seeing that she could not resist a huge army, the daughter of the prince began to ask heaven to prevent the invasion of enemies and pray that her house would not go to them.  At that moment the walls began to tremble and crumble, and an amazing lake appeared at the castle site.  The water in it was healing, and various flowers blossomed on the banks. </p><p>  Another mysterious place is the Island of lovers on Svityaz.  According to tradition, he appeared where two young people turned into trees to be together.  Rumor has it that there is a trail that leads to the island by land, but where it is, no one knows.  Therefore, couples go here only by boat. </p><p>  Legends are legends, but the water in Svityaz is able to heal wounds, soften the skin (due to the content of glycerin and silver).  In the old days, many Polish pannochki were washed by its waters, which were specially delivered from Shack. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The most common type of vacation in the lake is the savages.  In the region there are many campsites and campsites where there is everything you need (toilet, shower, electricity, places for making bonfires).  It is only worth remembering that this is a forest region, and snakes live here.  You can also set up tents on the territory of a private house - local residents take a very small fee for this.  And you can always rent a house with them. </p><p>  Tourists, accustomed to comfort, can also go to the Shatsky Lakes: sanatoriums and recreation centers are plentiful.  The most popular of them are Vityaz, Forest Song, Themis, and Galitsky Dvor.  Most of them were built during the time of the Soviet Union, therefore they have the corresponding amenities.  The Shatsky Lakes recreation center (the village of Svityaz) is considered to be the best, which has cozy houses, its own beach and a large selection of entertainment (boats, catamarans, sports grounds, a disco, a cafe, excursions and so on). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="shatsky lakes sanatoriums" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/908827.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How can I get to? </h2><p>  It is easy to find Shatsky Lakes: the map of Volyn Region necessarily has a mark.  It is most convenient to go by personal car or bus via Lutsk or Kovel (the second option is much faster).  From Kiev, it is optimal to catch the train next to Kovel, and there is already a transfer to the bus (both stations are located nearby). </p><p>  Picturesque Polesie, shrouded in secrets and glorified by the ingenious Ukrainian poetess, hospitably invites to her.  Its beauty, as if on the day of the creation of the world, will not leave anyone indifferent.  Therefore, you will want to come here more than once. </p>
