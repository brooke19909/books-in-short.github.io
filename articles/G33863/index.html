The construction of the building dates back to the 17th century or the beginning of the 18th century, although the dating is still in doubt.  The old chambers of the Yusupovs are a real architectural miracle that glorified Bolshoy Kharitonevsky lane near Chistye Prudy, familiar to all Muscovites.

    <p>  The Yusupov Palace in Moscow (the photo in the article presents the architecture of the building) is a real attraction of the capital.  The building is considered one of the major cultural heritage sites. </p><p>  For those who are interested in where <span>the Yusupov Palace</span> is located in Moscow, the address is: Central Administrative District, Basmanny District, B. Kharitonyevsky per., D. 21, p. 4. </p><p>  The end of the XVII century is considered the most probable date of construction.  At this time, a complex of two-story buildings was formed, decorated in the style of Moscow Baroque.  Probably there was also a third wooden floor, which was residential.  The structure was a ceremonial vaulted room on the basement.  At the beginning of the XVIII century.  the so-called Dining Room with a characteristic wide passage was added to the northeast corner of the palace.  Under Peter I, the entire Myasnitskaya street was turned into a main road for the royal exit.  In the district began to settle close. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  The Volkov-Yusupov Palace in Moscow: the first owners </h2><p>  The first, about whom it is reliably known as the owner of the palace in B. Kharitonevsky, was one of the associates of Peter I, vice chancellor, knight of the Order of St.  St. Andrew, the famous diplomat P.P. Shafirov.  Historians believe that it was Shafirov who built the earliest parts of the complex that makes up the Yusupovs palace in Moscow. </p>

    <p>  Having a successful career, in 1723 the official fell out of favor with the emperor.  He was sentenced to death, which at the last moment was replaced by a link to Siberia.  The former diplomat was stripped of his titles, ranks, and all property. </p><h2>  Peter Andreevich Tolstoy </h2><p>  The building in Kharitonyevsky Lane (the future Yusupov Palace in Moscow) was transferred to Count P. A. Tolstoy.  The head of the Secret Chancellery in those days terrified contemporaries.  His descendants are the famous writers Tolstoy - Alexei Konstantinovich and Lev Nikolaevich.  Due to participation in a palace intrigue against <span>A. D. Menshikov,</span> Peter Andreevich was exiled to Solovki. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Trusted His <span>Grace Prince</span> Chief Secretary A. Ya. Volkov </h2><p>  The next, in whose possession was the Yusupov Palace in Moscow, was the closest associate of the ‚ÄúMost Holy Prince‚Äù A. Ya. Volkov.  Judging by the nature of the duties assigned to him, which in most cases were very sensitive, Volkov was one of his most trusted servants.  After the overthrow of the nobleman Volkov deprived of the rank of general, as well as the palace in Kharitonevsky lane. </p><h2>  The curse of the kind </h2><p>  The property was transferred to the treasury, and in 1727 it was granted to Prince G. D. Yusupov, the representative of one of the most notable noble families of Russia, whose history goes back to the Muslim Middle Ages. </p><p>  Historians believe that its founder was Yusuf-Murza - the khan of the great Nogai Horde, which brought fear to Russia.  In 1563, his son Il-Murza arrived in Moscow, who managed to excel in the service of the tsar.  During the <span>reign of Fyodor Ivanovich, the</span> grandson of Il-Murza, Abdull, unknowingly in the post fed goose meat to Patriarch Joachim, who, learning of the deception, was in terrible anger.  To save himself from disgrace and ruin, Abdul-Murza decided to convert to Orthodoxy.  He was granted the forgiveness of the sovereign, the title of prince and the name Dmitry Yusupov.  But according to family tradition, that very night the prophet Muhammad appeared to him in a dream, who cursed the entire Yusupov family for apostasy.  From now on, in each generation, only one man was destined to live to the age of 26 years. </p><h2>  New owner, Boris Yusupov </h2><p>  Boris Grigoryevich was the Governor General of Moscow, and also served as director of the Shlyakheti cadet corps.  Thanks to him, Empress Elizabeth in 1756 signed a decree on the creation of the first public theater in St. Petersburg. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  In the 1770s, the Yusupov possessions were expanded: on the western side, along with a stone house, the acquired neighboring Izmailovs estate was added to the plot. </p><h2>  The legendary wealth of the Yusupov clan </h2><p>  The legendary wealth stored in the ancient chambers of Kharitonevsky Lane began with the first owners.  The Yusupovs are known to have owned many palaces, houses and estates throughout Russia.  The number of serfs belonging to them amounted to tens of thousands, of the land there were hundreds of thousands of tithes.  The Yusupov-owned chambers in St. Petersburg, by analogy, were also called the palace. </p>

    <p>  At the turn of the XVIII and XIX centuries.  the house of the merchant Chiriev (residential, one-story) joined their possessions.  Now, in the Kharitonyevsky Lane, the Yusupovs owned as many as three houses.  In those days, the owner of the site was the most famous of the Yusupovs - Nikolai Borisovich, minister of the department of appanages, senator, active privy councilor, member of the State Council, first director of the Hermitage.  The nobleman, who was reputed to be the most enlightened man of his time and a talented politician, spent most of his life abroad. </p><h2>  Famous tenant </h2><p>  Part of the buildings of the palace complex by Nikolai Borisovich were leased.  In 1801, the middle house, together with all the economic services, was rented by the father of the great poet Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin - Sergey Lvovich.  By this time, near the house there was already an orchard in which little Pushkin was walking with his nanny.  Later, he transferred his childhood impressions to the poem Ruslan and Lyudmila.  Although the future poet had a chance to live in the house for only three years, the Kharitonevsky lane was immortalized in his work.  An unpretentious one-story wooden house on the corner of an alley, according to one of the capital's legends, is mentioned in the seventh chapter of the famous "Eugene Onegin."  They call him that - ‚ÄúTatyana‚Äôs house‚Äù or ‚ÄúLarinsky‚Äù. </p><h2>  In the crucible of war </h2><p>  At the beginning of the XIX century.  the house where the parents of the great Russian poet lived passed into the possession of Prince A.I. Vyazemsky.  It is known that the palace was badly damaged in the fire of 1812.  Almost nothing was saved inside.  After the French were expelled from Moscow, the chambers were repaired, and the former decorative decoration was restored.  During the rebuilding in the middle of the XIX century, the house acquired a U-shaped plan. </p><h2>  The last of the kind owners </h2><p>  Boris Nikolayevich Yusupov (next owner) was the ceremonial master of Emperor Nicholas I, a real privy councilor.  He lived mainly in St. Petersburg and only briefly visited Moscow. </p><p>  But in the 1860s, life in the Yusupov Palace was really overwhelmed.  The chambers were again renovated when Yusupov Jr., Prince Nikolai Borisovich, began to own them, who bought a house from the court adviser Plemyannikov, which was once the home of the Pushkin family.  Yusupov, the accompanist of the imperial court, was known as a great connoisseur of music, a talented performer and writer. </p><p>  Unfortunately, this outstanding man was the last of the representatives of the male line of the old noble family of the Yusupovs.  Princess Zinaida Nikolaevna, his only daughter, heiress of great fortune, became the wife of Count F.F. Sumarokov-Elston, great-great-grandson of M.I. Kutuzov, who was allowed to be called Prince Yusupov by the emperor Alexander III, at the request of Nikolai Borisovich. </p><h2>  Large-scale restoration </h2><p>  Old Prince Yusupov spared no effort in trying to give the chambers of the Kharitonevsky palace splendor.  At the end of the XIX century.  its large-scale restoration began, during which they rebuilt the western part of the chambers, changed the facade decoration stylized in the 17th century, and redesigned the premises.  Then the third floor was added to the chambers.  The roof decor was also restored, which is a high cover with stone smokers and weathercocks.  Glasses were inserted into the windows - imitating mica windows of the 17th century. </p><h2>  Byzantine luxury </h2><p>  Receptions, which were arranged in the Yusupov Palace, amazed the guests with their splendor, called by many "Byzantine".  The owners allowed everyone to see the luxurious interiors of the palace.  The throne room, whose domed ceiling was painted with zodiac constellations, and the walls are decorated with images of a dragon, the fabulous bird Sirin and paradise flowers, were especially striking in its rich decoration and size.  They led into the hall three bronze openwork doors.  According to the fashion of that time, there was also a Chinese room with birds, dragons, stylized lanterns and characteristic ornaments. </p>

    <p>  In 1908, shortly before his twenty-sixth birthday, her son Nikolai Feliksovich died in a duel.  A tribal curse came true.  Felix Feliksovich, the only successor to the family and the heir to all wealth, became a participant in the murder of Rasputin, in those days one of the key figures that influenced the course of history.  Until now, the mystery of his death remains one of the unresolved mysteries. </p><h2>  Nationalization </h2><p>  After the revolution, F. F. Yusupov and his family went to Europe.  Their property was nationalized.  It is known that the Bolsheviks tortured the butler to find out the place where the treasure was hidden by the prince, but the secret was not disclosed. </p><p>  Since 1928, the Yusupov Palace became the place where various Soviet institutions were located. </p><h2>  Conversions </h2><p>  In the 1940s, a travel arch under the Dining Room was laid.  This turned out to be distorted the whole appearance of the building.  During the Soviet Union, an architectural monument was not restored.  By the 1990s, Yusupov‚Äôs palace in Moscow was already in very poor condition. </p><p>  In 1999, the <span>facade was</span> partially <span>restored, the</span> roof and the forged grate were also repaired. </p><h2>  Our days </h2><p>  A large-scale repair and restoration work began in the 2000s: the destroyed northern facade (built in the 19th century) was restored, the outer walls in the passage arch were dismantled.  The openings were glazed in it, and the roof was also strengthened.  In accordance with historical materials, the north and south porch, parquet and stone floors on the floors, the historical color of the facades and murals were restored.  After restoration, the doors to the Yusupov Palace in Moscow were opened for all visitors.
