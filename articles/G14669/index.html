Capitol Building in Washington</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A special attraction of <span>the US capital,</span> which Washington is rightfully proud of, is the Capitol.  Everyone probably saw a photo of this magnificent white marble building.  It is located on top of Capitol Hill, surrounded by other important institutions - the residence of the Supreme Court and the Library of Congress.  Monuments to <span>Abraham Lincoln</span> and <span>George Washington are</span> also nearby <span>.</span> </p><p>  The word "Capitol" is associated with the hill of the same name in Rome.  In the ancient era, the Senate sat there and held important public meetings.  Where did this name come from in the New World, a few thousand kilometers from Rome?  Hill in the United States is considered the center - rather, ideological rather than geographical - of the District of Columbia.  <span>This building</span> has an interesting story that you will learn by reading this article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Capitol washington" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/402916.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Building construction </h2><p>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbuilding a congressional home belongs to George Washington.  He laid the first stone in the foundation of the building.  It happened on September 18, 1793.  It is difficult to say who was the architect of the building, since the main architects were constantly changing, and each subsequent brought something of their own.  But the main features were sustained in the Empire style.  The building was not yet completed when Congress gathered in its walls in 1800. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The former metropolis - Great Britain - could not come to terms with the independence of the States.  In 1814, British troops burned the Capitol (Washington).  It took five years to restore it.  But the construction work did not end there.  From 1820 to 1827, a passage was erected between the northern and southern wings of the building, over which a monumental dome was built.  About thirty years later, Congress decided that the US Capitol was not large enough. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Washington Capitol photo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/402920.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Grand restructuring </h2><p>  As soon as it was deemed necessary to expand the building for the meetings of the Congress, it was decided to rethink its design.  The project remained the same: columns of classicism and generous decor of the Empire style.  However, unique details have been added.  So, the <span>capitals of the columns</span> began to decorate not the bay leaves of the Mediterranean, but the ‚Äúlocal‚Äù representatives of the flora - ears of corn and tobacco leaves.  The old dome was replaced by a new, cast-iron, eighty-seven meters high.  The walls of the building were specially designed so that they could withstand its weight of four thousand tons. </p><p>  In 1863, the building added the finishing touch.  A six-meter <span>statue of Liberty by</span> T. Crawford was hoisted on the dome.  So the US Capitol, whose photo you see, has acquired a modern look.  The prototype of this building is considered to be the Roman Cathedral of St. Peter, although some experts see it as resembling the Parisian Invalides (architect Mansard Jr.). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Us capitol" class="if" height="458" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/402921.jpg" width="600"></div>

Central heating was carried out in the Capitol (Washington), and elevator shafts were mounted.  But by the middle of the century this building seemed a bit small.  Therefore, in 1960, the eastern facade was extended by ten meters.  Thus, as a result of numerous reconstructions on the pedestal of Capitoline Hill, this white marble miracle appeared - the Congress building. </p><p>  Inside, it is as beautiful as outside.  In 1865, the artist Konstantin Brumidi decorated the dome with the first mural in the United States.  She portrays George Washington surrounded by Olympic gods.  Brumidi painted not only the dome, but also the Hall of Columns.  Frescoes and friezes reflect more than two hundred years of history of the state. </p>

    <h2>  Capitol - Washington: Conceptual Connection </h2><p>  Architects have worked hard to ensure that the building of the US Congress fits correctly into urban development.  The dome and the highly recognizable Capitol Rotunda are visible from everywhere.  Still: after all, a building eighty-eight meters high crowns the top of the most significant hill in the area.  In addition, all the main streets of Washington lead to the Capitol, thereby indicating the state symbolism of this place. </p><p>  In order not to close the magnificent building, there is no urban development around it.  It is surrounded only by a spacious park with lawns, with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 55 hectares.  A kilometer and 800 meter long national alley connects the Congress Building with two monuments: Lincoln and Washington.  Equally significant for Americans and buildings nearby, included in the complex of government institutions: the Supreme Court and the <span>Library of Congress.</span>  Previously, they were in the Capitol building.  Sessions of the Court only in 1935 were moved to a new building. </p><h2>  Excursions to the Capitol Building in Washington </h2>

    <p>  About four and a half million tourists visit the most famous US building annually.  There are currently about 540 rooms in the White Marble House of the Capitol.  However, tourists are allowed in only two.  You can go inside only as part of the tour.  However, they are absolutely free in the Capitol.  It is only necessary to present a passport at the ticket office and take a ticket with a number. </p><p>  The group is immediately led to the upper floors, because the two lower floors are occupied by simple office premises.  Above are the House of Representatives (in the south wing) and the Senate (in the north).  There are special loggias for the public above these halls, because all Government meetings are not hidden from the people.  Transparency (transparency) is the first rule of democracy.  The elevator will take tourists to the top floor, to the observation deck, from where a stunning panorama of the city opens.  Unfortunately, the Statue of Liberty can only be seen from below, through binoculars.  She is interesting in that her mantle has a fringe - a kind of tribute to the indigenous people of North America. </p><h2>  Functionality </h2><p>  It is very important to emphasize that the Capitol (Washington) is not only an architectural masterpiece.  In addition to aesthetic value, this building has a deep ideological meaning.  She continues to function.  There are meetings of the two main branches of US power - the Senate and the House of Representatives.  The fact that government officials gathered under the dome of the Congress can be found by the flags around the building.  If they are all raised, then a session is underway.  Only two American banners at the entrance from the time of the First World War are constantly developing on flagpoles.  And so it will be, as long as there is a great democratic country - the United States of America. </p>
