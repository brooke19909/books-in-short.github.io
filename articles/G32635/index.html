At Sberbank, it does not exceed 50 days.  If during this period the owner pays for the purchases and manages to make 100% of the amount spent, the bank does not charge interest for use. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Many customers do not know whether it is possible to replenish Sberbank's credit card with parts during the grace period.
