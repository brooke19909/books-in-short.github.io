In fact, in a disastrous state, he adopted the country in 1216, being a nine-year-old child.  After a series of military defeats and diplomatic failures made by his father, John Plantagenet, monarchical power in England was significantly weakened.  Magna Carta - a document subsequently considered progressive, greatly undermined the monarch's centralized power.  Nevertheless, Henry 3, king of England, ruled the country for 56 years - until his death in 1272. </p>

It is difficult to overestimate the contribution of this man to the preservation of the unity of England. </p>

    <p>  At that time, some of the nobility and almost all of Scotland recognized Louis Louis of France as king of England.  The defense of Dover Castle, led by Hubert de Burg, actually stopped the invasion of Louis troops on the island. </p><p>  Finally, in 1227, upon reaching adulthood, Henry 3, king of England, began to rule on his own, in his own name. </p><h2>  Exile and Return </h2><p>  It is known that during the reign of Henry 3, requisitions from the nobility increased significantly.  Dissatisfied barons took up arms against their monarch.  Under their pressure, in 1258, in Oxford, the king was forced to sign the so-called Oxford Provisions, limiting his power, in the presence of 24 representatives delegated by the barons.  But already in 1261, Heinrich was released by the Holy Pope from obligations under this document (the analogy with ‚Äúconditions‚Äù, signed under the influence of members of the Privy Council by Anna Ioannovna, Empress of Russia, and then solemnly torn) suggests itself. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The refusal of Henry 3 from Provisions led in 1263 to an uprising led by the king‚Äôs son-in-law, Count Simon de Montfort.  And in 1264, Henry 3, king of England, was captured by the rebels. </p>

But the situation in England at that time was such that many were afraid of strengthening the power of de Montfort, and the king was arranged to escape.

    <p>  The fate of the Plantagenet dynasty was decided during the battle in 1265 at Ishem, where the king's supporters prevailed, Simon de Montfort died (he was posthumously deprived of the nobility, leaving no titled heirs), and the king‚Äôs power was restored. </p><h2>  Government </h2><p>  All actions of Henry 3 were dictated by the situation that developed in the country during the reign of his father.  Almost the entire period of the reign of Henry was completely absorbed in resolving issues of power, quarrels with the barons.  He paid very little attention to the internal structure of his state.  The reforms of Henry 3 mainly concerned the church.  It is believed that he was a very devout person.  Some contemporaries testified that he sincerely cried during prayer. </p><p>  King Henry 3 was highly revered Saint King Edward the Confessor.  All over England, many temples were built in his honor. </p><p>  The reign of Henry 3 is associated with the heyday of the church.  Ministers of worship received more rights and privileges.  The state treasury paid for the construction of temples.  The cathedrals themselves began to be built using a different technology, they became more airy and openwork. </p><p>  Two new religious orders arose in England - the famous Franciscans and Dominicans.  On the basis of the <span>Dominican Order</span> , the Inquisition later known for the famous witch-hunt will arise in Europe, as a result of which hundreds of thousands of human lives will end. </p><h2>  last years of life </h2><p>  The reign of Henry after the restoration of his monarchy was not overshadowed by any serious threats and troubles.  The country was no longer torn by rebellion and contention.  The king himself considered his main achievement the consecration of <span>Westminster Abbey,</span> built in his reign <span>,</span> where the remains of his idol Edward the Confessor were transferred. </p>
