    <p>  By cons of the service, Russian tourists attributed: </p><ul><li>  Staff knowledge of only Turkish and English.  When communicating with the administration of the service, misunderstandings may arise on this basis.  And hotel translators are not provided.  Although outside the Romance Club hotel 3 * in Marmaris, you can find Russian-speaking operators. </li><li>  Water at the hotel is sometimes intermittently supplied.  This is especially inconvenient when tourists return from the beach, want to take a shower faster and go down to the restaurant.  There is also a recurring unpleasant smell of sewage in the toilet rooms of the rooms. </li><li>  The Internet signal is weak in the territory of the Romance Club hotel 3 *.  And every day, guests have to re-enter the password to connect to the Wi-Fi network. </li><li>  The younger generation found the service more focused on family vacations, as there are no noisy discos and animations here. </li><li>  The road to the beach takes no more than three minutes.  But the busy road, near which the hotel is located, makes the path difficult.  Tourists warn to be extremely careful.  Often flickering pedestrian scooters are not allowed. </li><li>  The beach is clean but small in size.  Guests of two complexes have a rest on it (Romance Club and Romance Beach).  Because of this, sun loungers are close to each other. </li><li>  Food received a double assessment.  Some tourists liked the dishes and menus of the hotel restaurant.  Others remained dissatisfied with the monotony of choice and the look of the products themselves. </li><li>  In addition, in the middle of the season the hotel has a large influx of tourists, which sometimes creates inconvenience, queues and confusion in the distribution of rooms.  People who got into the <span>Romance Club Hotel 3 *</span> at the end of the season due to the small number of tourists in the midst of relaxation may be asked to move to another hotel.  It also causes some inconvenience. </li></ul><p>  In general, the Romance Club hotel 3 * in Turkey is fully consistent with its status both in price and quality of services.  And the cozy and picturesque Marmaris is ready to fill in the shortcomings in entertainment and the kitchen. </p>
