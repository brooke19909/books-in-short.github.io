  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Moscow Insurance Companies (CTP): List and Rating of Companies</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In accordance with the Law "On OSAGO" No. 40-FZ, all car owners must insure their liability.  In the people it is customary to call it "auto-citizen."  When planning to take out insurance, drivers, as a rule, look for such insurance companies that are reliable and offer the most favorable conditions.  In this search, it helps to study the ratings, which make it possible to analyze the relevant market, and choose among the offers those that differ in the best performance and customer reviews.  In the article, we consider what the most well-known insurance companies in Moscow (according to compulsory motor third-party liability insurance) exist. </p><h2>  The need for objective assessment </h2><p>  The rating of insurance companies (hereinafter referred to as SK) began to be created almost immediately after compulsory car insurance was introduced in Russia.  At first, car owners focused only on the lowest prices on the market.  Subsequently, an appropriate level of service provision was added to this indicator. </p><p>  Naturally, there is a category of drivers who are guided only by the opinion of friends or are guided by their own convictions.  At the same time, they do not take into account information about those insurance companies in Moscow, according to compulsory motor liability insurance which rating shows high results.  However, this decision can hardly be called far-sighted, since at present different ratings are compiled by professionals who use the latest objective information taken from open sources in their work. </p><p>  It should be understood that not all ICs are able to fulfill obligations to customers.  Therefore, in this market it is no longer a rare occurrence when insurers are revoked licenses or they declare themselves bankrupt.  In this regard, the use of ratings becomes a necessity for car owners if they do not want to suffer financial losses. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.imagenesmy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ingosstrakh Moscow" class="if uuid-3176977" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30676/3176977.jpg"></div><h2>  Assessment: the basics of formation </h2><p>  For a better understanding of the principles of this system, it is worth comparing the assessment in Russia and in Western countries.  So, if in a European country a company receives the highest ‚ÄúA‚Äù score, then this is a guarantee that most customers will contact it.  Such an IC is successful, stable and has all the trends for continuous growth.  The situation in the Russian market is somewhat different.  Not always the insurance company, which was put in first place in the ranking, will have the best performance in all respects.  For example, it may not always be able to guarantee compensation payments to customers who have entered into relevant agreements. </p><p>  The insurance includes not only statistical data, but also the probability of the occurrence of a particular event.  This is of particular importance in the case of car insurance.  Accident-free riding is tens of thousands of times more compared to accidents.  Therefore, you should choose a company that is known to be paying the appropriate refunds in a stable manner.  The official rating is based on: </p><ul><li>  Information of the Central Bank. </li><li>  Accounting SK. </li></ul><p>  The rest of the <span>ratings of insurance companies</span> (compulsory motor third-party liability insurance) in Moscow, lists of which can be found, for example, on the Internet, are usually made by companies engaged in statistics or professional journalists.  They are based on the following data: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  at the level of confidence in a particular IC; </li><li>  on an analysis of the actions of company representatives in an accident; </li><li>  on the results of social surveys carried out on the Internet, by phone or by other means. </li></ul><p>  It turns out that using information from ratings, car owners have the opportunity to obtain objective data. </p><p>  At the same time, in the case of alternative sources (except for the Central Bank and SK accounting), the publication of fake results of social surveys cannot be ruled out.  When the UK pays to get a high place, not having statistics for this. </p><p>  Another type of rating can be attributed to ‚Äúexpert‚Äù.  However, they also have flaws.  Often, they do not indicate the criteria by which the assessment was carried out, but only a ready-made list.  In this case, there is also no guarantee that these places are not pre-paid by interested UK companies. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.autoiinsurancellcompanies.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="SC Consent" class="if uuid-3176981" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30676/3176981.jpg"></div><h2>  What are the ratings and who can be trusted? </h2><p>  Companies involved in the compilation of ratings in the field of finance and insurance are based on the following parameters: </p><ul><li>  in shares of payments; </li><li>  financial stability; </li><li>  market fame; </li><li>  demand for services provided; </li><li>  other parameters. </li></ul><p>  To select <span>the insurance companies in Moscow on CTP</span> should be studied not only the official ratings, but also an alternative.  We consider individually each of the above sources for obtaining relevant information. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Central Bank Data </h2><p>  This rating is compiled on the basis of information received from the UK every quarter based on the results of financial statements.  They are published on the official website of the Central Bank.  When compiling a rating, information such as: </p><ul><li>  The total number of contracts concluded during the reporting period. </li><li>  Total fees. </li><li>  The size of insurance payments. </li><li>  Bounce rate </li><li>  Other data. </li></ul><p>  Despite the veracity of these data, you should not rely solely on them when making a decision.  For example, an increase in the number of concluded agreements can only indicate a large-scale advertising campaign, and not about increasing confidence in the UK. </p><h2>  Information from specialized agencies </h2><p>  To get on the list of insurance companies published by the relevant organization, insurance companies in Moscow under mandatory motor liability insurance must file an application and pay for the services of specialists.  Experts analyze the results of each such SC, and then make predictions about their future activities. </p><p>  According to the results of studies, applicants are assigned certain categories that are published in open sources.  Users have no way to verify the reliability of the rating results.  There were even cases when companies occupying the first positions in the future could not cope with their obligations, and this led to bankruptcy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.foxnews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to do CTP in Moscow" class="if uuid-3176991" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30676/3176991.jpg"></div><p>  In Russia, companies are officially registered that are professionally engaged in analyzing the insurance market and assessing the performance of insurance companies.  The following agencies stand out among them: </p><ul><li>  "Expert RA".  The company takes into account the geography of the UK, the number of customers, as well as the percentage of issuance and refusal to issue insurance payments. </li><li>  "NRA".  It analyzes and evaluates only companies that provide relevant information about the activity. </li></ul><h2>  "Popular" ratings </h2><p>  When deciding on where to make OSAGO in Moscow, car owners study the ratings and comments left by those who have already used the services of the UK, and who have developed a certain opinion on this matter.  Potential customers get acquainted with reviews, as well as real user stories.  However, here it is necessary to take into account the subjective factor.  So, car owners are willing to share negative impressions, while positive experience is not considered necessary to comment, because they consider it the norm. </p><p>  Currently, you can find different ratings, which are compiled by well-known expert organizations, as well as print media and websites.  Anyone can get acquainted with this information, since it is intended for this very purpose and is in the public domain. </p><h2>  OSAGO classification </h2><p>  The world has developed a practice in which insurance companies are given the following ratings: </p><ul><li>  ‚ÄúA‚Äù, if the insurance company is stable, makes payments without problems if insured events occur. </li><li>  ‚ÄúB‚Äù, if the UK allows for minor delays in transferring payments, but does not have problems with liquidity in general. </li><li>  ‚ÄúC‚Äù, if the UK makes payments ‚Äúwith high probability‚Äù, but in the presence of financial difficulties, payments can be made with significant delays. </li><li>  ‚ÄúD‚Äù, if the IC is functioning, but at any time can be declared bankrupt. </li><li>  ‚ÄúE‚Äù if the insurance company is liquidated by court or is at the stage of bankruptcy. </li></ul><p>  Pluses are added to these signs if this or that company surpasses the others in corresponding parameters.  So, the highest rated company has been rated as ‚ÄúA ++‚Äù.  Car owners who have received low marks are not interested in car owners (unless the contract was signed earlier and the goal is to find the appropriate company). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flippoinsurance.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow insurance companies OSAGO: rating" class="if uuid-3176985" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30676/3176985.jpg"></div><h2>  Top Companies </h2><p>  Having familiarized yourself with the basics of assessing ICs, we will consider specific insurance companies in Moscow (for compulsory motor liability insurance).  Below is a list prepared by Expert RA agency as of 2019. It lists the companies offering to insure motor third-party liability according to the reliability parameter. </p><ol><li>  IJSC Ingosstrakh (Moscow) - A ++. </li><li>  SOGAZ w - A ++. </li><li>  VTB Insurance - A ++. </li><li>  RESO-Garantia - A +. </li><li>  SAO ERGO - A +. </li><li>  Liberty Insurance - A +. </li><li>  RSHB Insurance - A. </li><li>  AIG - A. </li><li>  Alliance Insurance Company - A. </li><li>  SD "VSK" - A. </li></ol><p>  Insurance companies that ranked in the top ten are characterized by the most stable market position in the coming period.  This means that they certainly do not face bankruptcy, and their assets will cover all liabilities arising from auto insurance contracts.  At the same time, these insurance companies are actively fighting fraudulent activities.  If relevant signs are revealed in relation to employees, official investigations and expert examinations are carried out. </p><h2>  Anti-rating </h2><p>  Many ratings are compiled on the basis of statistical information provided by insurance companies to the Central Bank.  At the same time, not only lists of the best companies are compiled, but also the worst.  An example of the latter is a rating built on the basis of waivers of payments.  It includes the following companies: </p><ol><li>  "Welfare General Insurance" - 50%. </li><li>  BIN Insurance - 28.51%. </li><li>  D2 Insurance - 23.19%. </li><li>  Armeec - 16.42%. </li><li>  ‚ÄúSG MSC‚Äù - 14.95% </li><li>  Alliance - 13.81%. </li><li>  ‚ÄúReliance‚Äù - 12.5%. </li><li>  Borovitskoye  - 11.54%. </li><li>  ERGO - 9.95%. </li><li>  ‚ÄúMoscow Region‚Äù - 9.27%. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.carmudi.com.ph" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How much is CTP in Moscow" class="if uuid-3176992" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30676/3176992.jpg"></div><h2>  SC popularity </h2><p>  Another well-known rating, which is compiled on the basis of the parameter of popularity of companies, is based on the number of contracts that each of the UK concluded in the corresponding period of time. </p><ol><li>  Rosgosstrakh - 7319437. </li><li>  RESO-GARANTIA - 3787256. </li><li>  Ingosstrakh - 3009434. </li><li>  SD "VSK" - 2496504. </li><li>  Open Joint Stock Company Alfa Insurance - 1429513. </li><li>  SOGAZ - 1294186. </li><li>  IC "Consent" - 1041909. </li><li>  "MAX" - 706321. </li><li>  Yuzhural-ASKO - 630171. </li><li>  Ugoria - 610138. </li></ol><h2>  Car Owner Reviews </h2><p>  Equally important is the reviews that car owners leave about insurance companies providing OSAGO services.  At the same time, site administrators try to track and consider only real user reviews.  One of them of such ratings on the famous banking portal showed the following results for 2018: </p><ol><li>  ‚ÄúZetta insurance‚Äù - 56 reviews out of 152 were counted, user rating 3.2. </li><li>  Tinkoff Insurance - 204 out of 460 reviews are counted, the average rating is 2.81. </li><li>  SOGAZ - 29 out of 86 reviews, a score of 1.79. </li><li>  Alfa Insurance - 167 out of 395 reviews are counted, a score of 1.49. </li><li>  IC "Consent" - 29 out of 87, a score of 1.41. </li><li>  Ingosstrakh - 104 out of 226, a score of 1.4. </li><li>  VTB Insurance - 104 out of 207, a score of 1.26. </li><li>  SDK ‚ÄúVSK‚Äù - 179 out of 356 reviews, score 1.25. </li><li>  The Renaissance Insurance Group in Moscow - 109 out of 158, a score of 1.24. </li><li>  Intach Insurance - 16 out of 48, a score of 1.13. </li></ol><p>  If you study the different official and popular ratings, it becomes clear that in many ways they are similar.  The place in the ranking may slightly differ, some companies leave dozens, while others, on the contrary, are included in it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.autoiinsurancellcompanies.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Motor third party liability insurance in Moscow" class="if uuid-3176989" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30676/3176989.jpg"></div><h2>  Description of SK </h2><p>  Consider the characteristics of some insurance companies separately. </p><p>  SD "VSK" (Military Insurance Company) is one of the largest.  Twice she received the gratitude of the President.  1.4% of car owners render a payment, and the average compensation amount is 42,000 rubles.  The company holds the position of "A ++". </p><p>  Ugoria is a class A developing company.  She refuses to pay insurance only 0.7% of cases, and pays 44,000 rubles each.  The main shareholder is the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug, however, SK has over 60 representative offices throughout Russia. </p><p>  Closed Joint-Stock Company Moscow Joint-Stock Insurance Company (CJSC MAKS) has been operating since 1992.  However, the company took up insurance directly in 2003.  On average, the amount of insurance compensation is 35,400 rubles.  There are few refusals to pay, only 0.8% of the total number of applicants.  IC is considered reliable, it is predicted stable development in the future. </p><p>  Alfa Insurance has the same indicators as VSK.  The amount of payments, on average, is 41800 rubles.  And the contributions made 10.6 billion rubles. </p><p>  Transneft Insurance Company is a subsidiary of the relevant oil company.  Since 2013, it was acquired by SOGAZ.  For several years she has held the position of "A ++".  At the same time, the average company payments are small - only 17,500 rubles.  The failure rate is 2.4. </p><p>  Ingosstrakh Moscow provides payments in the approximate amount of 40500 rubles.  The total amount is 15.5 billion rubles.  SK refuses to pay 3.3% of applicants.

The failure rate is 1.9%.  Agency "Expert" estimates the reliability of this IC as "A +".

But while the company is not very popular.  MTPL agreements were concluded in the amount of 2.8 billion rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ca.news.yahoo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="CTP insurance companies Moscow: list" class="if uuid-3176987" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30676/3176987.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The basis of the various ratings of motor insurance companies in Moscow compulsory insurance are those or other sources of information.  Car owners are advised to focus on different lists or on a combined type rating where different parameters are combined.  Then the chances of obtaining objective information increase, and with it the opportunity to conclude an agreement on favorable terms with a reliable company.  Thus, at present, they focus not only on how much CTP costs in Moscow, but also on other indicators indicating the reliability of the company. </p>
