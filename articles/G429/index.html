Cadet corps</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The first <span>cadet schools</span> in Russia are called garrison schools.  They appeared at the beginning of the 18th century and taught children elementary sciences and military skills.  <span>This craft</span> has survived to our time, and even now the oath of the cadet is relevant and honorable.  In tsarist times, the <span>military profession</span> was in demand and prestigious. </p><p>  After 25 years in the service, one could count on help from the state in the form of a land plot and material allowance.  For special merits they even gave a noble title.  Now the situation has changed somewhat, but, as before, every military man can be sure that he will always have work, since the homeland always needs defenders. </p><h2>  Cadet corps </h2><p>  Cadetism is designed to prepare youth for a military career.  The advantage of such training is the formation of the child's independence and love for the motherland.  An important role in such a school is given to principles.  So, a cadet is a person who appreciates traditions, brings up various virtues in himself and purposefully forms a cultural and patriotic personality.  Friendship plays a significant role. </p>

And the first so-called cadet school is knight camps.  The start of military schools was given by the knight academy, where the venerable warriors taught young men the art of fencing and horseback riding.  Such a trend originated in Naples, and from there migrated to France and England. </p><p>  Such knowledge allowed young people to show their courage in various tournaments and performances.  But it was available only to nobles.  Later added mathematics, fortification, blueprints and even artillery.  Peacetime has made adjustments.  If earlier the rank could be obtained only during the battle, then starting from the 17th century the officer rank was granted by seniority.  It was then that the rank of cadet arose. </p><p>  In French, the word ‚Äúcadet‚Äù is the youngest.  From Prussian - a young man whose life is connected with military affairs.  Wealthy nobles sent their children to military schools to gain time.  Cadets received the title much earlier than their peers. </p><h2>  First schools </h2><p>  The direction begins its history from the distant 1653 year.  A military school was founded for rich children, the conditions of which were significantly different from the usual system.  In 1716, a cadet corps was built.  It was a guesthouse where, along with the program of the educational institution, mastery of military affairs was introduced. </p>

Subsequently, the little general grew up in the glorious commander Frederick the Great.  It was during the reign of this man that much was done in the field of studying the theory of military art.

In 1698, under his leadership, the ‚ÄúSchool of Figiry and Land Surveying‚Äù began to work.  Then, in 1701, a school of mathematical and navigational sciences was created.  But the first and second became only the foundation for the emergence of a separate movement - the Cadets of Russia. </p><p>  Peter the Great was a proponent of geodesy, and the main vocation of these schools was to teach the boys the theory of mapping.  Previously, children were sent to Europe for quality knowledge.  But later it was too costly for the empire.  It is this principle that laid the foundation for the creation of military institutions of various directions. </p><p>  So, in 1721 the first garrison schools were built, which in character resembled a cadet corps.  They took the sons of soldiers.  From 7 to 15 years they studied military sciences, after which they served in the army.  The initiator was Count Mikhin, who arrived in Russia at the invitation of Peter I to manage the engineering process.  Popularly, such schools were called "knightly academies."  Indeed, young people were taught not only literacy, but also high aesthetic sciences. </p><p>  In general, the main reason why it was popular to send children to closed schools was that they gave good knowledge and a good start for professional growth. </p><h2>  Craft development </h2><p>  Subsequently, a plan of changes was developed in line with military training.  Institutions spread to different cities of the empire.  In the middle of the 19th century, a cadet was a guy who received military training along with general knowledge.  He could continue serving as an officer.  So, from cadets, students suddenly turned into leaders.  Every day they were trained in combat training, and then they showed results in front of the king. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

Often such clashes led to riots.

    <p>  At one time, more than 40 such schools worked on the territory of the Russian Empire. </p><h2>  What cadets are studying </h2><p>  Today, a cadet is primarily a high school student, but with the addition of special subjects to the curriculum.  The average training time is 3 years.  But there are schools where the duration of education is much higher and can reach 6 years.  Most often, children are accepted after the end of the 9th grade.  Depending on the building, there are institutions that work with younger children, starting from the 5th. </p><p>  Before deciding which school to go to, you still need to determine not only the age, but also the direction in which the school will teach.  Particular attention is paid to gymnastics and physical fitness.  Additional classes are engineering, medicine, topography and military regulations.  An important role in the education of cadets is assigned to aesthetic bias.  Also, in accordance with the corps to which the student belongs, he can study specific sciences.  In the 21st century, both boys and girls can enter cadets equally easily. </p>

    <h2>  Everyday life of the cadets </h2><p>  The main criterion for choosing students is an excellent physical and psychological state of health.  The second is associated with significant loads and a tight schedule for the school day.  In addition, cadets study in closed boarding schools.  So, they can see their relatives only at the weekend.  The most important in the educational process is considered strict discipline for students.  Since 1732 in the first cadet corps they wore uniforms, this tradition continues today. </p><p>  In addition to wearing military clothes, young people march, keep watch and turn to senior in rank.  A big plus for such an education is a maximum approximation to the real conditions of army life.  All kinds of sports camps and field training are held. </p><p>  But the most important stage is the traditional cadet oath.  The young warrior promises not only to obediently fulfill his new duties, but also to serve his homeland and to defend it if the enemy attacks. </p>

    <h2>  First step to the dream </h2><p>  Educational institutions today offer not only excellent education, but also many benefits for their future wards.  So, for example, children whose military parents died while performing their duties can study for free in such institutions.  Also, those whose fathers are currently working on particularly important tasks.  There is a possibility of free education for orphans.  An opportunity is also provided for children from large families. </p><p>  For approval, you must also take care of such documents as an extract with grades for the last semester and a characteristic from a previous school. </p>

Due to the high sports workload, adolescents with poor health are not recommended to study at the school.  Also, a psychologist conducts work with them, which determines whether the child is ready to emotionally begin a new independent life.  And only after careful checks the student is awaiting initiation into cadets.  Shoulder straps will be given out only to the biggest patriots of their dreams.

    <h2>  Problems of modern learning </h2><p>  It seems that so much time has been separating Russia from the Soviet Union.  But unfortunately, the country is still working on the imperial system and is not trying to change this.  Contemporaries are faced with remnants that still hang out in the country's politics, since a new training system has not yet been formed.  Old professors work according to the anachronistic scheme that they were taught on the territory of the Union.  Party propaganda has long been outdated, but the century is the foundation for a new generation.  Also, the goal to which the students should reach is incomplete. </p>

In addition, the graduate marks of the cadet are equal to the points of a simple student.  That is, the Cadets of Russia are not at all protected in the face of strict reality.
