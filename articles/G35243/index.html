    <h2>  Oriental Tea Ceremony - Meditation to Soul </h2><p>  Today, many are keen on the east - did not think why?  Why, for example, do Japanese and Chinese attach so much importance to following certain rituals?  Eastern wisdom teaches that this brings some order to our life, adds meaning to it and eliminates unnecessary throwing and doubt.  The ritual itself is not important, its strict observance is important, methodical and calm.  This is a peculiar desire to achieve perfection in every action, no matter what it leads to. </p><p>  Orientalists call Chinese tea drinking one of such simple and very important rituals.  It gives inner harmony and allows you to leave the hustle and bustle beyond.  This is a very special atmosphere that reigns between well-knowing each other or unfamiliar people.  In the Middle Kingdom they believe that during tea drinking time changes its course, clinging to space, state and leaving only fire, water and a tea leaf in the spotlight.  Anyone who has never attended a Chinese tea ceremony might think that everything said is too exaggerated.  But people who have already participated in it do not need to say anything - they already felt the full value of this slow and enchanting action on themselves. </p><p>  And although the address of the "Golden City" in Tula is central Russia, the tea ceremony is organized here with careful observance of many little things.  Everything is just like in the Middle Kingdom. </p>

    <h2>  Paint shooting </h2><p>  Paintball in the "Golden City" of the Tula region also appeared recently.  Mobile emotional game.  Imagine that your boss is on the opposing team - with what pleasure you will shoot him!  A second such chance may not be presented.  The essence of the game is that the two teams are fighting among themselves, and the weapon is a pneumatic gun that shoots with paint balls.  When hit by the target, they leave a characteristic mark on the enemy‚Äôs suit.  Everything is completely safe, but very exciting.  This is where there is the opportunity to be in the role of James Bond with chases, ambushes and all the other pleasures of a superhero. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  What do the reviews about the "Golden City" in the Tula region say?  Most vacationers note a warm welcome and service at a high level.  Very helpful staff.  Visitors noticed the perfect cleanliness of the building and the complex.  Many newlyweds wrote that their wedding was wonderful, and the organization was impeccable. </p>
