The conditions and available directions of international delivery will be discussed later in this article.  There are various modes of delivery for goods of various weights.  So, a shipment weighing up to twenty kilograms can be delivered under the following conditions: "Delivery by the specified time" or "Economy mail delivery".  If the weight of the cargo exceeds twenty kilograms, the conditions of the Economy or Express modes are applied to it. </p><p>  The option "Delivery on time" will be considered further separately.  As employees of the Pony Express company report this service, it enjoys inexhaustible popularity among customers. </p><p>  What is the "Mail Delivery" mode?  If time does not play such a big role for you, and the shipment weighs less than twenty kilograms, then this service is a good way to save your money. </p><p>  Goods can be delivered in accordance with the conditions of the following modes: </p><ul><li>  ‚ÄúFreight-express‚Äù (weight of departure - more than twenty kilograms; delivered urgently). </li><li>  "Cargo-econom" (transportation is not fast; the cost is much lower; the weight of the item exceeds twenty kilograms). </li><li>  "Direct car" (the volume of cargo is so large that it can fully load the car; transport is selected depending on the nature of the departure). </li><li>  "Express mail delivery" (departure weight - less than twenty kilograms; destination - Russian Federation or one of the CIS countries). </li><li>  ‚ÄúDocuments‚Äù (nature of departure - documents; cargo weight does not exceed five kilograms; destination - Russian Federation or CIS countries). </li><li>  ‚ÄúNon-documents‚Äù (express delivery; nature of departure - non-documentary; cargo weight does not exceed twenty kilograms). </li></ul>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Delivery on time </h2><p>  As reported by the Pony Express carrier about this service, employee reviews indicate that customers are very often interested in this delivery mode.  Of course, in the modern world, time is of particular importance. </p><p>  There are several different modes of providing the service in question.  Among them are: </p><ul><li>  "Express 10:00."  It implies the delivery of mail to the destination on six possible routes in the Russian Federation directly to the beginning of the working day. </li><li>  "Express 14:00."  The company guarantees high-quality transportation of a shipment, the mass of which does not exceed twenty kilograms, across the territory of the Russian Federation and its delivery to the destination no later than fourteen o'clock in the afternoon. </li><li>  "Express 18:00."  Pony Express will make sure that by the end of the working day the departure reaches its destination in a number of large cities of the Russian Federation. </li></ul><p>  Now you can accurately and correctly plan the logistics and time of all your mailings without any obstacles.  Why do customers choose this particular service?  There are a number of reasons for this: </p><ul><li>  The company provides financial guarantees that the shipment will be delivered on time. </li><li>  Pony Express is committed to handling this kind of cargo in the first place. </li><li>  The carrier offers such customers a wider range of extra services. </li></ul><p>  Now, as <span>staff reviews (Moscow)</span> have noticed about the Pony Express services, thanks to this option, accuracy can become your main competitive advantage. </p><h2>  International shipments </h2><p>  There is another feature of the "Pony Express."  Reviews say that this company delivers a variety of items to more than two hundred different countries in the world.  The maximum weight transported on one invoice is five kilograms. </p><p>  Tariffs for the transportation in question are calculated in accordance with which group of countries the destination belongs to. </p><p>  There are six tariff zones in which Pony Express is delivered.  Reviews recommend that you familiarize yourself with this information in advance in order to calculate the cost of transportation.  The following tariff zones are allocated: A (Ireland, Austria, Spain, Italy, England, Northern Ireland, Belgium, Latvia, Lithuania, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, Wales, Germany, Finland, France, Denmark, Netherlands, Switzerland, Norway , Sweden, Scotland, Estonia, Vatican), B (Iceland, Romania, Antilles, Canada, Armenia, Ashgabat, Cyprus, Barbuda, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Slovenia, Tajikistan, United States of America, Hungary, Venezuela, Virgin Islands, controlled by England, Virgin Islands controlled by the United States  Ricky, Turkmenistan, Turkey, Greece, Georgia, Croatia, Czech Republic, Dushanbe, Yerevan, Poland), C (Australia, San Marino, Kenya, China, Serbia, Singapore, Brunei, Thailand, Taiwan, Malao, Malaysia, Micronesia, Trinidad and Tabago, Hong Kong, Fiji, Philippines, New Zealand, New Caledonia, Channel Islands, Israel, Papua New Guinea, India, South Korea, Indonesia, Japan), D (Puerto Rico, Anguilla, Saipan, Cayman Islands, El Salvador , Antigua, Santa Lucia, Argentina, St. Bartholomew, Aruba, Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Colombia, Saint Vincent,  Saint Kitts, Belize, Costa Rica, Saint Martin, Saint Eustace, Curacao, Bolivia, Bonaire, Brazil, Suriname, <span>Turks and Caicos Islands,</span> Guyana, Martinique, Marshall Islands, Guadeloupe, Mexico, Guatemala, Uruguay, Montserrat, Honduras, Grenada, French Guiana, Guam, Nicaragua, Dominica, Chile, Dominican Republic, Sri Lanka, Ecuador, Pakistan, Panama, <span>South Africa,</span> Paraguay, Peru, Jamaica), E (Qatar, Oman, Bahrain, Kuwait, Syria, Lebanon, Nepal, United Arab Emirates, Eritrea, Jordan), F (Reunion, American Samoa, Runada, Yemen, An  ola, Cambodia, Cameroon, Canary Islands, Capo Verde, Swaziland, Kiribati, Northern Mariana Islands, Seychelles, Senegal, Congo, Saint Lucia, Benin, Cook Islands, Ivory Coast, Bermuda, Laos, Lesotho, Liberia, Botswana , Solomon Islands, Libya, Sudan, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Sierra Leone, Bhutan, Mauritius, Vanuatu, Mauritania, Madagascar, Tahiti, Tanzania, Malawi, Vietnam, Mali, Togo, Gabon, Maldives, Tonga, Haiti, Morocco , Tuvalu, Gambia, Tunisia, Ghana, Uganda, Guinea, Mozambique, Guinea Bissau, M  Ngola, Faroe Islands, Myanmar, Niger, Nigeria, Central African Republic, Namibia, Greenland, Chad, Djibouti, Egypt, Zaire, Zambia, Western Samoa, <span>Cape Verde Islands,</span> Palau and Zimbabwe, Ethiopia), G (Sao Tome, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, North Korea, Comoros, Mayot, Nauru, <span>Equatorial Guinea,</span> Norfolk). </p>

    <h2>  Packaging </h2><p>  About another nice feature of the company, reviews say: ‚ÄúPony Express‚Äù for most items provides free packaging with company symbols of this carrier. </p><p>  This can be a particularly durable plastic bag designed for loads up to five kilograms, or a cardboard envelope that can withstand the effects of moisture on the shipment. </p><p>  If the client wishes, he can use his own material for packaging.  It is important that it matches the contents of the shipment and how it is planned to be delivered to the addressee. </p><p>  Special protective signs on the packages allow avoiding unauthorized opening of the consignment with its subsequent repacking.  This guarantees the confidentiality and safety of the goods. </p><h2>  Cargo insurance </h2><p>  Cargo insurance coverage is another attractive feature of the carrier in question, as reviews say.  When registering this service, Pony Express always compensates for damage that was caused to the ship by accident or during transportation by any means of transport of the company or the carriers cooperating with it during transportation both within the country and abroad. </p><p>  The company is only liable for the goods indicated on the consignment note that are permitted for transportation by current state legislation.  If the item was lost that was not recorded in the invoice or one that is officially prohibited for transportation, the damage will not be compensated.  Therefore, it is important to carefully read in advance what rules, requirements and standards are established by the legislation today in this regard. </p><p>  It is important to accurately indicate the declared cost of departure, because insurance compensation will be carried out taking into account it. </p>
