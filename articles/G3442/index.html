  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The interactive side of communication. general characteristics</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The interactive side of communication is a conditional concept that includes a description of the components associated with the interaction of people in it, as well as the organization of their joint work.  It is being studied by the industry in <span>social psychology,</span> which is engaged in socio-psychological analysis.  We are talking about "symbolic interactionism", the founder of which was Mead. </p><p>  The scientist proved the following postulates: </p><ul><li>  in the social nature of the human "I" communication will play a significant role; </li><li>  the personality is formed as the sum of the reactions of the human psyche to the opinions of everyone around and in the process of joint activity; </li><li>  the most basic is the situation of interaction and the interactive side of communication. </li></ul><p>  In modern psychology, more attention is paid to the following points. </p><p>  Firstly, the typology of interaction in communication can be divided into two main types - competition and cooperation.  The first implies that people will put their interests above everything else, the second - to strive for common goals. </p><p>  Secondly, the interactive side of communication includes the presence of public control.  It is carried out through a system of social patterns and norms that are accepted in this society.  They govern all social relationships and interactions. </p><p>  Thirdly, each person should be guided by these norms and correlate their actions with them.  Further, he will select the necessary, correct and those that regulate relationships with other people. </p><p>  Fourthly, the interactive side of communication includes the system of roles that each person plays in interacting at home, at work, with friends and relatives.  Very often they clash with each other because they have to prioritize.  As a result, conflicts very often arise. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  They are most often studied precisely when the interactive side of communication is being considered.  Psychology distinguishes two large groups of <span>causes of conflict</span> : </p><ul><li>  subject-business; </li><li>  personal. </li></ul><p>  Let us dwell in more detail on their characteristics.  Subject-business causes of conflicts arise when material interests are affected in the interaction.  Personal ones - most often relate to <span>self-esteem</span> and self-esteem. </p><p>  The protracted conflict leads to the emergence of a semantic barrier when there is a discrepancy of opinions, requirements, orders, and further communication only leads to an aggravation of the situation. </p><p>  The interactive side of communication has three main factors that are important.  We are talking about the distance between people, mutual orientation, the presence of external barriers.  It is necessary to characterize each of them. </p><p>  The distance between people will depend on the specifics of their interaction.  So, when pronouncing pleasant information to another person, we strive to come closer and look into his eyes.  And, on the contrary, in an unpleasant situation we will try to move away. </p><p>  Orientation implies the features of the location of the interlocutors in relation to each other.  For example, face-to-face, or face-to-neck, and so on. </p><p>  Eye contact is very important.  Studies show that a person will look into the eyes of his interlocutor if he wants to show devotion and love.  Or, if you wish, to demonstrate strength and aggression. </p><p>  An external barrier will contribute to a deterioration in the quality of interaction.  When <span>establishing relationships,</span> it is recommended to remove chairs, tables, bags and more. </p><p>  Therefore, the interactive side of <span>communication</span> is very important <span>.</span>  <span>The psychology of</span> each person must constantly adapt to its features so that the interaction is more productive. </p>
