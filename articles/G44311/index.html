    <h2>  Features of the technical aspect </h2><p>  What is a PBX?  The easiest way to disassemble this is the example of its technical support.  From this point of view, a service of this nature can be provided with several possibilities.  What is a PBX decryption is worth knowing, as well as getting acquainted with the disadvantages, advantages and features of a technical nature.  The method of technical support is selected depending on what type of activity a particular company is engaged in. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Types of services </h2><p>  Often, in the production market, their customers are offered combined services.  What is a PBX, it will be more clear after we consider the options: </p><ul><li>  The equipment that is provided.  For the organization, it is allocated by the so-called subscriber gateway or server using software.  These devices are usually installed in the premises of the direct employer.  But in the customer‚Äôs company, phones are installed that have IP addresses, as well as a software application for these devices.  In addition, programs of an updated type are installed with an orientation on the task of business development. </li><li>  Also on the market, the installation of the so-called platform is quite widespread.  Each <span>corporate client</span> acquires a virtual machine, which includes an operating system and software.  Communication machines similar to the previous service may also be installed in this machine. </li><li>  The third type of service is the provision of a domain to the office of the company.  An individual entity, that is, the domain itself, is singled out to organize the promotion of the company.  He also has his own types of settings, which each consumer will be able to customize exclusively for themselves. </li><li>  Combining common communication services into one tariff plan.  This tariff plan has its own short numbering plan.  In this case, it implies its additional features of a rather interesting nature.  The equipment consists in the integrated voice menu and autoinformer. </li></ul><p>  Now it has become much more clear what it is - an office telephone exchange.  It is also worth noting the fact that the management of this virtual telephone exchange is provided exclusively by the tenant of this station.  As a rule, control is carried out directly using a computer or a mobile device.  The person who rents this station can hire special operators who will carry out this function. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Virtual PBX service is provided for regular customers free of charge.  Connection is carried out only with regular replenishment of the account.  It is a replenishment of the account at least once every three months.  In the event that one or another client does not replenish the account more than this period, then a fine of five US dollars is imposed.  The entire system of this user may also be blocked. </p><p>  If you just forgot to replenish your account, the service provider is likely to remind you of this.  After all, the organization often sends a notification to its client that they do not have enough funds in the account and need to replenish it.  Further, the user himself makes one or another decision: either replenish the account or disable the PBX. </p>
