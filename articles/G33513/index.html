Such was the extraordinary Winston Churchill, books about which they write today, and also make films that open unfamiliar pages of his biography.  Some points remain a mystery today. </p>

    <h2>  Birth and family </h2><p>  At the end of November 1874, in the Blenheim Palace of the Duke of Marlborough, they were preparing for the ball.  Lady Churchill certainly wished to attend.  She was discouraged, but she was adamant, which led to some circumstances that disrupted the evening.  It just so happened that Winston Churchill was born on a mountain of women's coats, hats and other outerwear, piled up in a heap in the room that served the guests as an impromptu wardrobe. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Raising a red and not very beautiful child was engaged mainly in the nanny Everest.  The influence of this remarkable woman on the future politician was enormous, and he always kept her photograph in a prominent place in all his offices, obviously, comparing his actions with the moral guidelines laid down by her for the rest of his life.  This is how Winston Churchill expressed his gratitude, whose biography testifies that the nanny was a right and wise man. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="winston churchill sayings" class="if" height="229" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10920/385977.jpg?1398883992524" width="276"></div></h2><h2>  School, adolescence </h2><p>  Little Winston was not a child prodigy.  Although he possessed excellent memory, he used it only when he was interested in the subject being studied.  The diction of the boy was so-so, he did not pronounce some letters at all, but he was distinguished by verbosity.  To exact sciences, Greek and Latin, he showed complete indifference, but he loved his native English, he studied it with pleasure. </p><p>  A descendant of an aristocratic family and had to study in a special school.  This was Ascot, a privileged educational institution in which Winston Churchill spent several years.  Then the young man was transferred to the Harrow high school, also famous for its long traditions.  Parents believed that the son of stars from the sky was not enough, and so it was, and therefore determined his military career.  In the Royal Cavalry School of the Royal Army "Sandhurst" the young man could enter in 1893 only the third time.  Two years later, his father died.  For the son, the death of a beloved and respected parent was a great loss, despite a certain mutual misunderstanding.  Childhood ended, the young man turned into an adult man. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Beginning of parliamentary activity </h2><p>  Having the asset of higher education, the military rank of lieutenant and noble birth, Winston Churchill, whose biography as a politician was just beginning, won the parliamentary elections of 1900.  Despite the fact that he ran for the conservative party, they showed sympathy, rather, to its opponents - the liberals.  Such a contradiction was expressed in the fact that he himself defined his status as an ‚Äúindependent conservative‚Äù, which created many problems for him, but this line of conduct also had advantages.  Conflicts with party members created a certain scandal, which contributed to greater fame in political circles.  Due to the fact that during his speeches many parliamentarians, and sometimes the Prime Minister himself, defiantly left the courtroom, Winston Churchill was spotted by <span>Lloyd George.</span>  In 1904, he left the ranks of the Conservatives. </p>

    <h2>  Colonial Minister </h2><p>  The eloquence of the senator attracted attention to him, and proposals for cooperation with various constituencies were not slow in waiting.  Those of them that were not interesting to Churchill, he unconditionally dismissed, but in 1906 he agreed to become a minister in charge of the affairs of the colonies.  The importance of overseas territories for the well-being of the British Empire was enormous, and even then the politician's patriotism manifested itself, expressed in the priorities of the power's interests over other considerations.  The results for a short time were very impressive, and the efforts were noticed and appreciated at the highest level, including the entourage of Edward VII and the monarch himself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  <span>The political crisis of</span> 1908 ended with the resignation of Prime Minister Campbell Bannerman, whose place was soon taken by Asquith.  He invited Churchill to take up the Royal <span>Navy,</span> but was refused.  War was not expected in the near future, and without it, the post of Minister for the Navy did not bode well.  The reaction was the same with regard to another post of the Minister of Self-Government, although for a different reason, Churchill was simply not interested in the topic.  But he wished to engage in trade, although at first glance it did not promise any political dividends. </p>

    <h2>  Marriage </h2><p>  Winston Churchill was so busy with political affairs for a long time that his friends had already begun to doubt that he would ever marry, but they were mistaken.  Despite more than modest external data and constant official workload, he nevertheless found the opportunity to meet a very beautiful girl, charm her (obviously, with intelligence and eloquence) and lead him down the aisle.  The daughter of a dragoon colonel officer - Clementine Josier - was charming, educated, intelligent, fluent in two foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äã(German and French).  Even the owners of the most evil languages ‚Äã‚Äãcould not suspect Winston's selfish motives: there was practically no dowry, except, of course, the personal qualities of the bride and her noble Irish-Scottish origin. </p>

    <h2>  Minister of Internal Affairs </h2><p>  At the age of thirty-five, Churchill became Minister of Law and Order, occupying one of the key posts in the Empire.  Now he had to answer for the police of the capital, bridges, roads, correctional facilities, agriculture and even fishing.  Also, the duties of the Minister of the Interior, according to the old English tradition, included the indispensable presence during childbirth in the royal family, the proclamation of heirs to the throne, the writing of reports on the work of parliament, which made it possible for Churchill to demonstrate his literary talents at the highest level.  He did this with great pleasure. </p>

    <h2>  On the eve of the great war </h2><p>  The fact that the "cold" contradictions between countries rich in colonies and Germany and Austria-Hungary deprived of them sooner or later develop into a "hot" conflict, someone might have doubted, but not Winston Churchill.  Based on data obtained from intelligence and defense experts, he drafted a memorandum for the prime minister on military aspects in Europe, stating the practical inevitability of the impending war.  After that, the country's leadership undertook a peculiar castling, swapping Macken and Churchill, as a result of which the author of the report received the fleet, which he had previously abandoned.  It was 1911, serious events were brewing.  With the task of preparing Royal Navy for the upcoming naval battles, the new minister coped. </p><h2>  First war </h2><p>  The start date of the military conflict was determined by the British government quite accurately.  The usual naval maneuvers in 1914 were canceled, a hidden partial mobilization was carried out, after the traditional parade on July 17, the ships were not sent to their places of permanent deployment, and on the orders of the Admiralty they kept their concentration.  After the war between the central powers and Russia began, Churchill took upon himself the responsibility of declaring the complete mobilization of the fleet, without waiting for a government decision.  This step could cost him dismissal, but everything worked out, the decision was recognized as correct, and a day later his actions were approved.  On the fourth of August, Britain declared war on Germany and Austria-Hungary. </p><h2>  Post-war life </h2><p>  The events of the First World War are well-known: after the defeat of Germany and the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the world, and primarily Europe, faced the problem of the spread of communism.  Winston <span>Churchill's</span> anti-Marxist position, his <span>statements</span> on this subject indicate his conviction of the need to destroy the Bolshevik regime in Russia.  But economically, Western countries, exhausted by a four-year massacre, were not ready for large-scale military intervention.  As a result of the impossibility of an armed struggle against communism, the leaders of a democratic Europe, and then the whole world, were forced to recognize Soviet power.  Churchill's role as Minister of War by the year 1921 became secondary.  This, of course, upset him, but the troubles were ahead.  In the same year he suffered real sorrows: first the death of his mother (and she was not yet old, only 67 years old), then the two-year-old daughter Marygold. </p><p>  Zeal and energy, as well as a new job, helped the couple recover from a terrible double sorrow.  Churchill again becomes minister for the colonies, but the 1922 election ends catastrophically: he does not get into parliament.  Churchill decides to relax a bit with his wife in France.  It seemed that the career was over. </p><h2>  Parliament again </h2><p>  In the first half of the twenties, Churchill had an influential political enemy - Bonar Lowe, who served as prime minister.  In 1923, he became seriously ill and no longer recovered.  The disgraced politician managed to establish contact with Baldwin, the new leader of the conservatives, but the first two attempts to return to parliament were unsuccessful.  From the third time, he nevertheless returned to a respected assembly, winning the election from Epping County, and at the same time received the chair of the Minister of Finance.  In 1929, the Labor Party replaced the conservatives in power, and for a decade Churchill‚Äôs active nature was not able to express.  He had to follow the development of events in Germany, which by the mid-thirties was increasingly clearly reviving economically and militarily, becoming a formidable rival for Britain. </p>

    <h2>  Prewar expectations </h2><p>  Few British politicians understood the role of aviation in the coming war as deeply as Winston Churchill.  Photo and newsreels depicting Neville Chamberlain, waving an agreement signed in Munich, documented the complacency of the then European peacekeepers, who made concessions to Nazi Germany in the second half of the thirties. </p><p>  Meanwhile, in Britain for about two years now, a secret government committee has been operating to monitor the strengthening of the state‚Äôs defense capabilities.  Its member was Winston Churchill, whose statements regarding the prospects for pacification of Hitler were pessimistic.  Even then, he was distinguished by paradoxical and non-standard thinking, arguing that, looking too far ahead, people act short-sightedly.  Winston preferred to deal with pressing and urgent issues.  In particular, thanks in large part to the efforts of the committee, the Royal Air Force received Spitfire and Hurricane fighters capable of withstanding the Messerschmitts by the start of the war. </p><h2>  The finest hour, the second war with Germany </h2><p>  After the attack on Poland and the declaration of war on Germany in 1939, Britain fought Hitlerism alone for almost two years.  June 22, 1941 was a holiday for Churchill.  Upon learning of the German attack on the USSR, he realized that the war could be considered won.  Winston Churchill, whose biography was connected with the struggle against communism, at that time wanted nothing as much as the success of the Red Army.  Being in an extremely difficult economic situation, Great Britain provided military assistance to the USSR, supplying military goods.  The ability to sacrifice even one‚Äôs own convictions for the sake of saving one‚Äôs own country is a sign of a true patriot and wise politician.  However, this deviation in views was temporary and forced.  The declared and demonstrated sympathy for the Soviets gave way to outright hostility by the beginning of the Big Three conference in Potsdam. </p><p>  During the war, strong-willed qualities are most pronounced.  Winston Churchill was no exception.  His biography in those years entered the brightest phase, he perfectly combined eloquence with the ability to resolve military-political and economic issues.  It was difficult to call his words concise, but in some of his verbosity the British found what they lacked so much: confidence in victory and good spirits.  However, one of his aphorisms expressed the opinion that silence is often a sign that a person simply has nothing to say.  He also said once that only the inhabitants of Albion can rejoice that things are bad.  There was no politician in the United Kingdom, which was as popular as Winston <span>Churchill.</span>  <span>Quotes</span> from his speeches were passed on to each other by the inhabitants of London and Coventry, Liverpool and Sheffield, suffering from bombing and hardship.  They made many smile.  It was the high point of the premiere. </p>

    <h2>  After battle </h2><p>  The Second World War ended.  Winston Churchill resigned at the end of May 1945, sharing with the Conservative Party her defeat in the next election.  Well, this is the essence of Western democracy, for which the recent, but already past merits mean little.  Winston Churchill's aphorisms concerning this form of government are distinguished by special malice, reaching cynicism.  So, he quite seriously argued that democracy is only that good, that all other methods of governing the country are even worse, and to be disappointed in it, just talk a little with the ‚Äúaverage voter‚Äù. </p><p>  However, the threat that in many countries would get worse after the war was real.  Stalinist communism advanced across the planet using a wide variety of methods - from power to sophisticatedly insidious.  The Cold War began immediately after the victory over fascism, but it was marked by a speech in the American city of Fulton, which in 1946, on March 5, exactly seven years before the death of Joseph Stalin, Winston Churchill delivered.  Interesting facts and coincidences accompanied him all his life.  The attitude of the British politician to "Uncle Joe" was ambiguous, as Western politicians called the Soviet leader Stalin.  Churchill's hostility and rejection of Marxist ideas were combined with genuine respect for the outstanding personality of a person who was sometimes his ally or enemy. </p><p> The prime minister‚Äôs attitude to alcohol is interesting.  According to him, he received more from alcohol than he gave.  In old age, Churchill joked that if in his youth he did not drink before lunch, then now he has a different rule: in no case do not take strong drinks before breakfast.  According to the memoirs of his grandson, his grandfather began the day with a glass of whiskey (not such a small portion), but no one had ever seen him drunk.  Of course, such habits do not deserve to be imitated, but, as the Russian proverb says, you won‚Äôt erase words from a song. </p><p>  The literary works written by Winston Churchill are also interesting.  The books tell about colonial wars, in particular, about the Afghan and Anglo-Boer campaigns, about the struggle against world communism, as well as about many other historical events in which the author took part.  The texts are distinguished by an excellent syllable and subtle humor, characteristic of this outstanding person. </p><p>  Churchill had to occupy the prime minister‚Äôs chair twice.  The last time he headed the British government in 1951 at the age of 77.  Old years affected the general condition of the body, it became increasingly difficult for him to work.  ‚ÄúSir Winston Churchill‚Äù - since 1953, when the young Elizabeth II - the new Queen of England - awarded him the Order of the Garter, it was necessary to turn to the prime minister.  British law does not provide for more honor.  He became a knight, and only the monarch considered a higher social position. </p><h2>  Goodbye politics! </h2>

    <p>  Covered with a veil of secrecy is information about how Winston Churchill left politics.  A brief biography, studied by British schoolchildren and students, contains information about accepting his resignation without undue hype in 1955.  The removal from power took place gradually, over almost four months.  The respect, reverence, and tact shown by senior British leadership during this process deserve separate words.  The whole life of a politician was devoted to serving the homeland and taking care of its interests, which was noted by many awards (both royal and foreign). </p><p>  Great Churchill lived another ten years.  A new era has come, the war began in faraway Vietnam, the youth went crazy about their idols, the Rolling Stones and the Beatles conquered the world, the ‚Äúflower children‚Äù - hippies - preached universal love, and all this was so unlike secular the political life of the beginning of the century when young Winston began his long journey in politics. </p><p>  An outstanding prime minister died in early 1965.  The magnificent multi-day farewell ceremony was not inferior in solemnity to the royal funeral.  Churchill found his last peace with his parents in the usual city cemetery in Blandon. </p>
