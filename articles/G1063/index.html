    <p>  In combination with the high resolution of the corresponding module - up to 4800 points, the FINE concept, as many experts say, really involves creating high-quality photos on the printer.  It can be noted that for this MFP, a separate series of cartridges - XL FINE, characterized primarily by cost-effectiveness, has been released.  So, according to some reports, they are approximately 30% more effective than standard printing components. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  Among the useful resources that become available to the user who has purchased the Canon MFP under consideration are specialized programs that come with the device.  So, many customer reviews of the Canon Pixma MG2440 contain positive ratings from the My Image Garden program.  This type of software has a wide range of capabilities for organizing and managing photographs.  The program also allows you to use the MFP scanning modules and access various online resources. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Auto Clip feature, which is performed by the Easy-WebPring EX extension, installed on Internet Explorer, is noteworthy.  With it, the user can find the desired multimedia files on the Internet and print them.  This program also allows you to combine the contents of several web pages on one sheet with subsequent printing or saving as a document in PDF format. </p><p>  The owner of this Canon MFP is also available with the Creative Park Premium cloud service.  It allows you to work with photos, create cards or, for example, calendars. </p>

    <h2>  Scan Module Specifications </h2><p>  Let us now examine some of the parameters that characterize the Canon Pixma MG2440 scan module.  The reviews of many users indicate that it is used no less intensively than the print unit.  The type of scanner installed in the corresponding module is a flatbed one.  The maximum resolution of the device in terms of the corresponding function is 600 by 1200 pixels.  A <span>color depth of</span> 40 bits is provided. </p><h2>  Work in Xerox mode </h2><p>  The photocopy function, in turn, involves the use of both of the above modules - print and scan, which are equipped with a Canon Pixma MG2440 MFP.  Reviews of digital enthusiasts who used the device, of course, also include the opinions of customers regarding the operation of the device in Xerox mode. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  The capabilities of the corresponding module are such that it is difficult to compare it with a copy machine, if only because the printing technology in this case is inkjet, and the scanner of this MFP is not adapted by default for quick photocopying.  Therefore, indicators reflecting the performance of the device when working in Xerox mode are very modest.  The device processes about 1-2 pages per minute.  However, as some reviews of the Canon Pixma MG2440 testify, the Xerox function is very necessary at a particular point in time, and even such indicators will be acceptable.  However, as noted by MFP users, the quality of the copies is excellent. </p><p>  Now we‚Äôll study in more detail how customers evaluate the Canon Pixma MG 2440 printer. User reviews can be divided into several categories: </p><p>  - reflecting the opinion about the functionality of the device; </p><p>  - evaluating the quality of printing, scanning and photocopying; </p><p>  - reflecting the opinion of the profitability of the device; </p><p>  - Evaluating the usability of the device. </p><p>  We study the specifics of the relevant reviews in more detail. </p><h2>  Reviews: device functionality </h2><p>  Regarding this aspect of the MFP, users note that the device is optimal for both home and office.  <span>The multifunctional device Canon Pixma MG</span> 2440 is moderately dimensional, not too noisy, combines key functions: printing, scanning, as well as working in Xerox mode.  Among the useful options noted by users are automatic on and off.  The first allows you to quickly use the necessary modules when the computer programmatically calls the printer or if the owner is going to use the MFP's hardware controls.  In turn, if the device is not used, the automatic shutdown function deactivates it, thereby contributing to the saving of electricity and reducing wear of parts. </p>

    <p>  Some users, however, note that they have questions for the manufacturer regarding the completeness of the device.  The fact is that they had to buy a cable that connects the Canon Pixma MG2440 8328b007 - USB Cable to the computer.  But users did not fix any difficulties in quickly finding this accessory for sale. </p><h2>  Reviews: print quality and other features </h2><p>  The category of devices to which the Canon Pixma MG2440 belongs to one of the key functions is inkjet photo printers.  Devices of this type are characterized by a rather narrow focus of technological solutions that are introduced by the manufacturer.  The most important thing in this case is that the printer provides printing of photographs and photocopying them, and, if necessary, other color images. </p>

    <p>  Therefore, comparing the <span>Canon Pixma MG2440 printer, reviews</span> of which in terms of the corresponding function are also often found on industry online portals, for example, with a laser printer or MFP in terms of printing texts is incorrect.  Perhaps the device will be able to provide comparable print quality of pages or even higher, but it is unlikely that it will be compared with a laser platform in terms of speed of sheet processing, as well as cost-effectiveness. </p><p>  Users, judging by the reviews, understand this and try to approach the assessment of the quality of the device objectively.  Regarding the main function to which the MFP is adapted - printouts, scanning and photocopying of photographs - the ratings of digital technology lovers are quite positive.  The printer prints high quality images in good color, it works great with common types of photo paper. </p><h2>  Reviews: profitability </h2><p>  We noted above that the device contains economical cartridges of the XL FINE type, which can provide 30% more efficient ink consumption compared to standard components of the corresponding type.  How do MFP users evaluate the practical performance of these cartridges?  Discussion of Canon Pixma MG2440 MFPs on industry portals is often accompanied by discussions to determine the real effectiveness of the respective print components. </p>

    <p>  The main difficulty in determining the position closest to an objective assessment is that users can use the printer in very different modes.  Even if in all cases we are talking about working with photographs, their color, brightness can also vary significantly.  As a result, one person can print 10 images on the MFP, and another, for example, 15-17.  The first, of course, will be a less positive review.  ‚ÄúOh, the Canon MG2440 Inkjet MFP did a great job,‚Äù writes the second.  Each of them will be right in its own way. </p><p>  But if you try to catch a certain trend in the users' assessments of the cost-effectiveness of this MFP - the assessment of the corresponding printer characteristics is generally positive.  At least many digital enthusiasts cite the fact that the XL FINE cartridges at their disposal lasted significantly longer than some older models. </p><h2>  Reviews: usability </h2><p>  The most important characteristic of any, probably, consumer electronic device is ease of use.  What do the owners of the Canon Pixma MG2440 say about the comfort of use of the device?  In general, the device is rated as very easy to use.  It does not have any unusual for a person who has any tangible experience in operating office equipment, management tools.  Work with this MFP, as users note, is very easy. </p><h2>  Prices </h2><p>  Our small review of the Canon Pixma MG2440 will be useful to supplement with information on pricing for the device.  In the catalogs of Russian suppliers of MFPs, it costs about 1,900 rubles.  A USB cable, which, as we noted above, is not included in the device‚Äôs kit, will cost another 100 rubles.  Users respond to the ratio of price and functionality of the device quite positively. </p><p>  So, we looked at the prices and reviews on the Canon Pixma MG2440 and found out that this device is characterized by manufacturability, functionality and a low price.  According to many users, the device can be considered economical.  Such an assessment is based on the practical experience of operating the device and is quite possibly due to the fact that this MFP has high-tech XL FINE cartridges.  Apart from the MFP itself, at the disposal of the user who bought the device is a set of convenient programs.  Useful online services are also available to him. </p>
