Of course, the Order of Glory was not the only significant state award associated with military merit.  However, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis particular regalia was that it was to be awarded to ordinary and junior officers for heroic deeds accomplished directly on the battlefields.  Initially, it was supposed to be called the Order of Bagration, but in the end the award received the name that exists today.

    <p>  Award history </p><p>  The first heroes assigned to regalia appeared in November 1943.  I would like to note that today it is not known exactly who exactly became the first owner of the order in question, since various wartime documents somewhat contradict each other in this matter.  Over its entire existence, more than one million people have been assigned the insignia.  Of these, full cavaliers - more than 2,500 heroes.  It is interesting that, unlike many other orders and medals that could be collectively awarded to military units and units, the soldiers were awarded the Order of Glory only for their personal courage and services to the Fatherland. </p>
