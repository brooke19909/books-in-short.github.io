It is constantly evolving, in spite of any crises.  The demand for the products of the plants operating here is growing.  And, therefore, there is also a need for qualified specialists.  And what can attract a person besides good work?  Of course, the solution to the housing problem.  The village of Red Field <span>in Chelyabinsk</span> just gives such a solution. </p><h2>  District History </h2><p>  At the beginning of the 20th century, the settlement was formed thanks to the Tolstoy brothers, who built a mill here.  Gradually, growing with houses, the village was inhabited by Poles, Tatars, Bashkirs, Russians.  The first school, barns, stables were built.  After the revolution, there were about 50 yards in the village of Krasnoe Pole near Chelyabinsk.  Now the population of the Krasnopolsky settlement totals more than 1.5 thousand people. </p><p>  Until the beginning of the 80s of the XX century, on the territory of more than 500 hectares, there were 4 settlements in the immediate suburbs of Chelyabinsk:  Red Field and the village  Prudny, the village of Klyuchi, the village of Zavaruhino. </p>

    <p>  In general, the outflow of the population has been observed in the regional centers of Chelyabinsk over the past few years, but the situation is stable in the Sosnovsky district.  And taking into account the active construction of residential buildings, social institutions, an increase of up to 400 thousand people is expected. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Cottage village </h2><p>  In the early 90s of the last century, the construction of the cottage village Krasnoe Pole near Chelyabinsk began.  But until 2015, only 10% of land plots were developed, although almost 250 plots went into private ownership. </p><p>  Construction went extremely slowly and exclusively by the owners of land allotments themselves without any government subsidies aimed at solving federal programs to improve the living conditions of the population. </p><p>  Now two cottage villages are being built on the territory of the Krasnopolsky rural settlement: Zvezdny and Radonezh. </p>

    <p>  All necessary communications are brought to the construction zone, to each site separately.  Further, the owners will themselves plan what and where they will be located. <br>  Given the low cost, the demand for these houses is quite high. </p><h2>  Residential areas </h2><p>  In addition to cottages in the Red Field of Chelyabinsk, residential neighborhoods with multi-storey buildings are also being built.  These are residential complexes "Ivushki" and "Maple".  The first housing was commissioned in the summer of 2016. </p><p>  Low price per meter - from 2.79 thousand rubles.  Various options for planning and decorating apartments make it possible even for low-income, young families to acquire their own housing. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  On the territory of the actively built Krasnopolsky settlement there is a kindergarten for 60 children, a school for 500 students, a stadium with a hockey box, a hospital, 7 shops and 4 consumer services.  And the plans - the construction of new objects of socio-cultural purpose. </p><p>  Transport connection with the city center is also developing.  If earlier it was possible to get only by car or from the Shagol railway station, walk almost 2 km, now public transport is going to Krasnoe Pole from Chelyabinsk.  You can get there by buses 132, 16, shuttle buses 3, 10. They all go to the village of Krasnoye Pole Chelyabinsk.  Minibuses 15, 39a, 44, 45 reach the village.  Shagol, from there you can walk on foot, breathe in fresh air, not polluted by emissions from plants. </p><h2>  Development plans </h2><p>  According to the development plan, the northern, eastern and western directions will be mastered, up to the natural forest borders, areas of main engineering networks. </p><p>  Earlier in this territory, the most populated were the village.  Red field and pos.  Prudny.  This means that the communications are failed and the land is suitable for agricultural activities.  Two kilometers in the northeast, there is the line of the railway station - Shagol and Esaulskaya at an equidistant distance from the village.  Highways of regional and federal significance pass through the village of Krasnoe Pole near Chelyabinsk. </p>

    <p>  The convenient location of the village, relative to the city center, is due to the tendency in recent years to live by the principle of "work in the city, life in the suburbs."  Relatively smooth natural landscape topography, proximity of natural water bodies, good ecology, since the area is located away from the industrial zone - these factors influenced the concept of the territory development. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Since mid-2015, new houses in the Krasnopolsky area have been populated, and new residents of houses under construction are waiting for their turn, show interest in the quality of life.  Not a single construction of residential or commercial premises is complete without turmoil. </p><p>  It is important that the building be erected in compliance with technical operational standards.  Developers in the Red Field of Chelyabinsk maintain these standards.  As elsewhere in new buildings, especially in new areas, utility systems still need to be debugged, but judging by the reviews about the Red Field of Chelyabinsk, tenants argue with the builders, nevertheless, they recommend buying apartments here. </p>

    <p>  Fully finished apartments, with excellent sound insulation, caring neighbors, rapidly developing socio-cultural and domestic sphere, solving the transport issue - all with a view of the beautiful forest from the window, fresh air, despite the proximity of the metropolis.  But it all started with the mill of two brothers 100 years ago ... </p>
