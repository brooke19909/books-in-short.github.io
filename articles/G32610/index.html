Tourists are happy to spend their holidays here.  In summer, the island has all the conditions for recreation, there is practically no rain, which means you can safely enjoy the wonderful weather.  The sea breeze smooths out the summer heat well, so being on the island is a pleasure.  Even those for whom the heat is simply contraindicated can spend their holidays here.  In particular, this applies to pensioners and children.  There are no health problems that can be significantly affected by fever.  Compared to other Greek islands, the beach season in Corfu comes later, but this does not affect the popularity of the island.  The hottest month is July, the air temperature reaches +28 <sup></sup> . But at this temperature the sea remains cool and fresh, its temperature does not exceed 22 degrees.  Due to such weather conditions, the island has become a popular tourist destination. </p><p>  If in July you can relax by the sea, then May and June can be devoted to spiritual enrichment.  Of course, you can also swim, but the air temperature is not too high at this time, so the weather conditions are more conducive to walks in parks and other attractions.  As for the latter, there are quite a lot of them.  Archaeological excavations are especially active in Corfu.  This action can be observed and even take an active part. </p><h2>  The best time to travel to Corfu </h2><p>  If a tourist intends to go only to the sea and relax to the sound of the surf, then it is best to implement his plan in July.  This is the warmest month of the year.  The water is warm enough, sometimes it reaches a peak temperature - 25 degrees.  This is a very comfortable indicator, even small children can swim in such water. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  August is not the best month for a calm and measured rest.  There is a full house on the island, it was during this period that the maximum number of tourists came here.  Prices during this period rise quite noticeably, even plane tickets are getting more expensive.  If a tourist does not have financial restrictions, then he can choose August for a vacation, and in order to save, it is better to come in July. </p><p>  The best time to relax is September.  The fact is that the flow of tourists is significantly reduced, workdays begin, children go to school and so on.  At the beginning of September, prices drop significantly, rest becomes affordable, but at the same time it is not inferior in August to its comfort.  The sea remains as warm, and hotels will gladly accept guests and even make discounts.  But in the second half of September, it is not recommended to go to Corfu: the weather changes begin, and it is very difficult to predict here whether it will be warm or the rainy season will begin.  Therefore, for the purpose of a comfortable and budget holiday, it is better to go to the island in the first half of September.  A trip with young children is also better to postpone for this period.  Pleasant climate, a small number of tourists - this is exactly what the baby needs. <br>  Well, having arrived on the island, you need to settle down somewhere, and, of course, I want to choose a worthy place.  Such a place could be a hotel Gelina Village <span>Hotel Resort Spa 4 *.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="corfu gelina village hotel resort spa 4" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1539059.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The journey from the airport to the hotel takes about an hour by bus in the highlands.  On arrival, you can go for breakfast, or you can immediately check in.  Despite the fact that the hotel is large enough, sometimes you have to wait for the guests to leave the hotel in advance.  Judging by the reviews, such a problem arises for almost everyone who book two-room apartments.  Previously, guests are accommodated in one-room rooms. </p><p>  But for this inconvenience, the hotel administration offers quite decent compensation.  Guests say that you can use the safe for free, change towels, dine at the water park and visit the fish restaurant at any time. </p>

    <p>  The coast, according to tourists, is just wonderful.  The entrance to the sea is gentle, which, again, pleases parents with children.  Soft sand at the bottom.  There are several entrances to the beach: through a huge slab, on stones or on sand near the Pirate bar.  There are no jellyfish in the sea, no dead fish, no nasty algae.  During a storm, this, of course, cannot be avoided. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2>

    <p>  The hotel operates on an all-inclusive basis.  There is an incredible amount of food here, but the lines are also huge.  For dinner, it is better to arrive on time.  Then you can find a free table, and all dishes will be available.  If you are late, you can wait in line for a long time at the table, and then for food.  For dinner, experienced tourists recommend going to a fish restaurant.  True, they serve fairly uniform seafood dishes.  But then you can avoid the hustle and bustle and hungry neighbors.  The assortment always has squid, fish soups, mussels with sauce, small fish in the form of chips.  Fruits are also served here.  To whom it is not enough, you can go to a supermarket located near the hotel and buy there anything you like. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Employees of the animation club are true professionals in organizing children's leisure.  Kids are entertained by the pool, in the water park, on the beach, and in any free area.  In the evening, adult programs are held.  Although small guests can have fun at the evening disco.  After this, you should definitely visit the water park.  Here you can see fakirs, magicians, and even yogis.  At a children's concert, your children can show all their talents.  Adults can laugh at the Comedy Club show, sing in karaoke or enjoy national dances. </p><p>  The hotel has a zoo.  Children really like to visit him and feed funny animals, which, by the way, are just crazy about all visitors.  They meet vacationers with joyful screams, who knows how. </p><p>  In the evenings, mosquitoes can be very annoying.  It is better to bring a remedy from them with you.  Not every room has mosquito nets, so it is better not to open the windows. </p><h2>  pros </h2>

    <ul><li>  Spacious two-room self-catering rooms. </li><li>  Great leisure for kids. </li><li>  Clear sea and gentle entry. </li><li>  A huge variety of delicious food. </li><li>  Helpful staff. </li><li>  Good spa area. </li><li>  The presence of a water park. </li><li>  Picturesque area. </li><li>  Working air conditioning. </li><li>  Very cheap chic dresses are sold in a nearby store. </li></ul><h2>  Minuses </h2><ul><li>  Not very convenient hotel location.  The complex is located in the northernmost part of the island, right on the beach.  Other hotels are located among the bays and cliffs, which looks more exotic.  Far to main attractions and the airport.  It‚Äôs almost impossible to go on an excursion with small children: everything is very far away. </li><li>  The local beach is considered the longest in Corfu.  The sand here is mixed with sharp pebbles, which can easily hurt your legs.  Children to the sea have to carry in their arms.  The beach is not very well maintained, and besides the sea, there‚Äôs nothing to look at.  The landscape is not particularly impressive. </li><li>  In the restaurant you can sometimes see dirty appliances.  But, fortunately, no cases of poisoning and infection were noticed. </li></ul><h2>  General impressions </h2><p>  Most tourists who visit Corfu recommend the Gelina Village Hotel Resort Spa 4 * hotel.  Tours here are not cheap, but in any case you will not regret it, especially if there is a question of rest with children.  For them, ideal conditions for a dull stay have been created.  Adults can also have a good time.  The hotel is located somewhat remotely from the sights, but without even going beyond its territory, you can enjoy a wonderful vacation among the picturesque nature of Greece.  Especially visitors flatter about local cuisine.  The hotel is very tasty food, so you should not spend money on trips to other restaurants.  Sea, beach, service - everything is on the level here.
