Venetian glass</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Murano is an island in Italy where the famous glass is made, the secret of which the local craftsmen have been guarding for centuries.  It is located northeast of the city of Venice, in the Venetian lagoon.  Murano is a small area, its area is only a little more than one and a half kilometers.  But his fame extends far beyond the borders of Venice, and even Italy.  The demand for glass, which is still being made here, the amazing beauty of its products attract tens of thousands of tourists to the island of Murano. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Murano Island" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1742483.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Remote areas of Venice </h2><p>  The city itself consists of dozens of different islands.  Bridges are thrown between many of them, and they are separated by canals.  But some - and rather large - areas of the city are quite far from its center.  They are scattered across the lagoon, and no one built bridges to them.  These areas include the island of Murano in Venice.  But there are other similar places here.  These are the <span>islands of Burano,</span> San Michele, Lido and Torcello.  The first of them is known for its needlewomen, embroideries and especially lace, as well as brightly colored houses.  San Michele is a Venetian cemetery.  Lido is famous for its beaches and film festival.  And the island of Torcello is completely different from other areas of the city.  It is quiet, small, with green meadows, ancient churches and Byzantine mosaics.  But Murano is the most popular and visited of all the Venetian islands.  His glass "art" is known throughout the world. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Murano island in venice" class="if" height="290" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1742482.jpg" width="600"></div>

How to get from Venice to the island of Murano?  You need to take routes 41-42 or 51-52 at the Santa Lucia train station or on the main pier on Roman Square (near <span>the Doge's Palace).</span>  The vaporetto departs approximately once every half an hour.  Moreover, the trip on this ‚Äúsea tram‚Äù in itself is a real excursion.  First, a vaporetto goes around Venice from the north, then stops at the Fondation Nuovo.  Further on the ship‚Äôs path there is an almost open sea - the Venetian lagoon.  Crossing it, the vaporetto makes another stop at the famous San Michele cemetery, where, incidentally, Joseph Brodsky is buried.  On the way, you will also see an interesting sculptural group ‚ÄúDante and Vergil‚Äù, installed directly in the water on a pontoon basis.  It takes about thirty to forty minutes to get from the city center to the island. </p><h2>  Infrastructure and Population </h2><p>  Murano is actually an archipelago.  These are seven tiny islets that are washed from all sides by the Venetian lagoon.  However, from time immemorial, they are interconnected by bridges, so they are perceived as a single whole.  The island is a self-governing district of the Venetian commune.  It has its own infrastructure, shops, administration, hospital.  About four to five thousand people live on the island.  And during its heyday - in the Renaissance - much more people settled here.  The population of the island in those years was more than thirty thousand.  However, now there are much more tourists on Murano than locals.  Although sometimes it seems incomprehensible how such a number of people could be placed on this small piece of land.  The island is a "Venice in miniature."  You can also walk on it only on foot.  It, like the main Venice, is divided in two by the Grand Canal, through which they ride gondolas. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Venetian lagoon" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1742490.jpg" width="600"></div>

Both the Romans and various tribes are ready here.  There was a city founded here and a fishing port, and a salt trading center.  In the <span>XI</span> century, monks of the Order of Kamaldul moved here.  At first the community was small.  Then they founded the monastery of San Michele di Murano, which later became the center of printing.  But the heyday of the island came at the end of the <span>XIII</span> century.  In 1291, the Government of Venice decided to transfer all the glass-blowing workshops of the city there.  By medieval standards of fire safety, this craft constantly threatened the surrounding inhabitants.  In the city, fires constantly flashed, and given that most of the houses in those years were wooden, you can imagine what damage the fire inflicted. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Venetian glass" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1742484.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Venetian glass island </h2><p>  In fact, it is, of course, Murano.  There are a lot of workshops on the island, where you can see firsthand the process of its manufacture.  According to tourists, this is a bewitching and simply magical sight.  And in souvenir shops you can buy different products - earrings, jewelry, accessories, decor for the interior - which is just not here ... And all this is of stunning color, incredible texture and amazing ornament.  Just keep in mind that it‚Äôs better to buy all this in more remote areas, and not in the center of the island.  Prices there may be lower.  But even if you do not have free money, you will spend half a day just looking at the windows and just moving from one workshop to another.  There is also a <span>Museum of Glass</span> on the island <span>,</span> where thousands of tourists flock every day.  And on the streets and courtyards are luxurious compositions in a modern style.  They are also made of glass. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Secrets of glass making </h2><p>  The production process has been secret for many years.  Venetian glass was one of the city‚Äôs income sources.  It was made using special technologies invented by local craftsmen.  It is not surprising that the government - the Council of Ten - did not even release craftsmen from this island.  The glassblowers who settled there had to stay there forever.  If such a master left the island, then he was declared a traitor, they secretly hunted and killed him, wherever he is.  But for such insulation glassblowers received huge privileges.  The daughters of the masters could marry aristocrats, and their children retained the titles of patricians. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Murano glass" class="if" height="295" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1742493.jpg" width="520"></div>

    <h2>  What was produced on the island? </h2><p>  Mostly mirrors and glasses were made on Murano, as well as various figures.  For a long time nowhere else in Europe did they know how to do this.  Then the range of production expanded significantly.  The products, besides their pretentiousness, seemed so weightless, as if soaring in the air.  This was written in books, and glass masterpieces were depicted in the paintings.  Murano Island became so famous that glassblowers were presented to guests by doges and various dignitaries.  When Venice paid tribute to the Turkish Sultan, she sent as a fee some of the masterpieces of her masters.  Glass-blowing art reaches its peak of glory by the <span>16th</span> century.  However, after a hundred years, these products go out of fashion.  In the <span>eighteenth</span> century, Venetian glass production declined.  And with the advent of Napoleon‚Äôs troops, all the factories were destroyed.  But since the 19th century, fashion for glass has returned and still reigns.  A lawyer from Vicenza, with the help of English merchants, built a factory here and resumed the famous production. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Murano island in italy" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1742492.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Museum </h2><p>  Exposition halls displaying various types of glass were opened in the Palazzo Justinian in 1861.  It used to be the residence of Bishop Torcello - a patrician palace built in the Gothic style.  In this building for a long time was the city hall.  Here you can familiarize yourself with the history of how an amazing craft originated and developed that glorified the island of Murano.  In addition, the museum has collected exhibits representing glass products of different times and peoples, starting from Ancient Egypt.  The museum can only be reached on foot, following all signs, from the main vaporetto station called Murano Faro.  The exposition is closed on Wednesdays.  The museum operates in the summer from ten in the morning until five in the evening, and in winter - until four. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  What is famous for the Venetian island of Murano in addition to its famous glass?  Of course, its architecture.  In the Renaissance, aristocrats and noble rich people began to settle on this island.  At this time, it became fashionable, as in the ancient era, to settle closer to nature.  That is why people with money and good taste began to build villas that were decorated with statues and paintings.  And at their leisure, they invited astrologers, philosophers and poets and conducted exquisite conversations here about art and mysticism.  There are beautiful palaces and ancient churches here.  For example, the Cathedral of Santa Maria e Donato is famous for its stunning <span>12th-</span> century frescoes.  This is one of the oldest churches in the entire Venetian lagoon.  It is built in the Byzantine style - on the floor, walls and ceilings are rich mosaic panels.  The Clock Tower of the <span>19th</span> century is also interesting.  This is one of the most visited places.  And the oldest palace on the island is the Palazzo di Mula.  It was built in the <span>XII</span> - <span>XIII</span> centuries, and he managed to avoid updating, like other beautiful villas.  That is why here you can admire the Gothic lancet windows and panels in the Byzantine style. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Murano island reviews" class="if" height="419" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1742494.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where to live? </h2><p>  Murano Island in Venice is mainly a day trip destination.  Most tourists come here for a few hours.  But there are those who want to spend at least one day among this beauty, because it‚Äôs so good and calm on the island in the mornings and evenings, when endless crowds of people will subside.  For such connoisseurs of exclusiveness, there are seven hotels in Murano.  They are small, but quite expensive, however, like any housing in Venice in general.  The cost of living ranges from 75 to 200 euros.  The only four-star hotel is La Gare Hotel Venice - McGallery Collection.  The rest of the hotels are not so chic, but nonetheless very romantic. </p><h2>  Murano Island: traveler reviews </h2><p>  Travelers believe that even if you have only two days allocated to Venice, one of them should definitely be spent on exploring the surroundings.  You simply will not have a choice.  Otherwise, you will not understand what real Venice is.  And the whole day just needs to be allocated for visiting Murano.  You will never forget the moment when you will be seated on high chairs, offered tea or wine, and you will watch another masterpiece appear under the magical hands of a glassblower.  The limitless textural and color possibilities of this glass can bring to life any, even the craziest imagination of artists and designers.  It looks great both among jewelry or household items, and in any interior.  It is best to buy glass from the island of Murano in official workshops or souvenir shops, otherwise you may purchase a Chinese fake.  Although every little thing there will cost at least two euros, but all these products will be heavy, bright, with a deep overflow of shades.  It is also surprising that such fragile jewelry - albeit of enormous size - is stored right on the streets, and no vandals have still broken them. </p>
