    <h2>  Roaming in Russia </h2><p>  The first thing you can imagine is roaming within your own country.  This option is quite popular, it is used by many travelers.  If you want to talk on favorable terms, traveling around Russia, you should pay attention to the "Tele2" roaming service.  In Moscow, in St. Petersburg, in Volgograd - it does not matter which city you are in.  The main thing is that the conditions will be quite favorable. </p><p>  On average, the cost of calls will cost the user 5 rubles per minute.  This applies to both incoming and outgoing calls.  SMS messages cost 3.5 rubles in Russia.  But international numbers will have to send letters at 5.5 rubles apiece.  Incoming SMS is free. </p><p>  Calls to the <span>CIS countries</span> cost 25 rubles, and to Europe and other countries - 45 and 65, respectively.  As you can see, quite favorable conditions.  The Internet is bypassed according <span>to the Tele2 tariff plan.</span>  Roaming in <span>Moscow, Surgut</span> or any other city in Russia is automatically turned on and ceases to function when you return to your home region. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Everywhere Zero </h2><p>  Nevertheless, if you travel a lot inside the country, you can connect yourself an additional option in order to save money.  It's called Everywhere Zero.  This is a kind of Tele2 roaming, which allows you to talk for free throughout Russia.  But with some limitations. </p><p>  So, all incoming calls will be free, and outgoing calls will be paid.  But for a minute of conversation you will pay only 2 rubles.  Messages cost 2.5 rubles.  And the Internet, as in the previous case, costs subscribers according to their tariff. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tele2 roaming in Moscow" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1125259.jpg"></div>

    <p>  It should be noted right away, ‚ÄúEverywhere Zero‚Äù is a paid service.  Its connection costs 30 rubles, and the monthly fee is 3 rubles.  Not so much if you get a lot of incoming calls while traveling. </p><p>  How to connect Tele2 roaming?  Dial * 143 * 21 # on your mobile device.  Now wait for SMS alerts with the result of processing your request.  If there are enough funds on the balance sheet (about 33 rubles), then you will connect to yourself ‚ÄúEverywhere zero‚Äù. </p><p>  Important: the option requires disabling when it is not needed.  The USSD request * 143 * 20 # is suitable for this.  In principle, Everywhere Zero is not so popular among subscribers.  In most cases, you can do without it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Roaming Abroad </h2><p>  When traveling around the world, roaming "Tele2" is turned on by default.  And abroad, there are terms of your tariff plan.  In each country they are different.  But not too much. </p><p>  What is Tele2 roaming in Egypt, for example?  All incoming calls cost 35 rubles per minute.  Just like conversations with Russia, as well as a minute of negotiations with the country in which the subscriber is located.  And a similar price tag applies to all incoming / outgoing from different countries.  Except for South and North America.  In this case, you will pay 65 rubles per minute.  This is the price tag for an outgoing call.  Incoming, as already mentioned, will cost 35 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tele2 roaming abroad" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1125252.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Messages and MMS also have a cost.  Incoming SMS while roaming abroad is free.  If you decide to correspond with someone, then get ready - you will have to pay 12 rubles for 1 SMS or MMS.  Not very much, but for active communication this is not a very suitable solution.  Roaming "Tele2" also extends to the Internet.  1 mega-traffic of traffic costs 50 rubles.  Many subscribers do not like these conditions.  And so they are looking for some additional tariff options.  Fortunately, those are available. </p><h2>  Conversations Without Borders </h2><p>  If you need Tele2 roaming abroad, but you don‚Äôt particularly plan to make calls, but to receive it, yes, you will have to pay attention to the option ‚ÄúConversations without borders‚Äù.  This is a pretty good offer in this situation. </p><p>  The cost of incoming calls when connected will be 5 rubles.  And the same will be the <span>monthly fee.</span>  Connection of the tariff option "Conversations without borders" is free.  In the same way as disabling it.  In principle, a rather interesting solution.  Perhaps, ‚ÄúTele2‚Äù roaming tariffs outside of Russia cannot offer more profitable than ‚ÄúConversations without Borders‚Äù. </p><p>  How to connect this option?  Here, as always, a USSD request will come to the rescue.  It looks like this: * 143 * 1 #.  After you connect to the services, keep in mind that if necessary, you will have to independently abandon "Conversations without Borders".  This package is not automatically disabled.  To solve the problem, use the following command: * 141 * 0 #.  Keep in mind that "Conversations without Borders" is an option that only works outside of Russia.  When traveling inside the country, it makes no sense. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tariffs tele2 roaming" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1125254.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Internet Abroad </h2><p>  In truth, it is worth paying attention to another option.  At "Tele2" roaming abroad does not offer the most advantageous network access services.  But the situation can be rectified quite easily and simply.  For example, by connecting the additional service "Internet abroad".  This package offers subscribers to use the Internet while traveling around the world on favorable terms. </p><p>  When joining this opportunity, subscribers receive 10 megabytes of free traffic per day.  And over this limit you will have to pay 30 rubles per megabyte if you are not in the CIS or in Europe.  On the territory of these regions, traffic will cost 10 rubles.  Please note, "Internet abroad" has a monthly fee.  If this service is provided in the territory of the CIS countries or Europe, then you will pay 100 rubles, otherwise - 300 per month. </p><p>  Connecting and disconnecting is also slightly different.  For example, for the CIS and Europe, you will need to dial * 143 * 31 # to start using the offer and * 143 * 30 # to refuse the package.  In other countries, the command * 143 * 41 # and * 143 * 40 # are used to connect to refuse the tariff plan.  This is all that Tele2 roaming can include. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  So we got acquainted with all the services that you can connect to yourself at "Tele2" while traveling.  As you can see, there are not many of them.  And some of them turn on / off automatically. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tele2 roaming in Egypt" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1125255.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Should I resort to using additional service packages when roaming?  Everyone decides for himself.  In any case, subscribers assure that with the connected services ‚ÄúInternet abroad‚Äù and ‚ÄúConversations without borders‚Äù you can save quite a lot of money. </p>
