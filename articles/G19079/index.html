    <p>  Anapa is considered an ideal place for children.  40 km of sandy coast are very convenient for the whole family, as they are gentle and sandy.  There are also small sections of pebble beaches.  Anapa has a large number of water parks, zoos, attractions, oceanariums, dolphinariums, as well as many health-improving children's complexes.  If you believe the reviews, in Russia you can not find the best resort for families with children. </p><p>  It is also popular to travel to Sochi.  After all, here is a unique nature, well-developed infrastructure, a large number of health facilities and the cleanest sea in the region.  Here you can have a great rest for families with children and outrageous youth.  Festivals, the best night clubs, water parks and attractions, aquariums and dolphinariums - all that you can wish for on vacation, tourists can find in Sochi!  Among the shortcomings, reviews note high housing and entertainment prices. </p>
