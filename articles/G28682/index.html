And today, the origin of the creations of human hands remains a mystery, over which researchers unsuccessfully fight. </p><h2>  Gigantic vessels </h2><p>  Unique sites with amazing artifacts were discovered in 1930.  The valley of pitchers, as scientists called this place, was intrigued by giant bowls with large openings.  The gigantic size of the ancient vessels suggests that once upon a time they were used by the tribes of giants.  By the way, and local legends say about the ancient giants who allegedly stored strong wine in these jugs. </p><h2>  Valley of Pitchers: Strange Findings </h2><p>  About 4 thousand vessels up to 3 meters high were found, huge lids lay nearby, which probably covered the contents in the artifacts.  Strange circles are carved on the surface of some disks, a layer is completely hewn on the others, only a small bump is left.  One can only guess how much time it took for this lesson.  And to dig a hole in a huge vessel to a considerable depth is not a matter of one month, or maybe even a year. </p>

    <p>  In the course of the research, the age of ancient objects was established - they are about 2 thousand years old.  It is believed that they belong to the so-called <span>Iron Age.</span>  On the territory where the jugs were found, and inside them, bones, beads, stone and ceramic fragments were found. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Unsolved Mysteries </h2><p>  Heavy gigantic objects - the weight of one vessel exceeds 6 thousand kilograms - are mostly cylindrical, but some of them are oval or rectangle.  It is interesting that there is not the same rock nearby, from which the jugs are made, therefore, scientists are inclined to believe that they were brought from somewhere.  But who and why pulled heavy vessels?  No researcher will give an answer to this question.  And also no one will tell you why huge containers are scattered on such a large territory of Laos. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pitcher valley in laos" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1117970.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Versions of the contents in the vessels </h2><p>  The valley of pitchers holds many secrets, and one of the main questions tormenting archaeologists: what exactly was stored in the vessels?  In addition to the version of wine, there are other conjectures.  Some researchers adhere to the theory that the vessels that stood on the ground gathered moisture during heavy rains and were intended to quench the thirst of travelers engaged in trade.  And unusual objects found inside stone artifacts were offerings to the ancient gods asking them to send water for drinking. </p><h2>  Funeral cult </h2><p>  Another version is put forward by scientists who believe that the Valley of clay jugs is associated with a funeral cult.  Not far from one plateau on which strange objects were found, they discovered a cave with traces of soot on the holes located above, clearly made by human hands.  There is an assumption that the bodies of the dead were burned there, and the soot remained after the release of smoke during cremation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  But regarding what was still stored in huge vessels, the versions diverge.  Some scientists believe that the remains of ancient ancestors were buried inside jugs, while others hypothesized that cremation did not occur immediately after death, but after some period of time.  And until a certain period passed, the remains lay in urns, waiting in the wings. </p><p>  Archaeologists who discovered bones near unusual jugs proposed another version, which suggested the body of the deceased was inside the vessel, and the relatives of the deceased were already buried just around the giant pot.  But so far, none of the hypotheses has been confirmed or refuted. </p><h2>  War trail territory </h2><p>  Tourists coming to Laos in order to see for themselves the existence of mysterious vessels are not available at all sites.  The fact is that during the war, when the Americans dropped air bombs on the country's provinces, many artifacts were seriously destroyed, and unexploded ordnance kept a mortal danger for all visitors. </p>

    <p>  Unfortunately, the Valley of Pitchers, where a large number of mines are located, has not yet become a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  The authorities have long been trying to assign a special status to these lands, which would help clear the area of ‚Äã‚Äãammunition and increase the tourist flow.  Then the entire vast territory of the valley, and not 3 safe sites, would be accessible for inspection. </p><h2>  Destruction as a result of natural phenomena </h2><p>  The valley of pitchers in Laos sometimes presents a sad sight, and this is not always associated with hostilities.  As a result of natural phenomena, when the seed of a tree gets inside the vessel, the giant bowls break into two parts under the strength of the developed root system.  And such ancient destroyed artifacts are added every year. </p><p>  The amazing Valley of Pitchers holds many secrets, and no one knows when all the answers will be known.  Indeed, the unraveling of the history of ancient civilization, from whose vital activity only giant vessels remained, will be the key moment, which, perhaps, will change a lot in the scientific life of our society.  It is hoped that new studies of a unique corner will at least slightly open the veil of secrecy. </p>
