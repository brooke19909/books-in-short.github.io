This hot tropical country, where summer lasts almost all year round, attracts them not only with warm weather, but also with the low cost of trips.  For a reasonable amount, you can stay in a pretty good hotel.  At the same time, every resort has budget hotels that are almost as good as their more "star" competitors.  Not sure where to stay in Thailand and save money?  Pay attention to the inexpensive but cozy hotel Green Park Resort 3 * <span>("Green Park</span> Resort") in Pattaya.  The article will focus on its territory, number of rooms, reviews of tourists, as well as on the features of the resort in this article. </p><h2>  Holidays in Pattaya </h2><p>  This resort is considered one of the most budgetary in all of Thailand.  On its territory there are a lot of inexpensive hotels for every taste, including the Green Park Resort 3 *.  Pattaya is a bustling and never falling asleep city located right on the seashore.  Therefore, it is suitable for those tourists who want to combine a holiday by the sea with active entertainment.  However, there are quiet areas in the city where lovers of nature and silence will find solitude.  But young people who love night parties, it is best to settle in the central part. </p><p>  What to do when you come to Pattaya on vacation?  This city offers tourists a lot of entertainment.  The main street of the resort is Walking street, where a huge number of bars and nightclubs are located.  Lovers of the history and culture of Thailand can be advised to go on an excursion.  Tourists can explore the ancient Thai temples, as well as the Big Buddha Hill, located near the center of Pattaya.  The city also has a unique Mini-Siam amusement park, in which miniature copies of the most famous sights from around the world are created.  These are Japanese pagodas, and Egyptian pyramids, and the Eiffel Tower, and even St. Basil's Cathedral. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Numerous diving schools are open along the coast, where you can rent equipment for swimming underwater.  Pattaya has several large municipal beaches that are safe for children to swim.  They are equipped with sun loungers, showers, changing rooms and toilets, and the entrance to them, as a rule, is completely free. </p><h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  This hotel is located in the northern part of the resort, where it is much calmer and quieter than in the center.  Therefore, it is recommended for families with small children.  Many inexpensive cafes and shops are open here.  Green Park Resort 3 * in Pattaya is built on the first line of the sea.  The nearest municipal beach is just 200 meters away, so you can walk to the coast in just 5 minutes.  Near the hotel there are 2 cafes, a French patisserie, a large supermarket and a public transport stop.  Therefore, without problems, tourists can reach the central part of the city in just a few minutes.  What is the distance between Walking street and Green Park Resort in Pattaya?  3.5 km.  The complex itself is located on the outskirts of the city, and on its territory there is a lush tropical garden.  Therefore, day and night it is quiet and calm. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="12.951765" data-lng="100.88531499999999" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/7/8/9/11789.png"></div><p>  According to tourists, a significant drawback of the hotel is its remoteness from international airports, since the nearest of them accepts only local flights.  Most of the travelers arrive in Bangkok, which is almost 150 km from Pattaya.  This means that they will have to spend about 2 hours on the way to the hotel.  The cheapest way to get to the resort is by bus, but tourists can also pay for a more expensive taxi.  You can also arrange a transfer from the airport to the hotel and back in advance, including it in the price of the ticket. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Important information for tourists </h2><p>  The Green Park Resort 3 * complex in Pattaya is considered a place for budget accommodation.  Its opening took place in 1995, but regular repairs are being made in the rooms and public areas, so it cannot be called obsolete.  So, the last renovation was completed here in 2012.  Most of the hotel is occupied by a tropical garden.  It also houses two main three-story buildings and several separate bungalows.  Guests can relax and swim in the spacious outdoor pool.  The hotel is fully decorated in Thai Oriental style, which, according to tourists, adds a special touch to it.  The complex offers tourists 204 spacious and bright rooms. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebookers.fi" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Territory" class="if uuid-2964184" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102891/2964184.jpg"></div><p>  Most often, tourists from China and Europe relax at the hotel, so its staff and administrators speak English.  There are no Russian-speaking employees in the complex.  Here tourists with children of all ages are welcomed, charging a lower payment for them.  But you should not come here with animals - their placement in the rooms is strictly prohibited.  When checking in, no cash deposit will be charged. </p><h2>  Housing stock </h2><p>  The Green Park Resort 3 * complex is a large hotel offering tourists more than 200 rooms.  There are standard double and family apartments on its territory, therefore, when fully populated, more than 500 people can live in it at the same time.  At the same time, 8 rooms in the hotel are adjacent, that is, connected by interior doors.  But there are no rooms equipped with facilities for people traveling in a wheelchair. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  When making a voucher, future guests can choose one of the following rooms: </p><ul><li>  Standard Room - one-room double apartments, consisting of a living room, bathroom, terrace or balcony.  Their area is 32 m <sup>2</sup> .  Rooms overlook the outdoor pool. </li><li>  Superior Room - Superior apartments, which are also designed for 2 guests.  They have the same area as the standard rooms, but their windows overlook the garden. </li><li>  Superior Bungalow - similar to the previous room category.

Its area is 66 m <sup>2</sup> . </li><li>  Junior Family Two Bedrooms are large family apartments consisting of 2 living rooms and 2 bathrooms.

As a rule, the change is carried out 2-3 times a week. </p><div class="photo" data-original="green-park-resort.allpattayahotels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Room Interior" class="if uuid-2964176" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102891/2964176.jpg"></div><h2>  Room features </h2><p>  Each room at Green Park Resort 3 * is equipped with a set of modern furniture, including double or single beds, bedside tables and wardrobes for clothes, a desk and chair, armchairs or a dining room on the balcony or terrace.  There is in the apartment and all the necessary equipment for a comfortable stay.  You can relax in the evening watching a plasma TV, to which a set of cable TV channels is connected.

An electric kettle can be used to warm the water.

Each guest is provided with a set of towels and bath accessories, as well as a shower cap. </p><h2>  Service and Facilities </h2><p>  Since the Green Park Resort 3 * complex is considered a budget hotel, it offers the appropriate level of service.  Therefore, not many infrastructure facilities are located on its territory.  However, everything you need is here.  So, for guests there is a 24-hour reception desk, where the administrator is constantly located.  It will help to exchange currency, copy documents or connect to the paid Internet.  Guests can always leave their car in the parking lot.  Several shops are open for tourists on site, including a souvenir shop, as well as a beauty salon and laundry. </p><div class="photo" data-original="it.eureka-reservation.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel lobby" class="if uuid-2964166" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102891/2964166.jpg"></div><p>  The hotel has a large business center equipped with modern computer technology.  Visitors can rent one of five conference rooms that can accommodate up to 300 people.  The hotel organizers can arrange banquets and business meetings upon request. </p><h2>  Catering </h2><p>  The Green Park Resort 3 * beach hotel in Thailand is considered a place for inexpensive accommodation, so the food here is not too varied.  Do not expect that the price will include gourmet delicacies, desserts or expensive drinks.  As a rule, tourists pay only breakfast, as in Pattaya there are a lot of local restaurants and cafes where you can cheaply try local cuisine.  But if you wish, both full and half board can be included in the price. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebookers.fi" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Main restaurant" class="if uuid-2964172" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102891/2964172.jpg"></div><p>  The hotel has only one restaurant - Green Park, which serves local and international cuisine.  In the morning, a buffet is served in the hall, and the rest of the time, tourists are served √† la carte.  You can enjoy refreshing drinks or cocktails at the SALA THAI Bar, located by the pool. </p><h2>  Beach holidays at the hotel </h2><p>  The Green Park Resort (Thailand, Pattaya) does not have a private beach, so most of the guests go to sunbathe to the nearest municipal stretch of coast, located 200 meters from the complex.  It is fully equipped for a comfortable stay.  There are sun loungers and umbrellas that protect from the sun, showers and changing rooms.  Sunbed rental is charged.  The beach has a water entertainment center and a diving school. </p><p>  You can also relax on site, which has a large outdoor pool.  It is filled with fresh water and is open daily until 18:00.  Nearby is a sun terrace, where tourists can sunbathe on the sun loungers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="it.eureka-reservation.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Open pool" class="if uuid-2964159" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102891/2964159.jpg"></div><h2>  What entertainment does the complex offer tourists? </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews, the Green Park Resort 3 * hotel in Pattaya does not provide its guests with a lot of entertainment.  It is fully focused on a relaxing beach holiday, so almost all the free time tourists spend on the beach.  However, guests can always arrange and pay for the tour at the reception.  In your free time, you can stroll through the tropical garden, equipped with benches for guests. </p><h2>  Conditions for placing with small children </h2><p>  Quite often, The Green Park Resort 3 * complex in North Pattaya is chosen by families with small children, since it is located in a quiet area.  It should be understood that the hotel is budget, so it does not offer a large number of amenities for kids.  Guests can request a cradle in the room, but you should do this in advance, as their number is limited.  For babies in the restaurant high chairs are provided for feeding.  And in the common pool for babies there is a separate shallow zone. </p><h2>  Positive feedback about the hotel The Green Park Resort 3 * (Thailand) </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the complex has a good reputation among picky tourists.  They believe that for a low cost of living in a hotel they offer decent service.  However, you should not count on a first-class reception, as the hotel has not only advantages, but also disadvantages.  First, we list the main advantages of the hotel that tourists distinguish in their reviews: </p><ul><li>  Great hotel location.  Not far from it there is a beach and several cafes.  Moreover, in the evenings, the territory is very quiet. </li><li>  The hotel has a lot of Europeans resting with children who practically do not drink and behave politely and calmly. </li><li>  Varied and delicious breakfasts, the menu of which includes excellent coffee and fresh fruit. </li><li>  A large tropical garden on the territory where tourists like to walk in the evenings. </li><li>  A spacious pool of an original form with a separate sector for young children. </li></ul><h2>  Negative reviews about The Green Park Resort 3 * hotel in Thailand </h2><p>  Of course, budget hotels can hardly be called an ideal place to relax, as they often have a lot of disadvantages.  However, according to tourists, this complex stands out positively among other three-star hotels in Pattaya.  Nevertheless, they recommend that the hotel management pay attention to the following disadvantages of the service: </p><ul><li>  The room is equipped with old mini-refrigerators, which are very noisy.  To sleep peacefully, tourists have to turn it off at night. </li><li>  The water in the outdoor pool is sometimes turbid, but hotel staff are trying to quickly clean it. </li><li>  The untidy territory of the hotel.  The staff does not monitor the plants and lawns, garbage discarded by guests is also extremely rarely cleaned. </li><li>  Many mosquitoes fly into the rooms on the ground floor, which are almost impossible to get rid of.  Therefore, it is better to settle on the upper floors. </li><li>  Some rooms need urgent cosmetic repairs.  On the walls you can see dirty stains, and the doors in the bathroom do not close. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bathroom" class="if uuid-2964156" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102891/2964156.jpg"></div><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Thus, judging by the reviews, the Green Park 3 * hotel (Pattaya, Thailand) is perfect for budget accommodation.  It can be recommended to tourists who are looking for a good hotel in a quiet area, but do not want to spend much on it.  It is worth noting that the hotel is most often visited by young couples and families with children.  Youth companies here can get bored, as there are no large bars and nightclubs nearby. </p>
