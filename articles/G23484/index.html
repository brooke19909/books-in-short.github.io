The soul is torn from a gassed metropolis to the bosom of nature, preferably to water.  Do you still think that you can swim and sunbathe only in the southern resorts?  You are mistaken!  No less developed industry of outdoor recreation is in the suburbs. </p><p>  If weather conditions permit, head to the Pirogovskoye reservoir.  Malibu Beach is not just a strip of sand.  This is a whole entertainment complex.  Many call Malibu a resort.  So it is, because there are three hotels, two of which are floating.  And what is the recreation infrastructure in the Malibu resort near Moscow?  How to get there?  How much does it cost to stay there for the weekend?  What other services does the administration of the Malibu hotel and entertainment complex provide?  We will talk about all this in our article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Malibu beach" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1850571.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is the Malibu hotel and entertainment complex located </h2><p>  You don‚Äôt have to go for a long trip to bring to the sandy <span>shore of the beach</span> and cool the hot bodies in the waters of the Pirogovsky reservoir.  This paradise is located just twenty one kilometers from the Moscow Ring Road.  Turn off from the Moscow Ring Road to Ostashkovskoe highway.  It stretches to the northeast. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After driving seven kilometers along the highway, you will reach an intersection in the village of Belyaninovo, at which you should turn right (along the main road).  Next you will pass the settlements of Boltino and Pirogovo.  After the last village you need to turn left and follow the signs for Sorokino.  The road will lead you to the barrier of the MLO "Bay of Joy."  Having passed it, you need to turn on the second turn to the right. </p><p>  Entrance to the territory is free.  From public transport, only the Rocket and Moscow motor ships from the capital's River Station go there.  They are mooring at the marina of the Bay of Joy.  And the Malibu beach is already two hundred meters from there. </p><p>  The hotel and entertainment complex occupies the northern shore of the reservoir.  His exact address: Moscow region, Mytyshchi district, the village of Sorokino.  It is part of the municipal recreation area "Bay of Joy." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Malibu beach in Pirogovo" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1850582.jpg" width="600"></div>
