    <p>  What are the advantages of a modern motion sensor?  Does a street sensor really help save money?  Where can I install such devices?  How to choose them correctly?  We will try to answer all these questions today. </p><h2>  Where are such devices installed? </h2><p>  In order to rationally approach the use of resources, it is recommended to install motion sensors everywhere.  According to experts, these devices provide from 50 to 75% energy savings. </p><p>  Manufacturers can offer both a lamp with a registrar for installation in a house, office, porch, pantry, and a streetlight with a motion sensor that can be installed in the garden, in the yard, on the garage doors, etc.  Such devices are very convenient for home and for the street.  You no longer have to fumble with your hand on the wall, looking for a switch.  The light will turn on on its own as soon as you approach a sufficient distance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In many situations, it is convenient to use a motion sensor.  An outdoor appliance, for example, can be installed at the entrance to a suburban cottage or along garden paths along which the path to the building passes.  The darkness will no longer accompany you in the evening or at night, and electricity bills will no longer pull the "veins" from the family budget. </p><h2>  Operating principle </h2><p>  A street lamp with a motion sensor is a functional and modern device.  The principle of operation is based on the inclusion of a light source after an object appears in the sensor "field of view".  The lamp is turned off after a certain period of time (the user can install it himself). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="street lamp with motion sensor" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/1693516.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Most often, an infrared motion sensor is used for lighting.  The street registrar is appreciated for the fact that it can serve for a really long time (without breakdowns and interruptions in work).  In addition, the devices have good sensitivity. </p><p>  The operation of the sensor is as follows.  He scans the area around him, recognizing the temperature indicators of the surrounding space.  As soon as the temperature changes as a result of the movements of the object, the device immediately triggers, lighting the light. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  By the way, a street motion sensor can work together not only with lighting devices.  It can be part of a video surveillance system or burglar alarm. </p><h2>  Customization and features </h2><p>  Any street lamp can be configured according to three main parameters. </p><ul><li>  Time interval.  You can set a specific period during which the device will work.  The on time will be much shorter than the off.  As a rule, the inclusion is configured in the interval from three seconds to several minutes.  The delay for the shutdown time is set for a period of two to five minutes. </li><li>  You can independently adjust the sensitivity.  The higher this indicator, the clearer the motion sensor (including street) will be triggered.  Experts advise changing the sensitivity settings depending on the time of year.  As a rule, in the summer the motion sensor works much better, but in the cold season, periodic malfunctions occur due to low temperatures. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="street motion sensor" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/1693515.jpg" width="225"></div></li><li>  You can adjust the level of lighting.  Agree, why in the daytime include electricity.  The sensor detects movement and simultaneously checks the level of illumination of the territory.  If it is lower than the specified threshold in the settings, the lamp will turn on the light.  If a person passes by at noon, then the electricity will not be turned on.  This is a thoughtful saving. </li></ul><h2>  The main advantages of devices </h2><p>  Street lamps equipped with motion sensors have a lot of positive qualities.  As we have already noted, they significantly save energy and, consequently, reduce costs.  Also, the devices have compact dimensions and stylish design.  They can be installed in any room, without worrying that they will look ridiculous against the background of the interior. </p><p>  In addition, lamps with sensors are very convenient for owners of summer cottages and country houses.  They can be installed not only on the porch, but also in the basement, on the veranda, in the pantry.  No flashlights, no search for switches.  Similar devices are elementary alarms.  The light turns on regardless of which person is in the home.  And if you approached the house, and there the light is on, someone must have entered the housing or the plot. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="streetlight with motion sensor" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/1693514.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  What to look for when choosing a street lamp? </h2><ul><li>  Good protection against moisture and dust.  It is desirable that the street lamp with a motion sensor has a housing made of anticorrosive materials. </li><li>  Shockproof and moisture resistant glass.  No external influences should harm the device and disable it. </li><li>  Stylish design and compact size. </li><li>  A properly working motion sensor with the possibility of various functional changes and settings. </li></ul><p>  Of course, such devices make a person‚Äôs life more comfortable. </p>
