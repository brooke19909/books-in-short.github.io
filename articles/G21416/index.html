  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DIY gypsum vases: manufacturing methods</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Master classes that teach you how to make gypsum vases with your own hands will help to add a twist to the design of your home or to prepare an original gift for a loved one.  First off, it's pretty simple.  And secondly, you can create vases from gypsum with your own hands according to your own plan.  And then you get an absolutely exclusive thing. </p><h2>  Gypsum-dipped fabric vase </h2><p>  This manufacturing option is the easiest.  The master will need a piece of unnecessary matter.  Immediately before work, a gypsum solution should be prepared. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="J-zVDumYltI" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-zVDumYltI" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/4/3/1/0/14310.jpg"></div><p>  The fabric is dipped into it and hung on a bucket, column, stump.  It is important only to think in advance that the bottom of a gypsum vase made by hand should be stable and even.  Therefore, on the top of the column of small thickness, it is recommended to stuff something that increases the diameter of the base of the future crafts: a plate, a pan cover with the handle down, a cut square or circle made of plastic or wood. </p><div class="photo" data-original="craftopediasss.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gypsum-dipped fabric vase" class="if uuid-3074472" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2638/3074472.jpg"></div><p>  In a few hours, a pretty creative gypsum vase will be ready.  Doing it yourself is not at all difficult. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Plaster vases from improvised materials </h2><p>  Most often, masters, working with plaster, use the casting method.  In order to make a vase of gypsum with your own hands in this technique, you need to choose the right shape.  It is not necessary to cook mold specially.  You can find something suitable among the materials at hand. </p><p>  For work, use the main capacity of the desired size.  It can be a plastic or glass bottle, box, container, tall glass for beer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blightdesign.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Plaster vases molded from plastic bottles" class="if uuid-3075934" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2638/3075934.jpg"></div><p>  It is also necessary to take care of the details, thanks to which it will be possible to make a recess inside the vase.  It can be of any shape.  Only here the master needs to pay attention to its size: too large can lead to the fact that the walls of the vase will turn out too thin. </p><p>  If a casting shape with a narrow neck, for example, a bottle, plastic or glass, is used for casting, then after hardening the gypsum, it will not be so easy to extract the craft.  Plastic can be cut and removed.  And the glass containers will have to be carefully chopped so as not to damage the gypsum vase made by yourself. </p><h2>  Master Class </h2><p>  Here, the technique of casting a vase with a rectangular base is described in detail. </p><p>  To make it, you will need a container: a box of milk or juice, a container, a casket, a box.  It is important to choose the shape of the right size.  In this case, a plastic container is used to store cereals. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Still worth taking care of the details for the excavation.  It is convenient to take a glass or a glass bottle with a diameter smaller than the filling mold. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Square Base Vase Casting" class="if uuid-3075572" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2638/3075572.jpg"></div><ul><li>  In a larger container, a part for excavation is placed.  It is held in such a way that it does not touch the bottom of the mold. </li><li>  Gypsum diluted with water is carefully poured into the void between the mold and the part to form a recess. </li><li>  Then wait a while until the gypsum slightly hardens.  During this period, the part of the recess is held in suspension. </li><li>  When the mass "seizes", the structure is left to fully harden.  Then they remove the vase, grind the irregularities with fine sandpaper. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.core77.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="white gypsum vases" class="if uuid-3077983" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24824/3077983.jpg"></div><p>  You can leave the vase white - it is very stylish.  But if the master has a desire to paint the craft, make a drawing on it, then do not resist it.  The finished vase can be varnished. </p><h2>  Making molds </h2><p>  Often you want to make a vase of a certain shape or repeat a finished one.  Then the master himself makes a mold for casting from a solution of gypsum or silicone sealant. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.designspiration.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mold for casting gypsum vases" class="if uuid-3075569" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2638/3075569.jpg"></div><ul><li>  A slightly larger container is taken than the object from which the form is removed.  It will fulfill the role of formwork. </li><li>  A mass is poured at the bottom of the container (gypsum mortar or silicone sealant). </li><li>  After hardening, the object itself is laid sideways on the resulting layer. </li><li>  The mass is poured exactly half. </li><li>  The design is left alone for a while. </li><li>  Can be made in the not yet completely hardened mass of the excavation.  These will be ‚Äúlocks‚Äù, thanks to which parts of the mold precisely fit during the casting of the vase itself. </li><li>  Next, the design should completely harden.  This will be one part of the mold.  You can check whether everything turned out right at this stage by removing the template from half of the mold.  Then the sample to remove the mold again needs to be installed in place. </li><li>  The upper layer of half the form is greased with fat: glycerin, petroleum jelly, oil, cream. </li><li>  Fill the entire template with mass so that it disappears completely. </li><li>  Wait until the mass becomes as solid as possible. </li><li>  The halves of mold are removed from the container, they are separated from the template from which the mold was removed. </li></ul><h2>  Plaster floor vases </h2><p>  Now you can start casting.  With the help of such molds, floor gypsum vases are made with your own hands. </p><p>  First, the halves of the form are connected and fixed, wrapped with twine, tape, tape.  The principle of filling is similar to that described in the chapter "Master Class". </p><div class="photo" data-original="alexstock.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY gypsum floor vases" class="if uuid-3074475" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2638/3074475.jpg"></div><p>  The resulting craft is coated with paint, varnish or drawing.  If desired, leave the vase white. </p><h2>  Creative molds for casting from Lego </h2><p>  You can create your own vase design.  For example, to assemble the layout from the details of the Lego constructor. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.yatzer.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gypsum vase &quot;Pixels&quot;" class="if uuid-3074576" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2638/3074576.jpg"></div><p>  Next, you need to make a mold according to the method described above and make gypsum casting. </p>
