Such a demand for them arose due to the quality characteristics and the duration of the operational period.  But, despite the high performance, washing equipment can fail for various reasons and at any time. </p><p>  Today, many models of washing units are equipped with displays, where various information is displayed, notifying both about the execution of the washing mode and about errors in their operation.  In the event of a problem in the operation of the machine, a specific code appears on the display.  He points to the "culprit" of the breakdown.  Judging by the reviews of users, the error he2 of the Samsung washing machine most often appears on the display.  Consider what it means and what are the options for eliminating it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digiplus.cl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine samsung error he2" class="if uuid-3128872" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/3128872.jpg"></div><h2>  What does it mean? </h2><p>  Error Samsung's washing machine NO2 alerts you to a problem with heating water coming from the water supply to the tank.  With the high-quality functioning of the appliance in the ‚Äúwashing‚Äù mode, the rate of water heating should increase within 10 minutes after starting the program.  If this does not happen, then the control system will report a malfunction, showing the code HE2 on the display.  In this case, the ‚Äúculprit‚Äù of the breakdown is the heating element of the Samsung washing machine, which performs the function of heating cold water. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Reasons for the display of the HE2 error </h2><p>  The error code in question may appear on the display of the washing machine if: </p><ul><li>  failure of the heating element; </li><li>  malfunctioning of the temperature sensor built into the inside of the tubular heater; </li><li>  microcircuit malfunctions; </li><li>  disconnecting the conductors connecting the heating device to the control module. </li></ul><h2>  Samsung washing machine error HE2: how to fix without replacing the heater? </h2><p>  Based on the fact that when replacing the heater, it is necessary to dismantle some panels of the case, as well as to exclude other "culprits" of the breakdown, the following details should be diagnosed: </p><ul><li>  Checking the operability of the elements of the machine's connection to the electric network.  Exclude the use of additional connections, a tee and an extension cord when connected to an outlet.  Check the connection of the equipment cable conductors to the plug terminals. </li><li>  The control module is malfunctioning.  Disconnect the machine from electrical power, and then reconnect it to electricity.  Restart the machine by setting the ‚Äúwash‚Äù mode. </li></ul><p>  If these steps did not remove the HE2 error from the display of the Samsung washing machine, then in this case, you must proceed to dismantle the panels that form the basis of the device. </p><h2>  Why can a heating element fail? </h2><p>  The causes of damage to the heating element are as follows: </p><ol><li>  Scale deposits on the tubes.  Limescale is a barrier to the transfer of heat generated by an electrical component to cold water.  Formed as a result of hard water and the use of detergents, hard deposits have poor thermal conductivity.  Due to the slow heating of the water in the tank, the heating element overheats, and ultimately the part fails.  Scale is also the cause of the formation of a corrosion process, which leads to the destruction of the metal base of the tubes. </li><li>  Manufacturing defect.  If this fact is established by examination, the consumer has the right to free repair, or replacement of the washing machine. </li><li>  Exceeding the prescribed detergent.  The proportions recommended by the manufacturer must be observed. </li></ol><p>  Important!  To extend the life of the heating element, experts recommend using ‚ÄúKalgon‚Äù for washing machines when washing, to soften the water, or once every 1-3 months (depending on the frequency of operation and water hardness) drive it to the ‚Äúidle‚Äù mode ‚ÄúCotton 60 C ¬∞ ‚Äùwith the addition of a special descaler or ordinary citric acid. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.flipkart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="kalgon for washing machines" class="if uuid-3128884" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/3128884.jpg"></div><h2>  The preparatory process for disassembling the washing machine </h2><p>  Before direct repair, it is necessary to perform preliminary work, which are as follows: </p><ol><li>  Preparation of a place for dismantling: free access to equipment, as well as enough free space for the location of the removed parts. </li><li>  Disconnecting the appliance from the power supply. </li><li>  Stopping the water supply to the machine by setting the tap to the ‚Äúclosed‚Äù position. </li><li>  Disconnecting from other communications. </li><li>  We remove the remaining water using a drain filter located in the lower plane of the front panel. </li><li>  Installation of the unit on the prepared space. </li></ol><h2>  Necessary tools </h2><p>  To carry out repair work to replace the heater in the Samsung washing machine, the following tools are required: </p><ul><li>  electrical pliers or pliers; </li><li>  set of keys; </li><li>  a screwdriver with several nozzles that differ in geometric shape; </li><li>  electrical multimeter; </li><li>  lubricant. </li></ul><h2>  How to disassemble a Samsung washing machine? </h2><p>  The process consists of several stages: </p><p>  1. Removing the upper base of the frame: </p><ul><li>  using a screwdriver, unscrew the screws (2 pcs.) on the back of the case; </li><li>  remove the panel by slightly moving it back. </li></ul><p>  2. Removing the control panel: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  remove the container designed for detergents.  To do this, push it all the way and press the latch installed between the sectors of the tank; </li><li>  unscrew two fasteners installed on the inner base of the dispenser and one fastener located on the right side of the control panel; </li><li>  move the panel and then disconnect it from the case; </li><li>  lay the control panel on the upper plane of the frame. </li></ul><p>  3. Dismantling the front part: </p><ul><li>  removing the rubber seal installed between the round bases of the drum and the hatch.  To do this, it is necessary to slightly unscrew the edge of the round cuff, pick up the metal clamp and remove it using a screwdriver with a flat nozzle; </li><li>  disconnecting the door lock system with an electrical connector; </li><li>  unscrew the fasteners located in the upper and lower plane of the front cover; </li><li>  disconnect the cover from the car frame. </li></ul><h2>  Diagnostics of TEN </h2><p>  After dismantling the front cover of the case, a small insulating insert with conductive terminals located at the edges will be visible.  A fastening element is installed in the middle of the insert.  Do not immediately start replacing the heating device, as the cause of the HE2 error in the Samsung washing machine may be the disconnection of the conductor from the terminal.  To do this, it is necessary to test it: </p><ul><li>  set the multimeter to the "resistance test" mode, choosing the minimum indicator; </li><li>  carefully shift the conductors from the conductive terminals and the temperature sensor; </li><li>  lean on one probe of the device to two contacts of the part; </li><li>  we determine the heater‚Äôs operability: an indicator ranging from 25 to 30 Ohms indicates the working condition of the part, and if the system fails, the value will be 0 or 1. <div class="photo" data-original="topbort.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="he2 samsung washing machine error how to fix" class="if uuid-3128899" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/3128899.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  If the heater is suitable for further operation, we perform a quality connection of the conductors with its contacts.  If, as a result of the diagnosis, it turns out that the heating element is out of order, it will be replaced. </p><h2>  Choosing a new electric device for heating water </h2><p>  You can purchase a <span>heater for the</span> Samsung <span>washing machine</span> in specialized trading companies.  Going to the store, you need to know exactly the model of your device (on the case or in the technical data sheet), as well as an indicator of its power and geometric shape, which must correspond to a failed heater. </p><p>  In the event that this information is not available, it is necessary to select a heater in the presence of a worn-out electrical device.  Spare parts for Samsung washing machines, as a rule, can also be ordered at most service centers, or via the Internet.  In this case, information about the model of the device is required. </p><div class="photo" data-original="by.all.biz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="heating element samsung washing machine" class="if uuid-3128895" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/3128895.jpg"></div><h2>  The process of replacing the heater </h2><p>  To retrieve a worn part, you must perform several steps: </p><ul><li>  using a socket wrench, remove the nut located on the insulating insert; <div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="replacement ten in the washing machine samsung" class="if uuid-3128886" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/3128886.jpg"></div></li><li>  slightly loosen the device, holding his contacts with his hands; </li><li>  strike lightly on the pin on which the fastener was mounted.  To do this, you can use a small hammer or socket wrench; </li><li>  to displace the worn part from the seat, use a screwdriver, which needs to slightly pry the part; </li><li>  remove the device from the inside of the tank. <div class="photo" data-original="mastrr.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="spare parts for washing machines samsung" class="if uuid-3128879" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/3128879.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  The seat has been freed, we proceed to the installation of an unused heater: </p><ul><li>  we check the resistance of the new device with a multimeter; </li><li>  we clear the place of accumulated dirt and scale; </li><li>  we process a sealant with the special substance WD 40; </li><li>  install a new heater for the Samsung washing machine; </li><li>  insert the temperature sensor; </li><li>  We carry out the connection of conductors to the heater contacts. </li></ul><p>  Repair work on replacing the electric heater is completed, you can proceed with the installation of the panels. </p><h2>  The final stage </h2><p>  After completing the full cycle of repair work, we proceed to connecting the machine to all systems: </p><ul><li>  installation of the unit in its former place; </li><li>  connection to the sewer system; </li><li>  installation of a water tap in the "open" position; </li><li>  connecting the machine to electricity; </li><li>  starting the machine in the "wash" mode. </li></ul><p>  If within 10 minutes from the start of the start the he2 code does not appear on the display, then the error has been eliminated. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.how-to-repair.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ten for samsung washing machine" class="if uuid-3128866" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/3128866.jpg"></div><p>  If necessary, spare parts for Samsung washing machines are not difficult to find.  But it is better to prevent premature component failure by following simple rules for operating the device. </p><p>  To extend the service life, it is not necessary to use Calgon for washing machines each time, as the advertisement recommends.  It is much more economical to install a special water filter on the inlet hose or to periodically clean the device using citric acid or special equipment containing it. </p>
