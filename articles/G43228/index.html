What is this object?  What is it for?  As it turns out?  All these issues are of interest to citizens.  After all, all this is closely related to taxes.  This means that it is extremely important for the population and for the state.  Tax liabilities are mandatory for all adults.  So it is important to fully understand what is at stake.  In fact, everything is not as difficult as it seems at first glance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tax account" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1307542.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Definition </h2><p>  Taxpayer <span>personal account</span> - what is it?  Understanding this term is not so difficult if you have already dealt with tax calculations.  It‚Äôs not a secret for anyone that all payments made by citizens must be taken into account somehow.  For this, special accounts were invented.  They are called facial.  They reflect all your operations with certain clients.  We are talking about financial and credit settlements. </p><p>  What is a taxpayer personal account?  From the foregoing, only one conclusion can be drawn - this is a well-known TIN.  It is assigned to every citizen and taxpayer of the Russian Federation; it does not change in a lifetime.  Not so hard as it seems.  You can easily and easily get this document.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter, we are talking about an individual or legal entity! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where to go </h2><p>  Did you need to know the personal taxpayer account?  Where to find this information?  At the moment, there are several solutions to the problem.  And every citizen has the right to independently choose the way to solve the problem. </p><p>  The first and easiest is to apply with a passport to the tax authorities in your area.  There you will be informed of the TIN.  And if necessary, all the data associated with your taxpayer account.  Please note - TIN is only an identifier.  It searches for an account.  We can say that this is his number or "name". </p><p>  Also, the personal account of the taxpayer can be found on the Internet.  Usually either a variety of specialized services or the official website of the Tax Service of the Russian Federation help.  This is a more popular and common method today.  You are able at any time and anywhere to find out the TIN without any problems.  By the way, on the website of the Tax RF you can additionally get all the information that a personal account is fraught with.  There is nothing difficult about this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="personal tax account what is it" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1307543.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Find out the number </h2><p>  And now a little more about <span>how to find out the personal account of the taxpayer.</span>  We have already figured out where to turn to, either look at the Internet or the tax service.  Only according to the principle of operation, these items differ from each other. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For example, to obtain a personal account and information about it through the Tax authorities of the Russian Federation, only a passport is required.  Next, personally go to the regional "tax" office and inform the employee about your decision.  Do not forget to show your ID.  You will be informed of <span>the account number,</span> as well as all the information of interest.  Easy and simple.  Only you can "declassify" only your own personal taxpayer account.  Do not count on a stranger. </p><p>  But if you decide to implement the idea through the Internet, it will be enough just to turn to the "State Services" portal.  To register on it you need a TIN.  The personal account is not displayed anywhere.  It can be found along with all the information using the "Services" section.  There, find the "Account Statement", click on "Receive" and wait a while.  You will have to receive the corresponding document in .pdf format (or by mail if you have noted this earlier).  It will display information about operations with the account, as well as its number. </p><h2>  Getting a TIN </h2><p>  So, now it‚Äôs clear what a personal taxpayer account is.  Where can I get the appropriate identifier, by which it will be possible to receive information about tax calculations?  This is a TIN.  This number is available to all citizens of the Russian Federation.  It is only necessary to know him.  And, accordingly, get a document with this number.  This is not so difficult. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out the personal account of the taxpayer" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1307541.jpg"></div>

    <p>  You can act by several methods: personal appeal or virtual request.  In the first case, you will have to go to the <span>tax office in</span> your area.  But only with a specific list of documents.  Which one? </p><p>  Nothing special is required from you.  To obtain a TIN, you must take an identity card, as well as write a statement of the established form.  Additionally, but without fail, attach to the application any documents confirming your registration - permanent or temporary.  If you act by proxy, the corresponding "paper" will also have to be presented.  With these documents, go to the tax office and let us know that you would like to receive a TIN.  Your request will be reviewed within 7-10 days.  After with your passport, return to the tax office where you applied.  There you will be given a TIN certificate.  With it, it will be possible to find out in detail all the secrets that the personal account of the taxpayer conceals in itself.  This will require an extract.  How exactly does it work?  This was discussed earlier. </p><h2>  FTS to help </h2><p>  Sometimes personal appeal is not too suitable for citizens.  In this case, you can order the TIN directly via the Internet.  To do this, you will have to turn to the website of the Federal Tax Service.  There you can find out the personal account of the taxpayer, and <span>get an extract</span> from it, and order a TIN. </p><p>  Go to nalog.ru and see the possible services.  Find out there "Find out the TIN".  Click on this line, then fill in the required fields.  Next, click on "Submit Request".  Your TIN will appear on the screen.  But this is only if you have the appropriate evidence. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="taxpayer personal account card" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1307540.jpg"></div>

    <p>  When you just need to get the TIN, in the "Services" you have to find <span>"Get the TIN".</span>  Proceed in the same way - just fill in all the necessary fields, then select the type of receipt of the corresponding certificate.  Options available: </p><ul><li>  in electronic format; </li><li>  by mail; </li><li>  personally in the tax service. </li></ul><p>  Accordingly, after receiving the TIN, an extract from the personal account of the taxpayer can be provided to you in a few minutes.  Moreover, both in electronic and paper form. </p><h2>  Change of registration / last name </h2><p>  Some are interested in whether it is necessary to change the TIN (and personal account) if you decide to change your name or registration.  This question makes many think seriously. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="taxpayer account where to get" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1307544.jpg"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Do not worry - it has already been said that the TIN is assigned once and for all.  When changing your last name or place of registration, just call (or rather, personally go) the tax office of your area and report the changes.  Do not forget to present evidence.  New information will be entered into the system, and you will have the previous personal account of the taxpayer and the "old" TIN.  That is, the card of the personal account of the taxpayer will remain without significant changes. </p>
