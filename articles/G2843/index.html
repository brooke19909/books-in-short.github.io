    <p>  Nevertheless, tourists often come here.  What <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="46" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">draws</span> them to these godforsaken places?  Are there any attractions in <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="4" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling" data-group="agnonym-">Teriberka</span> ?  Or the charm of these places only in the wild and <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="47" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">remoteness</span> from the big city? </p><h2>  First settlement </h2><p>  As already mentioned, there is a village on the banks of the <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="5" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling" data-group="agnonym-">Teriberka</span> River.  It is easy to guess that people who appeared here several centuries ago were engaged in fishing.  It is known that the first settlement arose in the 17th century.  But then, of course, there were very few people here.  In 1608, no more than six families lived on the territory of modern <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="6" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling" data-group="agnonym-">Teriberka</span> .  The Murmansk region borders on Finland and Norway, and therefore the residents of these places did not always live in peace.  In 1623, the village was attacked by a military squadron, but not Finnish and not Norwegian, but Danish.  Opponents drove the Russian army deeper into the mainland, seized supplies and destroyed trophy boats. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Teriberka in the 19th century </h2><p>  Restlessly, the inhabitants of the camp lived two hundred years later.  In 1809, the settlement was burned by the British.  However, after 14 years it was restored, and it became one of the best in the Murmansk region.  In the middle of the XIX century, the active settlement of <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="8" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling" data-group="agnonym-">Teriberka began</span> .  Russian colonists arrived here.  The government created rather favorable conditions, for example, new residents received good benefits.  True, the first time I had to live in dugouts, but this people, apparently, was quite hardworking.  Local residents were engaged in fishing, <span>whaling,</span> livestock. </p><p>  In the second half of the 19th century, the first Orthodox church appeared in <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="9" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling" data-group="agnonym-">Teriberka</span> .  It was built on a donation from industrialists.  And in 1875, the church of the <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="1" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">Prophet Elijah</span> was opened, and ten years later the church of the Icon of the Mother of God.  At the end of the 19th century, a lighthouse with a pneumatic siren was launched. </p><p>  By the beginning of the XX century, Teriberka became a full-fledged settlement.  There were churches, a lighthouse, and a hydrometeorological station, founded in 1893.  In addition, a feldsher’s point worked - the only one on the entire coast.  At the same time, schools and a people's house were opened - a type of cultural and educational institution, prevalent in pre-revolutionary Russia. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At the beginning of the century, sharks and cod crafts were particularly developed.  True, the majority of the people involved in this type of activity were the Norwegians, who had <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="58" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkGrammar" data-mce-mark="1">their own</span> <span data-annotation-idx="1" data-annotation="58" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkGrammar" data-mce-mark="1">store</span> and a trading post here.  The cod trade was quite active.  Five years before the revolution, <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="11" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling" data-group="agnonym-" data-mce-mark="1">Teriberka</span> became a regional center, by the beginning of World War I more than one and a half thousand people lived here. </p>

    <h2>  Soviet time </h2><p>  After the revolution, of course, much has changed.  Norwegians had to stop their business.  A collective farm was organized on the territory of the <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="48" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">village</span> , which included, in addition to fishing <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="27" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">shnyak</span> , a dairy <span>farm, a deer</span> herd.  By the end of the 20s, the village was already the center of the district of the same name.  And in the early thirties, nurseries for collective farm workers opened here. </p><p>  In addition to the above trades, fishing for herring and <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="49" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">salmon</span> was also developed.  In February 1930, a new collective farm was created, called the Red Banner.  Significant support was given to him by the revolutionary and military leader Kliment Voroshilov <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="28" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkStyle">.</span>  In 1932, a motor-fishing station was opened, which became one of the first on the peninsula.  This station included both a mooring and ship repair workshops. </p><p>  In the 30s, the majority of the population were dispossessed peasants from Astrakhan.  Local residents equipped a radio center, carried out electrification, built a cinema, club, hospitals, and began to publish a newspaper.  <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="12" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling" data-group="agnonym-">Teriberka</span> received the status of a working village in 1938.  But the real prosperity <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="50" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">of the</span> settlement <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="51" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">occurred</span> in the postwar years. </p><p>  During the Great Patriotic War, air defense troops were stationed here.  Despite the fact that <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="13" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling" data-group="agnonym-">Teriberka</span> was behind the front line, she was attacked several times <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="52" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">by</span> German bombers.  The collective farm continued to work, but almost all of the products went to the front. </p>

    <p>  In the fifties, <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="14" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling" data-group="agnonym-">Teriberka</span> had a dairy factory, a poultry farm, a large herd of deer, and an American mink breeding enterprise.  In those days, the inhabitants of the village earned good money.  And this, in turn, contributed to an increase in population.  The village began to decline in decline not after the collapse of the <span>Soviet Union,</span> but much earlier <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="41" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">-</span> in the sixties. </p><p>  Such is the brief history of <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="15" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling" data-group="agnonym-">Teriberka</span> , whose inhabitants once lived in abundance.  Today, less than a thousand people live here.  Of these, nearly two hundred are unemployed.  So what are the attractions of <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="16" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling" data-group="agnonym-">Teriberka</span> attract tourists to these cold lands?  After all, today the village is included in the most popular routes. </p>

    <h2>  Teriberka (Murmansk): attractions </h2><p>  First of all, it is worth saying that it was here that the famous film <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="31" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">"</span> Leviathan <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="32" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">"</span> was shot.

However, <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="2" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkStyle">hundreds of thousands of residents from other regions</span> come to the Murmansk region every year in order to go fishing and skiing.  As for <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="19" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling" data-group="agnonym-">Teriberka</span> , there are about twenty sights here.  Among them: </p><ul><li>  <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="20" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling" data-group="agnonym-">Teriberka</span> River. </li><li>  Church. </li><li>  Abandoned port. </li><li>  Ship cemetery. </li><li>  Old weather station. </li><li>  Coastal battery on the <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="37" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSemantic">harrow</span> . </li></ul><h2>  Harsh landscapes </h2><p>  One of the attractions of <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="21" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling" data-group="agnonym-">Teriberka</span> <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="42" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">is a</span> waterfall.
