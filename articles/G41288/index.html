    <p>  Among the competitors, Nokia smartphones stood out primarily in appearance.  The Finnish company worked out every little thing so that the device was recognizable and striking.  This feature also affected the updated N95: strict outlines and external elements that attract attention. </p><p>  The model is a slider, like its predecessor.  The front of the smartphone is made of glossy plastic.  The back material is similar, but already with a soft touch coating.  Unfortunately, fingerprints remain on the device, especially on the front panel.  The manufacturer took care of the screen protection.  A glass is installed on the display to avoid minor scratches. </p><p>  There are much more controls than on Android devices.  Although the external details create a unique style Nokia N95 8Gb.  The sliding part of the device will be especially interesting.  In the lower position, the keyboard will be available to the user, and in the upper position - elements for working with the player.  The decision to make the model a two-way slider is quite interesting. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The front part of the device was equipped with a speaker, front-end, display and controls.  Since the screen is not touch, the buttons on the front of the device are responsible for all the actions.  The device has two speakers, which are located on the side panels.  On the right side placed: <span>volume control,</span> player start and shutter buttons.  On the left is the charging jack and infrared port. </p><p>  The main camera and flash are on the back of the device.  The smartphone is collapsible, this is hinted by the presence of a cover on the rear panel.  Underneath is a battery and card slot.  The manufacturer refused the flash drive, since the updated N95 has as much as 8Gb of memory.  The bottom end has become a haven for 3.5 connector, usb jack and microphone. </p><p>  Compared to modern devices, the N95 8GB is tiny.  However, despite the small dimensions, the model turned out to be thick.  A small device also weighs a lot, as much as 128 grams.  Build quality will please, but there are minor creaks.  The device is available in black.  The manufacturer adheres to standard colors and rarely experiments with them. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  The screen of the <span>Nokia N95</span> 8Gb has become a little larger than its predecessor.  The diagonal of the device is 2.8 inches.  The small display received a resolution of 320 by 240 pixels.  The user will find ‚Äúcubes‚Äù on the screen of his device.  Pixels are noticeable especially in icons and text.  The display is capable of displaying 16 million colors.  In general, the screen is not bad for the 2007 device. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Installed in the Nokia N95 8Gb TFT matrix.  The technology is doing well, but it doesn‚Äôt work well in the sun.  Despite the excellent margin of brightness, the screen fades in bright light.  Lame and viewing angles.  The user will experience a slight distortion of the picture. </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  Like almost all Nokia smartphones, the model is equipped with Carl Zeiss optics with an aperture of f / 2.8.  The matrix of the updated N95 is 5 megapixels.  The pictures are quite decent, the phone can easily replace a simple soap box.  For everyday tasks, a camera is enough, but you should not count on much. </p><p>  Without additional functions, too, could not have done.  The smartphone‚Äôs camera is able to eliminate red eyes in pictures.  There is also a simple autofocus.  A lot of shooting modes.  In addition to automatic, the user is available portrait, close-up, sports and landscape.  There is also a night mode, but the image quality in it is blurry and lacking in sharpness. </p><p>  With the help of the settings, the owner can achieve decent quality.  In the model, you can adjust the <span>white balance</span> and choose the lighting suitable for the photo.  The device adjusts sharpness and contrast.  The user has something to work with, but will it be good for that? </p><p>  Nokia N95 8Gb is capable of recording videos as well.  The quality is so-so, since the resolution is only 640 by 480, but there is a function.  Video is shot in MPEG4 format.  It is doubtful that the user will often resort to this function. </p><p>  Present in the device and the front camera.  There is nothing to brag about here.  There is a recording of videos with a funny resolution of 176 by 144 pixels.  Photos also do not shine with quality.  The resolution of images is only 320 by 240 pixels. </p><h2>  Hardware </h2>

    <p>  The <span>Nokia N95</span> 8Gb original has an ARM 11 processor with a performance of just 332 GHz.  For an unpretentious OS and a weak "stuffing" this is enough.  There is also little RAM, only 128 MB.  Even with the memory consumption for the system, the user will have enough balances for almost any task. </p><p>  A typical N95 had a flash drive.  The novelty, alas, is deprived of the opportunity to increase memory.  Although the especially new N95 does not need this.  The manufacturer allocated models of as many as 8 GB of native memory.  The user of this amount is enough for both applications and multimedia. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  Under the cover, behind the device, a 1200 maH battery is hidden.  The battery provides a good battery life.  In standby mode, the device will last two or three days.  When making calls, working with mail and using the camera, a full battery will last a little more than a day.  If you use the N95 8 GB continuously, the battery will run out in 5-6 hours. </p><h2>  System </h2>

    <p>  Installed in the Nokia N95 8Gb Symbian firmware version 9.2.  There is also a proprietary shell on top of the system.  OS adaptation at altitude and serious freezes do not occur.  The platform is undemanding and consumes a minimum of RAM.  Most of the necessary programs are already on the device, and the missing ones can be installed.  Of course, Symbian is not as interesting as Android, but it can do a lot. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The set includes instructions, Nokia N95 8Gb, headset, charger and usb.  Options are familiar to devices on Symbian.  There will be no desire to get rid of the standard headset, because the headphones are of high quality, like the rest of the set.  Most likely, the user will need a case to protect the plastic case from damage and fingerprints. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  The N95 8Gb is definitely the pinnacle of the manufacturer‚Äôs craftsmanship in 2007.  Nokia has collected in its flagship the most excellent features and functionality.  Naturally, there were some minor flaws, but in general, everything is fine.  Although you should not expect less from the then market leader. </p>
