  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Quebec flag: history and symbolism</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The flag of Quebec is a blue and white banner, the design of which is recognized as the best among the Canadian provinces - such a conclusion was made by the North American Vexillological Association, after conducting a large-scale study in 2001.  The history of the flag is rooted in the distant past, when Canada had just begun its formation as a state.  Selected colors have a deep meaning. </p><h2>  Flag History </h2><p>  Surprisingly and unbelievably, Quebec's own flag arose earlier than the flag of the state of Canada.  The provincial population was united by a common history and culture, which allowed people to express a coherent and thoughtful political position almost two decades earlier than all of Canada, which at that time was somewhat fragmented. </p><div class="photo" data-original="imperialflags.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Flag of the British Merchant Fleet in Canada" class="if uuid-2523967" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2523967.jpg"></div><p>  Until the mid-20th century, there were two banners in Canada: the official banner of Great Britain and the flag of the British merchant navy, where the Canadian coat of arms and a small British symbol in the left corner flaunted on a red background.  Both options clearly demonstrated the influence of the British Kingdom on this overseas colony. </p><h2>  The influence of Britain and France </h2><p>  Among Canadians with French roots, discontent spread over the flag.  The French-speaking population was persistent, and the government agreed to a discussion about changing the flag.  The debate lasted a long time.  The only point that did not cause controversy was the red maple leaves - a long-standing symbol of Canada.  However, the participants in the discussion failed to agree on what background the maple should be located: on white, blue or red.  The English-speaking population did not want to see a white background - a symbol of the French monarchy, and French speakers demanded to abandon the red - the personification of the English crown. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Quebec flag.  What does it symbolize? </h2><p>  While debate over the <span>flag of Canada,</span> there was a debate in Quebec.  The influence of the French in this part of the country was undeniable, therefore, the selected banner design symbolized the centuries-old history of France and French America.  A blue flag with a snow-white cross in the center fluttered on the mast of the first French ship, which managed to climb up the St. Lawrence River, bringing with it the greatness of the French crown.  This version of the flag was for some time considered the flag of France and was used by merchant ships.  White heraldic lilies, traditionally symbolizing the French monarchy, were placed in the four corners of the banner. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.onlinestores.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Quebec flag" class="if uuid-2524082" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2524082.jpg"></div><p>  On January 21, 1948, the British national flag waving at the National Assembly in Quebec was officially replaced by the Quebec flag - a blue canvas with a white cross and four white lilies.  Thus, the Quebec banner was approved long before the appearance of the flag of the entire Canadian state. </p><h2>  Quebec City </h2><p>  Almost forty years later, the flag of the <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãof Quebec</span> (the capital of the province of the same name) was officially adopted.  A golden yellow sailing vessel surrounded by a white battlement was depicted on an azure background.  The ship was symbolized by the sailing ship of Samuel de Champlain (considered the founder of the settlement), who first climbed <span>the St. Lawrence River.</span>  Sails personified courage, battlement - city walls, and a bright blue background - fidelity, sovereignty, grandeur and calm wisdom.  The golden color of the ship expressed strength, wealth and justice, and the white tines - purity, mercy and victory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Quebec City Flag" class="if uuid-2524085" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2524085.jpg"></div><p>  As for the flag of Canada, it was adopted only in 1965.  On a white canvas between wide red stripes arranged vertically, a crimson maple leaf flaunts.  As a result of long discussions, the blue of the sea gave way to the traditionally British red color, and they decided to replace the first three leaflets with one to demonstrate the unity of the Canadian people. </p>
