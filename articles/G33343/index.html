The pension created at the expense of the Federal Customs Service annually receives customs officers, members of their families and vacationers on holiday packages. </p><h2>  Pension "White Sun" in Zelenogorsk.  What is this place and where is it located? </h2><p>  On the shore of the Gulf of Finland, 50 km from the city of St. Petersburg, there is a small picturesque resort-type town - Zelenogorsk.  The unique local climate has contributed to the emergence of many recreational facilities on the municipal territory, such as recreation centers, motels, spa hotels and various pensions.  Among them stands out "White Sun" - a boarding house in Zelenogorsk FCS (Federal Customs Service).  The health resort is located on the coast of the Gulf of Finland, in the zone of mixed forests with predominance of coniferous vegetation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pohjoiseen.fi" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gulf of Finland Beach" class="if uuid-2798890" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/105375/2798890.jpg"></div><p>  A clean sandy beach stretching over 10 km stretches on the coast.  You can say, ‚ÄúWhite Sun‚Äù is located in an ideal place for a healthy holiday: here there are coniferous forests saturated with ozone, and access to the coast with unique sea air and clean sand.  The forest belt is a natural barrier to cold northerly winds.  Winter in these parts is rather mild by Russian standards, summer is moderately sultry, air humidity due to the proximity of the Gulf of Finland is quite high.  All of the above makes these places very favorable for the treatment and climatotherapy of various ailments, including diseases of the circulatory system, nervous system and respiratory system.  The coast of the Gulf of Finland near the boarding house "White Sun" in Zelenogorsk in the photo looks simply amazing, in reality, of course, everything is much more colorful. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Conditions of stay </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the boarding house "White Sun" in Zelenogorsk is under constant protection, the vacationer will not see fences typical for the protected areas here, instead there is spaciousness and picturesque nature.  Everything in this place was created for a comfortable stay with no restrictions on movement.  Cellular communication operates throughout the boarding house, all popular Russian mobile communication operators are supported.  For emergencies, a call desk is available.  It is safe to say that vacationers will not have problems with communication with the outside world. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="One of the buildings" class="if uuid-2799256" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/105375/2799256.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get to Zelenogorsk boarding house "White Sun" </h2><p>  The first question that arises for a vacationer: how to get to the health resort?  The White Sun boarding house is located in Zelenogorsk, at the address: Primorskoye Shosse, 511. Even a person who first finds himself in these places should not have any problems finding a route.  An electric train runs from Finland Station to Zelenogorsk.  In the city at the bus stop, it remains to find bus routes numbered 312 and 411. Both go to the Chernaya Rechka metro station and directly to the destination (Sea Surf).  There are other options, such as minibus number K-400, which starts its route from the stop "Ploshchad Lenina", which is next to the Finland Station.  These routes work from 7.00 to 23.00.  Waiting for transport, as a rule, does not exceed 30 minutes.  The final stop for all types of transport - boarding house "White Sun".  Zelenogorsk, where there are many health resorts besides the described one, is a very small town, so getting lost here is a more serious problem than finding the right road. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="60.1894226" data-lng="29.74544639999999" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/8/5/5/8/8558.png"></div><p>  Car owners can independently find the right place.  Moving along the Sredne-Vyborg highway, at the 55th kilometer you can see the intersection.  Turning left on it, you need to move to the next intersection and then turn left again. </p><h2>  The appearance and functionality of the recreation center </h2><p>  On one of the terraces of the Gulf of Finland there are buildings of the White Sun boarding house.  Zelenogorsk is essentially a coastal city, so there are many recreational facilities on the local terraces, embankments and beaches.  The complex of buildings of the "White Sun" was built on a section of a ridge rising above the sea.  The total territory of the health resort is about 8 hectares, most of which is occupied by a picturesque forest zone.  In the park in several places there are sports and playgrounds, gazebos and benches, awnings and barbecues, in short, everything that a vacationer may need.  There is also a rental point for sports equipment for summer and winter outdoor activities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pergolas and barbecue facilities" class="if uuid-2799295" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/105375/2799295.jpg"></div><p>  The complex of buildings includes many buildings for recreation, leisure and treatment.  Here is a rather rich library by the standards of a boarding house, a hall for concerts and film screenings, gyms, a music salon, a billiard room, table tennis, and also a room for children's leisure.  In summer, an open-air pool with a good cleaning system and heated water is available.  Nearby there is a real tennis court, as well as volleyball, basketball and indoor soccer fields. </p><p>  There is a bike rental service in the park, and there are bicycle paths throughout the square that extend into the grove.  This type of leisure is quite popular among visitors, because it combines the pleasant with the useful in the best way possible. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gstours.gr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bike rent" class="if uuid-2799299" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/105375/2799299.jpg"></div><p>  In winter, holidaymakers are offered a spacious ice rink, ornate ski routes laid through the forest, as well as rental of Finnish sleds.  The latter, by the way, have their own track, laid within the forest zone, and are one of the most popular entertainments among guests.  In winter, there is no less entertainment than in the summer.  Many trips for this reason are ordered precisely during the New Year holidays.  Combining the healing effects of climate and outdoor activities, you can improve your health and just spend time with good use. </p><div class="photo" data-original="jooinn.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ski equipment rental" class="if uuid-2799300" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/105375/2799300.jpg"></div><h2>  Services </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, the boarding house is under the jurisdiction of the Federal Customs Service.  It follows that the majority of vacationers are FCS employees or members of their families.  A voucher for employees is available at a discount.  However, the service in the pension is at the highest level for all vacationers.  Among the services provided there are both preventive and therapeutic measures, as well as entertaining ones.  The latter include various cultural events: concerts, film screenings and excursions. </p><h2>  Medical service </h2><p>  Medical care in the "White Sun" at the highest level.  The treating staff consists of qualified specialists in the field of disease prevention.  Clients have access to a whole range of health-improving measures, including physiotherapy, aerophytotherapy, and treatment with fresh and mineral waters.  Among water procedures, it is worth highlighting various types of souls: ascending, circular and Charcot. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gumtree.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Real massage" class="if uuid-2799303" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/105375/2799303.jpg"></div><p>  Many types of massage, both manual and mechanical, within walking distance for a vacationer.  In addition to the entire client, electric power, a solarium, a modern gym, indoor and outdoor pools, as well as a phytobar are available. </p><h2>  Available rooms </h2><p>  Visitors are provided with a wide selection of rooms to stay.  A choice of single, double and triple rooms, equipped with refrigerators, televisions and electric kettles.  The rooms are small but comfortable.  Their functionality is quite enough for a short stay.  The local dining room provides a delicious and nutritious breakfast, lunch and dinner. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ka-plus.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="room interior" class="if uuid-2800047" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29489/2800047.jpg"></div><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  A comfortable local bus can take people on excursions to the cities of the Russian north.  The excursion program is primarily aimed at visiting the sights of St. Petersburg.  In addition to visiting the cultural capital, the bus will pass past famous places of classical literature, including the cities of Vyborg, Pavlovsk, Kronshtadt, Petrodvorets and Pushkin. </p><h2>  Opinions </h2><p>  Pension "White Sun" in Zelenogorsk, reviews of which are very eloquent, is one of the most visited and beloved health resorts of the Leningrad region.  The high quality of the infrastructure and the services provided is evidenced by the positive feedback from visitors and the impressive number of vacationers.  No need for a lot of big words.
