  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Microscope device</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A microscope is an indispensable assistant for researchers and medical staff.  The use of such a device allowed scientists to make a lot of important discoveries.  Therefore, it is interesting to know what a microscope device is, for what purpose it is used, and what types of this device exist. </p><p>  <strong>A brief excursion into the history of science</strong> </p><p>  In fact, to find out which of the scientists was the first to invent the microscope today is a difficulty, because a few hundred years ago the records and records were not very strict.  Of course, the first lenses and other magnifying devices began to be used for a long time.  But the date from the first complex microscope is considered the period from 1590 to 1610.  It was at this time that information began to arrive from various scientists about the creation of a device for the visual increase of small objects. </p><p>  Some evidence suggests that the first microscope was created in 1590 by Hans and Zachary Janssen.  On the other hand, a <span>magnifying device</span> was officially introduced by Galileo Halley.  Some historians believe that Anthony Vann Levenguk first began using the zoom system.  You can see that historical information is quite contradictory. </p><p>  Of course, in the 1600s, such devices were little reminiscent of modern ones.  The device of the microscope was quite simple and consisted of a system of two lenses, which worked only in <span>natural light.</span>  In the future, it was thought to use special mirrors for the concentration of the light beam. </p><p>  To date, there are several varieties of such devices. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Optical microscope</strong> </p><p>  This device is probably known to everyone since school times.  Microscope design is not that difficult.  The device consists of two parts.  The mechanical component is designed to fix the optical system and ease of use.  The mechanical parts are a tripod, tube, stage, macro- and microscrews. </p><p>  The optical part of the microscope consists of an eyepiece and lenses.  In addition, there is also a specific lighting system that is responsible for collecting light, concentrating the light beam and transmitting it to the right place.  The lighting system consists of a capacitor, a mirror, a transformer.  Some microscopes have a built-in low-voltage lamp. </p><p>  <strong>Polarizing microscope</strong> </p><p>  This is a kind of <span>optical device</span> with only a few differences.  This device is designed to study the so-called anisotropic objects, including minerals, biological products and polymers.  By the way, these same materials can also be studied under an ordinary microscope, equipping it with just a few <span>polarizing filters.</span> </p><p>  <strong>Binocular microscope</strong> </p><p>  Unlike the optical instrument described above, this microscope has only one lens, but two eyepieces.  It significantly increases the objects in question.  Of course, using such a device, cells cannot be seen.  The binocular is designed to study small parts of a plant, animal organs, minerals, etc.  Indeed, an optical microscope, due to a large increase, does not provide an opportunity to examine objects of such sizes. </p><p>  <strong>Electron microscope</strong> </p><p>  This invention is by far the largest breakthrough in science, because it allows you to consider objects, increasing them several thousand times.  Of course, the construction of a microscope is much more complicated.  The lighting system used here is not a light beam, but a directed electron beam.  Such a device allows you to consider even the smallest details at the subcellular level.  It was with its help that the organelles of the cells of living organisms were studied, and the structure of viral particles was also considered. </p><p>  In any case, the invention of the microscope allowed people to take a huge step in the development of science. </p>
