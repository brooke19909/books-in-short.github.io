Meaning of the word “penates”</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Initially, the Penates are pre-Roman deities protecting the house, or rather, standing on guard of the family’s food, because penus is translated as “pantry”, and many assume that the name of the heavenly guardians came from this word.  Later in Roman mythology the cult of the Penates already appeared, to which all the patrons of the house belong.  Usually, two Penates stood guard over the ancient Roman family.  So deified ancestors. </p><h2>  Etymology of the word </h2>

Cicero allowed the formation of the name from the word penitus - living inside.  Therefore, <span>Roman poets,</span> in contrast to Russian, in which the term was also incredibly popular, but in a different interpretation, often called these deities Penetrales, or "penetrating."  Penates are home deities that are part of the retinue of the goddess Vesta, the guardian of the hearth.  According to legend, the second king of Rome, <span>Numa Pompilius,</span> built in the city the first temple of the <span>goddess Vesta.</span>  Its hidden central part is called Pen (from penetralia - the internal secret compartment of a house or temple).  It maintained <span>eternal flame,</span> and state Penates were kept.  The theory of the origin of the name of the gods from the heart of the temple of Vesta is quite acceptable.

In the Latin version, this thought was as follows: Penates Publici Populi Romani. </p><p>  The history of state Penates in ancient Rome is not known for certain.  The uninitiated knew little about them; their keeping was shrouded in mystery.  It was believed that they were brought by Aeneas from Troy.  And what they were, only the priests and vestals - servants of the cult of Vesta knew.  But it was believed that the state Penates are the most important shrines of Rome.  They guarded the empire and served as a guarantee of prosperity and peace of the whole people. </p><h2>  Lovely, family, home ... </h2>

Clay and wooden images of them were stored in a separate cabinet located at the hearth.  It has already been noted that the cult of the Penates was identified with the deification of the ancestors.  The housekeepers who care for the welfare of the family, they were dead parents or simply made idols, all united under the understandable name of "native Penates."  And for all generations it was natural and desirable to return to them, no matter how far a person was.  For most people, their home, shelter, hearth have always been a guiding star in their life's journey.

And the expression "native Penates" ceased to personify guardian gods.  It has become synonymous with why at home.  And not everyone would understand the situation correctly if they showed him a talisman and called it Penat.  It would be necessary to tell the background.  Now there is a real estate agency called "Native Penates."  Well, of course, the authors of the title meant cozy apartments that could become a stepfather's house, and not some gods.  Guardian penates belong to a different time, a different culture.  But through the years all that warm and dear has passed, which is connected with the hearth, near which the family was gathering, where it was comfortable and reliable, because you were guarded by house gods.  As Mtsyri said on his deathbed: “... And I remembered our father’s house, before the evening hearth there were long stories about how people lived in the past ...” All this is close and beloved, associated with the place of birth and a happy childhood, it implies the phrase “dear Penates". </p><h2>  The idea of ​​a family nest </h2>

In 1899, already a famous painter, I. Repin buys a plot of land 50 km from St. Petersburg, erects a house and carefully equips the territory.  The choice fell on the village of Kuokkala because since 1898 Ilya Efimovich Repin served as the rector of the Academy, he had plenty of responsibilities.  Getting from the village to the duty station was quite convenient thanks to the railway line, and the place itself was secluded and quiet.

    <h2>  Deserved title </h2><p>  Everything turned out as planned: a shelter, where you are always attracted to return, where there are many loving relatives and friends, where success always accompanies you.  Soon after the family was justified, the owner received the title of professor and workshop leader at the Academy of Arts.  Manor Repin "Penates" fully justified its name.  The great painter lived here for 30 happy years. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Repinsky Penates" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/537852.jpg" width="500"></div>  This was the real house of the artist, he loved every corner here, and each corner had its own name.  I. Repin lived here until his death, which happened on September 29, 1930.  He was 86 years old.  According to his request, he was buried here, on the estate, next to the house and Chugueva hill.  The village of Kuokkala was renamed Repino, and now there is the Penates Museum, well-known to every Russian, which was founded in 1940.

    <h2>  Modesty and democratic morals of the estate </h2><p>  Unfortunately, during the war the house burned out completely, the entire estate was damaged.  Remained oak, planted immediately after the funeral.  After the war, the estate was completely restored, and the new museum opened in 1964.  Now it is a federal architectural monument.  You can talk about him for a very long time.  All the most famous and best people of that time visited the estate of the artist. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Manor Repin Penates" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/537853.jpg" width="600"></div>  I received I. Repin on Wednesdays, the rest of the days he worked.  Repin Wednesdays were known to both capitals, guests gathered at the estate after 3 hours.  Repin was a unique person; his estate “Penates” was also unique.  On its territory there were laws.  The artist did not hold the servants in principle, and two women who helped around the house lived here on equal terms with the owners, ate everything at the same table.  Serving anyone was strictly prohibited.  For those who violated the established procedure, a punishment was provided in the form of a public speech condemning their act.

    <h2>  The attractiveness of repin environments </h2><p>  These democratic relations, without barriness, made the Repin Penates particularly attractive.  The atmosphere was very pleasant.  The simplicity and modesty of the owner, who did not boast of merit and idol of his time, the lack of pretentiousness in the situation - all contributed to the establishment of companionship between the owners and guests of the estate.  It should be noted that, being impressed by the speeches of A. N. Beketov and Leo Tolstoy, who were guests here, about eating killing-free food, vegetarianism dominated the estate.  Much of the decor was made according to the sketches of the artist.  So the guest table was two-tier and rotating.  Dishes were placed on the first tier, and each of the guests could turn the desired food to himself by turning the handle.  Only in 1918, when there was a tension with food, ordinary food was served to the table.  At the same time, the border with Finland was closed, “Penates” became for Repin himself and many Russians in this country a piece of his homeland.  An artist of his own Academy bequeathed his legendary estate.  Thanks to the great painter, the name of his estate has found its own life.  When they say or write the word “Penates” in quotation marks and with a capital letter, it becomes clear that we are talking about the estate of Ilya Repin. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="manor penates" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/537854.jpg" width="556"></div>
