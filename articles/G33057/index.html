    <h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  The opening of Kipriotis Panorama Suites 5 * took place in 2001.  This complex consists of a main seven-story building located on a hilltop, as well as small cottages, 1 or 2 floors high.  The hotel is notable for the fact that it is part of the well-known network of Iberostar Greece SA, and also participates in The Consular Corps Discount Scheme. </p><p>  The complex is located in the eastern part of the island of Kos, a few kilometers from its capital of the same name, in the town of Psalidi.  The airport can be reached from here in about half an hour by car. </p><p>  In the immediate vicinity there are no special attractions, except for landscapes.  But a 3-5-minute drive away is the Loggia Mosque, the Hippocrates tree, the ancient Agora, the monastery of Agia Paraskevi, the amphitheater, Asklepion Kosa, as well as many other interesting places. </p><p>  But the most important thing is that from the hotel to its own private beach can be reached in 2 minutes on foot.  To the sea here - within easy reach, and this is the main highlight of the hotel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

If the room has a panoramic view, then guests can enjoy views of the endless sea.  Side?  Then you can watch the sunset or sunrise. </p><p>  The cleaning here is on top.  Rooms are cleaned every day, towels are replaced with new ones, and coffee, tea and sugar are replenished. </p><p>  Even at the tour desk, ticket office and hotel shops, everything is cheaper than in the city or nearby places. </p><p>  Many also admire the hotel grounds.  She's clean, big, neat.  And almost tame partridges, pigeons and other birds walk around the territory.  The hotel also has its own paddock with deer, which even allow themselves to be stroked.  Animal lovers will love this. </p><p>  By the way, if you want to enjoy the silence, it is better to come here in winter or autumn.  The climate here is pleasant, not very picky even swim.
