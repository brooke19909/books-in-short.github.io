  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ekimchan, Amur Region: severe living conditions and unique nature</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Ekimchan of the Amur Region is an urban-type settlement in the Russian Federation.  Located in the Far North, removed from almost all settlements of the region.  To the city of Blagoveshchensk - 655 kilometers, and the nearest railway station - "February" - is removed by 170 kilometers.  The nearest settlement is PGT Tokur (15 kilometers).  Therefore, getting here is considered great happiness, and such a journey is available only to very brave travelers.  But who got here, says that it seems that the time machine is working and you get to the beginning of the XX century. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="53.0748279" data-lng="132.93672530000003" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="7"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/0/7/5/1075.png"></div><h2>  general characteristics </h2><p>  Only 1,034 people live in the village of Ekimchan, Amur Region (statistics at the beginning of last year). </p><p>  The history of the name is shrouded in legend.  Allegedly, in ancient times, two Yakuts - Ekim and Chan - got to the banks of the Selemju River.  But suddenly one of them fell into the water and began to sink.  His friend immediately rushed to the rescue, as a result, both died. </p><p>  The first mention of this settlement dates back to 1882.  The status of <span>urban type the village</span> received only in 1961. </p><p>  It is quite cold here, in January the temperature can drop to -32 ˚, and in July it rarely rises to +7 ˚. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="mapsrf.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Map of the Amur Region" class="if uuid-2288597" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2288597.jpg"></div><h2>  Economy </h2><p>  The village is surrounded by gold mines, however, the whole history of the Selemdzhinsky region is associated with the extraction of this precious metal.  Today in the region there are 12 enterprises. </p><p>  However, for Ekimchan, Amur Region, the economic basis is logging, in particular for China.  Local residents are engaged in picking berries and mushrooms, fishing and hunting on an industrial scale, because in the area there are virgin forests, rivers and mountains. </p><div class="photo" data-original="apdv.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Airport &quot;Ekimchan&quot;" class="if uuid-2288601" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2288601.jpg"></div><h2>  An airport </h2><p>  Not far from the village, in the northeast, Ekimchan Airport is located.  He is assigned the class “D” and its main purpose is local flight flights and only in the daytime.  Airplanes of the Yak-40 and <span>An-28, An-2</span> type are operated here <span>.</span>  Helicopter landing of any type is possible. </p><p>  Last November, a plane crash occurred.  When transporting goods from the village of Ekimchan to the village of Udskoye, an airplane belonging to the Zodiac Group company crashed.  The tragedy occurred some 600 meters from the runway.  There were no passengers on board, but one of the two pilots died.  The accident occurred due to engine failure, and the plane crashed in the vicinity of the Pokrovsky key.  A criminal case was instituted on the fact of the incident. </p><p>  If we talk about good, then in 2016, work began on the reconstruction of the airport, completed at the end of 2017.  There is not such heavy traffic, and mainly flights are made along the same route: Ekimchan - February.  In 2016, only 1 thousand people used the air transportation services, and the same amount was transported monthly every month back in 1980.  However, the cost of flights is low, about 4100 rubles, which equals the cost of travel by bus to the city of Blagoveshchensk. </p><div class="photo" data-original="2x2.su" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The consequences of a broken dam" class="if uuid-2288606" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2288606.jpg"></div><h2>  Dam </h2><p>  In July last year, in the village of Ekimchan, Amur Region, there was another incident - it broke through a dam and flooded the entire village.  It was built by gold miners; most of all, those who live in the area of ​​Pokrovsky Key were unlucky.  As a result of the disaster, no one was hurt, but huge damage was done. </p><p>  Despite all the incidents, if you want to see the unique nature, which is almost untouched by humans, be sure to go to this village of the Amur region.  On the map, this is a small point surrounded by forests and rivers. </p>
