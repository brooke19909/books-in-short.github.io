    <h2>  Kings Park </h2><p>  Having visited St. Petersburg, you must definitely visit Pavlovsk.  This suburb, located near St. Petersburg, was previously the estate of Emperor Paul the First. </p><p>  All the <span>sights of Pavlovsk</span> surprise their guests with their unusualness and beauty.  An outstanding highlight of the city is the park, which bears the same name Pavlovsky.  This summer residence of the sovereign is not in vain included in the sights of Pavlovsk. </p><p>  Tsar's Park is one of the largest in Europe.  It is located on six hundred hectares and was created in the early nineteenth century.  It is recognized as the best <span>landscape park in the</span> world, as the architectural structures and landscape have found surprisingly accurate proportionality.  Green lands are located on a hill in the valley of the Slavyanka River. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Pavlovsk Palace </h2><p>  What else is worth seeing the sights of Pavlovsk?  Be sure to visit the <span>Pavlovsk Palace,</span> which is located on the banks of the river.  The residence is visible from any corner of the park, the building is made in the Italian manner of a country villa.  If you look at the palace from above, you can see that it resembles a horseshoe. </p><p>  Inside, the interior of the <span>royal chambers is</span> made in different styles, which creates a contrast with the strict facade decoration.  It is very interesting to visit the Italian hall, which is decorated with marble sculptures, and the Greek, created in the antique style.  The large hall with an area of ​​four hundred square meters also fascinates tourists. </p><p>  To appreciate the beauty and splendor of the park, you need to spend more than one hour, because everything that is on the territory of the royal residence is the sights of Pavlovsk. </p>

    <h2>  Colonnade Apollo </h2><p>  An interesting architectural idea in the park is the Apollo Colonnade, located at the entrance.  Initially, it represented closed columns, and in the middle a statue of the Greek god of art - Apollo - was installed.  Later, the composition was transferred to the river bank, where a water stream washed the foot of the Colonnade, creating an ancient Greek picture of <span>Mount Parnassus, the</span> home of Apollo.  After the landslide, which happened during the reign of the emperor, part of the composition collapsed, but this did not spoil the colonnade, but on the contrary, gave a mythical and mysterious appearance. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Not so long ago, a monument to the famous Austrian composer Johann Strauss appeared on the territory of the park.  It was a gift to St. Petersburg from the Austrian chapter for the celebration of the centenary of the city.  The monument is a small copy of the sculpture of the composer, which is installed in Vienna. </p><p>  This is not the whole list of places that Pavlovsk is famous for.  St. Petersburg, whose sights are world famous, is annually visited by crowds of tourists.  People who came to Pavlovsk can extend their excursion to the city of Pushkin, which is located very close by. </p>

    <h2>  Gateway to the city </h2><p>  The railway station, the gateway to the city, is the first to meet tourists.  The building was built in the fifties and is made in the style of “Stalin's Empire”, but this did not prevent the building from organically integrating into the architectural ensemble of the imperial city. </p><p>  Leaving the station and being on Sadovaya Street, guests of the city stumble upon Stein's cottage.  This is a beautiful building, made in the Art Nouveau style, <span>bright purple.</span>  Now there is a private music school in the mansion, a lime grove spreads around the cottage, which during flowering brings a pleasant and unique fragrance. </p><p>  Further the street is decorated with Cast-iron gates or, as they are also called, Nikolaev.  The gates are located on the road leading from Pavlovsk to Tsarskoye Selo. </p><h2>  Cathedral of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker </h2><p>  The Cathedral of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker, created in honor of Emperor Paul the First, will surprise guests with its beauty.  When looking at the cathedral, thoughts arise about his beautiful outfit, about the festive decoration.  Inside the church, peace and quiet, every parishioner feels grace and peace - it seems that Nikolai the Wonderworker himself is nearby and listens to the prayers of the laity. </p>

    <p>  The royal suburb surprises with its beauty at any time of the year, but the most amazing sight falls on the autumn season, when nature itself adorns the trees.  Natural decor extraordinarily complements the most beautiful historical sites. </p><p>  If you are going to Pavlovsk, the sights, photos of which you must have, will forever remain in your memory. </p>
