    <h2>  Crash </h2><p>  So, the first scenario, in which the <span>iPhone</span> 5 <span>does not turn</span> on (what you do not know at the same time), is nothing more than a system failure.  In fact, this problem has become very common recently.  However, it is eliminated easier than you might imagine.  To do this, you will not need to carry the gadget for repair or contact specialists. </p><p>  Have you encountered a problem when iPhone 5 does not turn on?  What to do?  It is enough just to simultaneously hold down the "Home" button under the display, as well as hold the power button on the device‚Äôs panel.  Hold them together for about 15 seconds, and then see what happens.  Typically, you will see an ‚Äúapple boot‚Äù.  After that it will be possible to work with the device further.  However, this is not all the reasons when the iPhone turns off.  There is also a rather extensive series that gives users a lot of problems. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The second scenario, as a rule, also occurs quite often.  If suddenly your iPhone 5 does not turn on, what to do - you do not know, then just try to charge the phone‚Äôs battery.  It is the lack of energy that often causes a lot of inconvenience to users. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone 5 does not turn on what to do" class="if" height="379" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/836136.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Connect the charger, and then plug it into a power outlet.  Now wait a few minutes and try turning on the gadget.  IPhone 5 does not turn on?  What to do?  Then you have to look for the problem elsewhere.  Everything is especially sad when you have a fully charged battery.  Her charge, by the way, is best checked on another gadget.  So you will understand that this is not the issue at all.  And we continue to understand the question: "iPhone 5 does not turn on - what should I do?" </p><h2>  Charger </h2><p>  Let‚Äôs walk with you, so far, according to the most innocuous options that can only be met.  After all, they are usually eliminated very easily and simply.  So the next victim on our list is nothing more than a charger.  If your iPhone 5 does not turn on, what to do - you do not know, then you should try to see the health of this equipment. </p><p>  The best way here is to use a similar smartphone.  Connect the charger to it, and then connect it to the network.  If the charging process does not start, you will have to change this ‚Äúspare part‚Äù.  Otherwise, you have to look for problems elsewhere.  Does it work?  Then there is another rather interesting option for the development of events, but we will consider it with you a little later.  So far, we will continue to understand with you more or less harmless reasons for this kind of behavior. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Flashing </h2><p>  Very often, users are faced with the fact that their iPhone 5 does not turn on.  What to do in this case is far from all.  And all the fault of flashing the gadget.  As a rule, this is done in order to be able to install "unlicensed" content on a smartphone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone 5 s does not turn on what to do" class="if" height="289" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/836135.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  To be honest, flashing is not a good move.  Yes, it is convenient, but the consequences may be irreversible.  Sometimes it‚Äôs enough to take the smartphone to a specialist who will fix everything.  But sometimes it can happen that you have to completely change your smartphone.  Thus, if your iPhone 5 does not turn on (what you do not know at the same time), you should be especially vigilant about such behavior.  In particular, after checking the battery, system failures and charger.  After all, after this, as a rule, more serious problems begin.  Let‚Äôs see what else can happen to your gadget. </p><h2>  Fake </h2><p>  And here is another leader among our topics.  Quite often, users think why iPhone 5 does not turn on, what to do, and so on after they have discovered the fake.  Or if they knowingly bought a non-original device.  It is the so-called "pirate copy" that causes many crashes and malfunctions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If your Chinese iPhone 5 does not turn on, what should I do?  You can contact the company where you ordered this gadget.  When you consciously buy a "pirate", then at best (if there is a guarantee), they will replace the device with a working one.  At worst, you <span>will be left with nothing.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why iPhone 5 does not turn on what to do" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/836133.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  But if you suddenly found a fake by buying a gadget in a regular or even a company store, then you can apply with the requirements to replace the equipment with the original.  Then you don‚Äôt have to think for what reasons iPhone 5 does not turn on, what to do and so on.  Sometimes, to be honest, in this situation you have to go to court.  But usually sellers and stores try to fix all the problems before your <span>patience runs out.</span>  In fact, there are a number of rather interesting scenarios.  And now we will try to get to know them. </p><h2>  Requires flashing </h2><p>  Well, here's another amazing little thing that can give you a lot of inconvenience.  If you think about the question: "iPhone 5 does not turn on - what should I do?"  An ‚Äúapple‚Äù appears and goes out - which means, of course, it is worth considering a lot about reflashing. It is, as already mentioned, that it can cause us inconvenience. However, in this situation, this behavior is caused precisely by the lack of firmware. </p><p>  In fact, it‚Äôs not worth it to ‚Äúchemize‚Äù yourself.  Yes, each user can connect their gadget to the iTunes service and carry out this process.  However, the problem may still not be resolved.  Thus, it would be better to immediately assign your iPhone to specialists and inform about the intention to reflash it.  For a small fee, they will fix the problem.  But here, not everything is as smooth and simple as we would like.  After all, sometimes flashing does not solve the problems that have arisen.  Let's get to know you a few other rather interesting approaches that can only relate to our topic today. </p><h2>  Connectors </h2><p>  Does your iPhone 5 not turn on?  What to do?  And it does not charge in addition?  In cases when you are firmly convinced that everything is in order with the battery and charger, you can begin to "sin" on the gadget itself. </p><p>  Maybe the reason for this behavior was the banal damage to the connector for connecting the "charge".  In this case, to be honest, you can definitely diagnose a breakdown only if you have a similar iPhone.  Just plug in a charger and check if everything works. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chinese iPhone 5 does not turn on what to do" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/836132.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  If the reason really lies in the damage to the connectors, then, of course, you will have to take it to repair.  Specialized services will help you troubleshoot very quickly.  After that, check if everything works.  Not?  What to do if iPhone 5 turns off and does not turn on?  Then let's continue to study the possible causes of such behavior, as well as options for eliminating them once and for all. </p><h2>  Moisture + Blow </h2><p>  If you notice that the <span>iPhone 5 S</span> does not turn <span>on,</span> you don‚Äôt know what to do, then you should remember if you dropped this gadget or if moisture got on it.  After all, it is these two components that quite often become the culprits of most problems with phones and smartphones. </p><p>  In cases when you just dropped the gadget into the water, you can still save it.  To do this, quickly and quickly disassemble it into parts, and then thoroughly dry them.  A hairdryer is best for this idea.  After that you can assemble the device and check if everything works. </p><p>  But with the blows things are a little more complicated.  If iPhone 5 S does not turn on, what should I do?  You will have to immediately take it to a specialized center, where you will have to eliminate the cause of the breakdown.  True, it also happens that the smartphone is shattered.  In this case, to be honest, hardly anyone can help you.  You have to buy a new smartphone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone 5 does not turn on what to do an apple appears and goes out" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/836134.jpg"></div>

      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  However, if you drop the iPhone, you can try to remove the battery from it, and then insert it into place.  Now try turning on the gadget.  Sometimes this technique works very well.  If this does not work, then, of course, take the device for repair.  Only there they can help you. </p><h2>  Viruses </h2><p>  The last option that can only be found is viruses.  Now they have reached computers from smartphones.  That is why quite often gadgets refuse to work. </p><p>  In fact, <span>viruses on an iPhone</span> are pretty hard to diagnose.  You can immediately discard this option if you have not used the Internet, and the flash card you have checked for the presence of these.  Then look at the previous options - there is sure to be something suitable.  But in cases where you are a real active user of the World Wide Web, do not be surprised. </p><p>  In fact, if you do not want to suffer for a long time with this problem, then, of course, it is best to take the iPhone to a specialized service and report your suspicions of virus attacks.  In cases where the "diagnosis" is confirmed, the problem is fixed, and you are prompted to install a special antivirus.  Do not refuse, because it is he who will help to eliminate the repeated penetration of infection into your smartphone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone 5 does not turn on what to do and does not charge" class="if" height="277" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/836131.jpg" width="600"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  It is not worth fighting telephone viruses yourself.  After all, here the system is more complicated than on a computer.  For this reason, only specialists working in branded service centers can help you here.  As you can see, there are a lot of reasons that the iPhone turned off and does not turn on.  All of them, of course, are already familiar to us.  And, as you can see, most of them are quickly eliminated. </p>
