    <h2>  Fishing </h2><p>  The fishermen are especially fond of the surroundings of such a city as Lipetsk.  The Matyr reservoir is the leader in the number of fish in the region.  Fishermen chose him back in 1970.  A huge variety of prey can amaze any spinner.  Catfish, silver carp, pike, pike perch, roach, common carp, asp are found in the reservoir. </p><p>  Of particular interest to fishers are fishing competitions.  The organization of such relay races takes place both in summer and in winter.  Competitions are city and regional level.  In winter, the Russian championship on fishing for mormyshka was previously held; 11 teams took part in it.  The attention of tourists is always riveted to this event. </p><p>  Strict rules must be followed during the championship.  Fisheries, as well as law enforcement officers and inspectors monitor compliance with these instructions.  There are certain rules, the implementation of which is considered mandatory.
