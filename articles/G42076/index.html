    <p>  The cost of living depends on the selected room, type of food, as well as the season.  The tour will cost more if you go in July and August, because these months are considered the warmest here.  It is much cheaper to go here in June or early September.  The temperature at this time is several degrees lower, but the sea is still warm enough for swimming.  The minimum price for a standard double room is approximately 2000 rubles per night.  In the midst of the tourist season, its cost can increase to 6,000 rubles.  You can pay for accommodation and additional services with Visa or MasterCard. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location of the complex </h2><p>  Hotel Perunika 3 * (Bulgaria, Golden Sands) is located in a quiet location, remote from noisy bars and night clubs.

    <h2>  Reviews of tourists: negative </h2><p>  Unfortunately, some tourists were unsatisfied with the rest at the Perunika Hotel 3 * hotel (Bulgaria, Golden Sands).  Reviews about him are often negative.  In them, guests describe the following disadvantages of accommodation: </p><ul><li>  The hotel staff hardly speaks Russian.  Tourists who do not know the basics of the English language may encounter difficulties in solving problems. </li><li>  Internet only works in the lobby.  The room may not be cleaned for several days in a row.  Even after going to the reception, the maid is very poorly cleaned. </li><li>  The hotel is trying to write off money for allegedly spoiled furniture or bedding.  Therefore, it is worth checking their safety before entering the room. </li><li>  The complex has a lot of Germans resting, who constantly drink and make noise.  It is better to take rooms with windows to the pool, because there are much quieter. </li><li>  All food is either salted or sprinkled with spices. </li><li>  Air conditioning is not working properly. </li><li>  A hairdryer and iron are issued only upon request for reception. </li></ul><h2>  Draw conclusions </h2><p>  Hotel Perunika 3 * (Bulgaria, Golden Sands) is equally well suited for young people and families with children.  Nearby there are many entertainment facilities: nightclubs, casinos, restaurants, as well as gaming and sports venues.  You should not hope that the tourist complex will offer you the highest class service.  This is a good hotel suitable for those who want to save on vacation.  Low prices here are consistent with the quality of service. </p>
