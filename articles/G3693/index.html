Both countries are located in southern Europe, have wide access to the sea and are at approximately the same level of socio-economic development.  In this article we will try to figure out where it is better to go - to Spain or Italy.  We will talk in detail about the pros and cons of spa holidays in both countries. </p><h2>  Spain or Italy: where is the best place to relax? </h2><p>  Italy, in the minds of many of our compatriots, is steadily associated with pasta, pizza, colorful carnivals, Venetian channels, fashion and romance.  And also with dirt and the mafia.  The word "Spain", in turn, causes only positive associations (with the exception of a rather ambiguous and dubious entertainment - bullfighting).  But anyway, both countries are equally popular among tourists. </p><p>  Sooner or later, the same question arises before many travelers: ‚ÄúWhere to go - to Italy or Spain?‚Äù.  And we will try to answer him as objectively and impartially as possible. </p><div class="photo" data-original="together.bunq.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Spain or Italy food" class="if uuid-2685999" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/2685999.jpg"></div><p>  So Spain or Italy?  Let's make a detailed comparison of these two countries according to the following criteria: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Geography. </li><li>  Climate. </li><li>  Food. </li><li>  Entertainment. </li><li>  Shopping </li><li>  Sights. </li><li>  Rastra. </li></ul><h2>  Geography and climate </h2><p>  Both countries are located in southern Europe, at approximately the same latitude.  Italy is washed by five seas and boasts the longest coastline among European states (about 8000 km).  The length of the <span>Spanish coast is</span> more modest, but Spain has another significant advantage - wide access to the Atlantic Ocean. </p><div class="photo" data-original="imsakolese.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Italy or Spain where to go" class="if uuid-2685997" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/2685997.jpg"></div><p>  The climate of Italy is extremely diverse.  In the north of the country - temperate, in the south - subtropical Mediterranean.  The climate in Spain is slightly hotter and drier than in Italy (especially in the central regions of the country, which are very remote from the sea).  If we talk about landscape diversity, then it is equally characteristic of both countries.  And if Italy‚Äôs natural beauties are impressive, then Spanish landscapes are more likely to produce a mesmerizing effect. </p><h2>  Food and entertainment </h2><p>  Italian cuisine is known throughout the world.  Who hasn't heard of pizza, lasagna, or risotto?  In any local cafe, these dishes, along with the famous Italian pasta, form the basis of the menu.  <span>Spanish cuisine is</span> less famous, but no less diverse.  Staying in this country, you should definitely try paella, tortilla or gazpacho.  Spanish wines are also noteworthy, especially Merlot, Rioja and Cabernet Franc. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.localguidesconnect.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where is better Spain or Italy" class="if uuid-2685998" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/2685998.jpg"></div><p>  In entertainment, of course, Spain wins.  Here you will definitely be advised to visit the bullfight (a bloody and ambiguous action) and watch a bright and colorful flamenco show.  In addition, in Spain a number of unusual festivals are held annually (for example, La Tomatina or Las Fallas).  In Italy, entertainment is more refined: here you can visit the opera festival in Verona or the famous Venice Carnival. </p><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  In shopping tourism, without a doubt, Italy leads.  Here you can purchase branded items and leather products of impeccable quality.  The most recognized centers of Italian shopping are Rome, Milan, Florence and Turin.  As a rule, people go to Spain in order to update their wardrobe with clothes of inexpensive and lesser-known brands.  In Spain, it is also worth paying attention to leather goods (in particular, bags and belts). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bespoqe.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Spain or Italy Shopping" class="if uuid-2686002" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/2686002.jpg"></div><h2>  sights </h2><p>  All true admirers of architecture and fine art should first of all visit Italy.  After all, it was here that such universally recognized masters as Michelangelo, Raphael, Botticelli were born and created.  Nevertheless, Spain will find something to surprise lovers of antiquity.  It is enough to recall only Barcelona and its unrivaled architect - Antonio Gaudi. </p><p>  Top 5 attractions of Spain: the Sagrada Familia, the Alhambra, the Royal Palace in Madrid, the Gothic quarter in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãthe aqueduct in Segovia. </p><p>  Top 5 attractions of Italy: Colosseum, St. Peter's Basilica, Leaning Tower of Pisa, Roman Pantheon, canals of Venice. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.roadscholar.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Italy Spain where" class="if uuid-2686001" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/2686001.jpg"></div><h2>  Italy, Spain: where you can relax cheaper? </h2><p>  It is believed that Spain is slightly cheaper than Italy, if we talk about spending on food, housing and transportation.  So, in the world ranking of countries according to the high cost of living (according to research by the Numbeo portal), Italy takes 23rd place, and Spain - 38th.  This aspect should be taken into account if you plan to go to one of these states for a couple of months. </p><p>  Nevertheless, budget holidays are available both in Spain and in Italy.  The table below shows estimated expenses for accommodation, food and transportation in both countries (per day for one person). </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td></td><td><p>  Italy </p></td><td><p>  Spain </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Accommodation (in hotels) </p></td><td><p>  55-75 $ (3500-4700 rub.) </p></td><td><p>  40-60 $ (2500-3800 rub.) </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Food (three meals a day) </p></td><td><p>  30-40 $ (1900-2500 rub.) </p></td><td><p>  25-30 $ (1600-1900 rub.) </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Transport services (taxi, bus) </p></td><td><p>  20 $ (1250 rub.) </p></td><td><p>  $ 18-20 (1140-1250 rub.) </p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  Holidays in Italy: pros and cons </h2><p>  If you have not yet decided where to go - to Italy or Spain, we suggest that you familiarize yourself with the main advantages and disadvantages of relaxation in both countries.  And we will start with the state of pizza and spaghetti. </p><p>  So, the main advantages: </p><ul><li>  The richest historical and cultural heritage. </li><li>  Stunning abundance of museums, castles and architectural monuments. </li><li>  A large number of thermal springs. </li><li>  The proximity of the mountains and the sea. </li><li>  Great shopping. </li></ul><p>  The main disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  Not always high quality hotel services. </li><li>  Problems with petty crime (especially in large cities). </li><li>  The work of public transport in Italy is far from ideal, there are problems with garbage collection. </li></ul><h2>  Holidays in Spain: pros and cons </h2><p>  And now let's look at the main advantages and disadvantages of holidays in Spain.  The main advantages: </p><ul><li>  A wide selection of magnificent beaches - sandy and pebble, comfortable and wild. </li><li>  A diverse hotel fund with high quality service. </li><li>  Incredibly picturesque landscapes and fine wine. </li></ul><p>  The main disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  The Spaniards are quite noisy and cheerful people.  Therefore, if you expect rest from rest, then it is better to go to a remote provincial area. </li><li>  There is a risk to say goodbye to your wallet in this country, especially in big cities. </li><li>  Many Spanish hotels have problems with sound insulation (due to the very thin partitions between the rooms). </li></ul><h2>  Useful tips for tourists </h2><p>  In addition to our article, there are seven useful tips for those who are going to relax in one of these countries: </p><ul><li>  In Spain, sea water, as a rule, warms up well only by mid-June.  You should not go here before, especially if you are traveling with children. </li><li>  It is not worth going to Italy in mid-August.  At this time, here comes the period of long weekends and seasonal holidays, which is associated with the local holiday of Ferragosto. </li><li>  For children and families, beach holidays are more suitable for Spain. </li><li>  Spain ranks 6th in the ranking of countries for Environmental Performance Index, while Italy is only 29th. </li><li>  In Spain, only a few locals speak English, so it is recommended to take a phrase book with you on a trip.  In Italy, this problem is not so acute. </li><li>  If the purpose of your trip is shopping, then feel free to go to the south of Italy (to Verona, Tuscany, Milan). </li><li>  The best time to visit Italy and Spain is spring or autumn (of course, if you are not interested in a beach holiday). </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.creativeholidaysindia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Spain or Italy Attractions" class="if uuid-2686000" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/2686000.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  And yet, Spain or Italy?  Where better to go on vacation?  It is definitely impossible to answer this question.  On the one hand, Italy has a milder climate and the sea is slightly warmer.  Nightlife and more productive shopping are more fun here.  But things are worse with ecology and crime.  But Spain in terms of tourism is a solid ‚Äúmiddle peasant‚Äù, a kind of middle ground, if we consider a variety of ratings. </p><p>  In any case, we told you everything we could, and even more.  The final point in the question "Italy or Spain - where to go?"  have to put it to you.  We really hope that our article will help to make the right and successful choice. </p>
