This is Spreuerhofstrasse - the narrowest street in the world, listed in the Guinness Book of Records.  After severe fires that swept the entire region of Baden-W√ºrttemberg in 1826 and destroyed 80% of the city, a global reconstruction of the Reutlingen buildings was carried out, as a result of which Spreierhofstrasse was formed in 1827.  It is not like all the streets of Germany, and is just a narrow passage between the houses, with a width of 31 to 50 cm! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The narrowest street in the world" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12709/276413.jpg" width="600"></div>  Therefore, it is not very popular with the townspeople.  However, it is a place of attraction for travelers from different countries, because it is not so often given the opportunity to walk along a 50 cm wide street.  But not everyone will decide on such a dangerous event.  Moreover, one of the houses, between which the narrowest street in the world ran, partially squinted, which makes traffic along it even more difficult.  However, the overlap of the Spreierhofstrasse in Reutlingen is excluded and will not happen in the near future.  Otherwise, humanity would lose a unique relic of the 19th century, and Germany would lose the status of the owner of the well-known and narrowest street in the world. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Narrowest street" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12709/276412.jpg" width="375"></div>

In its <span>capital, Prague,</span> 150 meters from the legendary <span>Charles Bridge</span> , a narrow, but cozy street with the intriguing name Vinarna Certovka, with a width of only 60 - 70 cm, is stretched by tourists. According to legend, the mysterious name came from the name of the river - one of the Vltava tributaries, which they called Devil the nickname of a local resident and a very quarrelsome woman who often went to the riverbank to wash her clothes.  She was distinguished by a difficult scandalous character, for which she was nicknamed the devil in a skirt. </p><p>  Vinnar Chertovka is not the narrowest street in the world and its name does not appear in the Guinness Book of Records, but it is in second place after the German Spreuerhofstrasse, walking along it is not an extreme activity and is not at all life-threatening, but on the contrary will give some pleasant moments.  But several people at the same time will not disperse here and movement is possible in only one direction.  That is why in order to avoid trouble during walks and to regulate traffic, Vinarna Certovka has two real traffic lights intended only for pedestrians: at the beginning and at the end of the street.  Originally planned as a fire passage, the narrowest Czech street has become a fairly popular tourist route.

    <p>  Third place for the narrowest street in the world after Germany and the Czech Republic took England, or rather the city of Exeter, where the old Parliament Street, 50 meters long, is located.  Its width in the narrowest place is 61 cm, and in the widest - 120 cm. Built in the 14th century with the original name Small Street and preserved to this day, it deserves special attention.  After all, Parliament Street is the narrowest street in the world from naturally constructed buildings, which were not formed as a result of reconstruction.  This British Pparliament Street and differs from the German Spreuerhofstrasse and Czech Vinarna Certovka. </p>
