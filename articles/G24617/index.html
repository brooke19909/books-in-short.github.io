This is an outstanding personality who has come a long way from a simple shepherd to the imperial chambers of Elizabeth Petrovna. </p><h2>  Childhood Alexei Grigorievich, or How to become a favorite </h2><p>  Alexey learned to read and write from a rural sexton.  With a beautiful voice, he often sang in the choir of a rural church.  And in one thousand seven hundred and thirty-first year, Colonel Vishnevsky, who was one of the courtiers of the Empress Anna Ioannovna, during his trip through the village was simply shocked by the boy's vocal abilities.  The colonel took him with him to Petersburg, where he began to sing in the choir of the palace chapel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Count Razumovsky biography" class="if" height="275" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25551/582658.jpg" width="220"></div>

    <p>  Not only was talented Count Razumovsky.  The biography reports that Alex was unusually beautiful.  His external and vocal data simply captivated Elizabeth Petrovna.  From that time, his rapid rise began, which led him to the imperial court in one thousand seven hundred and thirty-second year.  In place of his beloved prince Shubin, Elizabeth takes the favorite of Razumovsky.  Soon he lost his beautiful voice, but was accepted to the post of bandura player and practically headed the court of Elizabeth Petrovna. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Honors and titles given by the Empress </h2><p>  Count Alexei Razumovsky played a significant role in the <span>palace coup</span> on the night of November twenty-fifth to twenty-sixth of one thousand seven hundred and forty-one, which led Elizabeth Petrovna to the throne.  And already on November 30 he was appointed chamberlain with the rank of lieutenant general. </p><p>  And at the coronation he was made a marshal and holder of the Order of St. Andrew the First-Called and Alexander Nevsky.  Moreover, Count Alexei Razumovsky was awarded numerous estates in Moscow and other places.  There is an assumption that he even secretly married Elizabeth Petrovna in the rural church of Perovo in the autumn of one thousand seven hundred and forty-two.  It even earned him the nickname "Emperor of the Night." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rational count" class="if" height="296" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25551/582667.jpg" width="474"></div>

    <h2>  High position at the court of the empress </h2><p>  At one thousand seven hundred and forty-fifth, Aleksey Grigorievich became captain-lieutenant of the Life Guard, and three years later - already lieutenant colonel.  Meanwhile, despite all the honors rendered by the empress, this man remains very friendly and unsophisticated. </p><p>  Count Razumovsky, whose biography reports that at that time he not only had unlimited power in the state, but also became a wealthy man, nevertheless he was very modest and pious.  Always tried to stay away from intrigue and big politics.  He was very cheerful and good-natured.  And many used these qualities.  The guests without hesitation robbed him, coming to him, or frankly cheated, playing cards with him.  Such is the Russian people. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  On the fifth of September, one thousand seven hundred and fifty-six, Count Razumovsky, whose biography interests many contemporaries, received the rank of Field Marshal.  During the entire <span>reign of Elizabeth Petrovna,</span> he had an exceptional position at court, despite the fact that the empress later brought closer to her another favorite - Ivan Shuvalov.  In one thousand seven hundred and forty-fourth, the empress even visited the native village of Razumovsky, where she met with members of the family of Alexei Grigoryevich. </p><h2>  Caring for the Family, or Appointing a Younger Brother </h2><p>  The chambers of Razumovsky in the Summer Palace directly adjoined the chambers of Elizabeth Petrovna, and the count had constant access to them.  Alexey Grigoryevich Razumovsky, Count, was absolutely not interested in politics.  Nevertheless, he often supported Chancellor <span>Alexei Petrovich</span> Bestuzhev-Ryumin.  So, on the advice of the latter, Ukrainian hetmanism was restored.  And his younger brother, Count Kirill Razumovsky, moved to Glukhov, where he was elected and appointed hetman in one thousand seven hundred and fifty years. </p><p>  Thanks to his brother Alexei Grigoryevich, he was earlier sent to study at the University of Berlin.  The Empress conferred on him the title of count in one thousand seven hundred and forty-six.  And at the age of eighteen, he was appointed president of the Russian Academy of Sciences.  Then he becomes a lieutenant colonel in the Izmailovsky Imperial Guard, and a few months later - as a senator and adjutant general. </p>

    <p>  However, not one of these legends about the children of Razumovsky and the Empress has been documented.  Only Cyril had children, who had five daughters and six sons.  One of them, Count Aleksey Kirillovich Razumovsky, became the Minister of Education and a famous botanist, Andrei became an excellent diplomat, the count‚Äôs daughters were very famous maids of honor and had a great marriage. </p><h2>  Later years, or Shortly before the death of Elizabeth Petrovna </h2><p>  Before her death, the Empress made the successor of Peter the Third and took the word from him not to offend her favorites.  In one thousand seven hundred and sixty-second year, Alexei Grigoryevich Razumovsky decides to resign.  He moves from the Winter Palace to Anichkov, which was given to him by Elizaveta Petrovna. </p><p>  After the death of the empress, at the request of Catherine the Second, Alexei Grigoryevich destroyed all the documents testifying to the marriage with Elizabeth.  And on the sixth of July, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-first years, Razumovsky himself died.  The count was buried in the Annunciation Cathedral of the Alexander Nevsky Lavra. </p><h2>  Famous architectural monument in the city on the Neva </h2><p>  As a memory of this family on the Moika embankment is the palace of Count Razumovsky.  This is one of the few mansions left over from the eighteenth century in St. Petersburg.  He is one of the best estates of the city.  Work on the construction of the palace lasted about four years.  The front part was separated from the embankment by a high stone fence with a monumental gate in the center. </p><p>  The main facade of the building strictly symmetrically includes many carefully drawn bas-reliefs.  Razumovsky Palace was known for its many balls and masquerades.  The Count arranged alms days here during public holidays and received more than two thousand people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Palace of Count Razumovsky" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25551/582679.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <h2>  The fate of the palace of Razumovsky </h2><p>  At the end of the eighteenth century, the palace was bought by the state treasury and began to be used as an educational home for caring for disadvantaged children - orphans, foundlings or the disabled.  In one thousand nine hundred and eighteenth year, the first pedagogical institute in the Russian state began to be located in this building.  And already in the twenties he was renamed in honor of the social critic and political philosopher <span>Alexander Herzen.</span> </p><p>  In one thousand nine hundred and sixty-first years, a monument to Konstantin Dmitrievich Ushinsky, the recognized founder of pedagogical science in Russia, was erected in the courtyard.  It is located in front of the main entrance to the institute, and now the university.  The building has undergone several internal renovations.  Therefore, none of the original interiors has been preserved. </p><h2>  Another architectural monument, or the Housing of Razumovsky </h2><p>  The estate of Count Razumovsky is also incredibly beautiful.  This wooden building was built specifically for Alexei Grigorievich.  The central part of it is built of wood, and the side wings, having two floors, are already built of brick.  This unique masterpiece of manor building was not damaged even during the one thousand eight hundred and twelfth year, when Moscow was burnt during the invasion of Napoleon. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Count Cyril Razumovsky" class="if" height="379" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25551/582683.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In one thousand nine hundred and eighteenth year, the Institute of Physical Culture was founded in the estate.  The unique building on the orders of Lenin began to undergo reconstruction, the ponds were filled up, and in their place were located sports fields or stadiums.  Already in modern years, the estate was transferred to the Tsereteli Academy of Arts.  Soon there was a fire, which significantly damaged the main building. </p>
