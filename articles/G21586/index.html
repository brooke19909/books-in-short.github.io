    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  One of the most sought after tourist destinations is Egypt.  Hotel Coral Beach Resort Hurghada 4 *, despite its good reputation, makes some oversights, because of which tourists have a number of comments and complaints to it: </p><ul><li>  towels and bedding are quite old, with characteristic scuffs and stains; </li><li>  old broken sunbeds on the beach; </li><li>  low quality local alcoholic beverages; </li><li>  too many spicy spices in the dishes; </li><li>  despite the fact that in one of the pools there is the possibility of heating, it is not included even in frankly cold weather; </li><li>  few fruits on the menu; </li><li>  animals at the zoo do not receive proper care; </li><li>  in spite of the fact that the wireless Internet in the hotel is paid (besides it is quite expensive), the connection quality is very poor; </li><li>  most of the fountains provided for by the landscape design project do not work (according to hotel employees - for the purpose of saving). </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  This hotel can be considered an ideal place for those who love the sea and natural beauty, and at the same time are not very picky about the little things and do not demanding maintenance.  Despite the former luxury of the hotel, the impression is spoiled by its apparent deterioration.  Also, the quality of service and the appearance of the hotel is affected by the desire for widespread savings. </p>
