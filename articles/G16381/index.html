They can be woven from different materials, the most accessible of which is threads.  They are in every house in sufficient quantities to create several products. </p><h2>  Materials </h2><p>  What threads do baubles weave?  From any!  It can be threads for knitting, embroidery (floss) or just sewing, folded several times.  In addition, you can use thin laces, satin ribbons, synthetic fibers for flashing dolls or elongated stripes of plastic bags. </p><p>  The easiest way to weave baubles out of floss thread.  As everyone knows, they are quite smooth, consist of several not twisted threads, which contributes to the formation of neat knots, since the threads are evenly distributed over its entire area.  In addition, they are quite thick and durable, which allows you to use them without additional additions, and also have an extensive palette and low price. </p><h2>  Types of Woven Bracelets </h2><p>  You can classify baubles in several ways. </p><p>  By degree of difficulty: </p><ul><li>  simple; </li><li>  medium difficulty; </li><li>  complicated. </li></ul><p>  By volume are found: </p><ul><li>  flat; </li><li>  flagellate. </li></ul><p>  By the number of threads used, baubles can consist of: </p><ul><li>  2 threads; </li><li>  3 threads; </li><li>  4 threads, etc. </li></ul><p>  The more threads in the weave, the wider the finished product. </p><p>  By appointment: </p><ul><li>  decorative; </li><li>  charms; </li><li>  souvenir. </li></ul><h2>  2 strand bracelets </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.olgasmacrame.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bauble with simple knots of 2 threads" class="if uuid-2418077" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2418077.jpg"></div><p>  Weaving baubles from 2 threads of floss, as in the photo, is very simple.  The technique consists in tying the warp thread with a working thread.  To do this, you need 1 meter of thread of any color.  It can be folded, the main thread should be equal to the girth of the wrist plus a few centimeters for fastening.  Before starting work on a thread at the place of addition, tie a knot to form a small loop.  If you make a tightening fastener, then the thread must be cut into 2 parts.  The main thread should be equal to 3 girths of the wrist.  At its ends, it is necessary to tie knots or fasten beads.  Fold the main thread in a double ring so that the ends touch each other. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the place where the threads turned 2, start knotting with a second thread.  To make a beautiful spiral, the main thread must be stretched and straight, and the working thread will braid it, as shown in the photo. </p><p>  Another type of bracelets for beginners.  Weaving baubles from threads, as in the photo below, is very simple.  To do this, you need to make the nodes in turn and working, and the main thread. </p><div class="photo" data-original="caesarsebastian.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Simple baubles made of thread" class="if uuid-2417924" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2417924.jpg"></div><p>  In this case, the working and main threads should be the same length. </p><h2>  3-string bracelet </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.nbeads.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Three strand bracelet" class="if uuid-2418024" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2418024.jpg"></div><p>  Interesting are baubles of 3 threads.  Weaves, as shown above, are of the same principle as those of 2 threads, however, the nodes alternate on the right and left.  It turns out a narrow flat bracelet.  If you do not use one, but two knots with each thread, and also use threads of different colors, you will get such a bauble, as in the photo below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.consumercrafts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Double Knot Bauble" class="if uuid-2418071" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2418071.jpg"></div><h2>  Bauble "Spit" of 3 threads </h2><p>  A very simple bracelet can be made using the simple braid weaving technique.  In this way, baubles can be woven from threads, both adults and children.  When using 3 threads of different colors, you can create a unique decoration in a few minutes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  4-string bracelet </h2><p>  It is possible to weave baubles from a mouline thread into 4 threads, as well as from three, tying knots alternately with left and right working thread.  However, in this case there will already be two warp threads, due to which the width of the bracelet increases. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nbeads.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bauble of 4 threads" class="if uuid-2418026" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2418026.jpg"></div><p>  Another original bracelet will be a bauble in the form of a cord.  It can be woven using a round cardboard blank.  Notches are made on it.  The threads are arranged crosswise, then the threads are alternately thrown from top to bottom, from left to right, from bottom to top, from right to left. </p><p>  The second method is nodular.  All threads from the edge are tied into one knot, then each thread is tied to the adjacent clockwise one or 2 knots.  It is necessary to move in a spiral until the desired length is woven.  During the manufacture of this bracelet, beads or bells can be woven into the lace structure. </p><h2>  Bauble "Spit" of 4 threads </h2><p>  Unusual look bracelets from braids of 4 threads.  Unlike classic braids, weaving is more dense and interesting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.instructables.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Baubles with fishtail pigtails" class="if uuid-2417950" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2417950.jpg"></div><p>  The technique of weaving such baubles is simple and consists in shifting the extreme threads to the center to the opposite half. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Suppose a bauble will consist of threads 1, 2, 3, 4. They must be tied, forming a loop on top, and then distributing the threads on a plane and proceed to weaving.  Thread 1 to put between threads 2 and 3, thread 4 to place between 2 and 1. Thread 2 between 1 and 3, thread 3 between 4 and 1. We braid the baubles according to the pattern until its length is equal to the girth of the wrist.  Tie all the threads in one knot, put on a bead and tie again, carefully cut the excess threads. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Scheme of weaving braids of 4 threads" class="if uuid-2420680" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2420680.jpg"></div><h2>  Bracelets of 5 or more threads </h2><p>  Another favorite type of baubles from threads is flat nodules.  The width of the product will vary depending on the number of threads.  To make it easier to weave baubles, all the strings are collected in a bundle and a common knot is tied.  This makes it possible to work freely with threads without fear that one of them will stretch.  However, if the bauble will be with a complex pattern, it is better to use double-sided tape.  It must be attached to the edge of the table, in this case, it will be possible to distribute the threads in the desired order, and the countertop will not interfere with knotting.  It is also convenient to fix the finished parts of the bracelet on scotch tape to straighten and check the correct execution according to the scheme. </p><h2>  Forward and reverse node technique </h2><p>  Since it is impossible to weave baubles from threads without properly tying knots, it is better to train on 2 threads before starting work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="The scheme of proper knitting" class="if uuid-2422901" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2422901.jpg"></div><p>  In order for the bauble to have a neat appearance, all the knots should look the same regardless of which way they knit.  In fact, 3 types of nodes are used. </p><p>  To tie a knot and transfer the thread from left to right, it is necessary to cross the threads so that the left is on top of the right, then wrap it around the thread and pass it into the resulting loop.  Bring the left thread up, while the right one must be pulled.  That thread, which was less stretched, and forms the knot itself.  The next step is almost the same as the previous one.  Lower the upper thread, placing it on the left, cross with the right one, put it behind the thread, thread it in the loop and pull it out.  Here, the left thread must be pulled to the right, and the right one to the left.  Thus, the left thread will move to the right, and the knot will turn out neat. </p><p>  If you need to tie a knot when shifting from left to right, the actions are the same, only in a mirror image. </p><p>  Some ornaments require that the threads remain in place (turning knots).  In these cases, at the first stage, the knot is tied depending on the location of the thread whose color matches the color of the knot, and at the second stage, depending on where the thread should end up. </p><p>  For example, there are 2 threads, the left one is red and the right one is green.  It is necessary to tie a red knot, preserving the original arrangement of the threads. </p><p>  First stage.  Cross the red thread with the green one, put it behind the thread and pass through the loop, bring it up. </p><p>  Second phase.  Lower the red thread not on the left, as in the first version of the knot, but on the right of the red thread (as on the second), also cross right to left, put under the green thread, pass through the loop and pull to the right.  Thus, a red knot will be obtained, but the threads will remain in their places. </p><h2>  Ornamental Bracelets </h2><p>  This is the easiest and most common way to weave these bracelets.  It can be diagonal, parallel lines, angles, rhombuses, etc. Before starting work, you must select a sketch or draw it yourself.  To do this, you can use a simple sheet in a box or this blank. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Blank for schemes baubles" class="if uuid-2422908" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2422908.jpg"></div><p>  The blank "Mesh" is convenient to use when weaving complex ornaments from the center.  "Honeycombs" are ideal for direct weaving from one edge or a snake.  To quickly build the circuit yourself, you can open this image in the standard drawing program and fill the cells with the desired colors using the fill.  It is worth remembering that out of 5 threads, 4 knots are obtained in a row, that is, always one less.  Therefore, above the grids there is a strip for the distribution of threads by colors, the number of divisions of which is 1 more than the grid cells in a row. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Schemes for baubles made of floss thread" class="if uuid-2422909" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2422909.jpg"></div><p>  You can weave baubles from threads, as shown in the figure, by weaving from one edge.  To do this, you need to take several threads of different colors, arrange them in any order, and then proceed to weaving.  It is necessary to knit knots with the shift of the thread to the right, until the first thread is the last.  Thus, all the nodules in the row will be the same color.  The next row is connected similarly to the previous one.  In such a bracelet, the colors of the horizontal rows will correspond to the original arrangement of the threads. </p><p>  The second option is a bauble with vertical stripes.  In this case, when knitting knots, the threads do not need to be interchanged, they must remain in their places.  Such a bracelet can be knitted both from one edge and with a snake. </p><p>  Another option is knitting from the center.  Weaving baubles from floss threads according to the scheme presented below is quite convenient.  The threads are divided into 2 parts, the colors are usually mirrored.  A central knot is tied, the following knots are knitted along the arrows with threads of the same color on adjacent threads to the edge.  Thus, the central threads become external.  The next row can also be knitted from the center to the edges, then you will get corners of a different color, or you can not touch those threads with which the knots were already connected, and then return to the center using the colors in the reverse order.  In this case, we get rhombs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Scheme baubles made of thread floss" class="if uuid-2422907" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2422907.jpg"></div><p>  When the basic types of nodes are mastered and the principle of moving flowers becomes clear, it will be possible to proceed to more complex motives. </p><h2>  Baubles with names </h2><div class="photo" data-original="wanelo.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Name Bracelets" class="if uuid-2417983" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2417983.jpg"></div><p>  And how to weave baubles with names from threads?  Not very simple, but undeniably interesting.  They are also called a bracelet of friendship and give to dear people.  To make such a bauble, it is necessary to make a model in the blank of the "honeycomb", since weaving will be on the principle of "snake".  Next, determine the color.  For starters, it is better to use threads of two contrasting colors.  The extreme threads should be the same color as the background, about 1.5 meters each.  The rest is about 80 cm and the color of the letters. </p><p>  Knit all the odd rows of the background with the shift of the working thread to the right, the even ones to the left.  The knots of letters must be knitted in the opposite direction.  That is, if the background in this row is knitted from right to left, then the nodes of the letters will be shifted to the right. </p><p>  How to weave baubles from threads, shown in stages in the next video. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="bZbeMg2CZfA" data-url="https://youtu.be/bZbeMg2CZfA" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/2/6/1/3/2613.jpg"></div><h2>  Bracelet ornaments </h2><p>  In addition to decorative and souvenir baubles, charm bracelets are gaining popularity recently.  It is easy to weave corresponding Slavic or Celtic symbols into their structure. </p><p>  The most popular among them: </p><ul><li>  point - rock; </li><li>  inverted triangle - Makosh (goddess of fate); </li><li>  straight or diagonal cross - fire; </li><li>  rhombus - earth; </li><li>  zigzag - wind; </li><li>  Y - chara, inverted Y - Lyubchik; </li><li>  _F - Slavets and many others. </li></ul><p>  Weaving charm bracelets is necessary with a clean mind and bright thoughts, you can not interrupt, so as not to disrupt the energy weaving.  The colors for the Slavic charms are better to choose white and red, for the Celtic - depending on the identity of the sign of a particular element. </p><h2>  Mount </h2><div class="photo" data-original="hindiishayari.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bracelets from threads how to wear" class="if uuid-2418002" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2418002.jpg"></div><p>  Before weaving baubles from threads, you need to decide what the fastener will be.  This is one of the most important stages of weaving a bracelet.  It can be done in several ways. </p><ol><li>  Double ring.  This type of fastening is suitable for those types of bracelets where there are 1 or 2 main threads on which the working thread is imposed.  It is convenient in that it allows you to adjust the bracelet to any size, while not tying it on a strong knot.  Due to this, such a bauble can be easily removed from the hand.  Read more about this mount above. </li><li>  The loop.  Before weaving, the threads are tied into a knot, forming a loop.  It can also be formed during the direct weaving of baubles.  For this, after 3 rows, the threads are divided in half and the next centimeter is weaved into 2 independent parts, after which they are again weaved with a common fabric.  A bead, a button is attached to the second end of the bracelet, or a cord is left, which is then passed through a loop and tied. </li><li>  Classic ties.  For them, it is necessary to leave threads at a length of 20 cm from both ends of the bracelet, then weave them into a braid or bundle, tie a knot at the end so that the ties do not open. </li><li>  Metal mount for bracelets.  It can be bought in the hardware department, as a rule, it is a small carbine and a chain for adjusting the length. </li><li>  A woman‚Äôs <span>desire (a bracelet of desire,</span> one of the types of charms) is attached to the hand, tying the threads of the beginning and end of the bauble in pairs.  Accordingly, how many threads were used in weaving, so many fastening knots will be.  Such bracelets are worn without taking off; there is a belief that he will fall off his hand as soon as a wish is fulfilled. </li></ol><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  If we consider the reviews of beginner needlewomen, then baubles made of thread to weave are really very simple.  The main difficulty lies in the correct knotting.  But if this obstacle is overcome, then the process brings a lot of pleasure.  As for the fastening, some are inclined to believe that the most appropriate form would be ties with tassels.  They give the bracelets an originality and make them unique. </p><p>  Weaving baubles from threads of floss, as well as from any others, will appeal to both adults and children.  The creation of such bracelets contributes to the development of creative abilities, fine motor skills, perseverance, spatial thinking and concentration.  In addition, they can be a wonderful gift, decoration or amulet for themselves and loved ones. </p>
