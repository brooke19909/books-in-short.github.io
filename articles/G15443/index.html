    <p>  There are many versions of when and where people first started using cards for fun.  In one case, their invention is attributed to the Chinese, who began to paint dominoes from cardboard.  Others believe that the innovator in this matter was the French king, who was thus able to hide his frenzy during the evening game parties.  One way or another, at the end of the 14th century in France, representatives of the lowest classes became obsessed with this occupation, which often harmed both the family and work.  Most likely, it was from there that this passion for gambling fun from people came. </p><h2>  What is card suit and what does it mean? </h2><p>  Each suit has its own meaning and a different name, not only in languages ‚Äã‚Äãand cultures, but also in historical periods.  Their ancestors were Tarot cards, the name of which is still used in Italy - swords, swords and cups, dinars, wands.  The Germans began to call four characters in their own way: "leaves", "acorns", "hearts", "bells". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Black suit in cards" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16925/317772.jpg" width="223"></div>

In the Middle Ages, it was believed that each of the stripes denotes a specific layer of the population, and the virtues of the cards were invented according to the then existing <span>state system.</span> </p><p>  Particular attitude to the cards of believing Christians.  They consider them a creature of the devil, who, through them, is trying to attract people to his side.  Gambling or just finding a deck in a house is considered a sin, and the soul of such people will be destroyed and eternal life will not be granted to them if they do not come to their senses in time. </p><h2>  What are card suits called? </h2>

    <p>  Everyone knows the answer, but not everyone thinks what they symbolize.  According to one of the most common versions, all stripes denote <span>instruments of torture</span> and suffering of Christ during his crucifixion on the cross (directly the cross itself, a spear, a sponge with vinegar and nails).  That is why the church has such an unambiguous attitude to this entertainment. </p><p>  Each suit of cards symbolizes one of the famous elements.  Peaks - air, means everything that happens negative with a person at the moment: quarrels, failures, lies, losses.  Cross - fire, shows what position a person has in society, has power, or, conversely, is subordinate.  Hearts - water, is responsible for the <span>emotional state,</span> love and relationships.  Tambourines - land, helps to find out and clarify all business issues related to work, travel, education, etc. These designations are used in fortune-telling with the help of special cards. </p><h2>  What is the most favorable card suit? </h2><p>  Most people think it's worms.  In some ways, they are right, because the loss of such a card during fortune telling can bode well in resolving various troubles.  In this situation, things will go well, events will begin to develop as usual.  About the person on whom the card of hearts fell, you can talk about how wise and judicious.  In certain situations, this may mean a quick vacation. </p><p>  What about suits that carry a negative load?  Obviously, the black suit in the cards does not bode well.  If such a card has fallen, then immediate troubles are ensured.  Believe it or not, everyone‚Äôs business. </p>
