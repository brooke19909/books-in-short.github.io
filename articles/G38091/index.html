    <h2>  Common causes of the failure of their heating element </h2><p>  The heater for the washing machine is fundamental, therefore, it is important to know why this part often fails and how to prevent its breakdown. </p><ol><li>  Terms of Use.  In the process of operation, the heating element constantly heats up and cools, this eventually leads to wear of the internal spirals and leads to its breakdown. </li><li>  Hard water.  The heating element is constantly in contact with water.  Its poor composition leads to the formation of scale on the tubes.  This makes the heater spend more energy on heating the water to the required temperature.  To prevent the formation of scale, experts recommend installing water filters on the inlet hose, using special products along with the powder when washing.  You can also periodically start the idle wash cycle, i.e. without laundry, using citric acid or formulations containing it. </li></ol>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where it is located? </h2><p>  Since the heater for the washing machine is the only heating element, for greater efficiency, it is located in the lower part of the tank.  But on which side of the device - back or front, depends on the company and model.  Therefore, the replacement of the heating element of the washing machine begins with the determination of its location.  You can do this by the appearance of the device.  If the back wall of the washing machine is large, then most likely the heating element is behind it.  In any case, the rear protective part is much easier to remove than the front, so you should start with it. </p><h2>  How to replace the heater through the back cover? </h2><ol><li>  Disconnect the washing machine from the power source. </li><li>  Drain all water from the tank (this can be saddled through an emergency filter). </li><li>  Deploy the unit with access to the rear protective cover. </li><li>  Remove the rear panel by unscrewing the bolts or screws on which it rests. </li><li>  Behind the protective cover is the tank body, under it is part of the heater.  The main part of the heating element for contact with water is in the tank. </li><li>  In order to remove the heater, you must first remove the terminals with wires. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Replacing the ten washing machine" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/1543918.jpg"></div></li><li>  Next, you should unscrew the center nut securing the heating element with a wrench or pipe wrench. </li><li>  It is necessary to unscrew until the nut is with the stud in the same plane. </li><li>  Then, using a screwdriver or a hammer handle, the pin is squeezed out by pressing it. </li><li>  Now you can remove the heating element itself.  But it is worth considering that it is planted on a rubber seal.  Therefore, in order to get it, you may need a flat screwdriver. </li><li>  If a new heater for a washing machine has already been purchased, it can be put in place of a broken device.  It is inserted into the hole in the same way as the old one was installed - evenly, tightly, without distortions. </li><li>  The existing nut is screwed onto the stud and tightened. </li><li>  The terminals are connected to the installed device. </li><li>  The protective wall of the washing machine is attached back. </li></ol><p>  This is the easiest way to replace the heating element.  It is much more difficult to do this through the front side.  For example, if the washing machine is Samsung, the heater is replaced through the front cover. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to replace the heating element through the front cover? </h2><p>  If the question arose about how to remove the heater from the Samsung or Bosch washing machine, it can be noted that the process of removing the device is the same as that described in the instructions above.  The only differences are how to get to it.  To do this, you must: </p><ol><li>  As in the first case: disconnect the device from the power supply, drain the remaining water from the tank and free access to both the front of the machine and the back. </li><li>  Remove the upper protective cover.  To do this, you will have to unscrew the two bolts on the rear side and remove it from the front clips. </li><li>  Remove the detergent tray. </li><li>  Remove the bolts that hold the control panel and also remove it from the latches.  It is necessary to carry out work with extreme caution so as not to tear off the numerous wires leading to the program block. </li><li>  Open the hatch, dismantle the clamp holding the cuff and the sealing gum itself. </li><li>  Unscrew the screws that hold the main front protective cover, it is removed from the latches (it is slightly retracted to itself and down). </li></ol>

    <p>  Now access to the heating element is open.  It remains to disconnect it in the same way as described in the instructions above, carry out tank prophylaxis (remove scale or foreign small objects) and install a new heater in place. </p><h2>  Where to buy a new heating element for a washing machine? </h2><p>  If you plan to independently replace a failed element, it is best to purchase accessories for repair of household appliances in specialized stores.  There, qualified sellers will help you choose the appropriate device option. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to remove ten from a washing machine samsung" class="if" height="454" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/1543917.jpg" width="586"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  You should not purchase accessories at low prices through various bulletin boards.  The quality of such parts cannot be verified properly.  In the worst case, they can cause damage to other elements of the device. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  If the washing machine has stopped heating water, then most likely the heating element has failed.  You can replace it yourself, without the help of a wizard.  The main thing is to adhere to the sequence of actions and correctly choose a new heating element that will correspond to the model of the washing machine. </p>
