Schemes</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Each toy, of course, carries an emotional charge.  His strength depends on how and by whom it was made.  Hand-made toys inspire more confidence.  They feel the soul of the master, they transmit the warmth of the hands of the person who made them.  They are willingly chosen for young children.  Adults acquire dolls in their collections, but more often than not they become the first toys of newborns.  This explains the popularity of handmade toys. </p><h2>  From the history </h2><p>  Dolls appeared in ancient times.  They belong to the very first toys.  Initially, they did not even carry a game function, but performed the role of a totem or amulet.  The origin of the word "doll" is rooted in ancient Greece, where the word "cyclos" had two meanings - "circle" and "something curled up." </p><p>  In early history, the doll was an idol for religious rites.  It was also believed that the souls of their ancestors were leaving in them.  The ancients believed that if you call a doll by the name of a real person, then it becomes its double.  Having caused harm to the toy, it was possible to cause damage to its double.  Centuries later, dolls lost most of their supernatural powers, but something still remained.  There is still an opinion that dolls for newborns avert the evil eye and protect the baby‚Äôs sleep. </p><h2>  How to make money on handmade? </h2><p>  This direction has not lost its popularity for many years.  A correctly chosen and implemented idea guarantees a stable income.  Promoting something of your own is quite difficult, so it‚Äôs better to choose what they already love, know and buy.  Teddy Bears, Amigurumi, Slingbuses, Porcelain Dolls and ... Tilda Doll.  It will be discussed further. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where did Tilda come from? </h2><p>  Today, there are many directions and genres in the creation of handmade toys.  Among them, the Tilda doll is one of the most popular and in demand.  It appeared in 1999 thanks to a designer from Norway.  The doll name is copyrighted and is a full brand.  The Tilda brand produces products for creativity and literature on needlework. </p><p>  At first it was a textile figure of a woman with characteristic features - an elongated body with wide hips, a small head, a long neck, bead eyes and rosy cheeks.  This version of the doll has a decorative function, it can not often be washed and given to small children in the game.  Another thing is the crocheted Tilda.  It can be washed, chewed, fed with porridge and taken with you to the street. </p><p>  Despite the fact that Tilda is considered a brand doll, no one has been prosecuted for copying it.  Tilda toys are crocheted, knitted, sewn from cotton, fleece and other materials by craftsmen around the world.  The nature of the toy changes from the material used. </p><p>  The image became so popular that it was tried on animals.  The most popular of them are hares, cats and bears. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ravelry.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bunny under the tree" class="if uuid-2896811" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/108960/2896811.jpg"></div><h2>  Knitted toys </h2><p>  What could be nicer than a bunny Tilda crocheted?  It causes tender awe not only in the hearts of children, but also of their parents.  Crochet Tilda doll looks much more colorful than its textile version.  To realize such a toy is not difficult - recognition and a cute face will do their job.  But the creation of the figures will have to work hard.  Tilda crocheted strictly according to the scheme.  You cannot create your own proportions, otherwise the image will be lost.  You need to start with ready-made schemes.  Better yet, start with simple toys to fill your hand.  Schemes and descriptions of crocheted Tilda are presented below. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Doll size 33 cm.

It seems to them that creative work is not profitable and you invest more in the business than you receive. </p><p>  You need to remember about high competition.  <span>Tilda Tilda,</span> but you need to come up with your own zest, something that was not there before.  It can be clothes or doll accessories. </p><p>  Bunny Tilda crocheted in the same way as a doll, the only difference is in the ears. </p><p>  Make an amigurumi ring of 5 loops. </p><ul><li>  1 row - 5 sbn; </li><li>  2 - 5 sbn; </li><li>  3 - 2 p in 1 (10); </li><li>  4‚Äì5 rows - 10 sbn; </li><li>  6 - 1 sbn, 2 p in 1 5 times (15); </li><li>  7-8 rows - 15 sbn; </li><li>  9 - 1 sbn, 2 p in 1, 7 times, 1 sbn (22); </li><li>  10-14 rows - 22 sb; </li><li>  15 - 1 ub, 9 sbn 2 times (20); </li><li>  16-17 - 20 sbn; </li><li>  18 - 1 ub, 8 sbn 2 times (18); </li><li>  19 - 18 sbn; </li><li>  20 - 1 ub, 7 sbn 2 times (16); </li><li>  21-23 rows - 16 sbn; </li><li>  24 - 1 ub, 6 sb, 2 times (14); </li><li>  25‚Äì27 rows - 14 sbn; </li><li>  28 - 1 ub, 5 sbn 2 times (12); </li><li>  29‚Äì31 rows - 12 sbn; </li><li>  32 - 1 ub, 4 sbn 2 times (10); </li><li>  33‚Äì45 rows - 10 sbn; </li><li>  46 - 1 ub, 3 sbn 2 times (6); </li><li>  47 - 1 ub, 2 sbn 2 times (6). </li></ul><p>  After that, you need to tighten the thread.  Do not stuff your ears. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ravelry.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitted bunny" class="if uuid-2896812" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/108960/2896812.jpg"></div><h2>  How much work? </h2><p>  Turning into a doll factory is also not worth it.  It is more profitable to work on order.  To begin with, it will be enough to create several toys and take high-quality photos.  Many masters carry their work to the salon and arrange a real photo shoot for them.  Their works compete favorably with those that are presented in unprofessional pictures and, accordingly, are better sold. </p><p>  Knitting toys to order is also beneficial because each client requires an individual approach. </p><h2>  Toy sales </h2><p>  Bad business is that the Internet does not seek.  Moreover, when working at home, the most convenient way to implement it is through social networks or your website. </p><p>  There are still platforms that specialize in assisting in the sale of in-house products.  It is necessary to take into account the fact that they take a commission on the things sold. </p><p>  The price of products is set according to existing on the market.  You don‚Äôt have to follow the most expensive options, but you should not put up too low a price. </p><div class="photo" data-original="izvod.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tilda doll" class="if uuid-2896818" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/108960/2896818.jpg"></div><h2>  Hobbies for the soul </h2><p>  Making <span>knitted toys</span> is not only a good way to make money.  This activity for many becomes a favorite thing and even the meaning of life.  Crocheting soothes nerves, and created images forever settle in the heart of the creator. </p>
