It is located in a nature park with 140 <span>olive trees,</span> over 450 years old.  It consists of comfortable cottages and the main building.  On the territory there are two pools, a playground, a restaurant.  The promenade and the beach are 80 meters away.  The complex has 123 double rooms and 65 apartments.  All rooms have large terraces, air conditioning, refrigerators.  There are two-level apartments - one terrace has a sea view, the second - to the park.  On the top floor of the main building are VIP-apartments with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã70 square meters with magnificent views of the sea and the park.  This hotel guarantees high quality service, like many other four-star hotels in Montenegro.  Petrovac gave Ville Olivia one of his best territories in the center.  From here it is convenient to get to any part of the city in which there is something to see.  For example, the ancient Venetian castle of Castio, erected on the rocks.  Today, Castio has become the venue for discos and concerts.  Near the ancient fortress is a pier, from which sightseeing boats regularly depart.  In the center of Petrovac Bay, two rocky islands rise: Katic and Holy Week.  Crowds of curious tourists flock to them daily.  The famous Church of the Holy Resurrection was erected on the island of Katic.  According to legend, it was built by a sailor who escaped from the shipwreck on this island.  In the evening and at night, both islands are illuminated by searchlights, which makes the view of them from the coast especially mysterious and attractive. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Montenegro Petrovac Hotel Villa Oliva" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13013/258233.jpg" width="500"></div>
