But so that such walks are not tiring, tourists often prefer to stay in hotels located directly in the city center.  This article will tell about some of them that vacationers most often choose. </p><p><img itemprop="image" alt="Rome city center hotels" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39363/2071510.jpg"></p><h2>  The eternal City </h2><p>  Everyone knows the expression: "All roads lead to Rome."  It has so many attractions that reviewing all of them in a day is simply unrealistic.  To fully immerse yourself in the atmosphere of the Eternal City, you need to think through routes to the smallest detail.  To cover as much as possible all the sights, it will take at least a week.  Of course, I do not want to live somewhere far away and spend a lot of time only on the road.  For this, there are Rome hotels in the city center, which are located so convenient that it remains to enjoy only relaxation. </p><h2>  Why is the center? </h2><p>  It is ideal, of course, to book individual tours that provide personal guides.  If you also live in the center, then the tour will long remain in your memory as an exceptionally positive trip, rich in different emotions and impressions.  Almost all Rome hotels in the city center have a good reputation.  Among them, a large selection of categories.  Choosing a place where you can stay for the duration of the tour, it is worth paying attention to the fact that most of them are located in ancient buildings.  This means that the rooms will be small, since most often these are medieval buildings. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Rome flights" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39363/2071507.jpg"></p><p>  However, all the hotels in Rome in the city center, which have cramped rooms, compensate for these inconveniences with a high level of service.  In addition, the first advantage of such hotels is the location and accessibility of attractions.  And this is a very significant plus for tourists. </p><h2>  What are the characteristics of Rome hotels in the city center, which have the category of three stars? </h2><p>  Nice, one might even say, family-run hotels with cozy rooms and comfortable beds, an evening shower or bath and a cup of coffee for breakfast - these are quite affordable 3-star hotels in Rome.  In addition, located in the central part of the Eternal City.  True, there are times when it is difficult to find a free room.  Therefore, it is better to decide on a hotel in advance and book your accommodation.  Especially a lot of tourists are observed during the so-called Roman holidays. </p><h2>  Flights </h2><p>  Many pre-booked hotels offer good discounts, as do airlines.  It‚Äôs better to ensure everything in advance so that there is no unnecessary anxiety when resting.  If you fly to Rome from the capital of Russia, then there should be no problems at all.  Flights Moscow - Rome can be purchased without any problems, especially if you worry about this in advance.  Flights are operated daily and more than once a day.  The flight takes about 4 hours.  Today you can buy tickets and book hotels without leaving your home.  Online services work in good mode. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p><img itemprop="image" alt="Rome hotels in center 3 stars" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39363/2071509.jpg"></p><p>  If, for some reason, flights could not be purchased on a Moscow - Rome flight, you should always remember that there are flights with transfers.  This, of course, is not very convenient, but also not as catastrophic as it might seem.  You can also fly to settlements close to the Eternal City, and then just get local transport to Rome. </p><h2>  Hotels in the center of "3 stars" and close to the center with a good reputation </h2><p>  Tourists leave a lot of reviews about Roman hotels.
