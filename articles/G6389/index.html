Manufacturers strive to segment products so that each user has a choice, but this is not always possible.  In this case, the Japanese developers offer a fairly modern device with an advanced sound recording base and an acceptable price tag.  Of course, the digital voice recorder Sony ICD PX333 can not be attributed to state employees, but its capabilities are an order of magnitude superior to entry-level models. </p><h2>  Appearance and Ergonomics </h2>

    <p>  The case of the recorder is made in a traditional form factor.  On the front side is a display, controls and speaker.  It is noteworthy that the screen has a small size and a black and white matrix.  This fact does not allow to raise the device to the segment above the average, but from the point of view of operation, the practicality of this solution is not significant.  The display shows technical data and allows you to manage the internal memory.  Further, it is important to note the successful configuration of the location of the Sony ICD PX333 buttons, which are convenient to press and navigate by touch.  Another working component is the speaker, which occupies a considerable part of the device.  The feasibility of its massive layout can be argued, but if you need a clear reproduction, of course, it will not be superfluous.  The device is powered by two finger batteries with the ability to recharge.  In general, the device turned out to be compact and convenient to use.  You can leave it in your pocket for recording or hold it in your hand for a long time - the modest mass of the device, according to many owners, is almost not felt. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Specifications </h2>

    <p>  Digital devices from renowned manufacturers are usually endowed with many new options and technological capabilities, which significantly increases their cost.  The Japanese company in many segments follows the same path, but in the case of the Sony ICD PX333 model, the developers focused on the balance of the main technical data, which are presented below: </p><ul><li>  The type of sound recording is mono. </li><li>  The recording format is mp3. </li><li>  Built-in memory - 4 GB. </li><li>  The frequency range is from 75 to 20,000 Hz. </li><li>  Interface Support - USB. </li><li>  Connectors - for microphone and headphones. </li><li>  Indicators - displays the battery charge and the remaining recording time. </li><li>  Batteries - two AAA batteries. </li><li>  The dimensions of the device are 37 mm in width, 114 mm in height and 20 mm in length. </li><li>  Mass - 74 g. </li></ul><p>  Although the manufacturer conceived the model as unpretentious and with decent recording quality, it is not deprived of some technological innovations.  In particular, the recorder received the function of activation by voice and the ability to change the sensitivity of the microphone.  And now it‚Äôs worth looking more closely at the main functions of the device. </p><h2>  Functionality Sony ICD PX333 </h2>

However, as the owners of the device, this add-on is ineffective, it is more expedient to initially arrange the conditions for an acceptable recording.  Also, the model is equipped with a function for regulating the quality of the recording, which can be useful if the memory is suitable for the outcome.  By analogy with modern mobile phones, the Sony ICD PX333 recorder also received the ability to lock buttons.  But in this case, this option has a double function.  On the one hand, the lock prevents unintentional control of the device, and on the other, it protects against unplanned stopping of recording by accidentally pressing the corresponding button.  In addition, the device provides the ability to set the date and time, the function of listening to records and, of course, deleting them. </p><h2>  Instruction for use </h2>

    <p>  First you need to make sure that the batteries of the appropriate format with the correct polarity are inserted into the special niche for the batteries.  Next, you must unlock the device using the Hold button.  From now on, the recorder is ready for use.  The red button REC starts recording, and by pressing it the recording pause is set.  The fact that the recording was started is indicated by the orange indicator, which also provides the Sony ICD PX333 recorder.  The instruction manual recommends to direct the device with microphones towards the sound capture side during recording.  You can stop the device using the Stop button.  The file with the recording can be found through the menu, listen to or delete. </p><h2>  Computer connection </h2>

    <p>  The recorder can be connected to a computer using a special USB cable.  After a new device is found, you can copy the recorded sound files from the device to the computer's memory.  For the convenience of performing this operation, the manufacturer suggests installing the Sound Organizer program.  Also, the first time you connect Sony ICD PX333, a help menu will open, using which you can learn more about the recorder and the features of its operation.  It is important to keep in mind that formatting the device will lead not only to the loss of audio files in memory, but also to the deletion of help information from Sound Organizer. </p><h2>  Precautionary measures </h2><p>  The manufacturer does not recommend using the device when driving a bicycle, car or motorized transport equipment.  When handling the recorder, it is also undesirable to keep it near heat sources and in places that have open access to sunlight.  You should also protect the device from mechanical influences and protect it from dust, since clogged connectors can affect the quality of the Sony ICD PX333 technical filling.  The instruction warns against using the device in high humidity conditions.  If liquid penetrates under the case, remove the batteries and dry the recorder. </p><h2>  Positive feedback about the model </h2>

    <p>  One of the strengths of the model is the high quality of sound recording, and at distances of up to 4 m. In particular, students note that the recorder adequately copes with capturing speech at lectures, while eliminating excess noise.  The convenient location of the control buttons is also emphasized, although there are complaints about the relatively small size of the side keys.  Separately, users note the functions of the subsequent handling of Sony ICD PX333 recordings.  Reviews, for example, mention the ease of rewinding at intervals of 10 seconds, good playback through the speaker and the ability to edit tracks.  By the way, for the convenience of further handling the created audio materials, many owners of the recorder recommend initially choosing the appropriate recording mode that will allow capturing with the most favorable settings. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  As already noted, the model does not apply to the premium segment.  If the device is capable of competing with some top-level models in terms of sound characteristics, then the additional functionality is still quite limited.  This is what users of the device indicate.  Firstly, there is a lack of backlight.  Secondly, a significant part of the owners lack an equalizer.  Even these small additions could make Sony ICD PX333's recorder more attractive.  Reviews criticize the model for the automatic restriction of sound - this is how the Avls option works every 20 hours.  Unfortunately, this option cannot be disabled.  The rest of the model has no serious flaws.  At least, this device copes with the capabilities declared by the manufacturer at a high level. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  If you conduct a review of models presented in the same price category as the device from a Japanese company, then its advantages will be even more obvious.  In the segment up to 5 thousand rubles.  You can find devices with a color display and backlight, however, in terms of basic quality characteristics, they are unlikely to be ahead of the Sony ICD PX333 recorder with its ability to clear sound recordings.  The creators of the device paid attention to the quality of the microphones and the recording hardware.  This is also evidenced by record high frequencies for this level.  True, the opinions of the owners are not so clear about noise isolation and, in general, cutting off extraneous sounds.  Obviously, the ideal conditions for using this device are classrooms, studios, halls, as well as small rooms.  Conversely, the recording quality drops sharply on the street when the microphone begins to capture a wide variety of noise effects.  However, using the Sound Organizer program, you can get rid of the presence of unwanted sounds on the recorded track. </p>
