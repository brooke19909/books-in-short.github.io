Often they are associated with a decrease in income, which affects many areas of human life.  If there are credit obligations, for example, a mortgage, then you have to save a lot.  You also need to look for loan repayment methods.  Now it is possible to repay the mortgage at the expense of the state, if the decrease in income is due to objective reasons.  This allows you to save housing purchased on credit.  The rules of the program will be discussed in the article. </p><h2>  Decree </h2><p>  The norm is spelled out in the government decree No. 373, which is valid from 07.23.2015.  Later, the document was amended, and the new edition is valid from 07.12.2015.  It was introduced <span>by presidential decree</span> No. 1331.  The latest edition took into account all the flaws that were in the previous bill. </p>

    <p>  There is another reason why it is possible to repay the mortgage at the expense of the state.  This is a loan in foreign currency.  State support is provided if, after a change in the exchange rate, the payment increased by 30% without revenue growth.  The increase in costs is equal to the decrease in salary. </p><h2>  Members </h2><p>  Who can count on paying off mortgages at the expense of the state?  2016, like 2015, made it possible to apply for such benefits to the following categories of citizens: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  young family with a child under 18 years old; </li><li>  family with 2 children; </li><li>  a family where the child or parents are disabled; </li><li>  the presence of a dependent up to 24 years of age who has no official income; </li><li>  civil servants; </li><li>  workers of a <span>city-forming enterprise</span> ; </li><li>  participants in <span>government programs</span> ; </li><li>  employees of the innovation sphere; </li><li>  former combatants; </li><li>  employees of RAS institutions, Academy of Sciences and scientists. </li></ul><p>  Only persons of these categories need to apply for participation in the program. </p><h2>  Property Requirements </h2><p>  There are several requirements due to which the mortgage repayment is executed at the expense of the state.  2017, like 2016, was no exception for beneficiaries.  Benefits are granted on the basis of the following conditions: </p><ul><li>  real estate is the only housing or not more than 50% of the share in another property; </li><li>  cost of 1 sq.  m. should be less than 60% of the price of average real estate; </li><li>  The legal cleanliness of the property is important. </li></ul><p>  Housing must meet the requirements for area.  If the borrower lives there alone, then the object should not be more than 50 square meters.  m. For 2 people, the limit is 35 meters for each.  The entire area is not more than 70 meters.  If there are three residents, then the requirement for the object is up to 100 square meters.  m </p><h2>  Income requirements </h2><p>  There are requirements not only for real estate, but also for income for borrowers.  In 2017, an innovation began to operate.  A client can receive benefits if his personal or family income has decreased.  The deterioration of <span>material status is</span> indicated by the balance after the payment of the contribution.  If it is below 2 living wages, the borrower has the right to arrange the repayment of the mortgage at the expense of the state. </p>

    <p>  In Moscow, the cost of living is equal to: </p><ul><li>  17,000 rubles - for adult workers; </li><li>  13,000 - for children; </li><li>  11,000 - for pensioners. </li></ul><p>  A borrower who wants to take advantage of support should not have bankruptcy status by court order.  You can participate in the program if you have a targeted loan.  In this case, the delay should be within 30 - 120 days. </p><h2>  agreement date </h2><p>  According to the first edition of document No. 373, customers who issued loans until 2015 had the right to arrange repayment of mortgage debt at the expense of the state.  The next decree does not indicate anything about this.  Only the period from the execution of the contract to the appeal for help is determined.  It should be at least 1 year. </p><h2>  Procedure at Sberbank </h2><p>  Such services are available at all banks.  Many have a mortgage in Sberbank, because there are favorable conditions.

    <p>  After this, we must wait for the decision of AHML.  If the result is positive, then funds are transferred to the account, due to which the amount of debt is reduced.  The client must sign a contract with the bank, which sets out the terms of the transaction.  Then the mortgage is adjusted, it is carried out with Rosreestr and the bank. </p><h2>  Required documents </h2><p>  The borrower must submit the following list of documents: </p><ul><li>  passport; </li><li>  confirmation of the right to participate in the program: income statements; </li><li>  a copy of the work book certified by a notary; </li><li>  certificate of marriage or divorce; </li><li>  birth certificate of a child; </li><li>  real estate papers </li><li>  agreement on participation in shared construction; </li><li>  extract from the Unified State Register. </li></ul><p>  The list of papers is subject to change.  In addition, documents may be required on the disability of the client or his children, on participation in hostilities.  For the fulfillment of other conditions prescribed in the contract, the borrower is responsible independently.  These include life and real estate insurance. </p><h2>  Federal programs </h2><p>  Since 2011, Russian citizens can enter into a program that allows for debt restructuring.  It acts for young families.  It reduces the financial liability. </p>

    <p>  Participants must meet several conditions: </p><ul><li>  age - up to 35 years; </li><li>  no more than 15 sq. m.  meters of housing; </li><li>  availability of funds to fulfill loan obligations; </li><li>  proof of participation in social housing. </li></ul><p>  Compensation will be a great help to the family.  Although for some the amount will be small, given the cost of housing, it still saves a lot of money.  Therefore, if all the requirements are met, it is imperative to participate in such a program; to refuse such assistance is extremely unreasonable. </p><h2>  Nuances </h2><p>  Naturally, in this matter can not do without pitfalls: </p><ul><li>  lenders cannot take money from clients for the restructuring procedure; </li><li>  even with the program, the client needs to make payments, and this does not eliminate fines; </li><li>  the lender may forgive the fines in full or in part, if this is due to the deterioration of the financial situation of the client; </li><li>  the client continues to be liable for property and health insurance, as specified in the mortgage agreement; </li><li>  the application for restructuring is considered within the terms approved by the credit institution; </li><li>  the subsidy is not provided to the borrower, the funds are transferred to the bank, which helps to avoid spending for other purposes; </li><li>  if after receiving the mortgage another 1 child appears, then assistance is provided up to 5% of the amount; </li><li>  when participating in the program a certificate is issued; </li><li>  mortgage can be registered not only in Sberbank, but also in other banks of the country; </li><li>  You can use the help only 1 time. </li></ul><p>  Repayment of part of the mortgage by the state will be an excellent help for borrowers.  It is necessary to collect the necessary documents and wait for a decision.  Previously, a specialist should consult about the chances of participation in the program.  Sometimes some nuances can affect the decision of the commission, so it is important to make sure that you meet all the requirements for a participant in this program.  Show a little perseverance, and you will certainly achieve the goal!  The state takes care of its citizens and does everything possible for their comfort! </p>
