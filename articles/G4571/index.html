It is possible to complete such a product in 5-6 evenings.  What is suitable for beginner knitters?  It is best for the first time to take half-woolen threads with acrylic, medium density.  They will lie flat, not make the model heavier, and not fall over.

The remaining loops are knitted with a garter stitch, which tends to twist into a steering wheel.  Get a kind of neck.  This classic version will look quite impressive! </p>
