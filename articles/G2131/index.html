    <p>  Few believe that someday light will be shed on such a mysterious story as the Kennedy assassination, the news of which instantly spread all over America, and then other countries.  Residents could not believe that the young president, though not an ideal ruler, but beloved and respected by all, had died.  No one knew for sure who killed Kennedy, no one knows this now.  Too much time has passed, too many traces have been noticed. </p><p>  Witnesses do not like to remember that day: everything was unexpected, however, the president himself predicted in a few hours.  Of course, he hardly realized that he saw his own future and gave his words crushing significance, but they turned out to be prophetic.  The assassination of the president, according to John himself, is quite possible.  To do this, you need to take a rifle with an <span>optical sight,</span> climb onto the roof of a tall building and take a couple of shots.  There was irony in his voice. </p><p>  The assassination of John Kennedy was attributed to the lone psycho Lee Harvey Oswald, who later refused to admit his guilt, but his words did not matter - the case was sewn with white thread. </p><p>  Indeed, no one took into account many obvious inconsistencies, and if some evidence leaked to the press, they were immediately destroyed.  So, for example, the doctors themselves in the hospital said that they were not allowed to follow the trajectory of the bullets in the president‚Äôs body in order to understand whether they were firing from one or several points.  ‚ÄúTop‚Äù received orders that the case must be suspended.  The result is a standard crime committed by a rabid fanatic who has nothing to do with a conspiracy against the president. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, rumors about the shooting were not at all from one point, which was proved several years later by acoustic scientists.  The tape recorder in Kennedy‚Äôs car worked from the very beginning of the trip and recorded everything that was happening.  This evidence was not considered because on the record it was hardly possible to distinguish any sounds. </p><p>  But after an experiment that recreates those barely audible shots using modern equipment, the acoustics managed to prove that there were not two shots in the neck and then in the head, as is commonly believed, but four! </p><p>  The first three shots can still be loaded onto Oswald, who was hiding in a bookstore and from there made fatal pulls on the trigger, but the fourth, according to experts, followed from close range, front and right.  Later there were witnesses who allegedly saw those who killed Kennedy, but these testimonies remained unattended. </p><p>  The murder of John F. Kennedy was in the hands of many people from the criminal world - this politician took action, if not destroying crime, then at least blocking her path of free lawlessness. </p><p>  <span>John Kennedy</span> clashed with the CIA, believing that their service should be disbanded and stripped of such a significant share of power;  crossed the road of the mafia;  opposed military action in Vietnam.  All of this, in aggregate, turned a large part of not quite honest people against him, so to speak, for which the president paid with his own life.  Persons with power know how to cover their tracks, and apparently no one will answer the question of who killed Kennedy. </p><p>  There is also a version that the Kennedy assassination was accidental, and the killers aimed at John Connolly, Governor of Dallas <span>, Texas</span> , who was riding in a nearby car <span>.</span>  However, it is impossible to believe in a fatal coincidence and in misfire of a crime prepared in advance. </p><p>  John Kennedy was a strong personality, and on his shoulders lay a great responsibility, which he would hardly have repudiated of his own free will.  No one should go unpunished, as the canons of justice say.  Alas, there is no hope that one day, waking up in the morning and turning on the central channel, we will hear the long-awaited for us, not indifferent people, words: ‚ÄúIt became known who killed Kennedy ...‚Äù. </p>
