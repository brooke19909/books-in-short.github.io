Symbols and their history</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Each city and region of our country has its own symbolism.  Moscow, as the ancient capital of Russia, is endowed with not only the most recognizable, but also historically significant signs - its emblem and flag, which are familiar to every Russian. </p><h2>  Why do we need flags and coats of arms </h2><p>  From the earliest times with the emergence of states, their designations appeared.  They went out to fight with their banners, defended their interests and defended their homelands from attacks by enemies.  Although the tradition of having a flag and coat of arms is a thing of the distant past, the notion that each state must have its own symbols is associated with the beginning of the 20th century.  What is this for? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow flag" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30399/684316.jpg" width="450"></div>  The flag and coat of arms of a country, city or state are not only its symbols, but also a special form of definition.  They connect us with the history and culture of our country, are an expression of patriotism.  It is the flag and emblem of the country that defines us in the world, they recognize us in other countries.

    <h2>  What does the emblem of Moscow look like </h2><p>  On a dark red background depicts a warrior-rider on a white horse.  In his hands is a spear of golden color.  Under the hooves a predatory black dragon lays, which the knight disarms, piercing the beast in the head. </p><h2>  What is the difference between the flag and the coat of arms of Moscow </h2><p>  A flag is a canvas that has a specific gamut of colors, which are indicated as various symbols.  Coat of arms is an emblem or sign of a city, district or state, the image of which indicates the most significant characteristics of a particular area using symbolic meanings. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The flag and <span>coat of arms of Moscow</span> look virtually identical.  The emblem of the rider killing the dragon is located there and there.  The flag, unlike the coat of arms, has a rectangular shape. </p><h2>  What do the colors of the coat of arms mean </h2><p>  The red background symbolizes the memory of soldiers who died in the battles for the Motherland.  In the middle we see a warrior on a white horse.  White means courage, purity of thoughts.  The black dragon is an enemy force that curls underfoot and tries to lead astray.  The golden spear is wealth and greatness.  Thus, the picture personifies the fearlessness of the Russian soldier and his strength. </p>

    <p>  According to one version, the color of the cloak was introduced by Nicholas II as a symbol - the Russian tricolor (the shield represents the red stripe, the mantle is blue, and the horse is <span>white).</span> </p><h2>  Coat of arms history </h2><p>  The first appearance of the symbol, reminiscent of the modern flag of Moscow, dates back to the time after the victory on the <span>Kulikovo field.</span>  Then the horseman killing the dragon became the emblem of the <span>Principality of Moscow.</span>  It was believed that he personifies the ruler.  Only from the beginning of the 18th century the image of a warrior was attributed to St. George, this value was proposed <span>by Peter the Great</span> under the influence of European thinkers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  With the advent of Soviet power, the flag of Moscow for a while has sunk into oblivion.  Instead, an image of a sickle and a hammer appeared, indicating the victory of the working class.  Already in 1993, the flag of the city of Moscow again acquired pre-revolutionary features, and the usual horseman hitting a monster again marked the capital. </p>

    <h2>  Who is this warrior <strong></strong></h2><p>  George the Victorious is a native of the ancient Greek family, who is in the faithful service of the emperor.  During the terrible persecution of Christians, this warrior came to their defense, for which he was subjected to terrible torture.  George asked God for help to give him strength to withstand all difficulties.  However, residents ordered the fighter to be executed, and in 303 he died at the hands of the executioner. </p><p>  Since those long-standing events, May 6 is considered a memorable day for <span>George the Victorious, the</span> Great Martyr who died for his convictions and desire to protect the Christian world. </p><p>  About George composed many legends and traditions.  One of them tells of the miracle of a warrior and the serpent, whom he defeated.  According to legend, once in the vicinity of the city of Lasia there lived a monster snake, attacking and destroying local residents.  The city was then ruled by a stupid and cruel king who was merciless towards Christians.  When people complained to him about the tricks of the snake, he invited the residents to give the monster their children in turn.  The ruler himself had a beautiful daughter, but for the sake of justice, and she had to be put on the list for the monster to eat.  When it was her turn, the princess went to death.  But then George caught her.  Upon learning of the terrible serpent, he himself went to fight with him without his army in order to save the king‚Äôs daughter and inhabitants from torment.  Begging God for help, George was able to defeat the enemy with the help of a right blow with a spear to the head.  Having dragged the affected carcass, the warrior told the locals that faith is their main strength, which can withstand any difficulties. </p>

    <p>  How does this story relate to Moscow?  As you know, Yuri Dolgoruky was the founder of Moscow, thanks to his work and perseverance, Moscow subsequently became the capital of Russia.  The name Yuri in the Greek way means George.  This interesting coincidence for two significant persons for Russian culture and history served as an excellent symbol, so it is not for nothing that George the Victorious represents the flag of the city of Moscow.  After all, this is the heart of our country. </p><h2>  Where can I find the flag of Moscow now </h2><p>  The symbol of the capital can be found on almost every street.  Here is a flag on a high-rise in Moscow, and here it is depicted on a bus.  Repeatedly it can be found in the subway and on ads.  For many, this emblem is a symbol of something belonging to the capital.  Very often we can meet the Moscow flag on billboards that inform about upcoming events with the support of the metropolitan government. </p>

    <p>  Any resident of Russia can mark the Victorious on the Russian coat of arms, in its very core.  This tradition dates back to the sixteenth century, throughout the entire pre-revolutionary history, the double-headed eagle with the Victorious was considered a symbol of the Russian Empire, and then modern Russia. </p><p>  Also very often the image of the Moscow coat of arms is used on government sites or those dedicated to something of the capital.  In such cases, the Moscow flag is used in the vector so that the picture can be harmoniously applied over the background. </p>
