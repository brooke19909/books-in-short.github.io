Often the sound quality is poor.  Distortion, noise, and noise may appear.  That is why people who record their voice for reviews prefer to use an external microphone.  In the article we will consider popular options from the Genius company.  The products of this manufacturer are in demand. </p><p>  The most famous models are inexpensive options with good features.  They impress not only ordinary people, but also professional bloggers who have been recording sound for more than a year. </p><div class="photo" data-original="id.geniusnet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="company producer" class="if uuid-2412934" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2412934.jpg"></div><h2>  Genius MIC-01C1 </h2><p>  The described microphone Genius MIC 01C1 is sold in several versions.  One modification comes with a stand, the other without it.  In the second case, the device has a lapel mount.  Thanks to this, you can not take your hands and at the same time create high-quality sound. </p><p>  Lapel options will be quite good if a person does not have the opportunity to buy a radio device.  The length of such specimens is about one and a half meters.  This, in principle, is enough for recording in front of the monitor screen, but you can‚Äôt go far with it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lamaplus.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="microphone genius" class="if uuid-2412903" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2412903.jpg"></div><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The microphone membrane of the Genius MIC 01C1 has a diameter of 9 mm.  The frequency of adaptation varies from 100 to 10 thousand Hz.  The sensitivity of the device is 58 dB.  The main features of the device are the pink connector.  Many buyers emphasize that it would be nice to make the device a black shade.  However, this is nitpicking. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The quality of the microphone is good.  The cost of the device is 100 rubles. Therefore, it fully justifies itself.  However, the mount seems flimsy, but if the microphone breaks, then no one will be sorry.  You can always buy another device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="citycomputer-ks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="microphone genius mic 01c" class="if uuid-2412907" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2412907.jpg"></div><h2>  Product reviews </h2><p>  There are more positive reviews than negative reviews about the device.  Everyone notes convenience, low cost, size, and the fact that the microphone perfectly transmits sound.  In addition, describe the convenient attachment of the device.  Simplicity and good sound quality made this Genius microphone in demand. </p><p>  However, there are some disadvantages.  For example, fragility, weak clamp.  Also, some focus on too short a wire. </p><h2>  Genius MIC-05A device </h2><p>  The described microphone is as simple as possible.  This unit is sold with a stand.  Packaging received a minimal design.  The box is transparent, made of plastic.  There is also an illustration that shows the interesting features of the device. </p><p>  Genius microphone is made in a classic style.  The device is made of various designs: divided into 2 parts.  One of them is a connector with a length of 3.5 mm, and the second is a 1.8 m wire. Both structures are made of plastic.  They are painted black.  The device weighs 100 g. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The appearance does not deteriorate over time, so even after a long period there will be no problems with the design.  The microphone received a sensitivity of 48 dB.  If we talk about the frequency range, then it varies from 100 to 10 thousand hertz.  These figures are not bad. </p><p>  If a person has a camera, a Genius microphone will be a great addition to it.  It is also well suited for various headsets where there is no built-in microphone.  In order to make a connection, you only need to insert the wire into the audio output of the computer.  No drivers need to be installed. </p><p>  Of the features of this device, it should be noted that the materials from which the device is made are most practical, the design is simple, the connection is easy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.edge-1.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="microphone genius mic" class="if uuid-2412908" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2412908.jpg"></div><h2>  Device Reviews </h2><p>  From buyers sound mostly positive reviews about this device.  But there are also negative comments. </p><p>  It should be noted that many of the advantages distinguish good sound, low cost and easy installation. </p><p>  Of the minuses, some notice a short wire.  There are also complaints of sensitivity.  If you move away to a distance of 40 cm from the microphone, then the voice will be picked up rather weakly.  Even if you use a gain of up to 30 dB, then still the problem will not be solved.  Many write that the wire is of poor quality.  Some note the presence of too loud noises.  Therefore, when cleaning the record from them, it becomes poor-quality.  In general, for a little money (up to 1 thousand rubles), the option is not bad.  However, some buyers would like a little better performance.  Together with the headphones, the Genius microphone will work well. </p><h2>  Genius MIC-03A device </h2><p>  Next, you should consider another microphone, which is manufactured by the company.

The frequency range is from 100 to 10 thousand Hz. </p><div class="photo" data-original="citycomputer-ks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="genius microphone camera" class="if uuid-2412906" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2412906.jpg"></div><h2>  Product reviews </h2><p>  It is necessary to highlight all the advantages and disadvantages of such a device.  Headphones Genius MIC-03A are compact, the base is foldable.  This device can be used with various speakers if they have a standard input.  Cost is another plus.

This is due to the minimum cost of fixtures and good quality. </p><p>  Devices are popular with customers due to their well-coordinated work and high operational characteristics.  Many owners recommend not using the devices built-in with the headset, but separately purchased microphones for filming reviews or recording any broadcasts. </p><p>  The most popular was the Genius MIC-01C1.  This microphone really deserves praise, being almost a leader in this field. </p>
