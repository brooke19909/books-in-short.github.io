In the context of world history, this was just another clash of world powers, but the events caused the appearance of the so-called lost generation and colossal human sacrifices.  One cannot but mention the Cold War with the former allies and the many local conflicts. </p><p>  A revolution thundered in Russia, ending the monarchy, a young Soviet state was formed, which did not survive to the end of the century.  The end of the century has become a time of globalization and rampant computerization.  Such a huge number of events of various nature added many new names to the story. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.grandforksherald.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="famous people of the 20th century" class="if uuid-2521444" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2521444.jpg"></div><h2>  Time Century Man of the Century </h2><p>  A list of <span>famous people of the</span> 20th century was published by Time magazine in the December 1999 issue.  Out of a hundred centuries chosen by man, Albert Einstein became.  This decision was justified by the fact that the twentieth century, according to the editors of the magazine, will be remembered primarily by technology and science.  Einstein serves as an example for all outstanding scientists whose work is based on his discoveries. </p><p>  On the cover of the magazine was a famous photo of Albert Einstein made during a photo shoot in which the scientist told the photographer about his despair that the theory of relativity had become a guide for the US government in creating an atomic bomb. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="medium.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Adolf Gitler" class="if uuid-2521943" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2521943.jpg"></div><p>  Among the compilers of the list there were discussions about Adolf Hitler, the Fuhrer, responsible for the Second World War and the persecution of Jews by the Nazis, about his declaration by the Man of the Century for the influence exerted on the twentieth century.  The journal‚Äôs requirements for candidates included the fact that the chosen person should have had a huge impact on the century, but it doesn‚Äôt matter which one - good or bad. </p><p>  As a result, they decided not to put Hitler‚Äôs image on the cover of the issue.  But there was an article by journalist G. Gibbs ‚ÄúJustified Evil?‚Äù In which she argued that the Fuhrer was simply the last in a chain of ‚Äúbloodthirsty personalities‚Äù, originating from Genghis Khan. </p><h2>  Political Leaders and Revolutionaries </h2><p>  Famous people of the 20th century include Martin Luther King, Mahatma Gandhi, Theodore Roosevelt, Lech Walesa, Pope John Paul II, Winston Churchill, Mao Zedong, Franklin Roosevelt, Nelson Mandela, <span>Margaret Thatcher,</span> Ronald Reagan, David Ben Guri Mina, Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, Adolf Hitler, Imam Khomeini.  All these people were national, political or social leaders, leaders of revolutionary movements. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.hotgozip.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nelson Mandela" class="if uuid-2521486" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2521486.jpg"></div><p>  Time magazine singled out Vladimir Lenin and Mikhail Gorbachev in the list of famous people of the 20th century.  From the point of view of his supporters, Vladimir Lenin devoted his life to the struggle for the liberation of workers and peasants from capitalist oppression.  This is a prominent politician, ideologist of communism and the founder of the Soviet state. </p><p>  Mikhail Gorbachev became the first and last (that is, the only) president of the USSR, who started perestroika - reform of the entire political system, the result of which was the collapse of the Soviet Union and the beginning of the history of modern Russia.  Acceleration, publicity, the <span>fall of the Berlin Wall, the</span> end of the Cold War and the beginning of private enterprise - all this is connected with the reign of Mikhail Sergeyevich. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ria.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mikhail Gorbachev" class="if uuid-2521488" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2521488.jpg"></div><h2>  Prominent scientists and thinkers </h2><p>  Among famous people of the 20th century, one cannot but mention thinkers, philosophers, and prominent scientists.  Among them are Sigmund Freud, Jean Piaget, Jonas Salk, William Bradford Shockley, <span>Ludwig Wittgenstein,</span> the Wright brothers, Lius, Mary and Richard Lika, Sir Alexander Fleming, Leo Hendrick Bakeland, Sir Tim Bernes-Lee. </p><p>  In 1903, the first aircraft, created by the American inventors, the Wright brothers, lasted 59 seconds in the air.  This event is considered to be the moment of the birth of aviation.  In 1941, Konrad Zuse created a mechanical computer, and in 1946 John Mokley introduced the first electronic computer to the world.  World Putin was invented by Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee. </p><div class="photo" data-original="time.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Alexander Fleming" class="if uuid-2521490" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2521490.jpg"></div><p>  In the forties, a technology for the production of penicillin was developed, which began to be produced on an industrial scale.  Alexander Feming proved that this mold causes the complete death of pathogenic bacteria.  In 1953, Francis Crick and James Watsov discovered the structure of a new DNA helix, and Rutherford deduced the hypothesis about the structure of the smallest unit of matter and was the first to extract energy from the nuclei of atoms. </p><h2>  Celebrities in the world of art </h2><p>  In the 20th century, famous people were engaged not only in scientific discoveries and inventions, but also in social and political activities.  Many changes have occurred in the field of art.  Among the celebrities you can list Bob Dylan, Louis Armstrong, Coco Chanel, Charlie Chaplin, Pablo Picasso, Frank Sinatra, Igor Stravinsky, Steven Spielberg, Oprah Winfrey. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thatgul.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bart Simpson" class="if uuid-2521498" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2521498.jpg"></div><p>  Interestingly, Time magazine included the animated character Bart Simpson in the list of famous people of the 20th century.  The Simpsons combined social satire and animation in ways that have never been done before.  And, for example, Oprah Winfrey, according to Time, participated in the formation of both the 20th and 21st centuries, so she had the honor of being celebrated again in 2004. </p><h2>  Heroes and idols of millions </h2><p>  Many really familiar names on the list of heroes and idols of the twentieth century.  These are Che Guevara, Mohammed Ali, Princess Diana, mother Teresa, Anna Frank, Bruce Lee, Marilyn Monroe, Pele, William Wilson, John F. Kennedy and others.  Famous people of the early 20th century became for many people symbols of hope, the most real idols worshiped by millions.  For the Russians, the main idols of the past century were Yuri Gagarin, Vladimir Vysotsky, George Zhukov, Joseph Stalin, Leo Andrei Sakharov. </p><div class="photo" data-original="edition.cnn.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="John Kennedy" class="if uuid-2521503" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2521503.jpg"></div><h2>  Famous people of Russia of the 20th century </h2><p>  In Soviet Russia in the twentieth century there were many famous personalities.  What can we say about the first person to fly into space, Yuri Gagarin, the famous surgeon Nikolai Amosov, poet <span>Rasul Gamzatov,</span> designer Mikhail Kalashnikov, physicist Igor Kurchatov, composer Dmitry Shostakovich and other prominent figures in science and art.  From childhood, all these names were familiar to Soviet citizens. </p><div class="photo" data-original="russian7.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yuri Gagarin" class="if uuid-2521510" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2521510.jpg"></div><p>  It is impossible to count heroes of a smaller scale, that is, regional, but their contribution to the common cause is no less important than the work of prominent political figures, talented talents, or world-famous scientists.  In the Amur region alone, several famous people of the early 20th century can be listed immediately: V. M. Popov - a natural scientist, A. Ya. Gurov - the first Amur archaeologist, K. N. Gribsky - the governor, who transferred a large collection of gunshot and edged weapons and others. </p>
