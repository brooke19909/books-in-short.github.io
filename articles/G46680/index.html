How to sew a loose dress?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, more than ever, the trend is the simplicity of the cut of clothes.  A loose dress has been a hit for a season.  Only the density of the material, the decor change, and some modeling moments are introduced, but basically the cut remains unchanged.  The free dress pattern is quite simple to build, so even the most inexperienced seamstress will cope with sewing such a product.  Of course, you can easily go to the store and buy a finished product.  But independent sewing has a lot of advantages, the main of which is the cost, which allows you to pamper yourself for the same money with a couple of new things.  About how to sew a loose dress at home, and will be discussed further. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="loose dress" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1162259.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Material selection </h2><p>  A loose dress is best sewn from a knitted fabric.  Choose it should be based on the time of year.  For winter, you can take angora or wool, for spring and autumn - diving, footer, jersey, for the summer an ideal option would be a stretch cooler and micro-oil.  Also in the work you can use dressing cloths with transverse stretch.  The advantage of stretch fabrics is that they wrinkle less.  And given that the loose dress is wide enough, this fact plays in favor of the appearance of the thing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="free dress pattern" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1162264.jpg" width="252"></div>

The free dress pattern is based on the following body measurements: </p><ul><li>  volume of chest, waist and hips; </li><li>  chest height; </li><li>  width of back and shoulder; </li><li>  height of the back and front to the waist; </li><li>  length of the product; </li><li>  girth of the upper arm; </li><li>  neck circumference. </li></ul><p>  All measurements should be recorded on a sheet so that they are easier to transfer to the drawing. </p><h2>  Create Pattern </h2><p>  A loose dress, as a rule, has either a trapeze shape or a straight silhouette.  The template for the one and the other model is the same, and all additional elements are built in the modeling process.  The pattern is best done on a cut of wallpaper or construction film.  The latter option is more practical if the plans are to create not one, but several dresses. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="loose dress pics" class="if" height="432" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1162265.jpg" width="234"></div>

    <p>  So, to sew a loose <span>dress with your own hands, you</span> will first need to develop a pattern based on taken measurements.  First, draw a rectangle in which half of the back and half of the front will be built.  The upper and lower sides should be equal to half the circumference of the chest, and the sides should be equal to the length of the product.  From the upper corner you need to retreat by the amount of measurements "chest height" and "height of the back and front to the waist" and draw additional horizontals.  The first will be the chest line, and the second will be the waistline.  Another 20 cm should be retreated from the last and the line of the hips should be marked.  Continuing to create the basic mesh, you should note the width of the back and calculate the width of the armhole to draw additional verticals.  To do this, along the chest line from the left side of the rectangle, the value of the "back width" measurement recedes and sets the point from which the armhole begins.  To calculate its length, you need to divide half the volume of the chest by 4 and add 2 cm. This value is also noted on the chest line and put a dot.  The rest will refer to the front shelf. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Then proceed to the designation of the shoulder seams and necks.  Everything is quite simple here: the value corresponding to half of the circumference of the neck recedes from the upper corners and distinguishes the shoulder area.  In this case, the extreme point should be underestimated by 1 cm, and on the back side, the rounding of the neck should be raised by 1 cm, and the shoulder seam is also drawn with a bevel of 1 cm. After that, the center is found along the chest line in the armhole zone and a rounded armhole is drawn to this point, connecting it with the edges of the shoulder seams.  Side seams are lowered from this center point, which are slightly spread apart to the bottom line, in accordance with the volume of the hips. </p><p>  A loose dress eliminates tucks, which simplifies the construction of the template.  However, if the landing is not satisfactory, the product can be slightly adjusted from the back. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a loose dress" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1162263.jpg" width="327"></div>

    <h2>  Sleeve construction </h2><p>  For a <span>summer dress with a</span> free cut, it will be enough to process the armhole.  A warmer option will need to be supplemented with a sleeve.  It can be one-piece or set-in.  They are built in different ways.  If we continue the shoulder seam and, having cut the details of the base of the dress along the side seam, remove the lower section of the sleeve from it, a one-piece version will come out.  For a set-in sleeve, it is required to fold the details of the base over the shoulders and transfer the cut of the armhole to a separate sheet for the drawing.  After the upper rounding, you will need to rise by 1.5 cm and draw a circle based on the outline of the resulting line.  On the lower border of this figure in the center should be placed the measure of the girth of the upper part of the arm and draw a ridge descending along the boundaries of the circle and reduced to a straight line. </p><h2>  Decorative elements </h2><p>  The dress will come out truly exquisite if you use the decor correctly.  For example, a plain jersey can be diluted with lace inserted in the shoulders or around the neck.  You can also beat the contrasting combination of the same quality paintings.  Loose dresses, the photos of which are presented in the article, have various decorative ornaments that can serve as an example or become <span>an inspiration</span> for more interesting design ideas. </p><p>  In addition to the standard decoration options, you can experiment with textures.  For example, make a dress with a light chiffon collar and mittens on mother of pearl buttons.  Combined with dark knitwear, this dress will be a great office option. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself loose dress" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1162244.jpg" width="535"></div>

    <p>  Do not forget about elements such as pockets, they perfectly complement free dresses.  Photos of finished products on models will determine the most acceptable location of these elements.  Carved, laid on and with a leaf, decorated with rag roses, rhinestones and sewn stones on the strict silhouette of a wide cut, they will look very harmonious and make the image interesting and stylish. </p><h2>  Assembly parts </h2><p>  In order for the product to turn out to be of high quality, you need to sew all its elements in the correct sequence.  First of all, work is carried out with the front shelf, in particular, pockets and other model elements are formed.  Next is the turn of the shoulder seams and the stitching of the sleeves.  After the side slices are closed and a seam to the neck is sewn.  Next is the turn of processing the bottom of the sleeves and hem. </p>
