  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Factors affecting human health</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Even at the time of the rapid development of technology, science, and in particular medicine, the human body is exposed to the environment.  There are factors that affect health, which are an important component of the guarantee of a calm and measured life.  Such components are different for citizens of individual states, since not only the country, but each of us chooses the direction of our personal development.  At the end of the last century, scientists of the World Health Organization have identified factors that have the greatest impact on both well-being and health in general.  Their significance for the body is different, and for each individual person will not be the same. </p><p>  During the day, weeks, months and years, a person is affected by the environment, his environment, relationships at work, as well as a list of all kinds of irritants, which were combined into factors affecting human health.  A person is a social being, and it is not strange that it is precisely the <span>social factors that</span> affect human health regularly.  In order for this group to bring only benefits to the body, it is necessary to take a rational approach to organizing life activities: lead an active social life, create a certain routine of weekdays, avoiding a nomadic lifestyle, since it exposes the body to a series of attacks of external stimuli.  In second place are <span>environmental factors that</span> affect health through the environment.  The nature that surrounds us is an important aspect in the process of formation and preservation of health.  To ensure comfort for a person, it is necessary to take into account the <span>climatic zone,</span> which served as the original habitat.  So, for example, if a resident of hot countries is moved to a humid and cool climatic zone, then, as a result, we will get a lot of diseases only because in a stressful situation the immune system will not be able to cope with the actions of irritants.  What is necessary to avoid such troubles?  First of all, you need to try not to leave the zone, which favorably affects a person.  Also, do not forget that a significant amount of time a person spends at work, which means that you need to take care in advance to ensure favorable conditions in everyday life and at work.  Avoid sudden and constant temperature fluctuations.  And of course, do not forget that the ecologically clean area in which you live will be an excellent foundation for improving your well-being.  The following on the list are genetic factors that affect health and are the prerequisites for a certain kind of disease.  This fact should be important for future parents, since it is precisely on what diseases the relatives were prone to, the possible diseases of the child depend.  Is it worth clarifying that it is in boys, due to the presence of the "Y" chromosome, that their predisposition to <span>genetic diseases is</span> almost twice as high as in girls.  Meanwhile, it is important to always remember that throughout life it is quite easy to degrade the <span>genetic code,</span> because the genes that make up it are affected by bad habits. </p><p>  In last place is the provision of medical care.  Only ten percent of the total exposure can be attributed to this group.  This is possible to observe only because medicine, on the one hand, significantly prolongs and saves human life, but its primary purpose is to maintain health.  This component is no less important, since only subject to the availability of regular medical supervision and the development of an appropriate direction in science, it is possible to maintain health and compensate for the influence of other factors. </p>
