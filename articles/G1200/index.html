The fantasy in it is limitless.  Books accompany us all our lives - from birth to old age.  The book world beckons with adventures, feelings, magic, history.  If a person begins to read an interesting book, then he is no longer able to stop, as her magic gradually steals him into a land of fantasies. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.aljarida.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself paper book" class="if uuid-2264431" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71885/2264431.jpg"></div><h2>  We create ourselves </h2><p>  Unique to humans is that everyone is able to create a book with their own hands!  After all, it will not be difficult to create it together with children or the whole family.  A self-made book can complement photo albums with a family life story, interesting moments and adventures.  True, you need to learn a little about technology and secrets.  The most correct and fast way to help make a book a do-it-yourself master class. </p><h2>  Book with binding </h2><p>  One of the most common options is a standard, self-made book made of paper with binding.  Many parts can be bought on the Internet or in the craft shop.  For a hobby, it‚Äôs better to buy a lot of goods.  After all, a person always needs to improve himself, to develop.  This is possible not only by obtaining a second or third education, but simply by doing useful needlework in life. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="vintagepagedesigns.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself wish book" class="if uuid-2264435" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71885/2264435.jpg"></div><h2>  The core of the book </h2><p>  First you need to prepare the inner sheets of paper.  This will help the printer.  In Microsoft Word, set new page options.  The first thing you need is to change the page margins for the correct formation and readability of the text.  Fields must be: </p><ul><li>  top 1.5 cm; </li><li>  lower 1 cm; </li><li>  inside 2.5 cm; </li><li>  outside 1.5 cm. </li></ul><p>  The page type needs to be set to ‚Äúbook‚Äù.  Paper size A5.  After the text, broken into book pages, you need to number.  Go to the "Insert" menu, select the "page numbers" field (at the bottom of the page).  Only when you make the correct arrangement, you can begin to typeset.  This is necessary so that the text does not change from changing the position of the page.  Lines may have jumped up - incorrect transfer of a sentence to another line.  It is important to put everything in order so that reading is comfortable.  Printing can be done by helping the program navigate the text.  We bend ready-made sheets and compose brochures.  Further, everything is worth stitching to connect the heart of the book together. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thecreativepenn.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY wish book" class="if uuid-2264434" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71885/2264434.jpg"></div><h2>  The way to smooth the surface </h2><p>  To get a flat surface, the stitched sheets are placed under the press.  For this, you can use something heavy.  When pressed with a press, the butt is not touched.  We cut the end of the book with a hacksaw.  Six vertical incisions along the entire end.  The depth should be such that it affects all sheets of paper.  After the end you need to cover with PVA glue.  On a fresh coating with glue we attach the fabric so that the edges protrude by 5 cm. Calico fabric is the best option.  The core must be allowed to dry, after which we sew each sheet to the fabric with threads.  The firmware goes through the cuts.  We cover everything again with glue on top of the threads, preferably not liquid. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Cover </h2><p>  To create a cover you need to find a very thick cardboard.  Two rectangles are cut out of the cardboard.  Their dimensions should exceed the page above and below by 4 millimeters. The third rectangle is created from a thinner cardboard.  In length it should be the same as two large rectangles, and in width - as the thickness of the end of the pages. </p><p>  Then we cut out two pieces of fabric.  The first piece should be the same as for gluing the sheets of a book.  The second is as tall as a narrow rectangle - and wide - 6 cm larger than it.  We put the cover so that two large rectangles are on the sides, and a small part is in the middle.  The main thing is that there should be a gap between the parts.  We glue the fabric on a small part, so that it evenly captures the gaps and edges of large parts.  On the other hand, glue the second piece of fabric so that the tails remain.  We spread these tails in the middle and attach to the wrong side.  Then comes the freedom of creativity.  Front cover decoration is to your liking.  It can be painted with paints or pasted over with a colored wrapper.  The bends of the wrapper should be on the inside about 2 cm from all sides.  And with the last touch we glue the cover to the core. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.istockphoto.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself felt book" class="if uuid-2264432" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71885/2264432.jpg"></div><h2>  Useful book </h2><p>  Parents are always ready to give all the best to their baby.  Such a gift can be a self-made children's book.  What materials can be used?  A handmade book made of felt is a wonderful gift for a child on any occasion and just on a regular day.  It will help the child in the development and knowledge of the world as a whole.  It will serve as a toy for the baby, help develop the motor skills of the hands of the child, tactile sensations and attentiveness.  Also, each child dreams of fulfilling his desires.  Known methods can create a book of desires.  A self-made book of desires will have some magic.  This gift can save you from buying expensive goods.  If your family or friends have a wedding, anniversary, you can give a wonderful gift - a handmade book of wishes made by yourself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.instructables.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself children's book" class="if uuid-2264436" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71885/2264436.jpg"></div><h2>  Book of felt </h2><p>  Before you begin, you need to think through the concept of a book.  The main factor is the age of the child and the story with which you want to familiarize the baby. </p><p>  DIY basics of making a book: </p><ul><li>  Age of the child. </li><li>  Book size. </li><li>  Will the book consist of felt, or will you still use cotton. </li><li>  Creation of sketches, drawings. </li><li>  Prepare patterns from the fabric of each part. </li><li>  Think through the book hardcover. </li><li>  It is necessary to think over the educational elements for the baby and the storyline. </li></ul><p>  Cut the base for the book in size.  Calculate how many pages, and do not forget about the cover.  If the book has 5 pages, then you need to cut 10 pages and 2 covers. </p><p>  Materials for creating a book from felt: </p><ul><li>  Felt. </li><li>  Needles and pins. </li><li>  Threads matching color for each shade of felt. </li><li>  Buttons </li><li>  Ribbons. </li><li>  Beads. </li><li>  Synthetic winterizer. </li><li>  Lacing. </li><li>  Rep tape. </li><li>  Rivets, zippers. </li></ul><p>  Materials can be changed, it all depends on the imagination and imagination. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself master class book" class="if uuid-2264437" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71885/2264437.jpg"></div><h2>  <span>How to make a</span> felt <span>book</span> </h2><p>  Children's books are sewn in the same pattern.  The first thing you need is to attach a gasket to the front rag.  Cut out all the details of the book and its elements.  On the page of felt, the parts are fixed with pins in their location.  They sew it with a sewing machine or sew it on their own with a needle.  The two sides of the cover must be sewn together, and the tails should be hidden in the inside.  You can use items with Velcro, but in such cases, so as not to spoil the material of the book, the soft part of the Velcro needs to be sewn to the base of the book.  There are three types of seams that can be used to create such a book. </p><p>  Types of seams: </p><ul><li>  ‚ÄúForward with a needle‚Äù - this is how the details that can be removed are stitched. </li><li>  ‚ÄúBehind the needle‚Äù - parts that are not detached are sewn. </li><li>  ‚ÄúLooped‚Äù - in this way all pages are flashed on the sides.  This design very harmoniously decorates the book. </li></ul><p>  A binding for a book made of felt can be chosen in a variety of ways: loops, on the grommet, tape or pieces of felt.  You can use the "curly" scissors, the work done by them will be neat and beautiful.  For the softness of the book, you can lay a synthetic winterizer between the pages, this method will be advantageous to use for very young children.  You can also lay canvas fabric between the pages.  In this case, the book will be much tougher than the syntepon. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself book" class="if uuid-2264430" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71885/2264430.jpg"></div><p>  Velcro can be sewn onto the sealing fabric for convenience: </p><ol><li>  You need to put a dense cloth on the back of the book. </li><li>  Sew Velcro to the back. </li><li>  Be sure to trim the excess fabric for accuracy. </li><li>  Sew on the details. </li></ol><p>  As soon as the work on the pages ends, we proceed to fasten everyone together.  We take felt with sewn, already prepared appliqu√©s and put the front side to the table.  Next is a synthetic winterizer.  We cover everything with the second page.  The front part we turn to ourselves.  We cut off the excess parts of the synthetic winterizer and work through the edge of the book with a needle and thread, capturing all the pages.  After you need to sheathe all the edges of the pages inlay. </p><p>  From early childhood, books open windows to their rich world.  They teach us good deeds, gentleness and tenderness.  The role of books in human life is very great.  Without books, neither the education nor the culture of our society would be possible.  The fantasy of needlework is a limitless world of unique ideas for our world.  You can do an original thing that will delight and serve for many years.  A person is able to work miracles, you just need to want it.  Good luck in the execution of creativity with your own hands! </p>
