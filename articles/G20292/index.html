    <h2>  Holidays for everyone </h2><p>  Many come to these places.  In fact, in Manavgat everyone will find entertainment and relaxation to their liking.  Of course, many people come here to spend all their free time on the beach, sunbathing in the sun and swimming in the gentle sea.  But if entertainment of this kind bothers, then you can always do something else.  For example, in Side, which is literally 15 minutes from Manavgat, a very vibrant nightlife.  Lovers of nightclubs will definitely like it here, which are in abundance here.  Having been in at least one of them, you can feel for yourself all the charm of a resort town.  If a person is not a fan of such a holiday, then you can always visit the tour to admire archaeological sites and excavations.  Or just stay at the Raymar Resort Side 5 and enjoy great service.  By the way, I must say that service is what this hotel complex can really be proud of.  And it‚Äôs worth talking about this in more detail. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Service </h2><p>  Turkey, as you know, is famous for its impeccable service and quality of service.  Many come here for this.  And Raymar Resort Side 5 is one of the most striking examples of such complexes.  Here, all guests are treated very carefully, they always try to help if they have any questions or problems requiring resolution.  <span>Raymar Hotel 5</span> Side (Manavgat) even <span>offers</span> non-smoking rooms as well as rooms for <span>disabled guests</span> .  The guests are different, and the hotel administration takes this into account.  If suddenly guests needed to buy something, then they may not even have to go anywhere - there are shops on the hotel territory where you can actually get almost everything.  By the way, one more important fact should be noted.  The staff at Raymar Hotel 5 Side (Manavgat) speaks four languages ‚Äã‚Äã- German, Turkish, English and Russian.  The latter is very pleasing, since many of our compatriots find it difficult to communicate in a foreign language.  And a very large number of Russian tourists come to this hotel every year.  So there will be no problems with adaptation. </p>

Also, you will not have to pay for your child if he is not two years old.  Moreover, the administration will provide a cot.  You should only discuss this nuance when booking.  This is necessary so that employees allocate and put a crib in the room.  As you can see, Raymar Resort Side offers a really very attractive environment.
