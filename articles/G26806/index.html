A hairdryer is a must-have tool.  Now the stores offer devices of different types.  What power should a hair dryer be?  The features of the choice for this parameter are described in the article. </p><h2>  The choice </h2><p>  Drying speed and cost depend on power.  This information is indicated on the box with the device or on its case.  Usually the value is fixed in W or W. What should be the power of the hairdryer?  The following rules will help you make your choice: </p><ol><li>  Up to 1200 watts are ideal for brittle, thin, short, dry strands.  This is enough to dry, but there will be no additional harm.  The device does not dry out the curls and scalp. </li><li>  The hair dryer power up to 1600 W is suitable for long, thick hair.  Species and more powerful are allowed to reach the required volume. </li><li>  If a family needs a device for several people, then a universal view with the ability to switch power will be universal. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.tymestyle.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hair dryer power" class="if uuid-2813809" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44565/2813809.jpg"></div><p>  It turns out that the power of the hair dryer depends on the type of hair and the purpose of the device.  If a suitable device is selected, it will be safe for regular use. </p><h2>  Professional </h2><p>  All hairdressers have their own professional hairdryer.  Typically, this device is necessary in <span>beauty salons,</span> and for home use is worse than household appliances.  The reason for this is that only a professional is able to use it quickly and correctly in order to perform styling and not spoil the curls.  The power of a professional hair dryer is higher, because hairstyles in salons must be performed quickly and efficiently.  But with experience, such a device can be chosen for the home. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you choose a professional device, it is important to consider the following nuances: </p><ol><li>  The maximum power of the hair dryer is the best choice.  This will help to quickly complete the hairstyle, even complex. </li><li>  To work in the salons requires a long (2.5-3 meters) cord.  It will turn out to be easy to walk around the client, to be far from the outlet. </li><li>  You need to look at the material: it is desirable that it be a high-quality plastic, similar to metal. </li><li>  It is advisable to choose a device with different nozzles.  In addition to the hub, you need a brush, a diffuser. </li><li>  A device of a well-known brand is needed, do not stop choosing cheap Chinese models. </li><li>  A device that has many additional functions is perfect: ionization, auto shut off, temperature and speed adjustment. </li></ol><p>  The power of a professional hair dryer affects the ability to perform different hairstyles.  If this indicator is high, it will turn out to create even very complex styling. </p><h2>  With ionization </h2><p>  It is important to consider that hot air is harmful to hair.  A hair dryer with an ionization function serves as additional care.  Although this option does not treat damaged curls, but it reduces the negative impact.  Negatively charged ions neutralize static electricity, which leads to fluffiness, which complicates styling. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.anthropologie.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what power hairdryer" class="if uuid-2813814" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44565/2813814.jpg"></div><p>  With this effect, it will be easier to create a hairstyle, and the less the effect of hot air, the better.  Users believe that the hair becomes smooth, shiny.  The result is saved for at least half a day, it all depends on the condition of the curls. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  For home drying </h2><p>  Not everyone needs a high power hairdryer.  Models up to 1600 W are suitable for the home, if the hair is medium or short.  It is important to pay attention to the nozzles that are in the kit.  Diffusers are suitable for the house, not separate locks are dried with them, but all at once. </p><p>  Hairdressers recommend using this nozzle for damaged hair after perming, dyeing.  It is an excellent choice for daily and gentle drying. </p><h2>  For styling </h2><p>  The styling speed depends on the power of the hair dryer.  The larger it is, the faster it will turn out to complete a hairstyle.  But working independently with devices over 1600 W is not so simple.  It is advisable to simplify the use of nozzles: </p><ol><li>  A hairdryer allows drying and styling at the same time.  This option is ideal for long and short haircuts.  The nozzle is easy to use on its own, ideal for home use. </li><li>  Hubs are the classic nozzle of many hairdryers.  Through a small gap, a targeted stream of air enters the area, which allows you to quickly dry, lay curls, give them shape. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.hairdryerhouse.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="high power hair dryer" class="if uuid-2813821" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44565/2813821.jpg"></div><p>  Therefore, what is the best hair dryer power depends on many factors.  If you need to perform complex styling and in a short time, you need a high rate. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  For straightening </h2><p>  There are special devices that are designed to straighten curls, for example, ironing.  But not everyone wants to spend money on a new device that will be rarely used.  It is better to choose a nozzle on the hair dryer for straightening.  Usually it has the shape of a comb, it is worn on top, and the device performs their drying and straightening.  If necessary, the nozzle is removed. </p><h2>  Power measurement </h2><p>  <span>What is the power of a</span> hair dryer <span>measured</span> ?  Watts - a unit of measure, on the device it is indicated by the letter W. This indicator indicates the strength of the air flow supplied by the device.  Typically, devices are divided into the following ranges for this indicator: </p><ol><li>  Gentle styling - up to 1500 W. </li><li>  The average performance is 1500-2000 W. </li><li>  Professional - 2000 W. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.110220volts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="power professional hair dryer" class="if uuid-2813824" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44565/2813824.jpg"></div><p>  A hair dryer of high power is usually chosen for beauty salons, and it is difficult to work with it independently.  For home, you need to choose the average. </p><h2>  Temperature versus power </h2><p>  Different characteristics are responsible for a certain function.  Many people think that a device with high power heats the air very much: this may not be so.  Power indicates the speed at which the air dampens the device, it can be hot or cold.  The number of watts determines how quickly it will turn out to complete the installation, how much time will be spent on it. </p><p>  The opinion is considered erroneous that due to the power, the hair overheats, the structure is destroyed, the scalp is damaged.  If the temperature is correctly set, it will turn out to quickly complete the hairstyle without damaging the hairline.  Usually, the optimal mode is easily selected by hairdressers. </p><h2>  Low power appliances </h2><p>  By power, which hair dryer is better?  Low-power devices no more than 1500 watts.  Such devices have compact dimensions, often they add up.  Usually these devices are called road. </p><div class="photo" data-original="satu.kz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hair dryer power which is better" class="if uuid-2813828" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44565/2813828.jpg"></div><p>  The price of such models is acceptable.  The power consumption of these models is minimal, therefore, from this point of view they are more profitable.  Power will be enough for a daily short and short haircut.  Such models are suitable for very dry strands.  In this case, if you want to quickly make the curls dry by increasing the intensity of the hot stream, this will not work, and therefore there will be no drying of the hair. </p><h2>  Medium Power Devices </h2><p>  The power of a good hair dryer is 1500-2000 watts.  This is the most suitable option for domestic use.  The advantage of the device is that if there is a function to change the air supply and temperature, it will be possible to choose the appropriate mode for the procedure. </p><p>  The downside is the high energy consumption even when the device is used at a low temperature and at a low air supply intensity.  But if a short hairstyle grows, then you need to buy this option, since it helps to adjust the parameters of the mode by choosing the appropriate one. </p><h2>  Powerful Hair Dryers </h2><p>  Devices with a power exceeding 2000 W are intended for professional use.  The air of these models is strong, therefore, such devices are usually made of materials with high heat resistance, therefore they work continuously and without overheating for a long period.  Often in the kit there are many nozzles.  The minus of the models is the high cost and power consumption, which makes the use of devices financially unprofitable.  But the possibility of drying even long thick curls covers any disadvantages of the device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tofem.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what power should a hair dryer be" class="if uuid-2813830" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44565/2813830.jpg"></div><p>  Before using a powerful device with a high intensity of air supply and high temperature, it is necessary to choose protective equipment.  With constant procedures, special thermal protective agents are used.  Do not allow hot air to get on your skin.  This will not only not burn yourself, but also save moisture in the locks and scalp. </p><h2>  Other characteristics </h2><p>  In addition to power, you need to pay attention to other indicators.  One of them is ionization.  It protects hair from drying out and maintains its structure, as it neutralizes static electricity.  This function is good for winter, when the curls are naughty and very fluffy. </p><p>  An important indicator is the mode of operation.  Many devices use not only power controllers, but also speed and temperature.  But not all manufacturers have such models.  In low-cost devices, temperature and speed are regulated with one button.  This is not entirely convenient, as the temperature also rises with increasing speed. </p><p>  An important parameter is the number of speeds.  On the body of the device there are usually numbers indicating the smallest indicator, medium and high.  Some firms set even more speeds, but this option is not worth buying.  Functions may not come in handy, but there will be an overpayment for them. </p><p>  Strongly hot air spoils the curls, making them brittle and dull.  Manufacturers make devices with several temperature modes.  On the body of the product there are numbers that indicate the temperature, or a button that delivers cold air. </p><p>  If the kit has a lot of nozzles, then such a hairdryer will be convenient to use.  If the device is used only for drying hair, then the number of nozzles does not matter.  There are several of their main types: </p><ol><li>  Diffuser.  This nozzle has a tapered end.  Inside there are holes through which air enters.  The result is a soft feed that protects the hair. </li><li>  Concentrator  This nozzle is in most types of hair dryers.  It is presented in the form of a cylinder with a tapered end.  With the use of a concentrator, the air stream penetrates into the area where the device is directed. </li><li>  Active diffuser.  This is a large nozzle with "fingers".  With it there is a massage of the skin, giving the hair volume. </li></ol><p>  When choosing devices, you need to pay attention to the function of cleaning the filter located in the rear.  Its main function is to protect internal elements from dust.  If the filter can be removed, it can be easily cleaned from penetrated hair and dust.  It is advisable to buy a hair dryer with this function. </p><h2>  Manufacturer </h2><p>  The more famous the brand, the better the process is followed and the standards are met.  If you want the device to serve for many years, it is advisable to choose a device manufactured for Europe.  The best companies include the following: </p><ol><li>  Bosch </li><li>  VITEK. </li><li>  Scarlett. </li><li>  Rowenta. </li><li>  Valera. </li><li>  Philips </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.allure.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="power of a good hair dryer" class="if uuid-2813832" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44565/2813832.jpg"></div><p>  When choosing a hair dryer, you need to pay attention to the length of the cord so that it is enough from the outlet to the mirror.  The price depends on the manufacturer, configuration.  Products of European companies usually cost 5-6 thousand rubles, and hair dryers-brushes - from 700 rubles. </p><h2>  Best hair dryers </h2><p>  There are many devices for drying hair, so it‚Äôs not so easy to choose the right one.  The best devices are the following: </p><ol><li>  <strong>Bosch PHD9760 / 9769.</strong>  This model is suitable for home and salon.  The device has excellent power, 6 speed modes, 3 temperature modes, cool air supply function.
