It is located in the Northeast district of the city, in the same district.  It was opened in June 2010 and until the end of 2016 it was final, until it was extended to Petrovsko-Razumovskaya. </p><h2>  Title and History </h2><p>  The Moscow metro station Maryina Roshcha got its name from the district in which it is located.  The very same area was named after the noblewoman Marya, who was the wife of Fedor Koshka Goltay, who owned these lands. </p><p>  In 2007, for the construction of the station, the Canadian company Lovat Inc.  By order of Mosmetrostroy, it specially designed a mechanized tunneling complex, which is a shield with a diameter of eleven meters.  This was the first experience in the world metro construction of the construction of an inclined escalator tunnel with the help of such an installation - earlier it was used only for tunneling of horizontal type.  New technology has significantly reduced construction time and reduced the complexity of the process. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nevsedoma.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Station construction" class="if uuid-3049817" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10809/3049817.jpg"></div><p>  In the summer of 2008, the shield was assembled at the construction site of the Maryina Roshcha metro station, and at the end of August it was solemnly launched.  01/30/2009 the inclined tunnel for the escalator was completed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In April 2009, due to a lack of financial resources to complete the construction, the authorities decided to postpone the opening of the Maryina Roshcha metro station to May 2010. In January 2010, it was completely completed and architectural work was started. </p><h2>  Opening </h2><p>  The station was planned to be launched on May 15, the day when the metro metro turned 75 years old, but due to the unavailability of the escalator slope and the incomplete finishing work in the lobby, the opening was postponed to a later date.  At the end of May 2010, the clearance was carried out at the launch site, and on June 9 a test train proceeded along the tunnel. </p><p>  06/19/2010 the opening of the Maryina Roshcha station in the Moscow metro took place.  The event was attended by the head of the subway D. Gaev and Mayor Yu. Luzhkov.  They congratulated Muscovites and guests of the city on their new acquisition and thanked the builders who did their job perfectly.  After the commissioning of the "Marina Grove" in the metro of the capital, there were 182 stations. </p><p>  In October 2010, Mosmetrostroy began construction of the station‚Äôs northern lobby.  Initially, its opening was planned in September 2012, but actually took place only on 12.24.2012. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mapala.net" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Metro station &quot;Maryina Roshcha&quot;" class="if uuid-3049814" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10809/3049814.jpg"></div><h2>  Architecture </h2><p>  The Maryina Roshcha metro station is a three-vaulted pylon structure with a deep foundation.  The platform part is a structure with two landing platforms on the sides with a diameter of 8.5 m and a hall in the middle with a diameter of 9.5 m. In two rows with passages of 3.75 m there are nine pylons, each 6.76 m long.  In the middle hall, there is a cornice fluorescent lighting. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There is a single-track dead end behind the station.  Previously, it was used to change the direction of movement of electric trains, and is currently used to find trains at night and zone turnover during peak times. </p><h2>  Decor </h2><p>  The track walls of the Maryina Roshcha metro station are faced with beige aluminum panels.  The pylons are lined with dark and light marble to visually reduce their length and massiveness: light stripes merge with the cornice, and dark stripes merge with the base. </p><div class="photo" data-original="subway2009.narod.ru" data-author=": " data-source="http://subway2009.narod.ru/Moscow/10/Maryina_Rosha.htm"><img itemprop="image" alt="Marina Grove" class="if uuid-3049812" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10809/3049812.jpg"></div><p>  There are passenger benches along the platform walls in the side halls.  The exits and track walls of the platforms are decorated with mosaic landscape panels by the artist S. Goryaev, demonstrating the possessions of Count Sheremetevs. </p><p>  The floor is lined with beige polished slabs and dark brown granite, which together form a geometric pattern.  Exit stairs are faced with heat-treated granite.  At the edges of the platforms there are LED strips. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The Maryina Roshcha metro station is located between Butyrskaya and Dostoevskaya.  It is located under Sheremetyevskaya street, passing in parallel.  The southern lobby goes to the intersection of this street with Suschevsky Val, and the northern - to the Satyricon Theater and the intersection with the fourth passage of Maryina Roshcha. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mapala.net" data-author=":  , " data-source="https://mapala.net/ru/dmrog/stanciya-metro-marina-rosha/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Station outputs" class="if uuid-3049816" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10809/3049816.jpg"></div><p>  Within walking distance from the station is ‚ÄúKVN Planet‚Äù - a youth center with a multimedia concert hall that seats eight hundred people.  There are bus and trolleybus stops near the exits. </p><p>  In 2022, they plan to launch the Sheremetyevskaya station on the Big Ring Line and connect it with a transfer with Maryina Roscha. </p>
