Someone prefers five-star complexes, and someone and more budget options.  In our article we want to talk about one of the four-star complexes of the famous Kemer resort.  Seagull Hotel Beldibi 4 *, located in the village of Beldibi, offers its guests an economical vacation and good conditions.  Like any institution, the hotel has its advantages and disadvantages, which we want to tell about. </p><h2>  A bit about the hotel ... </h2><p>  Seagull Hotel Beldibi 4 * has long been successfully hosting tourists on its territory.

    <p>  Resort guests who prefer secluded locations will certainly visit the wild beaches of Belbidi.  Walking in the direction of Antalya, on the coast you can see several stunningly beautiful bays, in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich the cliffs border the sea and white sand.  Often in such places a unique view opens up, which everyone should see.  Despite the fact that some beaches of the resort are difficult to access, they are incredibly popular due to their picturesqueness. </p><p>  The village also has a municipal coastal section, which is equipped with showers, changing cabins, sunbeds and sunshades.  It is worth noting that the beach was awarded a high award - the Blue Flag. </p><h2>  Attractions Beldibi </h2><p>  Outwardly, Beldibi is not much different from other Turkish villages on the Mediterranean coast.  Its main street, stretching along the sea, is named after the famous hero - Ataturk.  Along the street stretched shopping malls, cafes, and numerous hotels. </p><p>  There is no promenade familiar to any resort in Belbidi.  There is only a beautiful road that stretches along the Ataturk Park.  Walking around the village, you can admire the mosque.

Despite the fact that the hotel complex has its drawbacks, as well as in any institution, it is very popular among tourists, and many people relax here is not the first time, since minor flaws can not overshadow a wonderful holiday. </p><p>  Enthusiastic hotel guest reviews are the best recommendations.

    <p>  The hotel is not new, but comfortable apartments are very convenient for living.  The only drawback, according to tourists, is the cleaning.  If the rooms themselves are somehow cleaned, then the bathrooms are not.  Maids only change garbage bags, and the presence of incentive bonuses in the form of tips do not affect the quality of cleaning.  Apparently, this situation is due to the fact that among the hotel staff there are not very responsible people.  But as for bedding, his maids change as necessary, there is no problem with this.  As for towels, fresh ones are given once every three days.  Safes in rooms are paid, so not everyone uses them.  In the bathroom there is only shower gel, as well as a hairdryer.  As for shampoo, paste, soap and other little things, then they must be purchased by yourself.  In principle, all detergents should be present in a hotel of this level, but in this institution they are not.  In general, tourists are satisfied with the living conditions. </p><h2>  Nutritional reviews at Seagull Hotel Beldibi 4 * (Turkey) </h2><p>  The hotel offers its guests an all-inclusive system.  Meals are organized as a buffet in the main restaurant.  The institution pleases with a good assortment of dishes, a large selection of fruits, stewed and fresh vegetables, sweets and desserts.  Of the meat there is mainly chicken.  In principle, there is always a lot of food on the tables, but there are no frills or fish.  In general, the food is quite good and varied. </p><p>  For children in the dining room there is a separate room with a TV, where kids can eat.  The complex has bars offering refreshing drinks, as well as quality local alcohol. </p><h2>  General impression of the establishment </h2><p>  Seagull Hotel Beldibi 4 * (photo is given in the article) makes the best impression, thanks to a rationally organized and beautiful area, as well as very friendly staff.  All tourists celebrate the reception staff and hotel animators.  Attentive staff is always ready to help their vacationers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel seagull hotel 4 turkey description" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2010419.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Reviews about Seagull Hotel Beldibi 4 * (Turkey) confirm the presence of adult and children's animation.  There is a playground for kids, there is a kids club and a pool.  However, children's daytime activities are not diverse, so children are not always interested.  In the evenings, a mini-disco is open for young vacationers. </p><p>  For adult vacationers conduct classes in water aerobics, yoga and other sporting events.  In the evenings, entertainment is available.  If you like outdoor activities, then the hotel you will find for yourself an interesting lesson.  You should definitely visit the spa and massage treatments.  In general, the animation is completely unobtrusive, it is clear that the guys are trying hard.  According to vacationers, the number of events that carry out activities could be increased. </p><p>  The hotel has serious internet problems.  The claimed free Wi-Fi is constantly interrupted, so using it is simply impossible.  Most of the tourists at the hotel are families with children and older people.  Young people here are likely to be boring, so you should consider other options.  Of course, Kemer is nearby, and young people go there in search of nightly entertainment, but is it worth spending extra money on trips if you can choose a more suitable place to stay?  Reviews of tourists about Seagull Hotel Beldibi 4 * speak of the institution as a place for a relaxing family vacation.  Therefore, choosing this complex, you should not expect anything more than it really is.  Since Beldibi itself is a small village, the most interesting is its beautiful nature and the splendor of the mountains.  There are no entertaining objects around the hotel, except for several stalls where you can buy fresh fruits.  The village also has market and remote trading on certain days.  For more interesting things you need to go to Kemer. </p><h2>  Beach Vacation Reviews </h2><p>  One of the advantages of the hotel is its location.  Since the complex is located directly on the coast, there is no need to take walks to the sea in the heat.  The beach is a two minute walk from the buildings.  The coast in this area is pebbly, making entering the sea completely inconvenient.  Many vacationers recommend purchasing appropriate shoes in advance.  The hotel's beach is equipped with sunbeds and tents, as elsewhere, there are many people who take up towels from early morning.  Sun loungers are provided to guests free of charge, but renting mattresses for them will cost a dollar a day if you want to take it. </p><p>  Beach towels at the hotel are also paid.  Most tourists buy their own beach accessories at the local market and use them.  As for the sea, it is very warm and beautiful.  For those who do not like pebbles, there is a pier from which it is great to dive into the water. </p><h2>  Pros and Cons of the Hotel </h2><p>  Summing up the conversation, it is worth noting the strengths and weaknesses of the institution.  The hotel is suitable for a relaxing and measured relaxation.  A small beautiful area gives this wonderful place a special charm.  The complex belongs to far from young institutions, which is clearly visible in the interiors of the halls and rooms.  The hotel needs a good renovation.  The complex consists of a number of buildings that are significantly different from each other.  In newer buildings, the condition of the rooms is better than in older ones.  But with all this, the hotel is very loved by many tourists who come to it far from the first time.  Attentive and sensitive staff, good food, beautiful nature and a warm sea - all this makes your stay at the Seagul Hotel pleasant and interesting.  Therefore, the institution can be recommended for families with children.  It is worth noting that most of the tourists living in the hotel are representatives of the post-Soviet space.  Most of the staff of the institution perfectly understands and even speaks Russian, so you can not be afraid of any language barrier. </p><h2>  Tours and activities </h2><p>  For those guests of the resort who can not imagine relaxing without entertaining trips, you can recommend using the services of a local guide, which can be found at the hotel reception.  However, as elsewhere, the cost of excursions with a representative of a tour operator is much higher than with a street one.  Since the village of Beldibi itself in terms of attractions and interesting places cannot please, it is worth going for new impressions to Kemer, which is located very close. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel seagull hotel 4 turkey reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2010417.jpg" width="577"></div>
