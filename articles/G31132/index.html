Probably nothing more charming after a hard working year and it is impossible to wish.  If you have already firmly decided that you will spend this vacation somewhere in warm places, for example, in Thailand, it is worth paying special attention and scrupulousness to the selection of a suitable hotel.  After all, if you really pay money, then only for the best service and the cleanest rooms so that nothing could overshadow the long-awaited vacation. </p><h2>  Hotel as in the pages of a glossy magazine </h2><p>  In Thailand there are a huge number of decent hotels.  So there really is plenty to choose from.  But I would like to draw your attention to the hospitable <span>Pattaya Park</span> Beach Resort, which was awarded three stars on its facade and which can really please you not only with its tropical nature, but also with many additional services that are necessary so that a person can really abstract from boring city ​​life and enjoy all the delights of spa life. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pattaya park beach resort" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28711/1101056.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where exactly is the hotel located and what interesting things can be found near it? </h2><p>  Pattaya Park Beach Resort has earned admiration for its location in the first place.  It is a bit distant from the city of Pattaya, only 5 km away, but this is enough to ensure that its guests have a great opportunity to enjoy the scenery of incredible local nature.  Pattaya Park Beach Resort is not just a hotel, it is a whole complex, the main parts of which are two buildings of the hotel - Pattaya Park (a more romantic part of the hotel, which is partially hidden from human eyes and is suitable for those who come to relax from any fuss and want to reunite with nature) and Pattaya Park Tower (this is a high-rise building, which, in addition to hotel rooms, also includes many entertainment options that those tourists who are tired of sitting in boring offices dream of so much). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There is literally a stone's throw to the coastline, only two hundred meters will separate you from the warm waves.  Tourists like the huge amusement park, not only children can relax here, but also interesting markets where you can buy bright souvenirs and exotic fruits that you can only dream of on the territory of our country. </p><h2>  The most important thing is the hotel rooms </h2><p>  Of course, prospective tourists are most interested in the rooms that <span>the Pattaya</span> Park Beach Resort <span>hotel</span> prepares for its guests.  Frankly, there is more than enough space here.  So, the romantic Pattaya Park building on its fifteen floors has placed as many as 240 rooms.  Here there are also small one-room options for a secluded vacation, and tourists who come with their family admire reviews for two or even three rooms.  The urbanized building Pattaya Park invites in 420 rooms, which are located on 25 floors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pattaya park beach resort 3" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28711/1101062.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <h2>  What is in the room? </h2><p>  Pattaya Park Beach Resort cares about its guests, so the feedback that it has air conditioning, a landline telephone, a large TV and a hairdryer is true.  <span>Daily cleaning,</span> stunning landscapes that open from the windows, filled with interesting, but paid drinks, a minibar and round-the-clock service make every minute spent in the room or on the hotel territory, just fabulous. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The downside that tourists often recall is overloaded elevators.  Since there are a lot of rooms in the hotel and there are always enough visitors, sometimes you have to wait for the elevator up to 10-15 minutes.  Another unpleasant problem is insects, but given the local nature and climate, they simply cannot be overcome by the hotel staff. </p><h2>  Interesting places for vivid entertainment that are part of the complex </h2><p>  Pattaya Park Beach Resort also has a whole entertainment infrastructure that adults and children can only dream of.  Since the total area is really huge, two beautiful pools, a fairly modern amusement park, two exotic bars and six restaurants with absolutely different cuisine are very comfortable here.  The kids are most pleased with the water park, where you can really frolic on the hottest day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pattaya park beach resort reviews" class="if" height="272" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28711/1101061.jpg" width="600"></div>
