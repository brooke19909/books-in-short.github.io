Marmaris is rightfully considered one of the best places to stay in Turkey.  It was he who was originally considered a European resort, since tourists from England, Germany and Holland rested in his hotels.  But gradually all the advantages of Marmaris were appreciated by our compatriots.  Let's discuss the reviews of tourists about holidays in Marmaris. </p><h2>  Weather at the resort </h2><p>  Reviews of tourists about holidays in Marmaris will certainly relate to the local climate, which can be safely called ideal.  The fact is that here, even in August and July, there is no intense heat.  The sea on the coast is always calm and clean, because the city is located in a closed bay, which is covered by an island and a peninsula from the open sea.  On the beaches it is almost impossible to catch the waves.  And the entry into the water is very smooth and gentle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Marmaris" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1955790.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In Marmaris, the climate is drier than in the same Antalya, so people with pulmonary diseases feel very comfortable at the resort.  In winter, frosts are extremely rare, but sometimes it rains with wet snow.  According to tourists, you can go on vacation in Marmaris in the month of May, but the sea warms up fully only in June.  This is worth remembering if you are planning a vacation with children.  The season at the resort continues until the end of October, and swimming in the sea is possible until the beginning of November. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get to the resort? </h2><p>  You can not get to the resort from Russia by plane.  The nearest <span>airport</span> to <span>Marmaris</span> is in the city of Dalaman.  In this direction, the planes of the Turkish Airlines company fly.  There are no direct flights to Dalaman, so in Istanbul you need to change trains.  The flight takes about three hours.  Round-trip tickets cost around $ 190.  But tickets from St. Petersburg are much more expensive, about $ 300.  Of these cities, there are Aeroflot flights.  From Dalaman to Marmaris can be reached by bus.  In the summer, which covers the period from May to October, direct charter flights to Dalaman are opened.  The cost of such tickets is much less than getting with transfers. </p><p>  It is worth noting that Dalaman Airport is located 120 kilometers from the resort of Marmaris.  Therefore, the hotel will have to be reached by bus another 1.5-2 hours.  With all the advantages of Marmaris, getting to it is not very convenient. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="holidays in marmaris tourists reviews 2017" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1955810.jpg" width="580"></div>

    <p>  From April to the end of November, you can reach the resort by ferry, which arrives from the Greek island of Rhodes.  Therefore, tourists can first get to the island by plane, and then by ferry to Marmaris.  The only inconvenience is the fact that a Schengen visa is required to visit Greece. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Resort Areas </h2><p>  What you need to know about holidays in Marmaris?

    <p>  Icmeler is very famous for its stunningly wide sandy beaches and the equally famous thermal springs.  The area is perfect for families with children and youth.  A lot of family hotels with playgrounds have been built on the local coast.

According to vacationers, the coast was chosen by divers, because coastal waters are clean and calm. </p><h2>  Turunc </h2><p>  The village of Turunc is located next to Icmeler.  This area is the most calm and quiet place of the resort.  The pride of the village is a beautiful beach, which is awarded the Blue Flag.  The coast of the village is surrounded by pine forests.  Reviews of tourists say that in Turunch there are no fashionable hotels and expensive restaurants.  The entire infrastructure is quite modest and no frills.  People come here just for the sake of natural beauties. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Sarigerme </h2><p>  If you are looking for hotels in Marmaris for families with children, then you should head to it in Sarigerme.  The resort area is located near the airport and is focused on children.  In each institution for young tourists there is everything you need: from a special menu to animation and venues. </p><h2>  Armutalan </h2><p>  Armutalan is not just the largest resort area, but also a place of accumulation of all kinds of entertainment.
