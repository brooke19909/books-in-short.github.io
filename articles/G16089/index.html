  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Refrigerator "Snayge": advantages, disadvantages, customer reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>The Snayge refrigerator</span> meets all modern requirements: it is economical, durable and reliable, made of high quality materials, has a beautiful design.  The line of models includes several modifications that differ in size, functionality and cost.  The advantages of Snayge are undeniable, but there are also disadvantages. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kvarcs.lv" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Two-chamber Snige refrigerator" class="if uuid-2417698" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2417698.jpg"></div><p>  The Lithuanian company Snaige has been producing refrigerators since 1963 and has already managed to earn an excellent reputation.  The company refused to produce other household appliances and specializes exclusively in refrigeration equipment.  Every year, brand factories produce updated models that meet the latest norms and standards.  The latest technologies are widely used in production; therefore, Snage refrigerators are energy efficient.  This factor plays an important role, since the device is constantly connected to the network and consumes energy continuously. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  The cooling system is organized according to the principle of natural convection of air masses: cold air is supplied to the bottom of the chamber, then it is heated and moves to the upper part.  So in the refrigerator zones of different temperature and humidity are formed.  The Fast Freeze fast freezing function guarantees guaranteed maximum flavor and nutrient content in products.  Frozen food is not covered with ice and does not lose its natural color.  Two-chamber models have a spacious <span>freezer,</span> which cools food to -18 degrees, so that food can be stored in it for up to 12 months. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Environmentally friendly materials used for the production of Snayge refrigerators ensure the safety and security of products.  To finish the inner surface, a dense plastic is used, in which there are no pores, so the smells are not absorbed.  The position of the interior shelves in high impact glass can be adjusted in height. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  The disadvantages of the Snage refrigerator include the rather noisy operation of the compressor.  Although the engine is manufactured to EU standards, it can make a variety of sounds when turned on and off, but this happens infrequently and not in every device. </p><h2>  Line of models </h2><p>  Choosing a suitable model of the Snage refrigerator, it is necessary to take into account the main parameters: size, functionality, appearance and cost. </p><p>  Small refrigerators with a height of up to 1 m are distinguished by good capacity, for example, the R130-1101AA model boasts 97 l of usable volume of the refrigerator and 17 l of freezer, while the height is only 85 cm and the annual energy consumption is 179 kW / year.  This model is available single-chamber, ideal for a small kitchen, office or cottage.  Due to its low height, the refrigerator can even be placed under the countertop. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.1a.lv" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Small fridge &quot;Snayge&quot;" class="if uuid-2417702" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2417702.jpg"></div><p>  Medium-sized refrigerators up to 150 cm high can be either double-chamber or single-chamber.  In the first case, the model is equipped with a rather large freezer with a volume of 45-60 liters.  In the second case, the device can be completely without a freezer, so when buying, you should carefully study the technical specifications.  For example, Model C 29SM-T10021 is available <span>without a freezer.</span>  <span>A</span> medium-sized <span>refrigerator</span> is suitable for a small family of two to three people. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.1a.lv" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Medium refrigerator" class="if uuid-2417712" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2417712.jpg"></div><p>  The height of large models is 150 - 200 cm. As a rule, such Snayge refrigerators are two-chamber.  At a height of 176 cm, the usable volume of the refrigerator is 191 liters, and the freezer is 88 liters.  The annual energy consumption is 248 kW / year.  In addition to traditional snow-white models, the Snaige line includes color, bright enough options that will decorate the interior of the kitchen and make it more interesting.  Buyers have the opportunity to choose a refrigerator with a silver, steel, beige, red, blue or black facade. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.1a.lv" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Refrigerator &quot;Snayge&quot; red" class="if uuid-2417715" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2417715.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to standard food refrigerators, Snaige also produces wine coolers.  Such a device is equipped with glass doors and maintains a temperature of 5 to 16 degrees. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Customer reviews of Snage refrigerators are mostly positive.  The owners note the high quality of the interior decoration, good spaciousness, beautiful appearance and relatively low cost.  Although the brand is considered reliable enough, breakdowns do occur from time to time.  In this case, the repair of Snaige refrigerators is carried out by certified service centers, is carried out quickly and thoroughly, and the warranty period is 24 months from the date of sale. </p><p>  The refrigerators of the Lithuanian brand have been popular for more than a dozen years and have earned an excellent reputation.  Reliability, durability, high quality materials and beautiful design allow you to withstand competition and show consistently high results. </p>
