    <p>  And how much does a designer earn in various fields of activity?  What kind of designers are there and how is the work of creative people appreciated? </p><h2>  How does a designer work? </h2><p>  The salary of a designer largely depends on how he works.  Specialists of this kind can make a living in several ways: </p><ul><li>  Freelance - independent work, without a boss, alarm clock and Monday; </li><li>  work in a private company or agency at a rate; </li><li>  organization of own design agency. </li></ul><p>  If you want to work only for yourself and not depend on the vagaries of your bosses, the first option will suit you.  There are many exchanges where one-time orders are offered with good payment for the result.  To take advantage of the offer, you need to register on the site, make a small portfolio of your work and apply for the work.  The customer himself will contact you, after which it will be possible to discuss all the details of the work and agree on payment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You do not want to spend a lot of time on independent searches of the customer?  It is worth paying attention to design agencies.  The average salary of a designer in a small private company can be 50‚Äì80 thousand rubles.  If you have good experience and you know how to "sell yourself", you can count on working in a larger organization.  There, the salary of a designer can be 100-150 thousand and even more.  Office work has its advantages.  Interesting projects and lots of communication are provided for you.  In addition, you do not have to "bother" with customers.  Providing you with work is the task of leadership. </p>

    <p>  If you want to earn even more, you will have to organize your own company.  There is no upper bar for generating income.  Everything will depend on how quickly you can get on your feet and earn a good reputation in this market segment.  The better you work, the more ‚Äúfat‚Äù customers will come to you. </p><h2>  Web Designer and Graphic Specialist </h2><p>  One of the most popular areas in this area is a web or <span>graphic designer.</span>  Such people can easily help you develop business cards, websites, landing pages, posters, avatars and even develop a corporate identity for any organization. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  How much a designer of this kind earns depends on several factors: </p><ol><li>  The presence of a diverse and high-quality portfolio.  A potential customer should understand the level of your skills. </li><li>  The average price for services of this kind - do not overestimate the price for services, this will scare away customers.  But to appoint too low a price is also not worth it.  Of course, this will attract you more customers, but very soon you will be tired of sitting out all day for miserable pennies. </li><li>  The time taken to complete the order.  How much a designer earns depends on how much he works.  If you take one order a week, you will not see large profits. </li></ol><h2>  Landscape designer </h2><p>  Another fairly popular profession is a landscape designer.  The salary of such a specialist also depends on many factors.  A good landscape specialist has been appreciated more and more recently.  This is due to the fact that many families, tired of the bustle of the city, tend to move to nature, which means that they are faced with the need to equip the adjacent territory. </p>

    <p>  If your profession is a landscape designer, your salary will depend on which region you work in.  In some regions, the price for such services ranges from 20 to 30 thousand rubles per project.  In the immediate suburbs, you can already ask for 50-60 thousand rubles for one compound.  And if you know how not only to create a beautiful picture from flowers, trees and fountains, but understand the construction, geodesy, water supply and other areas of activity, then your earnings can rise to 100-120 thousand.  And if you can work not only efficiently, but also quickly, it‚Äôs worth trying two or three projects at the same time.  Earnings in this case will increase proportionally. </p><h2>  Interior Design </h2><p>  Such specialists most often do not work on their own, but in collaboration with a design studio.  Therefore, their salary is usually fixed and depends on experience, length of service and the number of successfully completed projects. </p>

    <p>  Beginners can expect a salary of no higher than 20‚Äì25 thousand rubles in the periphery and about 38 thousand in the capital.  More experienced specialists with higher education in this field and independently completed more than a dozen projects can rely on a salary of 80-100 thousand Russian rubles per month. </p><h2>  Clothes designer </h2><p>  The salary of a clothing designer depends on the level of the company in which he works.  Small firms will offer 25-30 rubles per month.  Salaries in large metropolitan firms can reach up to one hundred thousand. </p><p>  Only a small number of specialists in this field of activity can afford to create and promote copyright fashion collections and create under their own name.  Most <span>clothing designers</span> still work "uncle." </p><h2>  How much does a designer get abroad? </h2><p>  Everything we talked about before belongs to the Russian market of services.  And how much does the designer ‚Äúearn‚Äù from them? </p>

    <p>  Here you will have to add excellent knowledge of the language to all of the above skills.  Just conversational will not work here.  After all, you will have to discuss in detail with the customer all the nuances of the future project. </p><p>  Now about the salary.  By our standards, it can be said sky-high.  For example, an American graphic designer or web specialist can receive from 38 to 105 thousand "green" per month.  An interior designer in Australia can claim an average monthly salary of 75-80 thousand "American presidents." </p><p>  Advertising agencies in large cities in many countries set hourly rates.  It ranges from 320 to 585 dollars for one hour of work.  Not bad, right?  Looking at such offers, it is safe to say that a designer is not only a very interesting, but also quite profitable profession. </p>
