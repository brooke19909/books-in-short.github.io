An interesting legend is associated with the discovery of mineral springs: “One hunter wounded red deer and chased it for a long time. Soon he saw a beast approach the spring and began to drink. Then he entered the nearby lake and after a while left it noticeably refreshed. The hunter was very surprised and decided to try the amazing water himself. "  So it became known about the healing springs of the Tunkinsky valley.  Since the end of the 19th century, many researchers have visited it.  And already at the beginning of the 20th century, about 50 log huts were rented out in the village, and wooden log cabins were built around many springs.  And the resort began to be actively built up only in Soviet times.  A sanatorium was built here, new wells were drilled.  Now the village is one of the most visited resorts in Eastern Siberia. </p><h2>  <span>Climate in</span> Tunka Valley </h2><p>  What attracts tourists to Arshan?

    <p>  Healing factors are the mountain air of the resort, mineral waters for external use and silt healing mud, as well as medicinal drinking water, due to which the resort of Arshan appeared.  Treatment is also carried out with the help of physiotherapy: balneotherapy, mud therapy, inhalation, aromatherapy, massage, ozone therapy and many others.  The resort specializes in digestive diseases, diet therapy, bowel cleansing, tubing and irrigation of the stomach.  A lot of attention is also paid to psychotherapeutic methods of exposure.  Experienced doctors work in sanatoriums and there is a serious diagnostic base.  But the main treatment is still carried out with the help of well-known healing mineral springs, for which people travel to Arshan.  The resort arose only because of them. </p><h2>  Mineral waters of Arshan </h2><p>  Among the local population, healing springs have been famous for a long time.  The composition of the mineral water of Arshan is close to the Caucasian Narzan.  It is useful for chronic gastritis and other diseases of the digestive tract.  There are several sources in Arshan: there are both hot and cold.  Some of them are preserved in their original form, others exist in the form of wells, water from which flows directly into the sanatorium's bathroom building.  An eye source rich in iron is revered.  A sacred grove was formed around it, each tree in which was tied to the top with colored ribbons as a sign of gratitude for healing.  By composition, Arshan mineral waters are slightly acidic, highly carbonated, sulfate-bicarbonate and silicon.  The low-mineralized karst springs of Suburg and Papy Arshan are very famous.  There are water rich in carbon dioxide and used externally in the form of bathtubs.  A feature of almost all the wells in the resort is that they were drilled, since this water aggressively affects steel pipes, destroying them. </p><h2>  Arshan Resort: holiday reviews </h2><p>  Getting to the resort is easy - the asphalt and comfortable road goes to the village itself.  Buses and taxis go.  In a few hours you can get from Irkutsk or Ulan-Ude. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="resort arshan reviews" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10994/964600.jpg" width="276"></div>  Therefore, Arshan is a favorite vacation spot for residents of the region.  They go there from other parts of the country.  The resort amazes tourists with the beauty of nature, the purity of air and the healing power of water.  Reviews about the rest are mostly positive.  Of the shortcomings, tourists sometimes note the remoteness from civilization, some poor living conditions, a small amount of entertainment and difficulties in climbing mountain trails.  But everyone is unanimously inclined to believe that Arshan helped them to heal, relax and gain strength.  In addition, they note the extraordinary beauty of the weapons area.  Almost all vacationers recommend visiting the resort of Arshan.
