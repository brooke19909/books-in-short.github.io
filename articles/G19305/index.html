  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hot crochet stand: diagram, description, patterns</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The simplest hot crochet stand design can be the basis of the original product.  It is enough to pick up good threads, decide on the design and pattern.  The device will complement the interior design, save furniture from spoilage and improve the aesthetic appearance of the hot drink. </p><h2>  What Crochet Hot Stands Can Be </h2><p>  You can make a hot stand yourself.  The easiest option is crochet.  There are several options for manufacturing the device: </p><ul><li>  The most common are round coasters. </li><li>  More practical but less popular square coasters. </li><li>  Rectangular, triangular, oval products can be found. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.eeasyknitting.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hot stand crochet pattern" class="if uuid-3171226" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/3171226.jpg"></div><p>  Crocheting a hot stand is carried out in accordance with certain patterns.  If you fully follow the descriptions, the result will be amazing. </p><p>  To make the flow of tea or coffee more organic, it is worth making a whole set of coasters for cups and a teapot (teapot).  A complete set should be made in one style. </p><h2>  What materials can be used to make stands </h2><p>  Knitted coasters are mainly used in the kitchen, so it is undesirable to make a device from natural threads.  Such yarn quickly loses its shape, color, quickly ignites.  It is worth choosing such options for yarn: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Cotton and linen are suitable for the manufacture of openwork coasters. </li><li>  Acrylic is an ideal option for knitting any version of the stand. </li><li>  Knitted threads will help create a trendy product. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="madepeachy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crocheted circle" class="if uuid-3171235" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/3171235.jpg"></div><p>  Sometimes for the manufacture of textile elements of this functionality use satin ribbons, threads with lurex and other yarn options.  You can decorate knitted blanks with lace, fabric, ribbons, embroidery from threads. </p><h2>  The principle of knitting a round stand </h2><p>  The most popular form for stand is the circle.  It is very easy to knit such a variant of the product using a hook.  Even an inexperienced needlewoman will be able to make a fixture using an understandable diagram. </p><p>  How to crochet a base-circle for a cup stand: </p><ol><li>  First you need to make a loop, which will be the beginning for the formation of the amigurumi circle. </li><li>  Tie the loop with 6 single crochet stitches.  Pull the loop thread to lock the circle. </li><li>  In the second row, you need to double the number of loops.  In each column, knit two double crochet columns. </li><li>  In the third row, an increase occurs by half of the already existing number of loops.  Addition is made through 1 loop. </li><li>  In each next row, an addition is carried out through two, three, four loops. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="cornmaiden.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet hot stand" class="if uuid-3171234" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/3171234.jpg"></div><p>  Knitting continues until a circle of the desired size is obtained.  Further, additional finishing is done. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Square version of the stand made with a hook </h2><p>  Crocheting hot coasters with a description is an easy task.  Therefore, in addition to creating a round shape, you can try to make a square variation of the product.  The scheme of the hot stand in the form of a square hook implies the following description of the work: </p><ol><li>  You need to dial a chain of five loops, close in a circle. </li><li>  Knit four hoist air loops.  In the adjacent and each subsequent loop add three double crochets, 2 air loops.  At the end, knit 2 crochets in the same loop from which the rise was tied. </li><li>  The next row is knit in the same way, but the air chain is formed only on the turns.  The difference is the indent between the double crochet fans.  It needs to be done in every second air loop of the previous row. </li><li>  The same principle is applied in the manufacture of all subsequent rows. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="fifiacrocheta.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to crochet a hot stand" class="if uuid-3171237" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/3171237.jpg"></div><p>  Having tied a sufficient number of rows, finish the job.  In the process of creating a square, you should carefully monitor the smooth formation of diagonals. </p><h2>  Openwork cup stand </h2><p>  The openwork version of the device itself is a decorating element of the table.  You can create several collections corresponding to each season.  In winter, coasters in the form of snowflakes can be used, in summer - flowers, in autumn - drops, and in spring - leaves.  Naturally, the design of the hot stand under the hook in this interpretation will be difficult.  But the result will exceed expectations. </p><p>  How to crochet a hot stand in a romantic style: </p><ol><li>  Collect 6 air loops that lock into the ring. </li><li>  The next row should be knit with crochets.  It is worth increasing the number of loops.  In each loop, knit 2 columns. </li><li>  Next, knit air chains of five loops.  Fix with single crochet through each loop of the previous row. </li><li>  In the same way, knit all subsequent rows.  But you should increase the number of loops by one in the air chains. </li><li>  The last row can be knitted with crochet columns to create a frame for the openwork cloth. </li></ol><p>  You can use any scheme that knit openwork napkins to decorate the interior.  You can further decorate the product. </p><h2>  The principle of decorating the finished product </h2><p>  If the simplest scheme of the stand under the hot hook is selected, then decoration can improve the appearance of the product.  You can decorate the blank with any elements and materials.  It is important not to forget about the basic functionality of the device.  Therefore, do not use too voluminous elements. </p><p>  What decoration options can be used: </p><ul><li>  The actual option will be to make a stand in the form of a piece of fruit.  If you pre-knit a circle of threads of the desired color, then using elementary embroidery it is easy to make an ornament.  Thus, you can recreate a slice of lemon, orange, kiwi, watermelon. </li><li>  For children, an interesting option would be a stand-animal.  On the canvas you can embroider the face of the beast.  Additionally tie the ears and paws.  Original looks bunny, bear, cat, dog, squirrel. </li><li>  If you make more restrained options for coasters, then the edges can be sheathed with tape, cloth or lace.  Beads or beads are sewn along the circle.  If the version of the base is lace, then the holes can be twisted with tape. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="guide.alibaba.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="original stand decoration" class="if uuid-3171225" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/3171225.jpg"></div><p>  Decoration options can be very diverse in style and quantity of materials.  Used for such purposes improvised accessories: buttons, pins, zippers, locks, buttons. </p>
