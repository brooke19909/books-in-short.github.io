    <h2>  City street </h2><p>  All girls and boys with great pleasure play with cars.  Buses, motorbikes, small cars can become central elements of the game "City Street".  To make it, you will need a wide cardboard box, or rather, a cover from it, colored paper, glue, scissors, paints, plasticine.  In addition, you can use empty matchboxes and toys from Kinder Surprises.  Cover the bottom of the lid with gray paper.  It will be an imitation of asphalt.  With white paint, draw a <span>road marking</span> and a <span>pedestrian crossing</span> in the center.  From plasticine, blind the traffic light and install it before the "zebra".  Glue the matchboxes with light paper, and draw windows and doors on top.  So you make houses.  Place them on the edges of the box.  It remains to arrange cars and pedestrians.  Such a board developing game (DIY on the SDA), made with your own hands, will help children in practice fix the rules for crossing the street, the value of traffic signals. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Cardboard traffic light </h2><p>  For <span>outdoor games</span> on the theme of traffic, you often need a traffic light layout.  It is very simple to make from a cardboard cylinder from under the toilet paper.  For work, besides him, you need PVA glue, scissors, colored paper, cardboard, a wooden skewer, a matchbox, newspapers. </p><p>  How to make a <span>traffic light (DIY</span> on traffic rules) with their own hands from cardboard, we read in the description.  We bend the base from under the toilet paper in half, forming two corners.  Then we straighten the workpiece.  Again we bend it so that 2 more corners appear at equal distances.  Two squares are cut out of cardboard.  We glue them on top and bottom of the workpiece, closing the holes.  Emptiness in the form can be filled with newspapers.  So the traffic light will gain weight and become more stable.  Paste it with black or gray paper.  We also make out a matchbox.  We cut round details of red, yellow and green colors - traffic signals.  Glue them in the right places.  Using a wooden skewer we punch a hole in the lower part of the craft, paste the stick into it.  The other end of this part is fastened in the same way in a matchbox.  It will be a stand for traffic lights.  DIY on the SDA done. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY on school" class="if" height="354" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/381142.jpg?1398351486566" width="236"></div>

Even a child is able to make them with their own hands from improvised means.  For work, we prepare an unnecessary CD, white cardboard, gouache or watercolor paints, a wooden stick (for sushi or an ordinary dry twig from a tree), Moment glue. </p><p>  How to make crafts on traffic rules at school or at home in the form of road signs?  We learn about this from the instructions.  We put a disk on cardboard and circle it.  Cut a round part.  On it, draw a sketch of the sign with a pencil, and then paint it with paints.  By the way, this stage of work can be performed as an application.  Glue a wooden stick to the disk on a mirror surface.  We fix the cardboard blank on the opposite side.  That's all, the sign is ready.  It remains to stick it into the ground in the territory where the game will take place.  If this action is carried out indoors, then the sign should be installed on a stand made of a cardboard box (from under tea, medicines, etc.). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts on the topic of traffic rules photo" class="if" height="461" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/383041.jpg?1398557126820" width="444"></div>
