  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hong Kong Tourist Attractions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It often happens that in the guidebook about the sights a lot is said, but upon arrival it turns out to be a usual bait for tourists.  There are more than a dozen such lures in Hong Kong.  All of them were created and promoted by the Hong Kong government in the last twenty years, when he began to earn not only the image of the "financial center", but also the image of the "cultural center". </p><p>  1. <strong>Avenue of Stars</strong> (2004).  This is a pretty mediocre copy of the Hollywood Star Walk.  Here are all the same stars with the names and handprints of famous Hong Kong actors and directors.  The catch is that the average person knows none of them except Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee.  The stars themselves are small and nondescript, and it can be seen that they are made of inexpensive materials, because the paint on most of them has already faded.  They earn on tourists selling souvenirs and expensive food.  The only plus here is a great view of Victoria Bay. </p><p>  2. <noindex>  <span><strong>Big buddha</strong></span> </noindex>  (1993).  This is a giant Buddha statue at a centenary monastery.  Any tourist (non-Buddhist) will feel cheated when they get to Lantau Island, when they get to this statue by expensive cable car, climb up 200 or more steps and get ... nothing!  At the foot of the Buddha there is always a crowd of tourists who simply do not understand why they came there, because there is absolutely nothing to do there.  You can take advantage of the minus by going for a walk on the neighboring islands (but not in the neighboring village and monastery, because they are very commercialized). </p><p>  3. <noindex>  <span><strong>Victoria Peak</strong></span> </noindex>  .  This is a mountain with a magnificent view of the entire city center.  It would seem that there is no catch here.  But he is, and lies in the weather.  Hong Kong is located on the islands, so there is constantly increased humidity and fog.  That is, in most of the days of the year the city can be seen only through a veil of varying degrees of density.  And, of course, no stunning photographs (and they come here mainly after them) can be made.  Naturally, at Pike there is also a complete business set: an expensive restaurant, souvenir shops, a short lift on the ‚Äúhistorical‚Äù tram and a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãpeople. </p><p>  In addition to the above attractions, this list includes <strong>all the famous stores and markets</strong> : Stanley Market, Western Market and Night Market.  All of them are designed for tourists who do not know the real Hong Kong prices and are ready to buy things in three, four, or even ten times more expensive. </p><p>  In Hong Kong, one should be <strong>very critical of</strong> everything under the age of thirty, since it is very likely that it was built solely to attract tourists, and in fact does not bring them any benefit and has no value. </p></div></article>
