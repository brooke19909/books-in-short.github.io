    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Very conveniently located resort complex "Seaside-Galatea."  Kirillovka is a village in the Zaporozhye region, located on a picturesque peninsula.  On the right lies <span>Kosa Fedotova</span> and the Utlyuk estuary, on the left is the Peresyp, framing the Molochny estuary.  "Seaside-Galatea" is located approximately in the middle between them.  You can get by car along the Simferopol highway before turning to Akimovka (the deer‚Äôs monument serves as a guide), and then to the left of the village.  From Zaporozhye, Melitopol, Kharkov, Dnepropetrovsk there are regular bus services and minibuses.  In addition, during the season from many nearby cities go minibuses on request.  The ticket price is fixed.  From remote regions, you can take a train to one of the above cities, and then transfer to a minibus.  In Melitopol, they depart directly from the railway station without a schedule, that is, as the passenger compartment is full. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Galatea Seaside reviews" class="if" height="298" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/474015.jpg" width="357"></div>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  On the very shore of the endless blue sea is located the complex "Primorskaya-Galatea" (Kirillovka).  The photos provide comprehensive information about the beach, which is less than a minute to go.  The sand here is clean, the entrance to the water is shallow, the sea is warm and fairly clean.  The depth at the edge, as almost on the entire coast of Azov, is small, so for vacationers with children there is a real paradise.  Guests of the "Primorsky-Galatea" can use the sunbeds, umbrellas, a place under a canopy.  For entertainment, water slides are installed here, inflatable "bananas", "tablets", jet skis, parachutes are provided.  Since the sea is shallow, the water temperature here in early June reaches +20 ... + 22, and at peak season it rises to +26 ... + 28 degrees Celsius.  In shallow water, even higher, so the parents of the kids may not be afraid that their children will catch a cold.  But children can get sunburned, because there is practically no rain here in the summer, not a cloud in the sky, and the air temperature in the shade reaches +35 degrees Celsius. </p>

In addition, on the territory there is a whole kids club, "Winnie's Friend", where older children, under the supervision of educators, are engaged in drawing, modeling from plasticine, create applications, play, and very young people do what they like in the presence of dads and mothers.  But even that is not all.  There is a computer room in Primorskaya Galatea where "advanced" children play a wide variety of games. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Seaside Galatea photo" class="if" height="299" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/474016.jpg" width="359"></div>

    <h2>  <span>Recreation centers</span> in Kirillovka </h2><p>  Recently, Kirillovka has been developing quite actively.  Recreation centers here began to be built during the Soviet Union and continue to this day.  How many of them, it is not possible to calculate, since they are occupied here by every free piece of land.  Among them are inexpensive with minimal service and facilities.  Housing there is provided in small houses without amenities, such as in Ivushka, or in converted carriages and cabins.  But there are modern complexes built no earlier than 2000.  Base "Bosphorus" provides very comfortable cottages with rooms equipped with split-system, refrigerator, small kitchen, shower room with toilet.  The base ‚ÄúPeresyp‚Äù can also boast the same comfort.  Its infrastructure includes detached cottages with suites, junior suites, family rooms and apartments.  On the territory there is a cafe, a dining room, a swimming pool, playgrounds for children, a cinema hall, tennis and billiard tables, a first-aid post.  It is worth mentioning the ultramodern base "Albion", cottages in which (for one family) are all two-story, equipped according to European standards.  The territory is arranged so that if you wish you can relax in complete solitude.  For leisure there is a sports complex, comfortable gazebos with barbecue facilities and sockets for the Internet, playgrounds with children's attractions.  It is difficult to give a more detailed description of even several databases in one short article, but in Kirillovka you can have a wonderful rest. </p><h2>  Reviews about "Seaside-Galatea" </h2><p>  Everyone is always welcome in the resort complex "Galatea-Seaside."  The reviews of many people who have been vacationing there for several years are full of warm words addressed to the staff, who are trying to make the children feel good and the adults satisfied.  So, the doctor of the first-aid post is ready to help even in the middle of the night.  The animator is a lot of fun entertaining the kids who are drawn to him, like a native.  Vacationers like the beautiful green area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe resort.  The complaints are caused by the lack of <span>places for smoking,</span> insufficiently varied food, especially in the dining room for guests of economy class rooms, leaky showers (water falls on the floor) and the fact that there is no ‚Äúroom cleaning‚Äù service. </p>
