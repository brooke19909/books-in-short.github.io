The distance to the nearest airport, which is located in Larnaca, is about 45 minutes (the distance is ~ 55 kilometers). </p><p>  Protaras is widely known for its beautiful sandy beaches.  Also very close, 5 minutes by car, is the famous resort of Ayia Napa.  True, it is more suitable for families with children. </p><p>  The hotel itself is located on the first coastline.  Therefore, you can get to the sea in just one minute.  By the way, the beach here is sandy and shallow.  The bay in which it is located is protected by breakwaters.

It was built in 1987, but not so long ago, in 2013, a deep reconstruction was carried out.  So everything inside is very modern and new.  The apartments are also made in an interesting original style. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

As the guests assure, this is a good option for people who need a quiet vacation.  The place is calm, peaceful, in the evenings noisy.  On weekends, weddings are held in the chapel next door, which are often celebrated at the hotel.  However, even this does not cause discomfort.  In any case, those travelers who have already stayed here were satisfied with the impressions they received. </p><p>  In general, if you want to enjoy excellent service, all-inclusive service and the sea, you should go here. </p>
