To prevent unpleasant surprises from spoiling your vacation, check out negative comments in advance: </p><ul><li>  the buildings are quite old, and therefore in the rooms you can see cracked plaster and feel a stale smell; </li><li>  air conditioners work too noisy, which is especially felt at night; </li><li>  constant interruptions and interference with the satellite dish; </li><li>  if the windows of your room overlook one of the pools, then until late at night loud music will not let you fall asleep; </li><li>  even in cold weather, the water in the pools is not heated; </li><li>  old sunbeds both by the pool and on the beach; </li><li>  there are a lot of cigarette butts in the sand near the sea (but this is a claim, rather, not to the hotel, but to vacationers who bury the bulls instead of throwing them in the urn); </li><li>  in all rooms, except the ground floor, wireless Internet does not work well; </li><li>  photos of the hotel presented on the official website do not correspond to reality (in reality, everything is a little worn); </li><li>  sellers of jewelry and fur stores walk along the beach, who very intrusively invite tourists to their establishments. </li></ul><p>  Mirada Del Mar is a popular resort hotel with extensive experience and rich service traditions.  This institution, in most cases, is chosen for family vacations.  Both adults and children will be satisfied with entertainment and food. </p>
