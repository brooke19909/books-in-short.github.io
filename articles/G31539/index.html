The fame of the film actor extended far beyond America, and his fan club totaled more than one million fans.  Alas, today his name is remembered less and less, and the younger generation does not know anything about him.  Well, let's try to understand why this happened. </p>

    <h2>  Who is Chris Farley? </h2><p>  The full name of the actor is Christopher Crosby Farley.  He was born in Madison (Wisconsin) in February 1964.  His father was local businessman Tom Farley, and his mother was Mary Ann.  In addition to Chris, the family had three more children: Kevin, John and Barbara.  Interesting is the fact that all the children of the Farley family have connected their lives with art. </p><p>  As for Chris, his path to acting lay through Marquette University in Milwaukee.  It was there that in 1986 he received a theater education, having studied the specialty "Theater and Television Network". </p><p>  After graduation, Chris Farley got a job with his father at the company.  However, a passion for art made him look for ways leading to the stage.  Soon, he already begins to perform in the theater as part of the comic troupe Ark Improv.  He is later invited to another band called Second City Theater, and he agrees. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This decision becomes significant, as it is here that Chris Farley first meets with Lorne Michaels - producer of the famous TV show "Saturday Night Live".  A performance on the television show opened Chris Farley to the directors' eyes, thanks to which he soon received his first invitation to a movie role. </p>

    <h2>  Playing a movie </h2><p>  At the beginning of his television career, Chris focused only on roles in television shows.  Only occasionally did he appear in a big movie, and then he played secondary roles.  The breakthrough was 1995, when the comedy ‚ÄúTommy's Lump‚Äù appeared on the screen, where Farley became the main character. </p><p>  As for world fame, he got it thanks to the movie "The Beverly Hills Ninja."  Spectators fell in love with a cute puffer.  It seemed that now Farley would be fine, only the actor‚Äôs passion for drugs killed everything.  So, on December 18, 1997 he was found dead in his apartment.  The cause of death is an overdose of cocaine. </p><p>  What did Chris Farley leave behind?  <span>The filmography of the actor</span> has about 26 roles, most of which are comedic.  Also in 2005, he was assigned a star on the Walk of Fame, but only the actor himself will not see her. </p>
