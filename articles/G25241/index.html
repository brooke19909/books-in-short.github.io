    <h2>  A bit about October </h2><p>  Almost all primary school students dreamed of becoming October and, after joining this organization, proudly wore this title.  <span>The chest badge,</span> which is a five-pointed star, symbolized the baby's involvement in this movement, which is important for those times.  The October Revolution must necessarily adhere to certain rules of conduct: respect adults, study well and love school. </p><p>  What were the associations into which more adult youth entered, and what kind of symbolism are these - pioneer, Komsomol badges?  You can find out about this by reading the information below. </p><h2>  About youth associations of the USSR </h2><p>  After joining the Komsomol, representatives of this youth organization wore Komsomol badges, but younger schoolchildren had similar attributes.  An important step towards the formation of personality was the entry into the ranks of pioneers. </p><p>  A distinctive and important feature of the pioneers was a red tie and a special badge.  Of course, the image on it was different, depending on the release date, but there was always an image of a five-pointed red star with a portrait of young Lenin and the inscription ‚ÄúAlways ready!‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Badges are pioneer, Komsomol" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2161536.jpg"></div>

Most of the youth of the USSR joined the ranks of the Komsomol.  For many, the All-Union Leninist Communist Youth Union has become a real and unforgettable school of life. </p><p>  It was Komsomol members who worked at great construction sites, on the development of virgin lands and oil and gas deposits of Siberia, on the construction of the Baikal-Amur Railway, worked at factories and collective farms, and many others.  other </p><p>  This movement was under the supervision of the Communist <span>Party of the USSR.</span>  Komsomol badges had all the representatives of this organization.  Moreover, joining it was not so simple.  The Komsomol had its own rules and regulations aimed at the ideological education of young people.  In other words, the Komsomol organization brought up the future successors of the Communist Party.  Komsomol members had to fulfill the requirements of their mentors, to have high results in all areas: in labor, sports, military affairs, science, etc. </p><p>  At first, only workers had the right to join the Komsomol, but later on the organization began to grow throughout the country and began to accept high school students.  This was especially important for those who sought to connect their future life with the Communist Party. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Komsomol badges of the USSR" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2161509.jpg"></div>

The Komsomol did not have a specific flag, but each Komsomol organization necessarily had its own Red Banner.  There is even a Regulation on the Red Banners of organizations, approved in December 1984 by a Decree of the BCC Komsomol. </p><p>  One of the main symbols is the Komsomol ticket, the cover color of which symbolizes a particle of military scarlet banners or a reflection of the fire of the October Revolution.  The portrait of Lenin on it is a reminder of the fidelity of Komsomol members to the precepts of Vladimir Ilyich.  And popular posters containing slogans of fashion at that time can also be attributed to the symbolism of the Komsomol.  At that time, this was the most common way of agitation and propaganda. </p><h2>  Komsomol icon: photo, description </h2><p>  Soviet miniature in metal - badges.  They reflect the difficult and at the same time glorious history of the USSR. </p><p>  The first Komsomol badges looked a bit different than in the 1958s.  The metal symbol of 1922 had the form of a banner, with a red star inscribed in the center with the letters "KIM" (which means the <span>Communist International of</span> Youth).  Instead of the abbreviation "KIM" in 1945 appeared "Komsomol" (disintegrated KIM in 1943).  The design of the badge finally took shape already in 1958 - against the background of the red banner, besides the inscription ‚ÄúKomsomol‚Äù, a profile of V. I. Lenin appeared. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Komsomol icon: photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2161599.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The Komsomol badges were made of brass and aluminum with the application of red enamel.  They clung to clothes with a twist or pin.  Badges stood out for activists dedicated to various anniversaries, special events, rallies, etc. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Currently, Komsomol badges and other Soviet paraphernalia can be seen in large quantities in antique stores.  Today, everything that connects with the history of the development of Soviet power is in great price.  These are previously unknown paintings by artists of the USSR, a variety of dishes with communist slogans and abbreviations, posters, banners and pennants.  Prices for all this are sometimes off scale.  Even for the usual icons presented above, sometimes several thousand dollars are offered! </p>
