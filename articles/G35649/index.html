First of all, if we talk about the conditions, then almost every person is interested in two questions - this is the interest rate and down payment.  Today, the Bank of Moscow offers the following conditions for registration of a mortgage:

      <p></p>
    <p>  If the family is a member of the state support program, the interest rate will be 11.75%.  If potential borrowers are not participants in this program, then for them the interest rate will be set at 12%.  As for the down payment, it should be at least 15% if maternal capital is taken into account.  Well, if the family plans to take advantage of the classic mortgage terms, then they will have to pay 20% of the total.  It is worth noting that the <span>Bank of Moscow</span> offers mortgage products for a period of 5 to 30 years.  That's how convenient a mortgage is at the Bank of Moscow. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A calculator for calculating payments on the site is available.  This tool is easy to use and very convenient. </p><p>  It is also important that the exact amount of the down payment will be calculated from the smallest amount.  And in this case it does not play a role, this is the market price of housing or contractual. </p><p>  According to the established <span>rules for obtaining a mortgage,</span> it is necessary to provide not only the contractual cost of housing, but also the estimated value of the acquired area to the financial structure. </p><h2>  What requirements does the bank put forward to a potential borrower? </h2>

    <p>  This financial institution offers another profitable program for obtaining a mortgage in just two documents.  This method of obtaining a loan product is an excellent solution for those people who, by the nature of their activity, do not have free time to collect all the required documents.  It is worth noting that the design for this program provides an initial contribution of 40% of the total cost of purchased housing. </p><p>  This type of lending was called "Simple Mortgage at the Bank of Moscow."  We consider the conditions below. </p><h2>  Lending terms </h2><p>  If the client wants to use the ‚ÄúSimple Mortgage‚Äù program, then he will not be able to use maternity capital to make an initial payment.  Paying back a <span>loan with a cash</span> subsidy will also fail. </p><p>  To get a ‚ÄúSimple Mortgage‚Äù a person must be between 25 and 30 years old.  At the end of the loan agreement, a person's age may not exceed 65 years. </p><p>  When applying for such a loan, a person provides a financial institution with their passport, pension insurance certificate or any other document that can confirm their identity.  As a rule, an application from a potential borrower is reviewed by bank specialists within 24 hours. </p><p>  If a person decided to use this program, then the percentage on the loan will be higher by 0.5%. </p><h2>  Mortgage at the Bank of Moscow for payroll clients </h2>
