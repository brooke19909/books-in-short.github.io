    <p>  Yamantau is the highest mountain in Bashkortostan.  The mountain range is located on the territory of Bashkiria, its length is about five kilometers.  Its two highest points are the Bolshoi (1640 m) and Small Yamantau mountains (1510 m).  The top of the Greater Yamantau is completely flat and is a rocky plateau. </p><p>  From the Bashkir language, ‚ÄúYamantau‚Äù is translated as ‚Äúbad (evil)‚Äù.  Local residents called it so because the marshy mountainsides are unsuitable for use under pastures.  Moreover, this place was considered unsafe, since earlier it was often possible to meet bears there.  Those riding the slopes noticed that the horse subsequently inevitably died.  Bashkirs most often bypass these mountains. </p><h2>  Ancient legend about Yamantau </h2><p>  According to ancient legends, the hero Shulgan Khan, having corrected the customs of his ancestors, became the lord of the underworld, and he made the transition there through Yamantau.  Thus, the highest mountain in Bashkortostan served as a door to the dark world.  Not surprisingly, it was popularly known as the "devilish". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Modern fears </h2><p>  The sinister reputation of this massif was also supported by rumors that Yamantau had an increased background radiation because uranium deposits were found there.  However, scientists refute this information.  There is no evidence of the presence of mines in the bowels of Yamantau, and you can not be afraid of radiation, its level does not exceed normal indicators. </p><p>  In the 60s, it was decided to build a secret facility inside the mountain.  Various assumptions have been made, but so far no reliable information has been received about this.  The highest mountain in Bashkortostan is part of the South Ural Nature Reserve, and this entire territory is closed to visitors. </p><h2>  Another highest mountain in the Republic of Bashkortostan </h2>

    <p>  Mount Iremel (1582 m) is a mountain range and occupies the second highest place after Yamantau.  It is located in the north-eastern part of the Uchalinsky district and is part of a ridge called Ural-tau.  On the territory of this mountain range, such peaks as Maly (1464 m) and Bolshoi Iremel stand out.  The flat plateau at the top of Bolshoi Iremel is known as the Kabanchik, and Mount Zherebchik is located in the northwest of it.  Locals say that Big Iremel is the father, Small is his son, the Stallion and the Wild Boar are their pets. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The top of Iremel resembles a huge trapeze, the size of the site is about 1000 meters.  It is difficult to find a place where you can observe a similar panorama.  From this height, almost all the mountains of the Southern Urals are visible, including the highest mountain in Bashkortostan! </p><h2>  Sights of Mount Iremel </h2>

    <p>  Iremel ("holy" or "sacred mountain"), like Yamantau, is covered in legends and beliefs, and no less mysterious than her "elder brother."  A cross has been cut down on one of the ranges directly on the rock, but you can only see it from afar, and sunlight should fall on the surface of the rock at a certain angle.  On the slopes of the "holy mountain" found unusual signs carved on stones. </p><p>  Near the "holy mountain" among the swamps you can find a unique lake, in addition to medicinal mud, there are healing springs.  They say that even the most advanced form of asthma can be cured there.  In the future, it is planned to build a health center or sanatorium by the lake. </p><p>  At the base of the mountain range are the sources of five rivers, therefore Iremel is deservedly considered one of the largest water centers in Eurasia.  On these rivers - Big Avnyar, Tyulyuk, Sinyak, Tygyn, Karagay - you can reach the Caspian Sea and the Arctic Ocean, if you sail along the Volga-Don Canal, then the Black, as well as the Azov and Mediterranean Seas. </p><p>  At the foot of the ‚Äúsacred mountain‚Äù is the village of Tyulyuk, whose name means ‚Äúdesire‚Äù.  That is why they say that if you climb Mount Iremel, known as a "special" place, and bring something as a gift to the mountain spirits, you can get what you want. </p><h2>  Third highest peak </h2><p>  Now you know the name of the highest mountain of Bashkortostan and its "younger brother".  The third highest peak is the Big Shelom (1427 m), which is the southernmost and highest peak on the Zigalga ridge.  It is located in the South Ural Nature Reserve.  The peak got its name due to its resemblance to the hero‚Äôs shell (helmet).  One of the features of the Big Shelom - its peculiar outlines in clear weather are visible from different points of the South Ural mountains.  The top resembles a giant tent with stone slopes.  The ridge also has a Small, Third and Fourth Shelome. </p><h2>  How to climb the Big Shel </h2>

    <p>  Despite the fact that the mountain is part of the South Ural State Nature Reserve, recently an <span>ecological path</span> has been laid there <span>,</span> so you can freely go to the top, after paying and getting permission. </p><p>  Climbing these mountains is quite complicated and requires considerable patience and good physical preparation.  It is better to start the ascent from the village of Tyulyuk through Aleksandrovka or from the city of Katav-Ivanovsk right in the place where the narrow gauge railway used to be.  The slopes are covered with spruce, quartz sandstones begin above.  At the very top in the summer-autumn period you can find berries (lingonberries, blueberries) or mushrooms. </p><h2>  4th place </h2><p>  Masim (1040 m) - strictly speaking, not quite a mountain, rather just a hilly area.  The name comes from the name of Masem-bai or Masem-khan, the hero of the local epic, although it is possible that he was a real historical person.  Masim is located in the Burzyansky district near the Kapova cave. </p><p>  The mountain differs from other peaks not only in its characteristic shape, but also in that there are outlier rocks on its top - sections of high surfaces remaining after erosion, in other words - hills that have rounded peaks.  A metal ladder even leads to one of the outcrops - the Maiden‚Äôs Rock, locals leave coins, inexpensive jewelry on its top, tie colored rags to the branches of the mountain to dwarf mountain ash and birch branches. </p><p>  In the vicinity of Masima, birch, pine, oak, linden and even <span>Canadian maple</span> grow <span>,</span> as well as wild bees, which is why the Bashkir reserve was created in this area, which occupies a significant part of the Burzyansky district. </p><h2>  5th place </h2>

    <p>  Kuzguntash (987 m) is the highest point of the Irendyk ridge, located in the southeast of Bashkiria.  The length of the ridge is 135 km.
