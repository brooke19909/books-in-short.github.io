At the same time, there is a large selection of resorts.  So, you can go to any of the islands of the Greek archipelago, you can visit one of the coastal cities of mainland Greece, or you can buy a tour to a hotel, for example Calypso Hotel Siviri, which is located on the Halkidiki Peninsula - in one of the most heavenly places on the planet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="peninsula cassandra" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1587628.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The legendary ‚ÄúTrident‚Äù </h2><p>  In the northern Aegean, the land cuts into the azure expanses in a very interesting way.  If you look at it from above, you can see that this peninsula has the shape of a trident, exactly the same as that of the lord of the seas, god Poseidon.  In a word, Halkidiki consists of three long and narrow peninsulas with abundant vegetation: Sithonia, Agion Oros and Kassandra.  I would like to tell in more detail about the last of them. </p><h2>  Kassandra Peninsula: holiday features </h2><p>  This piece of sushi not only has a romantic name, but is truly a paradise.  It is located in the west and is the most densely populated of all three "fingers" of Halkidiki.  The tourist infrastructure is well developed here: traditional Greek taverns, clubs, bars, discos, souvenir stalls, boutiques, etc. There are many hotels of all categories: from chic five-star hotels, which, as a rule, belong to world hotel chains, to the most democratic dvushka ‚Äù, for example Calypso Hotel Siviri 2 * Standard.  Halkidiki as a whole is famous for its large number of historical sights, and the Kassandra peninsula is no exception, and some of them are located almost on the territory of hotels.  In a word, everyone who wants to combine a beach resort with an educational one will be able to enjoy the first and second equally.  In Kassandra, you can meet newlyweds, families with children, youth companies, and pensioners.  All this speaks of the universality of the peninsula as a seaside resort.  A pleasant, mild, very comfortable climate contributes to a pleasant stay.  The duration of the beach season lasts about 5 months - from May to the end of October. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Characteristics and Legends </h2><p>  The Kassandra Peninsula, as already noted, has the shape of an elongated finger, the length of which is 50 kilometers.  But in width it is quite narrow: only 15 km.  The highest point on the island is 355 m above sea level.  According to legend, in the past the peninsula was called Flegra, that is, ‚Äúburning land‚Äù, and its first inhabitants were the Giants - the sons of Uranus and Gaia.  It seems to many that Kassandra is a female name, but the peninsula got its name in honor of Tsar Kassandra - son-in-law of Alexander the Great.  They say that the first settlement on the peninsula was founded by the great Macedonian as early as the 4th century BC.  Life here was in full swing, the inhabitants were engaged in trade, a port acted on the shore. </p><h2>  Siviri </h2><p>  Today in Kassandra there are 44 settlements, each of which has its own special charm.  One of the best resorts not only in Kassandra, but throughout Greece is Siviri.  It is here that the aforementioned Calypso Hotel Siviri is located.  The resort can be called emerald.  It is completely immersed in the green of exotic plants and variegated flowers.  Closer to the water's aquamarine edge, the beach is strewn with golden sand.  The local landscape also includes picturesque mountains covered with a lush green carpet, as well as bizarre rock formations.  The village is distinguished by an abundance of taverns, restaurants and bars, which serve seafood skillfully prepared by local chefs, as well as bakeries, the fragrant aroma of which is mixed with the smell of olive and citrus plantations.  Especially lucky for those tourists who come to Greece during the Kassandra festival, which takes place in the famous Siviri amphitheater.  Having settled in Calypso Hotel Siviri 2 * (Greece, Halkidiki), they will be able to enjoy various interesting events on the festival‚Äôs agenda: theatrical performances, concerts, comic performances, which by the end of the day will be crowned with watching the unreal beauty of the sunsets. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reasonable prices" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1587615.jpg" width="600"></div>

At the same time, tourists can choose several food systems, up to ol ol inclusive.  And this is rare in hotels of this category.  Is everything so perfect in this hotel?  Some tourists complain in their calls that breakfasts are always the same, and they get tired of the monotony very quickly, while others, on the contrary, express their satisfaction.  The same goes for the cleaning issue.  Tourists write that it is extremely rare, but do not forget that this is an inexpensive hotel, and they chose it primarily because of the availability of prices. </p>
