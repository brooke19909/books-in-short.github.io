CCTV system: installation and maintenance</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you ask specialists what they mean by video surveillance, the answer will be approximately that it is a procedure that is carried out using optoelectronic devices designed for visual monitoring or automated image analysis.  And if you ask ordinary people who have encountered cameras in a bank or store, then the answer will be the option that this is part of the security of the facility.  Both definitions will be correct. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="video surveillance system installation" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22928/518347.jpg" width="465"></div></h2><h2>  Why is video surveillance necessary? </h2><p>  Each leader has his own motive for installing such a system.  Someone is watching customers and employees in the store, some are warehouse workers, and some are office workers to evaluate labor productivity.  CCTV is also used in private homes.  To control children, babysitting or pets.  But the main goal is to control the situation at the observed object around the clock or at random hours. </p><h2>  What is a CCTV system? </h2><p>  What is video surveillance, was described above, but there is also the second part of the term - "system".  What elements does it consist of? </p><h2>  DVR </h2><p>  This is the central part of the system.  Without it, installation of a video surveillance system is impossible.  Actuators and control devices, video cameras and security sensors are connected to it.  Recording is carried out on a hard disk of various sizes, depending on the model of the recorder.  The recording period is regulated by the volume of the hard disk and can be from 5 to 30 days.  Cameras can take pictures in three ways: around the clock, on a schedule, on the detection (presence) of movement.  The DVR can be connected to a local network or connected to the Internet to control it remotely. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At large facilities for storing and analyzing video information, it‚Äôs not registrars that use it, but special servers with their own software. </p>

    <h2>  Camcorders </h2><p>  Another important element of a video surveillance system is cameras.  Their design features are selected depending on the installation location and goals.  They come in color and black and white, outdoor and indoor, with IR illumination for night shooting and without. </p><h2>  The main groups of cameras </h2><p>  Surveillance cameras can be divided into the following groups: </p><ul><li>  <em>Modular and case</em> .  The first are a board with a lens.  They can be integrated into almost any interior item.  The second - stand-alone devices for surveillance indoors and outdoors (required to be placed in a thermo-jacket). </li><li>  <em>Analog and digital.</em>  <span>Analog cameras are</span> great for solving simple tasks (in a small store, office, home), when there are not so many controlled objects and there is no need for high picture detail.  Digital cameras are installed on more serious objects, have more functionality. </li><li>  <em>Street and interior</em> .  Outdoor cameras are protected by their body from various environmental influences.  Internal cameras do not require such protection and may have a more aesthetic design. </li><li>  <em>Stationary and controllable</em> .  A stationary camera only observes the area that it was originally aimed at when the installation was carried out.  A video surveillance system based on controlled cameras can change the viewing direction according to preset settings or through remote control, which increases the radius of the control zone. </li><li>  <em>Color and black and white</em> .  Black and white cameras attract the clarity of the picture.  Color cameras are more informative.  Recently, color cameras in terms of clarity equaled black and white.  And the latter have only one advantage - a lower price. </li><li>  <em>Wired and wireless.</em>  For wired cameras, the video signal is transmitted via cable.  Wireless cameras transmit through a radio signal. </li></ul><h2>  Source of power </h2><p>  Any electrical device requires power to function.  Elements of a video surveillance system are no exception.  For these purposes, it is better to use specially designed power supplies.  They come in direct and alternating current, various current strength and design.  They can be powered from the building‚Äôs power grid or can be autonomous.  The last factor allows even in the deep forest to make installation.  CCTV system is becoming more autonomous. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Shrouds.  Brackets </h2><p>  In order for the modular cameras to work in outdoor conditions, special protective devices have been developed - thermal housings.  They protect the device from overheating, freezing, excessive humidity, dust and other weather conditions, and from damage while installation is in progress.  The video surveillance system today received a different type of camera in which the lens and other electronic filling are initially installed in a specially protected case.  Brackets are used for mounting cameras on various surfaces: walls, poles, roofs, visors. </p>

    <h2>  Monitors </h2><p>  The full cycle of video surveillance includes not only a record of what is happening, but also the possibility of observing events on the air.  To make this possible, a monitor is connected to the DVR.  Since the operation of the video surveillance system must be uninterrupted, professional devices are required to display live pictures.  They are able to work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and do not spoil the vision of the operators sitting behind them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Cable </h2><p>  To connect the cameras to the DVR, use a <span>coaxial cable</span> or twisted pair when installation is in progress.  A video surveillance system, built for large distances (over 50 m), in order to transmit high-quality images, additionally requires the installation of signal amplifiers, which can be active and passive. </p><h2>  Lightning Protection Devices </h2><p>  Since wires laid outside attract lightning and <span>static electricity,</span> protective devices are required. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  If the plans do not include the installation of a video surveillance system with your own hands, then you will need to develop a project.  And for this, it is necessary to participate in the process of a specialist with architectural and engineering capabilities and for some time.  He needs to consider all kinds of security threats and customer desires, as well as regulatory requirements.  A well-defined terms of reference will greatly facilitate the work of a design engineer. </p><h2>  Installation and installation of video surveillance systems </h2>

    <p>  You can try the installation yourself.  Do-it <span>-yourself</span> installation <span>of a video surveillance system</span> is possible.  Moreover, many sellers offer ready-made kits.  You only need to determine the number and type of cameras, calculate the cable footage, the number of connectors for connecting cameras.  Then the installation itself is carried out.  The video surveillance system will not require special knowledge during installation, especially since manufacturers attach detailed instructions to most cameras.  A cable for the video signal to the recorder is drawn from each camera, and a cable from the <span>power supply is</span> laid to each camera <span>.</span>  <span>Cables</span> can be laid in the cable channel, can be laid in the plinth, under the ceiling or in any other convenient way.  After the cables are laid, and the cameras are connected to the recorder and powered up, the system is launched and adjusted. </p><p>  However, if you approach the issue of installing a video surveillance system more seriously, it would be more correct to contact a specialized company.  As a rule, such organizations have specialists with extensive practical experience in the design, installation, commissioning and subsequent maintenance of such systems.  It is enough to conclude a contract for the installation of a video surveillance system. </p><p>  Installation is made after the client has approved all the characteristics of the future system: which cameras and how many, which information processing and display devices, how long the information should be stored, what options the customer prefers to control the video surveillance system. </p>

    <p>  When the system is installed, <span>commissioning is carried out.</span>  Each camera is configured based on the wishes of the customer and technical conditions.  The readiness of the system for operation is confirmed by a signed act of work performed. </p><p>  As an additional service, organizations specializing in the installation of video surveillance systems offer their subsequent maintenance.  Moreover, the best option is the one when the installation and maintenance is carried out by the same organization. </p><p>  The cost of installing the system can be extremely different and depends on many factors: the number of cameras and their characteristics, the DVR or server, the distance of the cameras from the registrar, the location of the cameras (rooms, street), etc. An estimate for the installation of a video surveillance system is provided by any organization involved in the installation where all the above factors affecting the cost of installation will be indicated.  Accounting may have questions about how to write off money for this work. </p><h2>  Installation of a video surveillance system, KOSGU </h2><p>  Accountants who have to transfer money for work performed should pay for installation services under sub-article 226 of KOSGU, and for delivered equipment - under sub-article 310 of KOSGU. </p><p>  Those who want to start their own business and start installing video surveillance systems should know the OKVED code - ‚ÄúInstalling a video surveillance system‚Äù - 45.31.  There is one more code to consider.  OKPD - ‚ÄúInstallation of a video surveillance system‚Äù - 32.30.91.  However, in this business without work experience and special education, working is not just difficult, but very difficult.  And if there is no such experience, it is better to hire specialists, which, of course, is a bit costly. </p>

    <p>  The first customers are among acquaintances, through advertising in newspapers and on bulletin boards on the Internet.  Posting ads in the city will also not hurt, as well as visiting shops, offices for the proposal of their services.  Do-it-yourself installation of a video surveillance system will help until the staff and luggage of private clients are formed.  Then you can try to enter the market of corporate clients, where both the volume of work and profitability are much higher.  The profitability of this business can be higher than one hundred percent. </p>
