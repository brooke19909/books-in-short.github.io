Its northern part is occupied by a plain, and the southern part by the foothills and mountains of the Greater Caucasus.  Almost half of the republic's territory (40%) is occupied by forests in which beeches, oaks, maples, and also a noble hornbeam grow.  The climate here is moderately warm, in summer - up to +28, and in winter - up to -2 degrees.  Separately, it should be said about the thermal springs of Adygea.  Visiting them is not only an interesting and informative adventure, but also a way to improve your health. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Adygea thermal springs" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12024/641004.jpg" width="495"></div>

    <h2>  The healing resources of Adygea </h2><p>  Whatever season you choose, the weather will definitely please you.  There is never sweltering heat or burning frost, clear weather is almost always preserved, and winter pleases with an abundance of snow.  These climatic features, together with clean, mountain air, watered with coniferous tree volcanoes, turn the area into a natural inhaler where everyone can regain strength and stock up on health.  <span>The thermal springs of Adygea</span> are located in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe village of Tula.  There are a large number of them, officially called 14, but there are also ‚Äúwild ones‚Äù who simply hit from the ground and are not equipped at all.  Their visit may not be very convenient, but absolutely free. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Adygea thermal springs" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/640924.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Origin, or Where did the Adygea thermal springs come from? </h2><p>  It dates back to the times of the USSR.  It was then that geologists conducted exploration in the foothills of the Caucasus.  During drilling, aquifers with hot water (about 100 degrees) were opened.  Since this was not at all the ultimate goal of exploration, the wells were mothballed, and then they were completely forgotten.  Time passed, and the wells that were left without care began to flow.  Locals, having discovered the hot spring, equipped it with a simple ‚Äúbathhouse‚Äù.  But soon people with an entrepreneurial spirit became interested in the composition of the water.  The analysis showed that it is not only not harmful, but also beneficial to human health.  Wells began to be bought up, and around them to build recreation centers and sanatoriums.  The thermal springs of Adygea began to gain popularity among citizens of Russia and neighboring countries. </p><h2>  Which season is better to choose </h2><p>  It is good at any time of the year, but if you want to give yourself a fairy tale, then choose the winter months.  There is a fluffy snowball, the temperature is slightly below zero, and in the pool +40.  Steam rises from the water, creating the effect of a sauna.  You can get out and dive into a snowdrift, as well as play snowballs, and then again into the water.  In addition, the opportunity to ski and snowboard.  It turns out that all the best that is in summer and winter holidays is combined here.  By the way, the summer here is long.  In mid-October it is still very warm here, you can swim and sunbathe under the bright sun. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Adygea thermal springs white nights" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/640926.jpg" width="600"></div>

Surprisingly easy, the Caucasian thermal springs relieve stress and strain, so after a hard week postpone your trip to the restaurant and come here.  This weekend will quickly bring you back to life. </p><p>  We owe all of this to the hydrocarbonate-chloride-sodium composition and the increased content of <span>silicic acid.</span>  This is an amazing combination: it turns out the taste of spring, the purity of thawed and bactericidal properties of silver water.  It dissolves toxins and salt deposits, helps to remove sand from the liver and kidneys, urinary and gall bladder.  Finally, it perfectly strengthens the immune system. </p><p>  It turns out that indications for external use can be diseases of the cardiovascular, nervous, digestive, female genital, respiratory systems.

    <h2>  <span>Recreation facilities:</span> where to go to rest </h2><p>  Many travel agencies offer trips to thermal springs.  Adygea, whose base grows like mushrooms after rain, attracts tourists with the possibility of a budget holiday, which also improves their health.  They all offer different conditions, the first option is the ability to rent a house and spend a weekend or vacation here.  It is quite expensive, about 6000 per day.  If you arrived for one day, then there is no need to rent a house, guest pavilions have been created for this.  In them you can warm up, dry, sit at the table and dine quietly.  Such a pleasure is much cheaper. </p><h2>  Hot springs of the Mostovsky district </h2><p>  The first base, which is widely known, is Aqua-Vita.  There are two swimming pools, for adults and children, massage showers.  The territory is well equipped, there are gazebos, barbecue facilities, heated pavilions, separate, for a small company, and common.  Prices here vary significantly depending on the days of the week.  On weekdays you pay 500 per person for admission, on weekends - 800, and on holidays - 1200 rubles.  In addition, you pay 2000 rub for staying in the warm pavilion.  at the table.  Almost the same conditions apply at the neighboring Anastasia base.  Only pricing is more loyal.  The cost of 800 rubles does not change on holidays and weekends, and additional payment is not required for visiting the warm pavilion. </p><p>  Against their background, the Khutorok base is significantly different.  Accurate territory, the ability to rent a room or book a table in the common room, from the territory of which you can swim to the pool via the canal.  There is a tavern on the base.  The cost is very pleasing: 430 rubles per adult, and 230 per child.  Minus - a large number of vacationers, in the common room places are sorely lacking. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thermal springs of Adygea posulsky" class="if" height="430" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/640929.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  We go to the thermal springs (Adygea, Tula village) </h2><p>  This base was opened in 2009, and immediately fell in love with local residents.  It is very cozy here.  Unlike numerous bases, the basis of which is a swimming pool and a heated pavilion, there are 4 houses with 16 rooms, which accommodate 2 tourists.  Perhaps sharing another one or two at the request of vacationers.  All rooms are equipped with furniture and household appliances.  So, if you decide to visit the thermal springs (Adygea) with comfort, White Nights is exactly what you need.  You can come for a few days, while keeping in mind that working days are cheaper, 2000 rubles per person.  Weekends and holidays - 2800 and 3000 respectively.  This is the cost for a good rest with hot three meals a day.  There is the possibility of a one-time visit (from 12:00 to 22:00) - 250 rubles on weekdays and 300 on weekends. </p><p>  Often the guides, calling the address, say: "Flower Village (Adygea)."  The thermal spring can really be attributed to the territory of both settlements, since they are located nearby.  These are the villages of Tula and Flower.  If the first is famous for its comfortable recreation center, then the second tourists also do not deprive them of their attention.  The Institute of Floriculture and Subtropical Crops is located here, and the most interesting is a visit to real <span>tea plantations.</span>  Nearby is the Tea Museum and a tasting room.  It seems that it was because of this that the name of the village appeared - Floral (Adygea).  There are also thermal springs on its territory, a ticket to them can be obtained at any of the local travel agencies. </p>

    <h2>  Wild thermal springs </h2><p>  There are many of them in Adygea.  In particular, there are such between the villages of Red Dagestan and Nizhny Novgorod.  Hot water runs from the top of the damaged well and enters a shallow ditch, where it cools to about 40 degrees.  The depth of the natural puddle is about half a meter, the bottom is covered with silt, and the entire well is covered with a thick coating of minerals.  Swimming here is a dubious pleasure; in addition to rare tourists, cows come to the bathhouse.  Take a shower and nowhere to change clothes.  A little higher there is another outlet for a little warm mineral water, which is beautifully lined with stones. </p>
