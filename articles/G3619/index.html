We are more accustomed to call this flower hibiscus.  Small, fragile, delicate - it attracts most gardeners. </p><p>  Hibiscus blooms most often on the street, and it pleases the eye for only a month.  Skilled needlewomen offer to weave their hibiscus from beads, which will decorate the house all year round with its delicate, delicate petals. </p><p>  We present to your attention a master class ‚ÄúHibiscus from beads‚Äù, try to create a magnificent flower in a pot with your own hands. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dengarden.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Red hibiscus" class="if uuid-3093155" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/3093155.jpg"></div><h2>  Material </h2><p>  To create this craft you will need: </p><ul><li>  100 g of red beads; </li><li>  80 g of green beads; </li><li>  10 g of yellow beads; </li><li>  wire 0.8 mm; </li><li>  0.4 mm wire; </li><li>  wire 0.3 mm; </li><li>  green floss thread or satin ribbon; </li><li>  pot; </li><li>  gypsum. </li></ul><p>  In addition, select various decorative elements for the composition.  It can be artificial grass, sisal.  On gypsum, paint, including watercolor, is excellent.  You can also decorate the composition with stones and other decorative elements made by yourself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Delicate flowers" class="if uuid-3093170" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/3093170.jpg"></div><h2>  Flower weave </h2><p>  Let's start making hibiscus from beads.  We will begin the master class with weaving a flower and exploring one of the beadwork techniques. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This technique has several names, but the most common are weaving around the axis and circular.  We will tell you step by step how to weave a petal for a flower.  To do this, measure a piece of wire with a thickness of 0.4 mm, a length of about 1 m. Step away from the edge of the piece about 10 cm, fold the wire in half and twist the ends together several times, leaving a small loop. </p><p>  Then, on the axis, that is, the short end of the wire, type 11 red beads, on the other end - a few more, so that when the wire is folded along the axis, it protrudes somewhat.  Wrap the long end around the axis once and again pick up the beads, again a few more beads.  Do the same from the other end, so you get a circle.  Make 4 full turns around the axis, so throwing a wire. </p><p>  Next, weave the cloves to the petals.  To do this, we will extend the wire under the upper arc, leaving room for 11 beads to the axis.  Let's go back, having collected the beads, we will do the same on the other side.  Repeat the action, but not reaching the end of 5 beads. </p><p>  The petal is ready. </p><p>  For a flower of such 5 pieces are necessary.  To create a beautiful, magnificent bouquet, weave the right amount. </p><p>  To make the whole composition look real, make several petals without cloves, twist them into a tube - this way you will get small, unopened buds. </p><p>  In exactly the same way, weave for the flower and leaves, making the axis a little longer, about 10-15 beads.  Leaves are best made in different sizes.  For each flower you need at least 3-5 of these. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beautiful composition" class="if uuid-3093171" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/3093171.jpg"></div><h2>  Stamens </h2><p>  Now let's take the stamens, they are bright for hibiscus, so we will take a little yellow and red.  We measure a length of 0.3 mm wire about 30 cm. We will collect 25 red beads on it, step back from the edge about 10 cm. We will make a loop of 5 beads by simply twisting the two ends together about 1 cm in length.  Having departed a little from weaving, the same should be done with the next five beads and with the next.  Twist all 25 beads in this way, getting 5 red loops. </p><p>  Fold the two ends together and type 5 red beads on them.  Spread the ends to the sides and on the long one dial 20 yellow beads.  Make 4 more loops in the same way as the red ones.  Reconnect the ends and type 2 red.  Then make another 3-4 loops.  In total, three rows of yellow stamens are needed. </p><p>  At the end, re-wire the wire again to the sides and on each end dial 20 red beads.  Twist them so that the flagellum turns out.  Twist the ends of the wire together so that the structure does not open. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pink hibiscus" class="if uuid-3093168" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/3093168.jpg"></div><h2>  Flower picking </h2><p>  Now let's assemble the hibiscus from beads.  To do this, we put together 5 flower petals together, put weaving with a stamen in the center, twist the wire together, laying a thick wire for the stability of the flower, and neatly straighten the petals.  Take a floss thread or satin ribbon.  From the very beginning of weaving, we begin to wind up the wire.  Having fallen by 3-3.5 cm, we apply several leaves to the weaving, twist them with wire and continue wrapping them. </p><p>  Dilute the gypsum in the pot according to the instructions, put the flower inside, fix it with improvised means so that the hibiscus from the beads does not fall, while solidifying in an unpretentious position. </p><p>  When the product dries, decorate the white gypsum and place it in a conspicuous place.  We are sure that bead hibiscus flowers will attract the attention of your guests. </p>
