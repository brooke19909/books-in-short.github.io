This article discusses such a method of investing money as the contribution of an individual. </p><h2>  Contribution - a way to increase money </h2><p>  <span>Bank deposits,</span> and in particular deposits, are a reliable source of income for individuals.  If a person has money, and he keeps it ‚Äúunder his pillow‚Äù, then every year the purchasing power of the available amount will decrease.  This is due to the inevitable annual inflation process.  Every year, prices for goods and services rise, and the amount of money stored at home remains at the same level. </p><p>  To prevent the ‚Äúburning‚Äù of cash by inflation is one of the ways to increase it.  For example, the owner of free cash or non-cash means of payment can invest them in construction, business and other industries.  However, each investment entails certain risks.  If an inexperienced person is going to invest, then the risk of suffering from the hands of scammers and making a deal with an unsuccessful project increases several times.  But what about a population whose knowledge of financial markets is not so deep? </p>

    <p>  A great choice is a bank deposit.  Income from deposits, as a rule, is up to 10% per annum, it covers the annual inflation rate.  However, a bank deposit, the amount of which is not more than 1,400,000 rubles, is insured by the state, so that the depositor does not risk losing his invested money.  In the event of a crisis or bankruptcy announcement, a client with an open deposit of up to 1,400,000 rubles will be guaranteed to return the money invested. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Basic parameters of bank deposits </h2><p>  When choosing the optimal product, as well as the bank itself, the client should take into account the following conditions for the deposit: </p><ul><li>  deposit rate and term; </li><li>  deposit currency; </li><li>  the possibility of depositing additional funds to the account; </li><li>  early withdrawal of money and closing of the deposit; </li><li>  availability of interest capitalization; </li><li>  way of registration. </li></ul><p>  The interest rate indicates the income of the client and is expressed as a percentage for the year.  As a rule, banks prefer to make deposits for long periods, so the interest rate increases depending on the term of the deposit.  However, if the depositor for some reason closes the deposit ahead of schedule, then in such a situation the rate under the contract changes to the base one, which is several times less than the originally established one. </p><p>  The deposit period is of two types: unlimited and urgent.  An unlimited deposit provides for the possibility of replenishment of funds, and in most cases it is allowed to withdraw money from the account without reducing the interest rate, which, as a rule, is lower than for term deposits.  A fixed-term deposit involves investing money for a specific period at a higher interest rate. </p><p>  The deposit can be made in rubles, dollars, euros and other currencies. </p><p>  If it is possible to regularly <span>replenish the deposit, you</span> should choose a product for which the addition of funds to the account is permissible. </p><p>  If the financial position of the depositor is sometimes unstable and depends on external factors, then perhaps you should choose a product that provides for early withdrawal of money. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Capitalization is the addition of interest accrued over a specific period to the deposit amount for a subsequent increase and is an important parameter of any deposit. </p><p>  Making a deposit is possible with a personal visit to any of the bank branches with the necessary documents or remotely.  An example of remote registration is the <span>VTB</span> Seasonal Deposit <span>24.</span> Customer <span>reviews</span> indicate that there are no problems with remote deposit processing via the Internet. </p><h2>  Why exactly the bank? </h2><p>  Today, for individuals with free money, there are many financial instruments available to increase money.  For example, investing, purchasing securities, buying and selling foreign currency, investing in credit institutions and banks. </p><p>  As already mentioned, a bank deposit is the safest way to save money, as well as increase them in quantity. </p><p>  In financial markets, inexperienced users are more likely to stumble upon fraudsters in a particular industry.  Successful work with securities and currency requires knowledge, and better - experience and practice. </p>
