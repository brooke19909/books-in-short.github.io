Here you can enjoy plenty of fun, wander through the forest and even search for ripe berries.  Also here come fishermen who miss pleasant fishing. </p><h2>  Description of the lake </h2><p>  But where is Linevo located?  <span>Lake (Omsk region)</span> is located near Lake Danilovo.  Near the reservoir flows the Tara River.  Although the lake is small, only 530 by 320 meters, on its banks it has sheltered a parking lot for tourists.  The transparency of the water reaches 2.5 meters, and the greatest depth is 11 meters.  Around the cozy pool is a noble pine forest, in which there are berries and mushrooms. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Linevo Lake Omsk Region" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1080738.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Among the locals there are legends that the lake has healing properties. </p><h2>  Surrounding area </h2><p>  Not far from the reservoir stands the village of Okunevo.  Local residents are sure that Linevo is a lake (Omsk region), formed from a fragment of a fallen meteorite many centuries ago.  Be that as it may, it enters the system of "five lakes" located fairly close to each other.  The first two ponds - Danilovo and Linevo - among the vacationers are the most popular.  The other three are known under the names <span>Shaitan Lake, Shchuchye</span> (but among the inhabitants it may be called Urmanno or Indovo), Potenoye.  The latter implies that it is lost in the outback among the swamps. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lake linevo omsk region reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1080742.jpg" width="600"></div>

Although if you decide to go to Potennoye, remain extremely vigilant, because you can get into the swamp, and few have managed to find a path to it. </p><h2>  Rest on the lake </h2><p>  In the summer season, vacationers "crowds" gather on the lake Linevo (Omsk region).  A photo of the reservoir shows why people are drawn to this picturesque land.  But here it becomes especially noisy on weekends, so if you want to relax in silence, it is better to come to the pond on a weekday or early fall. </p><p>  In the immediate vicinity of the lake there are several tourist camps and parking areas, artificially sandy beaches depart from them.  Usually camp sites are equipped with small houses with essentials.  This is a table, chair, beds, refrigerator, dishes, stove for cooking and sockets.  Also at the tourist camps there are stationary tents.  In addition, there are places for setting up your own tents on the territory.  Nearby there are cafes where you can eat. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lake linevo omsk region rest" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1080741.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  At the bases you can spend your leisure time interestingly.  There are Russian baths, sports equipment, catamarans, boats.  In the evening, discos are organized, and excursions are organized in the morning.  If vacationers come in their own transport, it can be left in the free parking lot.  But it is important that such parking spaces are not guarded. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Fishing on the lake </h2><p>  Many fishermen, thanks to good catches, fell in love with Linevo.  The lake (Omsk region) is rich in perch, pike, chebak and tench.  In rare cases, carp can get on the net.  If caught by a worm, the catch will consist of perch.  The rest of the underwater animals does not respond to it.  Chebak pecks on plant bait.  In order to catch a tench, he needs to make a ‚Äúsandwich‚Äù from corn dough or pearl barley.  To catch a pike, use a spinner, or, as usual, on live bait.  You can cast fishing rods from moorings or sail by boat.  To go to the shore, you need to cross any <span>recreation center.</span> </p>

    <p>  There is a kiosk nearby.  On sale drinks for children and adults.  Prices are higher than in the city.  Also at the bases you can buy firewood. </p><h2>  Ecological state </h2><p>  More recently, this area has suffered from pollution.  Therefore, the leadership of the region decided to protect Lake Linevo (Omsk region).  The year 2014 was marked by the fact that this pond became a nature reserve.  From this moment the territory is under constant protection, therefore, vacationers are obliged not to harm nature, observing the norms of behavior, and to clean up the waste.  A year later, the environment improved significantly, and environmentalists breathed a sigh of relief.  Gradually, the reserve plans to strengthen environmental protection.  Therefore, vacationers can make bonfires only in designated areas.  In addition, if vacationers enter the territory of the wildlife sanctuary by car, but do not leave it in the parking lot, violators will face a significant fine (at least 4,000 rubles). </p>
