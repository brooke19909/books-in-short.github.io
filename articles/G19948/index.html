Their role in this area is very difficult to overestimate.  The products of this company have always been famous for their high quality and innovation.  Of particular note is the lineup called HD.  The top models of this series (even the frankly weak HD 700) are the best modern headphones.  This article is dedicated to one of the most interesting specimens in the HD line.  Today we‚Äôll talk about the Sennheiser HD 800. Want to know what is special about this device?  Then this article is for you. </p><h2>  Sennheiser HD 800 review </h2><p>  The HD 800 was presented at CES back in 2009.  Even then, with their value, they produced a real resonance.  If now top models cost about $ 1,000, then the price of $ 1,500 seemed incredibly high.  Nevertheless, the cost was fully justified.  First of all, the price was determined by investments in the development of the model.  When creating the HD 800 Sennheiser involved the best specialists and modern technology.  A lot of research work was carried out in order to bring the device to perfection.  What can we say about the real manual assembly, which was carried out in Germany. </p>

    <p>  Sennheiser put a lot of effort into creating the HD 800. But what is remarkable about this device?  What is special about the Sennheiser HD 800?  You can find answers to these and many other questions in this article. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Design </h2><p>  The appearance of the device can be safely called an icon in the world of headphone manufacturing.  Unique futuristic design mesmerizes and attracts.  When creating the HD 800, in order to give the headphones a more modern look, they refused to use wood, leather and other materials that are associated with middle-class devices.  Experts used high-quality plastic mainly silver and black. </p>

    <p>  The body of the device is made of special plastic called Leona.  It was developed by a separate chemical division of Asahi Kasei.  Plastic was reinforced with special fiberglass.  This, in turn, allowed us to create a strong and at the same time lightweight construction that does not contain unnecessary parts.  The inside of the speaker is protected by two layers of material: the first is a washing protection that protects the device from grease, dirt, and the second protects from hair and dust.  Outside, the emitters are covered with a thin, but rather strong metal mesh.  It not only gives the gadget a fashionable look, but also promotes the free movement of air, which, in turn, positively affects the sound.  A cable for the Sennheiser HD 800 comes standard.  Its length is about 3 meters. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A little confused by the presence of plastic in the guides of the headband.  For such a price it was possible to use more expensive material.  Nevertheless, there are no mass complaints about breakdowns of this unit. </p><h2>  Ergonomics </h2><p>  Sennheiser HD 800 Silver open dynamic stereo headphones are very convenient, comfortable.  The headband cushions and ear pads are made of velvety, soft material that does not collect dirt, pet hair and other small debris.  The sizes of the cups and ear pads allow you to easily cover your ear.  And with the correct adjustment of the headband, a clear fixation of the device on the head is ensured.  The weight of the device is quite small.  Fatigue is not felt even after prolonged and continuous operation.  Build Sennheiser HD 800, as always, at the highest level.  No backlashes or creaks were noticed. </p>

    <p>  However, since the Sennheiser HD 800 is an open earphone, the sound insulation is quite low.  Therefore, you can use them only in a quiet home stop.  If you still risk taking them outside with you, be prepared for the fact that others will hear your music, and you, in turn, will not be able to concentrate on the composition due to extraneous sounds. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Various measurements carried out by enthusiasts around the world showed that Sennheiser was able to create the best dynamic headphones in terms of characteristics.  First of all, the linearity, which can be traced both at low and at high frequencies, is pleasing.  The sound is very even, clear.  This result was achieved due to the non-standard arrangement of the emitters and the open acoustic design.  Initially, many experts doubted the feasibility of such a solution.  However, the results obtained have stuck in the belt of all skeptics.  You can immediately see that the guys from Sennheiser have done a good job on the new headphones. </p><p>  <span>Low frequencies</span> reproduce perfectly without any loss or subsidence.  Mid and high frequencies are incredibly smooth and at the same time deep.  Sennheiser HD 800 has a rather low harmonic distortion (especially against the background of competitors).  Resonances can be controlled at any frequency.  In general, we can say that the Sennheiser HD 800 is the dream of any music lover. </p>

    <p>  However, there were some minuses.  The main problem of the HD 800 is the selection of an amplifier.  <span>The Sennheiser</span> HD 800 <span>headphones are</span> pretty demanding.  Therefore, finding an amplifier that fits well with this model is not an easy task.  Quite decent sound is provided by the Chinese clone Violectric, manufactured by Accurate Radio.  Although certainly not the best option for the Sennheiser HD 800. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  The sound in the HD 800 is pretty neutral.  Headphones do not dissect songs to individual sounds.  However, with the Sennheiser HD 800 you can hear more nuances in the music.  The integrity and presentation of the composition does not suffer. </p><p>  The bass in this model is very deep and at the same time well controlled.  Thanks to the device, you can hear every note that immerses you in an incredible concert atmosphere.  The bass reproduction is incredibly good.  Listening to live recordings, you simply disappear into the sounds of the bass. </p>

    <p>  Mid frequencies are also reproduced at a decent level.  Attention worthy of the amazing separation of plans and resolution of the device.  Tools are very clearly positioned.  Closing your eyes, you can even clearly imagine how they are located on the stage.  In addition, the headphones perfectly convey all the style nuances of the artist, especially his vocals. </p><p>  High frequencies simply can not but rejoice.  The sound is very saturated.  Amazing resolution, level of detail and length.  However, the reproduction of frequencies is largely dependent on the amplifier.  Therefore, if the amplifier does not have enough power to unleash the potential, then the sound will be prone to sibilants, too bright. </p><h2>  Compatibility </h2>

    <p>  In terms of style, the headphones are pretty versatile.  They delightfully reproduce music of various genres.  Vocals, instruments rich in timbre, live recordings, and classical music are far from the entire list of those styles of music in which the HD 800 fully reveals its potential.  With all this, the brainchild of Sennheiser is so much immersed in the melody that the feeling of using headphones completely disappears.  Like other flagships, Sennheiser HD 800 Silver stereo headphones are very critical to the quality of the audio file.  Therefore, your collection of music will probably have to be reviewed. </p><h2>  Sennheiser HD 800: reviews </h2><p>  Nobody will talk about all the advantages and disadvantages of a device like its owner.  Sennheiser HD 800 customer reviews are extremely positive.  Headphones are praised for their stylish and modern design, high quality reproduced music, ergonomics, convenience during use, etc.  Many users also noticed high build quality.  Headphones do not creak even after prolonged use. </p><p>  Among the shortcomings, one can only notice the cost of the Sennheiser HD 800. Although the price has fallen a little, for many $ 1,200 this is an unbearable amount.  Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the price is fully consistent with the quality.  Also a minus is the low indicator of versatility.  Since the Sennheiser HD 800 is an open-type headphone, they can only be used at home.  Indeed, when operating in crowded places, extraneous noise will simply block the reproduced composition. </p><h2>  Total </h2>

If you want to purchase a more versatile device for listening to music, then it is better to turn your attention to other models. </p>
