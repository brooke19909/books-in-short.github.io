  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ammonium acetate. Obtaining laboratory and industrial methods. Application</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The chemical compound NH4C2H3O2 is known in wide circles as ammonium acetate.  In appearance, this crystalline substance is transparent or white.  The product for its preparation is <span>acetic acid.</span>  Ammonium acetate is obtained by reacting an acid with ammonia.  Being a substance readily available and relatively cheap, this compound is used as a food supplement (E264) or as a preservative. <br>  Among the physical properties of hygroscopicity.  It is it that ammonium acetate has.  Obtaining this substance in the laboratory is possible in several ways.  You can carry out the reaction of concentrated (glacial) acetic acid and <span>ammonium</span> carbonate <span>(ammonium</span> carbonate).  The result of the reaction is ammonium acetate and unstable <span>carbonic acid,</span> which in a short time turns into carbon dioxide and water. <br>  The following reaction involves the addition of 80% acetic acid to 10% ammonia <span>(ammonia).</span>  The reaction requires low temperatures.  A flask with reagents is lowered into the ice container, periodically vigorously shaking it.  Ammonium acetate is obtained by evaporation of the filtrate. <br>  For the third reaction, nitrile acetic acid or acetonitrile is used.  It is heated with water.  Among the production methods, a reaction has found industrial application when ammonium acetate is obtained from acetic acid in reaction with an aqueous ammonia solution. </p><p>  Among the methods for the production of ammonium acetate, one can distinguish a reaction in which this compound is a by-product of the chemical treatment of wood - ammonia.  The main goal of this reaction is cellulose diacylation. <br>  A remarkable feature of ammonium acetate is its ability to decompose at a temperature of 112 ¬∞ C into acetamide and water.  This reaction is often cited as an example of salt decomposition under relatively low temperatures. <br>  Ammonium acetate is used in industry and laboratory conditions as a component of anti-icing fluids.  The food industry has found an effective preservative in it.  It is also used as a reagent in certain types of organic synthesis.  <span>Laboratory studies</span> consider the consumption of ammonium acetate as a component of <span>buffer solutions</span> and during the deposition of proteins. <br>  Technologies have been developed for applying a pattern to fabrics or dyeing them using ammonium acetate.  It is used in the production of antibiotics and other products of the pharmaceutical industry.  It is also widely used in the production of foam rubber, plastics, and vinyl. <br>  The use of ammonium acetate for industrial purposes involves its transportation and storage in large volumes.  As a rule, crystalline powder is packed in special wicker bags or paper boxes.  Dry rooms are used for storage, where this substance is in a sealed state in the original packaging.  The substance is not toxic and does not pose a health hazard to the operating staff.  Precautions for handling this compound include eye and skin protection. <br>  If a substance enters the surface of the mucous membrane, first aid is a plentiful rinse with clean water.  After working with ammonium acetate, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. <br>  In a fire hazard, the compound in question is not dangerous.  It is not explosive and does not combust easily.  The domestic chemical industry has established the release of a substance in sufficient quantities to meet the needs of production.  In addition, the supply of ammonium acetate from abroad.  Traditionally, the main importer here is China. </p>
