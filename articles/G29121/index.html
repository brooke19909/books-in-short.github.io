Their popularity is explained by the fact that such devices have a beautiful design, all the functions necessary for the modern user, an acceptable "filling".  Their indisputable advantage, of course, is the low price.  New items regularly go on sale.  Each manufacturer annually updates its lineup.  LG was no exception.  In 2016, the K-line replenished with a new device.  The model belongs to the budget segment.  Equipped with a 5-inch display of good quality.  The processor used is the well-known company MediaTek.  <span>Features LG K8 LTE</span> supplemented with one gigabyte of RAM.  How did customers rate the new smartphone?  Does it comply with the statement "reasonable choice at a decent price"?  Let's get it right. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lg k8 lte specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2045923.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Features of a complete set </h2><p>  The device is packed in a company box.  It is decorated in a minimalist style.  In front, in capital letters, the name is printed.  At the bottom of the front panel there is a company logo.  There are no more design elements.  However, such simplicity and conciseness gives originality. </p><p>  For a set of components, buyers have questions.  The manufacturer may make changes without warning, therefore, in addition to the charger and USB cable, some also got headphones.  All documentation is provided in the box.  As for the memory card and cover, they will have to be purchased additionally.  Some users had difficulties with the latter, since universal models on a smartphone are not suitable due to the peculiarities of the location of the control buttons. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The design direction that was used for the smartphone is called Glossy Pebble, which means glossy pebbles.  It was this decision that made the gadget original.  2.5D glass adds sophistication and stylish appearance.  Thanks to him, the phone looks seamless.  Some users drew attention to a certain similarity with Samsung devices. </p><p>  The model range includes several color options LG K8 LTE: Black / Blue Indigo (Indigo blue), White (white), Gold (gold). </p><p>  The back panel has a corrugated surface that resembles a fabric texture.  It practically does not leave fingerprints and does not form scratches.  In this model, the manufacturer abandoned the standard arrangement of mechanical control keys.  Now they are not on the side edge, but not on the back cover directly under the ‚Äúwindow‚Äù of the camera. </p><p>  The user comments say that the manufacturer did not stint logos.  One is on the front side instead of the usual control panel.  By the way, the latter is moved to the screen.  The second logo is located in the center of the back cover. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lg k8 lte price" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2045924.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  A few words about the assembly </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the price of the LG K8 LTE is low, the build quality is absolutely not inferior to expensive smartphones.  Due to the fact that the phone has a removable battery, many buyers have doubts as to whether the back cover is securely fastened, whether it will slide off.  The smartphone case is assembled at a high level.  During operation, squeaks and crunches were not noticed.  It is also worth noting that the phone does not play anything, which, undoubtedly, is a virtue.  It is important that even with a thorough inspection of the housing, it is impossible to notice gaps and gaps.  The whole structure looks solid. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Controls </h2><p>  The LG K8 LTE phone has one feature, which was mentioned above.  We are talking about the "rocker" volume and key lock.  Their location on the rear panel for many users did not seem very convenient, but getting used to them would be easy.  The developers did not use the side faces of the gadget, leaving them completely empty.  Convenience is of course difficult to judge, since, on the one hand, many are already accustomed to a certain location, and such drastic changes cause some inconvenience, but on the other hand, the indisputable advantage is that it is the chosen place that completely eliminates accidental pressing. </p><p>  On the front panel, in addition to the large screen, there are other elements.  We are talking about the front camera, dynamics, proximity sensor.  Sensors in the model are located closer to the left side.  On black smartphones, they are almost invisible, but on white phones they are immediately evident. </p><p>  According to buyers, the manufacturer is very overloaded the bottom end.  Here the ports are mini-jack, micro-USB, as well as a microphone.  With the opposite end, the situation is the same as with the side faces. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="selfie camera" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2045925.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  LG K8 LTE: screen specifications </h2><p>  It's time to talk about the screen.  This model uses a 5-inch display with standard features.  Type of matrix - In-Cell Touch IPS.  The maximum resolution is 1280x720 px.  In principle, such characteristics are often found in budget devices, so they are unlikely to be able to surprise anyone.  However, despite the low performance, the picture quality is pretty decent.  The image looks juicy and saturated.  The brightness level is sufficient for comfortable operation.  Pixelization is invisible, since the density is 293 ppi. </p><h2>  Screen Reviews </h2><p>  The screen of the LG K8 LTE is protected by <span>Gorilla Glass</span> 3. Reviews about it do not always sound flattering, since even with careful handling it will form small scratches.  But what is undoubtedly a virtue is the presence of anti-reflective and oleophobic coatings.  There is no air layer between the glass and the display.  This improves image quality, but in the event of a breakdown increases the cost of repair. </p><p>  The lack of additional screen settings caused heated discussions.  By and large, there are no special comments on colors, but I would like to be able to make changes, for example, in the temperature of the shades.  Viewing angles are acceptable.  Saturation and contrast are reduced only when tilting more than 100 degrees. </p><p>  The responsiveness of the screen is good, but some owners had problems with double tap.  The function is unstable.  The phone can react only after the second attempt or not recognize the touch at all. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="android 6" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2045926.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Selfie camera: specifications and reviews </h2><p>  When advertising this model, the manufacturer pays special attention to the capabilities of the front camera.  And it is worth noting that it is not in vain.  Although the matrix has a resolution of five megapixels, but the pictures come out pretty good quality.  Get a good result allows a virtual flash.  Such a decision undoubtedly deserves respect.  The selfie camera does an excellent job even in low light.  Photos have high levels of detail and clarity.  The developers also envisioned a function that provides shooting with gestures.  There are no comments on her work. </p><h2>  Main camera features </h2><p>  In LG K8 LTE, the characteristics of the main camera are not inferior to the front camera.  The 8-megapixel sensor does a good job.  In low light, you can use the flash.  Users rate the quality of shooting at 4 on a 5-point system.  But it is worth noting that in the evening it is very difficult to get a clear photo.  At the slightest movement, the frame is blurred. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone lg k8 lte" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2045927.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Hardware "stuffing" </h2><p>  The ‚Äúheart‚Äù of the phone is the <span>MediaTek MT6735 processor.</span>  The manufacturer claims that it efficiently consumes energy.  The chipset is based on four computing elements.  The power of each reaches 1300 MHz.  This hardware is used by most companies to equip smartphones in the budget segment. </p><p>  The model of the coprocessor was not a surprise to buyers.  The ARM Mali-T720 is also often installed on modern gadgets.  The video card allows you to work with any type of graphic image.  The operating memory of the LG K8 LTE is limited to one gigabyte.  Unfortunately, such characteristics are not enough for the user to work with modern applications.  If you increase the load on the processor, then the phone immediately begins to freeze. </p><p>  Do not please buyers and the amount of integrated memory.  Currently, 16 GB is critically small for full-fledged work.  Developers offer owners to expand storage up to 32 GB by installing an external drive. </p><h2>  Performance Reviews </h2><p>  By and large, the characteristics of the LG K8 LTE are quite consistent with modern requirements.  Of course, he will not be able to perform several tasks at once, but with simple applications he will work stably, without lags. </p><p>  The smartphone is good at playing games.  <span>Mortal Kombat X</span> runs at minimum settings, and Asphalt 8: Airborne will work smoothly even with good graphics.  Naturally, there are no problems with video and music players.  Correctly run any office programs. </p><p>  It is important that even during games, the phone‚Äôs body practically does not heat up.  After a few hours, a slight increase in temperature is felt. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lg k8 lte black" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2045928.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  operating system </h2><p>  Owners of this gadget model are offered Android 6. Not without the proprietary interface LG Optimus UI.  You can get quick access to some functions in the curtain.  There is brightness control, data transfer, screen rotation.  Also, without going into the menu, you can enable / disable Wi-Fi, vibration.  The main screen displays icons of frequently used applications, the Google search bar.  If desired, the owner can set the weather widget, change the wallpaper.  The service line has not changed, so the icons are displayed on it in the same way as in the "clean" Android 6. On the right side there is a clock showing the current time.  A battery indicator with percentages is displayed next to them.  Next, you can see information about active SIM cards. </p><p>  Users have no comments on the Marshmallow version.  The applications available for installation are more than enough.  Developers release updates.  The system works smoothly, without crashes. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The battery for the LG K8 LTE developers have chosen rather weak.  Its capacity of 2125 mAh is not enough to ensure a long battery life.  With an average load, you have to put the phone on charge twice a day.  The maximum operating time with the active screen is no more than 2.5 hours. It will take about 2 hours to restore the battery life.  For these purposes, it is better to use the original charger, since from Chinese counterparts this process will occur very slowly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lg k8 lte screen" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2045929.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Summing up, it is worth noting that in appearance the phone can well compete with gadgets of the middle segment.  However, immediately after its inclusion, it becomes clear why the price of LG K8 LTE is so low.  In retail outlets, the cost of a smartphone starts at a mark of 6500 rubles.  The most striking disadvantages of this model, according to the owners, are the small amount of RAM, poor performance and, of course, a short battery life. </p>
