It is full of mysteries of ancient times, secrets and is on the peninsula one of the most unusual, mysterious and attractive places.  It is located near the city of Belogorsk.  There are almost no crowds of tourists here, so this area retains its charm; it has not yet been spoiled by the benefits of civilization.  In addition, the White Rock for beach lovers is of no interest. </p><h2>  First impression of the mountain </h2><p>  This is good, because the beauty provided to us by nature can be quickly destroyed.  This is rarely found in the world, and this is a real miracle of Crimea.  If you are in these places, you need to admire them, only then it will be clear that the peninsula is not only beaches and the sea.  Its typical landscapes reminiscent of the Wild West really liked the cinematographs and many films of Soviet times were shot here, such as ‚ÄúA Man from the Capuchin Boulevard‚Äù, ‚ÄúA Headless Horseman‚Äù and others. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="white rock crimea" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/833117.jpg" width="600"></div>  The action of all the paintings took place among the wonderful landscapes surrounding this place.  <span>Crimean Tatars</span> call this amazing natural wonder Ak-Kai, which translates as ‚Äúwhite rock‚Äù.  Crimea is very decorated with this beauty, which in reality has such a color, especially when viewed from afar.  Although there is nothing strange here, since the rock consists of limestone.  When the sun shines on it, in front of us is a real bewitching sight.

    <h2>  White rock (Crimea), how to get to this wonderful place </h2><p>  It's time to tell you how to visit these places.  It is advisable to first get to Simferopol.  There are several ways: from Russia and Ukraine.  We will not consider this.  We believe that you are already in the <span>capital of Crimea.</span>  If the path is not planned on your own car, then from Simferopol we go by any minibus, following in the direction of the city of Belogorsk. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="white rock crimea how to get" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/833121.jpg" width="600"></div>  The best guide for you will be the village of Vishnoe.  When you go out to its outskirts, you will immediately find yourself near the snow-white, wonderful rocks.  Now you know how to get to the White Rock (Crimea).  Address: Belogorsky district, the village of the same name.  It is, of course, low, only 325 meters, but it‚Äôs worth looking at a neighbor of the village of the same name.  For lovers of history: until 1948 it was called Ak-Kaya.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  More detailed cliff location </h2><p>  There are people who are not satisfied with this wording of the address.  They are not local, and this does not mean anything to them.  There is a special explanation for them where the White Rock is located in Crimea.  Its location - 50 kilometers from Simferopol and five - from the highway from the capital of the republic to Feodosia.  You need to drive through the city of Belogorsk somewhere around one kilometer to the north-east, and then four kilometers to the village of Belaya Skala.  He is at its very foot.  Now, probably, everyone will understand <span>well</span> where the local celebrity is located.  It remains only to indicate that it rises directly above the valley of the local river Biyuk-Karasu.  The height difference between the top of the cliff and the valley is one hundred meters. </p><h2>  Rock origin </h2><p>  A very interesting question - where did this unusual beauty come from and how?  It was obtained as a result of weathering and erosion of Paleogene and Cretaceous sandstones and limestones.  This process is an example of a well-known kuest relief.  The weathering of the mountain in the upper part created oval niches, grottoes, and pillars. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Belogorsk crimea white rock" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/833130.jpg" width="494"></div>  Below, weathering products are constantly accumulating - erosion hollows, bulk blocks, scree.  Some plants inhibit erosion in some places.  This is a thicket of meadowsweet and rose hips.  All this contributes to the beauty of the monument White Rock (Crimea).  The photos posted here convey only part of this magnificence.

    <h2>  The history of this cultural monument, excavations </h2><p>  In the sixties and seventies of the last century, at the foot of the rock, on its northern side, the Crimean Paleontology Expedition excavated twenty sites of a man of the primitive Mousterian era.  Found a lot of silicon spikes, scrapers, knives.  Near them were found a sufficient number of various bony remains of the disappeared fauna of the peninsula: onager, wild horse, primeval bull, saiga, red deer, giant <span>cave bear,</span> mammoth and others.  During excavations, a fragment of the skull of a Neanderthal, an adult, and later the remains of a child of the same time were first found here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get to the white rock crimea" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/833148.jpg" width="600"></div>  The reason is the favorable territory of the White Rock (Crimea) object for housing: river water, many sheds and grottoes, deposits of the necessary flint.  Even a high precipice brought benefits - it was ideally suited for hunting many animals.  Already in our era, in the first centuries, Sarmatians lived here in a cave.  According to some assumptions, it then served as a sanctuary, a kind of temple.  Tamgas were found - signs belonging to the clans of that time, which were carved in stone and this confirmed the ownership of these territories.

    <h2>  Scythian mounds, caves and place of execution </h2><p>  Many mounds are located on a plateau.  At the foot of the cliff in the Middle Ages lived Shirin, the leader of one of the rich Tatar clans.  Access to the upper cave is very difficult, since the entrance to it is located at a distance of 52 meters from the sole in the form of a circle-shaped hole and 49 meters from the edge of the cliff.  There are three legends dedicated to Altyn-Teshik: </p><ol><li>  This cave is the den of a serpent who was a werewolf.  He abducted a handsome man in the area and brought them here. </li><li>  This cave stretches very far - to Feodosia. </li><li>  Here the robbers hid a chest of gold. </li></ol><p>  On the rock, an older clan was elected; here Murza, dissatisfied with the khan of Crimea, gathered.  In the Middle Ages, Ak-Kaya was a famous place of execution.  In the eyes of Bogdan Khmelnitsky, who sometimes visited here, they threw prisoners off a cliff in order to make the hetman pay the ransom on time.  The headquarters of Suvorov was here in 1777.  In 1783, the Crimean aristocracy here took the oath of loyalty to Russia. </p><h2>  What are these places now </h2><p>  If you are a lover of ancient attractions, come to Belogorsk (Crimea).  The white rock will enchant you with its beauty.  Although, if you get close enough, it will be seen that the wall of this giant is not white, but has a cream shade.  Immediately you will notice a large number of caves and grottoes.  In their darkness, one can imagine many dark tunnels that go into the darkness of the dungeons.  But in reality, most often they are small cavities.  The white rock has a slightly ‚Äúoverhanging‚Äù overhang, under which relief patterns stretch. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the white rock in crimea" class="if" height="475" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/833198.jpg" width="445"></div>  They look like honeycombs, some kind of outlandish.  They are sometimes called weathering honeycombs, formed as a result of rock bombardment by rock particles - sand, which is carried by the wind.  The wind, which blows here from the west, has not only formed small cellular shapes, it has created round windows, grottoes, various niches, as well as columns, and they have been supporting the upper tier for many years.  The ‚Äúroof‚Äù is covered by the entire kilometer of rock by a weathering belt - horizontal, about a meter wide.  The cones of talus from crushed stone, which are well cut by erosive furrows and potholes, cover the bottom of the rock.  On them in places there are blocks of huge limestone.  It is recommended to climb the rock in the late afternoon: soft lighting, not hot, the distances open for observation.  If you want to explore all the holes, go along the path located in the west of the cliff.  And do not forget to shoot, shoot and shoot all the time.  Numerous photographs will remind you of this tour.

    <h2>  Fishing at the White Cliff </h2><p>  As we already reported, not far from the cliff, the local river Biyuk-Karasu flows.  It organized one of the best fishing in the Crimea.  White Rock is a great landmark for this.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe reservoir is 4.8 hectares.  The pond is equipped in the Belogorsky district, the village of Ukrainka.  To get to it, you need to go along the Feodosia highway from Simferopol to the village of Zuya, it's about 18 kilometers, then turn left to the desired settlement (another eight kilometers).  Here for carp fishing there is a special reservoir, fishing is carried out according to the catch-let-go rule. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fishing in crimea white rock" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/833209.jpg" width="480"></div>  You can catch grass carp, silver carp, carp - Hungarian, mirror and scaly.  You can stay in equipped houses.  That is, those who did not set out to swim at sea will be satisfied with how they spent their vacation.
