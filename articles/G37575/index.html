The son of the <span>commander of the Airborne Forces,</span> Vitaly Margelov, whose biography began almost normally, graduated from high school with a gold medal, entered the Moscow State University named after M.V.  Lomonosov in Moscow in 1958.  He lived in a hostel, did not trump his father‚Äôs name, and was respected among his peers.  During his studies, he commanded a student operational detachment of police assistance in maintaining public safety.  A popular movement at the time.  At this work, the future intelligence officer showed himself to be a courageous and selfless leader.  Vitaly Margelov disdained danger, was brave and resourceful.  About the commander of the operational detachment wrote in the central newspapers.  Before the distribution, a proposal was received to work in the bodies.  Father, Vasily Filippovich, approved the desire of his son to work in the KGB. </p><h2>  In the service of the motherland </h2><p>  Years went into professional development, numerous special business trips.  Our hero gave himself completely to work, skillfully led subordinates.  Vitaly Margelov reached the heights, becoming the second person in the <span>Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation.</span>  Government and departmental awards are a vivid confirmation of this. </p>

    <p>  In 2003, retired with the rank of colonel general.  Vitaly Vasilievich became a deputy of the State Duma, performed difficult work in the commissions on security, budget spending and investigation of the Beslan massacre. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  He raised acute, topical questions about the protection of the rights of military personnel in the reserve and family members. </p><p>  It is not easy to protect retirees of the Ministry of Defense; measures do not receive the proper response.  The media are cautiously pushing the discussion of pensions to the periphery of collective opinion.  Cases of retirees seem insignificant against the backdrop of issues of state protection, and rightly so.  But what is impossible to hide. </p><h2>  In defense of military pensioners </h2><p>  It is already impossible to hide the plight.  It will be good luck to force management to acknowledge underpayment of military stock, then a return mechanism should be developed without fail.  The government primarily repays external debts, but ignores its own citizens.  Another paradox.  Most of the military pensioners continue to work due to their financial difficulties.  It would be more correct to equalize the <span>types of public service:</span> civil, military and law enforcement agencies.  This is an integrated solution to pension problems. </p>

    <p>  The state is obliged to repay debts, no matter what the cost.  People who gave their years of life to defending their homeland did not deserve such an attitude.  It is not the business of ‚Äúsovereign" pensioners to <span>eke out a miserable existence.</span>  Their life is not as prosperous as it seems.  Here is the main tactical task.  Vitaly Margelov considered this problem to be paramount, developed the law ‚ÄúOn Foreign Intelligence‚Äù, where the advice of a state security professional is simply necessary. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Discussion </h2><p>  Fundamental principles - now only a Russian citizen will be a resident.  An employee goes on a business trip with a Russian passport.  In the previous edition there was no requirement to ban a second citizenship: it wasn‚Äôt, then it‚Äôs possible.  This generates unnecessary rumors and speculation.  The SVR employee is not a member of political parties.  He follows the orders of the leadership.  Guarantees: the state is obliged to save the scout and family members if a failure occurs during the performance of special tasks.  This is respected.  In addition, there is insurance for employees and family members. </p>

    <p>  Margelov took seriously defense issues, participated in the discussion of the law "On Military Service".  So, it was proposed to increase the term of the contract contract by five years.  Only surgical intervention V.V.  Margelova helped to avoid mistakes and prove the detriment of such a decision for the defense of the country.  The service life of platoon - battalion officers will increase as tenure lasts five years. </p><h2>  Nowhere without airborne </h2><p>  The son of Vasily Filippovich is known in the <span>landing troops.</span>  Traditionally, he contacts with the leadership, with the commanders who came after his father.  Vitaly Margelov often comes to the Tula and Pskov divisions, visits the Ryazan Airborne School, the constituency in which he ran.  Often comes to soldiers, officers and cadets.  Everywhere there is a respectful attitude towards the father - paratrooper No. 1, which does not fade away, but only increases.  Vitaly Margelov, whose photo is posted in this article, is captured below in his visit to one of the units. </p>

    <p>  Married, four sons.  The eldest, Mikhail, a <span>deputy of the State Duma,</span> heads the international committee.  Another, Vladimir, devoted himself to the Border Troops. </p><p>  The life of a pensioner is leisurely and measured.  Vitaly Margelov studied the military past, the further development of the Airborne Forces, the experience of the special services of the world, loved memoirs of scouts, walks in the woods, fishing.  In 2010, he died before he reached seventy. </p>
