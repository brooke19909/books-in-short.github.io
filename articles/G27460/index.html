  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The recreation center "Amber". Uvildy Lake in the Southern Urals</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It can hardly be argued that the region of the Southern Urals suffers from an excessive influx of tourists.  Mass demand is in completely different directions.  But the <span>Ural Mountains</span> have the originality and attractiveness of the nature of the middle zone.  And the tourism potential of the region is quite large, but at present it is far from fully realized.  In the Chelyabinsk region, there are many places of traditional recreation for local residents, such as recreation center "Yantar", Lake Uvildy.  But the tourism infrastructure of the region requires investment for further development.  Such investments are very promising.  Let us take a closer look at what already exists. </p><p>  The recreation center "Amber", Lake Uvildy </p><p>  The recreation center is located on the southeastern shore of one of the largest <span>lakes</span> in the entire <span>Urals.</span>  The total length of its coastline exceeds one hundred kilometers.  And this coastline is very picturesque.  It is quite winding, with many bays and quiet backwaters, the hilly coast is covered with dense coniferous and mixed coniferous-deciduous forests. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="recreation center amber lake uvildy" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/250645.jpg" width="492"></div>  Similar relic <span>coniferous forests are</span> still preserved in many places of the Urals, despite their predatory destruction over the past two centuries.  With the whole complex of its natural components, this lake is favorable for relaxation.  Among the many tourist infrastructure facilities existing on its coast, the Yantar recreation center is favorably distinguished.  Lake Uvildy in this place has a slightly medieval appearance.  Seven buildings of this recreation center give it such a look.  They are stylized by architects as <span>ancient castles,</span> decorated with towers and other attributes of Gothic architecture.  But this antiquity has a purely decorative character.  Here everything is equipped in accordance with modern standards and there is everything necessary for a good rest and treatment.  This opportunity provides its visitors recreation center "Amber".  Lake Uvildy, among other things, also has sapropelic mud.  They traditionally treat a whole group of rheumatic diseases.  And not so long ago, several radon sources were discovered near the coast. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="recreation center amber uvildy" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/250643.jpg" width="488"></div>  When some try to translate into Russian the meaning of the toponym "Uvilda" as "cup of health and longevity", then it is difficult to verify.  However, such a translation does not contradict the truth, the lake completely corresponds to such a definition in terms of its recreational and healing properties.  And many residents of Chelyabinsk are well aware of this address: recreation center "Yantar", Uvildy.  It is 80 kilometers from the city, and they come here to rest and improve their health. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="recreation center lake uvildy" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/250644.jpg" width="481"></div>

    <p>  Lake Uvildy, recreation on its coast </p><p>  The recreational potential of <span>Lake Uvildy</span> has been actively developed recently.  The number of places where you can stay on vacation is increasing.  But traditionally three stand out for a long time.  These are ‚ÄúRed Stone‚Äù, ‚ÄúSeagull‚Äù and ‚ÄúAmber‚Äù.  But many prefer to stay on the shore in a tent.  This is also possible, but it should be borne in mind that in some places you may be charged from 300 to 500 rubles for entering the coastline. </p>
