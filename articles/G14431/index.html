Of course, the hotel cannot be called a full-fledged sanatorium, but still there are some medical procedures for guests. </p><p>  Ripario Hotel Group has its own medical center, where you can get advice from the following specialists: otolaryngologist, pulmonologist, physiotherapist, pediatrician, balneologist and nutritionist. </p><p>  The basic package of each guest of the hotel includes a one-time free visit to a balneologist who will be able to give his recommendations regarding the need to undergo certain medical and preventive procedures.  The resorts of the South Coast have long been famous for their healing effects on the body.  Therefore, being on the peninsula, it is worth paying attention not only to beach-sea vacations, but also to pay attention to medical and recreational activities.  In this regard, the village of Otradnoye in the Crimea is quite suitable not only for swimming in the sea, but also for healing.  The fact is that a mineral spring (the first on the South Coast) was found on the territory of the complex, which has a unique chemical composition and healing properties.  Each guest of the hotel has a daily visit to the pump room for taking mineral water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Otradnoe crimea" class="if" height="472" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1895390.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  If the guests have spa cards, the staff of the medical center offers to take a health course of respiratory diseases, urological problems (Saki mud is used) and general therapeutic ailments.  In the arsenal of the complex there is a physiotherapy room, a bathroom, an inhalation room, a fitness room, a hydromassage and a swimming pool.  A number of massage therapists and a dentist also work. </p><h2>  Complex Services </h2><p>  Ripario Hotel Group (Yalta) has a fairly developed infrastructure.  On its territory there is everything you need for an interesting and comfortable stay.  Everyone can visit the fitness room located near the coast.  The sports club is equipped with modern fitness and weight training equipment.  In total, the gym has 30 simulators and two treadmills.  If desired, visitors have the opportunity to order individual lessons with a personal trainer. </p><p>  On the territory of the complex there is a field for playing futsal with natural coating, a tennis court with night lighting, a spa center.  For children and adults, animators with entertaining sports programs work in season. </p><p>  In different buildings of the hotel there are six conference rooms of different levels for business events of any complexity.  In addition, the complex has a car camping.  The suburb of Yalta is popular with car tourists, because here you can always find a place for a comfortable stay, in contrast to the crowded center of the resort.  The hotel has prudently organized a three-level parking lot for camping, equipping it with a toilet, shower and electricity.  Travelers, like other guests of the complex, can enjoy all the benefits on its territory (pool, gym, cafe, dining room, animators, beach, playground, tennis court). </p><h2>  Catering </h2><p>  The complex has several restaurants and a bar, the services of which are available to hotel guests. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ripario hotel group resort" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1895393.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Restaurant Ros Marinus is located on Massandra Beach in a cozy quiet place.  The institution offers visitors not only tasty food on the terrace, but also visit the solarium.  The restaurant is popular among tourists who highly appreciate the culinary skills of the chef and the unique panoramic view from the outdoor terrace.  A romantic place is worth a visit to enjoy its unique atmosphere.  No less interesting is the Modern restaurant, located on the ground floor of the building of the same name. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Massandra beaches are famous for their beauty and purity of water.  The main advantage of the hotel is its location directly on the beach.  The road to the beach from different buildings is from 50 to 70 meters.  It is worth noting that the complex has its own, closed to outsiders site on the coast with a pebble coating.  The beach is equipped with changing cabins, sun loungers, a shower, awnings and awnings for a safe stay. </p><h2>  Weather in Yalta </h2><p>  Every year, many tourists tend to the Black Sea resorts.  Among them, the <span>southern coast of Crimea is</span> especially popular <span>.</span>  Here, nature created unique natural conditions.  Big Yalta is located in the Mediterranean climate zone, due to the fact that it is protected by the Main Range of the Crimean Mountains.  The southern coast has long turned into a single resort, which includes Simeiz, Alupka, Alushta, Livadia, Koreiz, Oreanda, Gaspra and Miskhor. </p><p>  The unique climatic conditions make the region incredibly attractive.  In winter, the Black Sea gives off heat, softening the cold.  The weather in Yalta is always an order of magnitude warmer than on the mainland.  And in the summer, due to the proximity of the sea, there is no strong heat.  The uniqueness of the climate on the south coast is that winters are mild and warm, and summers are very hot, but at the same time not sultry.  Spring, as a rule, is long, but autumn, on the contrary, is long but warm, it is called the “velvet season”. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ripario hotel group yalta" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1895429.jpg"></div>

    <p>  According to many indicators, the climate of the southern coast belongs to the subtropical type.  The average annual temperature here is +13 degrees.  July is considered the hottest month, during this period the temperature reaches +24 degrees.  Even in February, the harshest month, the temperature does not drop below +4 degrees.  Numerous guests of the resort have long appreciated all the benefits of such a favorable climate in all respects and incredibly healing sea air filled with volatile pine needles.  Due to this, Yalta is known throughout the world as one of the best climatic resorts.  The peak of the tourist season, of course, occurs in the summer months, when the sea warms up and allows vacationers to soak up its waves.  However, in the remaining months the resort does not stop receiving guests. </p><p>  It is worth noting that summer on the south coast is dry, warm and long.  Sea breezes greatly reduce the scorching effects of heat.  In the summer months it is very warm, there is no sweltering heat.  The Yalta climate is drier than in the areas of the Black Sea coast of the same Caucasus.  Sea water on the South Coast in the summer warms up to a temperature of +22 - + 24 degrees.  The swimming season begins in late May and continues until early October.  From the first days of September comes the time of the "velvet season".  Thanks to the influence of the warm sea, good clear weather is maintained on the coast until December. </p><p>  Even the winter I Yalta is usually mild and fairly short.  Snow sometimes falls, but it melts soon.  But in the mountains at this time lies a dense snow cover that allows you to ski and engage in other winter sports. </p><h2>  Ripario Hotel Group: reviews </h2><p>  Continuing the conversation about the hotel, I want to pay attention to the reviews of people who visited it.  Is he really as good as tour operators imagine him.  Analyzing the reviews, it is worth noting that the complex belongs to those places about which there is a mixed opinion, since the reviews of tourists are quite contradictory.  But let's talk about everything in order ... </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ripario hotel group modern" class="if" height="257" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1895411.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As we mentioned earlier, the hotel is located in the village of Otradnoye in Crimea, near Yalta.  This location is both an advantage and a disadvantage at the same time.  On the one hand, the buildings are located in a park area, away from numerous discos and clubs.  But on the other hand, you need to understand that the hotel is in some ways divorced from the outside world.  If in the daytime you want to go to Yalta, then you can take the bus by spending about ten minutes on the way to the stop.  Unfortunately, public transport runs quite rarely (once every half an hour).  In addition, you can take a taxi, but their choice is also not great.  But in the evening there are problems with transport, it just isn’t there, so it’s difficult to go for a walk, and it’s boring enough to be in the boarding house all the time.  According to tourists, the hotel is suitable for those people who do not plan active trips along the coast. </p><p>  The territory of the complex itself is quite well-groomed, but small.  Very pleased with the proximity of the beach.  According to guests, the coast is beautiful and clean. </p><p>  Special attention should be paid to reviews of the hotel room stock.  Tourists recommend not booking apartments from the “economy” category, since such rooms are small in size and the windows face a blank wall.  Higher-level rooms are located in the Modern building, located by the sea, the windows and balconies of the building overlook the sea coast or the park area. </p><p>  Meals at the hotel are organized like a buffet.  When booking rooms, you can choose the appropriate food option: half board, full board or breakfast.  Regarding the quantity and quality of food, vacationers postpone conflicting reviews.  Tourists note a fairly simple and simple set of dishes on the buffet.  Of course, no one remains hungry, but there is not much variety either.  In the evenings, you can visit the hotel’s bar or restaurant, but for this, you must first obtain a hotel card on deposit to be able to pay for the order.  Unfortunately, staff does not accept conventional payment cards. </p><p>  In the summer, children's animators work at the hotel, there is a playground with horizontal bars.  Activities for adults are not carried out, except for the evening disco.  Children's programs do not differ in variety; the standard set of contests is repeated daily.  The hotel offers guided tours of natural and historical sites. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="suburb of yalta" class="if" height="257" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1895412.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  There is also a gym and tennis court.  A pleasant moment is the presence of a heated pool with fresh water, which can be an alternative for swimming in the cold season, as it is located in the spa.  In the summer, vacationers try to spend most of the time on the coast by the sea. </p><p>  The complex has its own pump room with mineral water.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All guests have the opportunity to visit it, since this service is a standard set of services. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, there is a medical center for tourists, where you can get advice from some specialists and undergo a number of procedures that are paid separately. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In general, the opportunity to recover a little is happy, but you need to understand that the complex does not have the status of a sanatorium.</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> A beautiful green area with centuries-old trees is a real highlight of this beautiful and secluded place. </font></font></p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p> In general, the hotel makes a good impression, if you do not pay attention to minor flaws, and follow the advice of tourists on the choice of apartments for accommodation.  The Modern building is equipped with good rooms and is located on the very shore, which is why it is popular with guests.  We hope that our article will help you make the right choice. </p>
