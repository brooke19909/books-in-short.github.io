It is a hat or a hat that brings the unique charm that is achieved by such work into the appearance of a lady. </p><p>  Today, a large number of hats are presented in the market, in shops and fashion boutiques.  However, the bulk of this is consumer goods.  Most people now dress in what is ‚Äúfashionable,‚Äù without thinking at all whether this model suits them or not.  Therefore, it is often difficult in the crowd to determine who is walking in front of you: a young girl - a student or a serious lady.  But as soon as the representative of the fair sex turns his face, it is sometimes difficult to restrain laughter or chagrin.  After all, knitted hats with a fur bully pompom, fashionable this season, sometimes look so ridiculous on adult impressive women! </p><p>  And although many understand the inappropriateness of their headgear, alas, they do not see a way out of this situation.  And yet he is!  And this is knitting hats with your own needles!  Who, if not you yourself, knows better than others which model will decorate you most, help create a harmonious image, emphasize advantages and hide flaws?  And the cost of such things, created with your own hands, will be much less than those that you purchase in a store or on the market.  Therefore, for the same money you can update your wardrobe by adding not one, but two or even three new original hats to it! </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>Knitting hats with</span> knitting needles will help the lady become the owner of both an ordinary <span>hat with a lapel</span> and an exclusive knitted hat with brim.  The fields at such a headgear will not be able to hold like <span>felt hats.</span>  Therefore, based on the peculiarities of the lady's appearance, they will need to be lifted and sewn in one place, decorating this place with a beautiful brooch or button, an artificial flower or beadwork. </p><p>  Young creative girls are well suited for hanging small fields "a la lesovichok."  And if a young fashionista wants to impress her peers not only with her knitting skills, but also with beadwork skills, then her hat will be perfectly decorated with a homemade <span>bead brooch that</span> imitates a butterfly or a rose, a heart or a bunch of berries. </p><p>  Knitting hats with knitting needles is also great for replenishing the sports part of the wardrobe.  Here, to come up with a style, you should not climb on the Internet and magazines.  Basically, sports models are not particularly sophisticated.  The main thing in them is the correctly selected colors of the product.  Multi-colored stripes, pompons and hats will be able to create the necessary mood for the skier or skater, runner or cyclist. </p><p>  Although why is it talking only about the representatives of the beautiful half of humanity?  Many men also believe that knitting hats with knitting needles is a worthy occupation, and they love to wear the works of their favorite needlewomen: grandmothers, mothers, sisters, loved ones, wives and daughters. </p><p>  And <span>knitting hats with knitting needles</span> for kids was completely indispensable for all centuries!  What models did not come up with fashion designers to please the kids!  These are the two-horned caps, on the tips of which tiny colored gloves are funny waving to everyone, and their three-horned brothers with knitted striped socks at the ends of the caps.  As if the gnomes played out on the heads of cute kids! </p><p>  There are children's hats - daisies, cornflowers, mushrooms, hats with braids made of yarn, hats with ears, which are more like a part of a fancy dress than a hat.  But the most important thing in them is that they are warm, comfortable, they lift the mood of the kids and extremely touches the adults. </p><p>  Of course, making such models just once seen on someone is quite difficult.  Therefore, you should look for a site where knitting hats with a description is presented.  This is especially true for beginner knitters.  But after you ‚Äúbeat your hand‚Äù in the manufacture of a variety of hats, creating your own model will not be difficult for you. </p><p>  So, to the point!  Knitting needles, a ball, fantasy and perseverance - that's all we need now. </p>
