For a year and a half, the organizers prepared the exposition for the opening, and on February 23, 1960, it took place, gathering a large number of spectators and the military.  At the time of opening, it was possible to find operated and experimental aircraft and helicopters of a predominantly civilian type in the museum. </p><p>  All exhibits are located in hangars, halls and even in the open.  On display are civilian and military aircraft, weapons, tools and uniforms.  Everyone can visit the foreign exposition, where you can admire the <span>aviation equipment</span> that was used during the Second World War. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Museum exposition and history (1958-1972) </h2><p>  The Central Museum of the Air Force of the Russian Federation is located in several rooms.

    <p>  In 1972, Lieutenant General <span>S.Ya.</span> became the head of the museum.  <span>Fedorov,</span> it was then that the institution underwent a number of changes.  The <span>Air Force Museum</span> in Monino at that time did not have in its collection a single fighter created in the bureau of A.S.  Yakovlev, there were no other cars that played a huge role in the Great Patriotic War. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Fedorov, having gathered several groups of enthusiasts, began to search for the <span>missing aircraft.</span>  They compiled a number of maps on which the found vehicles were marked, and a register of aircraft that could be evacuated to the museum was formed and then overhauled.  Difficult work yielded great results. </p><p>  Monino, whose museum was already popular, was replenished almost weekly with new exhibits.  Through such searches, they managed to get into the collection of IL-2, Yak-9, SB and some other aircraft.  It was not possible to evacuate some of the aircraft immediately; the process dragged on for several years.  Those machines that could be restored were among the exhibits of the museum. </p><h2>  Museum History (1991-present) </h2><p>  In the early 1990s, museum staff did a great job of arranging exhibits in open areas and in hangars.  The exposition was arranged in chronological order, which allowed to change the general appearance of the museum.  Museum visitors have become much more convenient to navigate on its territory. </p><p>  The Air Force Museum in Monino in the mid-1990s very often changed leadership, moreover, the civilian post of leader was abolished, and a military one was introduced instead.  The museum continues to improve its own organizational structure; as of 2015, it has four additional departments: propaganda, restoration, acquisition and exposure. </p><p>  The number of visitors to the museum is constantly growing, among them military, students, workers, schoolchildren, etc. Every day, excursions are held in the museum for everyone, their frequent participants are foreign tourists.  The museum has already been visited by people from more than 80 countries of the world, all of whom were delighted with the excellent condition of the exhibits.  According to the museum‚Äôs management, more than three million people have visited Monino since the opening of the exposition, and this figure is growing steadily. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Why in Monino? </h2>

    <p>  The Central Museum of the Air Force of the Russian Federation did not just happen to be in the village of Monino.  It was there that in 1940 the Air Force Academy was located, which could train at the new airfield.  Up to 4 thousand people could be accommodated in the existing premises, which the Academy immediately took advantage of, displacing the school of aviation specialists, which was located there. </p><p>  In the fall of 1940, the academy began its first academic year.  Between 1941 and 1945, air force units participating in the hostilities were deployed on the basis of an educational institution and an airfield.  It was there that at one time the legendary IL-4, long-range bombers, which played an important role in the battles for Moscow, was located. </p><p>  In 1943, a training regiment was formed on the basis of the academy, which successfully functioned until October 1946, when it was transformed into a mixed division.  The last classes at the academy took place in April 1956.  The airfield became too cramped for high-speed aircraft, and there was no way to extend the strip. </p><p>  It was then that the decision was made to organize <span>an aviation museum</span> in Monino in order to use the existing area and preserve the existing garrison.  For several months, the academy vacated the premises, and by the fall of 1956 the airfield was completely ready to organize a museum institution. </p><h2>  Exhibits </h2><p>  The museum exposition in Monino (Moscow) begins with stands that help the visitor get acquainted with the history of air navigation in Russia.  There you can also find documents about the very first experiments with aircraft, which were created to solve the most diverse needs of society. </p><p>  In the very first hall of the exhibition you can find out exactly how the aeronautical service appeared in the second half of the nineteenth century and what exactly it did.  The guides will be happy to talk about how Russian balloonists actively participated in the war of Russia with Japan in 1904-1905.  Further, moving to the following rooms, guests will be able to familiarize themselves with the development of aviation in chronological order. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2>

    <p>  As of the summer of 2015, the museum holds two <span>types of excursions.</span>  The first is a survey, during which guests visit three rooms, two hangars and an open parking lot.  The duration of such an excursion is a little more than an hour and a half, the maximum number of people in the group is 30. If the guest of the capital really wants to plunge into historical realities, he should go to Monino - the Museum of Aviation, the prices of which are quite affordable, will gladly accept it. </p><p>  The museum also hosts thematic excursions ("The Origin and Development of Aviation", "Air Force in the Second World War", "Air Force Development in the Modern Period"), which are popular among students and schoolchildren.  The cost of excursions ranges from 300 to 2000 rubles, for some categories of citizens discounts apply. </p><p>  Those who prefer to study historical exhibits on their own can simply purchase entrance tickets and enjoy the exposition.  The cost of a standard adult ticket is 150 rubles; a preferential ticket costs 60 rubles (for pupils, students, senior citizens, and also officers).  The main thing is to get to Monino, the museum is open all year and will be glad to guests. </p><h2>  Scientific work </h2>

    <p>  Employees of the Central Air Force Museum are constantly engaged in scientific research - writing publications and placing them in magazines on relevant topics.  Among other things, the museum constantly hosts scientific conferences on modern aviation, its history and development. </p><p>  If you are interested in scientific literature about the Soviet and Russian Air Force, which is not in stores, you can go to Monino, the museum often publishes books on this subject.  The cost of literature is quite affordable, and even fairly old books on aviation can be found in a cultural institution. </p><h2>  Exhibitions </h2><p>  The cultural institution, which is located in Monino (Moscow), is part of the Museum of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, dispersed over several metropolitan sites.  However, it is the Moninsky Museum that is visited most of all by guests of the capital and foreign tourists, since it is he who gives a chance to get in touch with the history of aviation. </p><p>  The cultural institution also periodically hosts exhibitions, in particular, in April 2015, the grand opening of the exposition prepared by the Central Military Commissariat of the Russian Federation and the National Museum of the Republic of Tyva took place.  The exhibition is dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the Victory in the Great Patriotic War and reflects the participation of the people's revolutionary army of Tuva in it.  It is planned that the exposition will work at least until the end of 2015. </p><p>  In June 2009, an exhibition was opened in one of the halls of the museum, dedicated to the uniform and armor of various times.  It offers the attention of viewers exhibits created in the period from the XIV to the beginning of the XX century.  Having visited the exposition, visitors can take photos in historical costumes, as well as practice archery. </p><h2>  Museum stock collections </h2>

    <p>  In the days of the USSR, everything that could become an exhibit went to Monino; the aviation museum willingly accepted it.  After the collapse of the USSR, the situation changed somewhat, now new exhibits more often appear in the museum thanks to the assistance of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation.  However, anyone can also contact a cultural institution and leave things for permanent storage. </p><p>  Among other things, visitors have the right to work in the clothing collection, which is often used by historians.  To gain access to the exhibits, you just need to fill out an application in the name of the museum management, as well as provide a passport or other identification card.  The fund is open to visitors on Wednesdays and Fridays. </p><h2>  Museum working hours </h2>
