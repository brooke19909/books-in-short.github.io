    <h2>  Brief introduction </h2><p>  Motorola RAZR V3 is a regular telephone for making calls and sending messages.  Produced by the company in 2004.  He proudly wore the title of flagship.  Against the background of models of other brands, he stood out clearly with an unusual design.  The developers provided the buyer with a clamshell phone with a very thin profile.  The keyboard also attracted attention.  It is made of metal plate.  For ease of use, there is an electroluminescent backlight. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The name of this phone was not chosen by chance.  In English, the word razor means razor.  But if you look closely at the device, the metal case of small thickness has similarities with this device. </p><h2>  Modification Black </h2><p>  The classic version of the Motorola RAZR V3 phone is a device with a silver casing.  However, the manufacturer also released a black version, which was specially designed as a gift for the Oscars.  Initially, this modification was distributed only in North America, and in a limited number.  But a little later it became available in other countries.  Black has no special differences from the silver version, only in the color scheme. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone motorola razr v3" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1916472.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Hot Pink Version </h2><p>  After the successful launch of the classic version, the Motorola RAZR V3 was released in pink.  The presentation of the model took place in October 2005.  She quickly gained popularity among the female half of the population.  Officially, the model was called RAZR V3 Pink.  However, some operators sold it with the Magenta prefix. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Motorola battery razr v3" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1916473.jpg" width="452"></div>

The operator T-Mobile USA offered the buyer a phone with an unusually designed case.  It was engraved in the form of a tattoo.  The drawing was developed by professional master Amy James.  He is a true pro and expert in his field, at that time he was the star of a reality show called Miami Ink. </p><p>  The manufacturer with great pleasure made such an updated decision.  The tattoo was applied to the body using laser engraving. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  What are the technical characteristics of this model?  The first thing the buyer pays attention to is the screen.  It is worth noting that the phone is equipped with two displays.  The main diagonal was 2.2 ∫.  The resolution is not very large, but in such phones it is not uncommon.  The image is displayed in 220 √ó 176 px format.  Unfortunately, the technology of those times did not allow creating screens with impeccable quality.  The clarity and contrast of the image are quite acceptable, but you can see the pixelation with the naked eye.  The color rendering level was limited to 262 thousand shades. </p><p>  The external display is small.  Its type is STN.  A resolution of 96 √ó 80 px was enough to make the information readable.  It is colored, supports more than four thousand shades. </p><p>  An equally important role in any mobile phone is played by the battery.  The Motorola RAZR V3 is equipped with a battery with a capacity of 680 milliamps per hour.  The battery is manufactured in compliance with lithium-ion technology.  In standby mode, the phone can work up to 280 hours. Lovers of long conversations will have to charge the battery after about 5 hours. </p><p>  This unit has a camera.  With it, you can take pictures and record videos.  The resolution of the latter is limited by the size of 176 √ó 144 px.  The quality of the pictures will be slightly better - 640 √ó 480 pixels.  The camera is not equipped with a flash and autofocus, which significantly affects the quality.  You can take pictures only in good light. </p><p>  To work with the phone, the manufacturer provided a built-in memory storage.  Its volume available to the user will be slightly more than seven megabytes. </p><p>  There are two ways to transfer data in the device: one - wired (mini-USB), the second - wireless (Bluetooth).  There is also a GPRS module.  The phone perfectly catches the network, works with standard size SIM cards.  According to users, failures in signal reception do not happen. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Motorola clamshell razr v3" class="if" height="457" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1916474.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  If you study the reviews of experts, we can conclude that the "clamshell" "Motorola RAZR V3" is an image device.  Its main purpose is to highlight the special status of the owner.  Unfortunately, the main focus was on the design, which could not but affect the technical specifications.  According to experts, they are not so outstanding.  Most owners for a very long time got used to the features of the interface. </p><p>  The most significant drawback of this model is the camera.  At that time, there were already enough devices on the mobile device market that were equipped with higher resolution optics.  But be that as it may, the RAZR V3 device is recognized as a cult cell phone in the world. </p>
