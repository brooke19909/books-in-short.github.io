    <h2>  Developer "SPb Renovation" </h2><p>  Reviews of the company‚Äôs activities began to arrive almost immediately, since the work plans were literally ambitious.  The city government instructed precisely this developer to create the future look of the city, with its help each district grows and develops individually, which means the entire metropolis as a whole.  Reconstruction objects, which occupy more than nine hundred hectares, are updated and changed for the better, which is why St. Petersburg Renovation collects so many reviews. </p><p>  This infrastructure facilities, and public and social institutions, and commercial premises, and residential, as well as the entire volume of communication and engineering systems.  And in all the good changes the company "SPb Renovation" participated.  The reviews say the following: the well-being of the city‚Äôs residents is improving - both emotional and social, the city is gradually transforming, and some areas are being revived, thereby raising the standard of living of many Petersburgers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Specifically about the reviews </h2><p>  Most of them have been written about shared construction, since the company works hard in the construction of objects not only commercial but also residential.  In the resort area, near the Gulf of Finland, the buildings that were erected by the developer SPb Renovation flaunt.  Feedback from equity holders is mostly grateful.  We are talking about multi-apartment complexes that are designed for the mass consumer, nevertheless equipped with the most modern engineering, built according to the latest, high comfort projects. </p><p>  The first project of the St. Petersburg Renovation group was earned by investors as far back as 2014, and they mostly positively assess the constructed and commissioned housing complex Sunday.  After the first experiment, Petersburgers began to deeply trust this developer, as, indeed, and many other state programs.  There are several reviews complaining about the postponement of implementation, but in fairness it should be noted that the company "St. Petersburg Renovation" has not yet allowed any long-term construction.  Employee reviews mark the moment that there is practically no staff turnover in this company, high-class professionals work there, who value their work very, very much.  And competitors envy and write fake reviews on the Internet, which, however, are easy to expose. </p>

    <h2>  Resettlement </h2><p>  Improving the living conditions of Petersburgers, including the resettlement of numerous communal apartments in this city, and the overhaul of Khrushchev-type houses are the main problem facing the government of St. Petersburg.  It began to be solved back in the last century, however, this work really unfolded now.  Town planners considered a huge number of various proposals and projects, among which the "Renovation Program" was the most interesting of all. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Along with the improvement of living space, no one suggested complete improvement of all adjacent territories, so that the changes corresponded to the appearance of the city, its spirit.  This is now done by St. Petersburg Renovation.  The construction company receives reviews literally about each of its commissioned facilities, and almost all of them are positive.  This is not at all surprising: the company was created specifically for the implementation of the "Renovation Program", and so far this is the only case when the developer appears for a specific project. </p>

    <h2>  For the good of the city </h2><p>  Reviews about SPb Renovation are received in the course of fulfilling the plans outlined by the government, and more than nine hundred hectares of the city have already been developed, where the complex has reconstructed domestic and social infrastructure, and engineering networks have been updated. </p><p>  People felt an increase in living standards, many Petersburg families were able to get their own apartments and leave their communal.  And not "in the virgin lands", but in well-developed and developed urban areas.  All this formed a high assessment of the public opinion of the activities carried out by the company "St. Petersburg Renovation".  Employee reviews are filled with joy from such trust in their company. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Steady Quality Growth </h2><p>  Everything suggests that the company will justify the trust in the future.  In the reviews of the company‚Äôs employees, the main landmarks are indicated - steadily growing development indicators of those areas that are being developed by the developer, ensuring the planned development of St. Petersburg as a whole. </p><p>  And the new housing, which is intended for resettlement, will continue to be carried out in good faith.

    <h2>  LCD Stereos </h2><p>  This quarter is located in the Krasnogvardeisky district of the city.  Like most objects of St. Petersburg Renovation, Stereos has received numerous feedback from investors, where luck is especially noted in choosing an architectural concept developed by masters from Europe - the architectural bureau from France AS Architecture Studio.  Indeed, the eye never ceases to be surprised at the new and interesting frame-monolithic buildings that replace the old and unsightly housing of Rzhevka.  On an area of ‚Äã‚Äãtwenty hectares, there are two ten-story buildings and seven seventeen-story buildings in a single complex. </p><p>  Real estate investors rejoice that their apartments will be spacious and tall - 298 centimeters high ceilings.  The balconies are perfectly glazed, the finish is everywhere fine: vinyl wallpaper, laminate, ceramic tiles on the floor and walls of the kitchen and sanitary facilities, durable plumbing.  Ecological double-glazed windows - wooden, metal entrance doors.  <span>Engineering communications are</span> all in place.  Halls and common areas delight real estate investors with designer finishes.  Passenger and freight elevators.  The first floors are given to services and trade.  Underground level with parking, where you can go down from any floor. </p>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The yards of the Stereos housing complex are closed, with minimal traffic, landscaped with playgrounds, sports and walking areas, there are places for recreation.  Guest parking is equipped. </p><p>  The territory is richly landscaped, guarded, video surveillance is installed.  A private school is built right inside the housing complex, there is a polyclinic nearby, and many shops.  Transport accessibility is excellent, however, the metro is within walking distance.  There are trams and electric trains from the station "Rzhevka".  Ecologically, this is not too good: industrial enterprises are quite close, as well as two large highways with constant traffic jams. </p><h2>  LCD "Astrid" </h2><p>  Another <span>housing complex</span> on nine hectares is located in Kolpino, where instead of the old two-story houses, by the end of 2017, new, multi-sectional buildings will show off.  Here, the developer is also "Renovation of St. Petersburg."  Reviews of those who received the keys to new apartments in already built complexes are unlikely to differ from those who receive housing here.  Unless now they will contain even higher grades. </p><p>  In the center of the Astrid complex, the project will show off a square in the form of a rotunda with roads and streets leaving from it in different directions.  In the greened courtyards there will be constant video surveillance, on the roof of the parking lot - recreation, sports, playgrounds.  Schools, hypermarkets, kindergartens, cafes, offices, clinics already exist in all neighborhoods.  Nevertheless, all the first floors will be given to shops, beauty salons, dental offices and other institutions of the service sector. </p><h2>  LCD "Big Moscow" </h2><p>  Another way to renovate the quarter is to build modern houses in place of dilapidated and low-rise buildings.  This is the <span>Moscow district of St. Petersburg,</span> and the updated quarter was also designed by French architects.  In the first stage, six frame-monolithic buildings with underground parking.  Excellent quality of work performed is noted in almost every review.  The apartments are fully finished turnkey: textured wallpaper (vinyl), wear-resistant laminate, beautiful ceramic tiles in the bathrooms, expensive plumbing, even sockets and leads for washing machines are provided. </p><p>  Double-glazed windows are wooden, energy-saving, in metal doors - imported locks, glazing of loggias and balconies frameless.  On the ground floor there are utility rooms - pantries, strollers and the like.  Elevators are high-speed.  Engineering communications replaced by new ones.  This is the central district of the city, so the infrastructure is developed according to such a metropolis, that is, there is everything.  Own infrastructure owns two kindergartens, four schools, a clinic and commercial premises, which are located along the entire length of the first floors. </p>

    <h2>  LCD "Malaya Okhta" </h2><p>  Two and a half hectares in the Krasnogvardeisky <span>district of St. Petersburg</span> is occupied by the new housing complex Malaya Okhta, and the company SPb Renovation took over the construction.  Previously, there were only emergency buildings, now they are demolished.  Those one hundred and twenty families that lived in them will now live in a new quarter, without moving to another area. </p><p>  Sixteen brick-monolithic buildings of one hundred twenty-four thousand square meters are an excellent replacement for the old foundation.  Moreover, the new project was developed by English architects of the company PRP Architects.  The infrastructure here is good, including its own.  The only negative noted in the reviews is the environment by industrial enterprises.  However, there is a lot of greenery - near Malookhtinsky Park, Yablonovsky Garden, two rivers flow nearby - Okhta and Okkervil. </p>
