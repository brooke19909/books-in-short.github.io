    <p>  The small picturesque Silver Sands Beach Resort 3 * hotel is located in the southern part of Goa, namely, in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe resort town called Colva.  An indisputable advantage of the hotel is its proximity to the beach, which can be reached in a matter of minutes.  Margao is 3 km from the property.  But the nearest airport is located further, about 22 km, in the city of Dabolim. </p><p>  This is a small but incredibly comfortable hotel complex.  Its area is approximately 4.4 thousand square meters.  In the center is the main building of the hotel, which, incidentally, was built in 1990.  But in 2009, the last complete restoration was carried out and today this place is striking in its beautiful design and elegance.  The whole territory is decorated with greenery.  There is a small garden where tourists like to spend time.  In the courtyard there is a swimming pool, relaxation terraces, sports grounds, evenly cut lawns. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel Silver Sands Beach Resort 3 * (Colva): description and photos of rooms </h2>
