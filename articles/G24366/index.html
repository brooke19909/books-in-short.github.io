And sometimes such events are included in the program of adult corporate parties.  And then all of us women are visited by the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat would be so interesting to create.  We will talk about how to make an original creative outfit for a competition or a <span>costume party</span> in this article.  After reviewing the information presented here, you will learn how to make <span>dresses from improvised materials.</span>  Photos of such works can also be seen.

    <h2>  A CD outfit is a brilliant idea!  Method number 1 </h2><p>  We will create this version of the product from lasers.  In addition to them, you will need <span>sewing accessories,</span> scissors, an awl and a long tunic for work. </p><p>  We begin the process of making a dress from improvised material - a disk.  First of all, you need to do the preparatory work - to solder the holes in the round parts.  To do this, over the candle or gas stove we heat the tip of the awl and solder it with one hole in each disk along the edge.  Next, lay out the shirt (tunic) on the table and, starting from the bottom edge, sew the shiny elements.  We attach them symmetrically to each other around the entire circumference of the product.  When the first tier is attached, we proceed to the design of the second.  If you want to create the effect of scales, then now impose a little discs on those located below.  Thus, we draw up the entire shirt. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Carnival costume made of laser.  Method number 2 </h2><p>  Dresses from improvised material (disk) can be done differently.  In this case, round elements will not overlap each other.  In lasers we burn holes as described in the previous part of the article.  Only we do not one, but four holes located at the same distance from each other.  Next, we sew the disks together.  To do this, insert the thread into the needle and tie a large knot so that it does not slip into the hole.  Insert the needle into the hole on one part, stretch the thread.  Next, insert the needle into the hole of another laser circle and withdraw on the wrong side.  Repeat these steps a few more times.  Then we fix the thread and cut it off.  Thus, we connect in a row the desired number of disks.  We make out several of these ribbons.  From them we form an integral rectangular web, stitching the disks horizontally according to the same principle.  When the workpiece is the size you need, connect it along the edges, forming a "tunnel".  Sew the product on a long T-shirt for the holes in the disks of the upper row.  It turns out a kind of sundress.  If desired, you can issue straps.  The outfit is ready. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dresses from improvised materials photo" class="if" height="466" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/371637.jpg?1397163169529" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  <span>Autumn dresses</span> from improvised materials.  How to make such an outfit? </h2><p>  We will make a costume for the autumn ball from fallen leaves.  We collect a lot of them, we give preference to whole and beautiful specimens.  In addition to them, we prepare a needle, threads and a simple, simple sundress (without frills and decorative ornaments).  Such a suit is simple.  Sew the leaves, starting from the bottom of the dress, by the tail.  Arranged from close to each other.  First we decorate the first tier, then the second, overlapping the foliage.  Thus we sheathe the entire product.  The work is quite laborious, but the result is worth it. </p><p>  When performing this model, it should be borne in mind that the foliage quickly withers.  Therefore, to make dresses from improvised material of this kind should be on the eve of the celebration, and keep the finished product in a cool room, occasionally sprinkling it with water. </p><h2>  Paper dress - fast, simple and beautiful </h2><p>  This version of the outfit from improvised material is the easiest to manufacture.  Corrugated paper, scissors and glue - we create an original costume from these materials.  All work is carried out directly on the model itself.  Wrap a roll of paper in the chest area twice, cut off the excess.  Glue the edge.  We give the bodice the desired shape, slightly crumpling the paper in the right places.  Fold the other roll with an accordion.  Glue one edge of this blank to the one already on the model, forming a skirt.  You can make it not one, but several.  It turns out a kind of pack.  It remains to glue straps from strips of paper.  Use paper bows or flowers for decoration. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="autumn dresses from improvised materials" class="if" height="460" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/371650.jpg" width="337"></div>
