This is what most people who have already been here talk about: </p><ul><li>  When checking in, a deposit of $ 100 is required.  He will be returned in full upon eviction. </li><li>  If guests arrived earlier than check-in (from 14:00), they can be accommodated immediately.  But only if there are free and ready to move in numbers. </li><li>  The apartments are gorgeous, as in the photo.  Many worry that there are no balconies, but this is not a problem - the windows open, so that no one will be stuffy. </li><li>  When placing 1 child under 12 years of age, an additional fee for him is not charged.  For children under the age of 3, a separate cot is provided for free. </li><li>  The rooftop pool is striking in its cleanliness.  Towels can not be taken - they are issued at the entrance.  In the jacuzzi, the water is very warm, and the massage option can be turned on independently.  However, the rooftop does not catch Wi-Fi. </li><li>  Guests are given 2 bottles of water upon arrival.  Every day in the refrigerator report more. </li><li>  Cleaning is carried out daily and efficiently.  They change towels and bedding, replenish supplies of sugar, cream, tea, coffee.  Maids also report soap, shower caps, creams, gels, shampoos.  You can not take anything with you on vacation. </li><li>  The safe and refrigerator in the room can be used for free, and not for money, as in many other hotels. </li><li>  In the lobby there is a small Internet corner with computers, one of them with a printer.  You can use it for free. </li><li>  If you need to call the local number - you can do this from the reception.  Managers will politely help you book a tour, tour, call a taxi, etc. </li></ul><p>  After reviewing the reviews, we can conclude that the Grandeur Hotel is a city hotel with modern comfortable rooms, chic service and excellent attitude towards guests.  And with low prices for accommodation besides!  About them will be discussed later. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hoteis.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hall at Grandeur Hotel" class="if uuid-2560210" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2560210.jpg"></div><h2>  Recommendations </h2><p>  People who have already visited Dubai often leave tips in their reviews that may turn out to be useful for travelers who are only going to come here.  Here are the 5 most common recommendations: </p><ul><li>  The area is very busy.  Nearby there is everything - shops, restaurants, Internet cafes, hypermarkets, exchangers, as well as countless branded boutiques.  We definitely need to go here with a considerable amount of money in order to spend it with pleasure on profitable shopping. </li><li>  If you leave the hotel, then go right and go around the building, you will see a small grocery store across the road.  There is a good choice, low prices, and you can still pay in dollars. </li><li>  Change currency is best in Mall of the Emirates.  This shopping center is located next to Carrefour hypermarket.  You can get to it quickly - you just need to turn right from the hotel and go straight ahead. </li><li>  If tourists went on a trip with a company of 4 people, it is most profitable to take a taxi around the city.  In the UAE, it is very cheap.  In addition, it will bring where it is necessary - there will be no need to knock down legs in search of this or that place. </li><li>  It is highly recommended that you look at the singing fountains.  People resting here went to them every day.  This free sight gives unforgettable emotions. </li></ul><p>  By the way, if you want impressions, you can order several excursions.  It is better to contact the hotel administrator for help and in no case take them to the beach.  There tours are offered at, to put it mildly, inflated prices. </p><h2>  Voucher cost </h2><p>  For two people, the price of a tour to Dubai, at the Grandeur Hotel, is about 70,000 rubles.  This price includes: </p><ul><li>  Flights from Moscow to Dubai and back. </li><li>  Accommodation in a 2-bed superior room (7 days / 6 nights). </li><li>  Breakfast </li><li>  Medical insurance. </li><li>  Transfer from the airport to the hotel and back. </li></ul><p>  This is just one example.  Today there are many trips - you can go on a trip at least 3 days, at least 3 weeks.  The price will differ from the term, room category, airline and, of course, the time of year.  In low season, tour operators offer the lowest rates. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.viamichelin.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nara Grandeur Hotel Thailand" class="if uuid-2560211" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2560211.jpg"></div><h2>  Nara grandeur hotel </h2><p>  In conclusion, I would like to talk about a hotel with the same name, which is located in Thailand, just a 10-minute walk from the famous Patong Beach. </p><p>  This complex, presented above in the photo, really deserves attention.  Nara Grandeur Hotel (Patong) is a luxury grand hotel located in the heart of the city.  In just 5 minutes you can walk to the largest shopping center called Jungceylon.  A trip to the airport will take only 50 minutes. </p><p>  This is a city boutique hotel.  Its peculiarity is comfortable rooms decorated in a modern style, freshly renovated, plumbing shiny from the novelty, as well as delicious food and high-class service.  The staff here, by the way, speaks three languages ‚Äã‚Äã- Thai, English and Russian. </p><p>  This is an ideal hotel for people who do not care about entertainment, but the level of service and the atmosphere of luxury. </p><p>  For two people a trip here will cost about 70,000 p.  Includes accommodation in a room (9 days / 8 nights), round-trip flights, transfer and medical insurance. </p>
