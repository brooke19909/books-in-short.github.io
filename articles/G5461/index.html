There were times when, moving from one coast to another, people used boats, built land crossings and built ferries.  Today, bridges are a means of communication of 2 coasts, a means to reduce the path of movement and to be able to lay a variety of cables along a shorter path, etc. These fantastic buildings are a real miracle of architecture, not only durable and reliable, but also beautiful. </p><p>  The construction of the bridge described in this article was at one time the most important step in the development of the Russian transport network and the city of Ulyanovsk. </p><p>  Before we get to the question of how the Presidential Bridge was built, we will talk a little about another similar remarkable construction of Ulyanovsk. </p>

    <h2>  Imperial bridge </h2><p>  This bridge is unofficially called the Liberty Bridge, Simbirsk and Ulyanovsk (and now the Old).  It was built during the reign of Nicholas II (in 1913-1916).  Then the city was called Simbirsk. </p><p>  At first the bridge was a railway, and then automobile roads were added to it.  The <span>Imperial Bridge</span> belonged to beam structures.  In those days, the bridge was considered the largest in Europe.  Over 3,500 specialists participated in its construction. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The bridge across the Volga was reconstructed several times.  Its last repair was in 2003-2010.  Citizens recall that from the left bank to get to the city center through the bridge was possible only on schedule. </p><p>  On the island under the bridge you can see a huge cross.  It is put in memory of the tragedy that occurred at this place.  In June 5, 1983, a tragic accident occurred - the cruise ship Alexander Suvorov crashed as a result of passing under a bridge that was not navigable.  The official number of victims was 176 people. </p>

    <p>  After another (Presidential) bridge was erected in Ulyanovsk, the old Imperial bridge became less busy. </p><h2>  The history of the construction of the new bridge </h2><p>  Many residents of Ulyanovsk still remember this lengthy process of building a unique bridge, including the period when its construction was suspended during the Soviet era.  The construction of the longest bridge in Russia has been ongoing for 23 years.  Total costs for 2008 prices amounted to 38.4 billion rubles. </p><p>  Its design began in 1980, and already in 1983 the first stone was laid.  According to plans, they should have completely built it in 10 years.  But construction work began only in 1986, and in 1995 they were suspended due to lack of funding from the state.  Resumed construction in 1998. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  As a result, after long years of work, all design decisions were introduced.  The Presidential bridge in Ulyanovsk was completed.  The official opening ceremony of its first stage took place in 2009 in November.  It was attended by D. Medvedev.  The second phase opened in November 2011. </p><h2>  Bridge options </h2><p>  The length of the Presidential bridge is 5.8 km, and the total length of the 1st launch complex is almost 13 kilometers. </p><p>  The structure of the facility includes 6 overpasses.  The length of one bridge span is 220 meters (each weighing more than 4 thousand tons).  The bridge is structurally designed for a throughput of up to 40 thousand cars per day. </p><p>  The Presidential bridge in the upper tier has a width of 25 meters (dimensions - 21 meters with bike paths of 100 centimeters and sidewalks of 1.5 m).  In two directions there are 2 lanes, there is a central dividing strip (this corresponds to the route of the 1st category). </p>

    <p>  The lower tier (2nd stage of construction) has a width of 13 meters.  It is planned to run a light rail in 2 lanes. </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  The new Ulyanovsk bridge across the Volga was built using the most unique technology of trellised farms (spans), the parameters of which are presented above.  Such an innovation made it possible to reduce the cost of construction works by more than 1 billion rubles and significantly reduce the time (more than 1 year). </p><p>  The Presidential Bridge is able to withstand strong hurricane winds and violent earthquakes.  It is the second longest bridge in Europe.  In the first place, the Lisbon <span>bridge of Vasco da Gama,</span> reaching 17.2 kilometers in length with access roads. </p><p>  To enter the bridge in Ulyanovsk, a special roundabout was built for the convenience of citizens, which can significantly save time. </p>

    <h2>  View of the Ulyanovsk bridges </h2><p>  The Presidential Bridge in Ulyanovsk can be seen from the high stele, located on the square of the 30th anniversary of the Victory.  From this place, where the eternal flame is located (exit from the Imperial bridge to the central part of the city), you can see an excellent panorama of the Volga River along with bridges. </p><p>  It offers an impressive view of the reservoir. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The Presidential Bridge is a significant section of the transport corridor that connects part of Russia (European) with the Far East, Siberia and the Urals.  It became part of the most important Ulyanovsk transport hub, and most importantly, laid the foundation for a new route for cars in the international Transsib corridor, which is significant for the whole country.  The construction of the bridge helped to improve the transport system of the city and a huge area. </p><p>  Perhaps the bridge was so named in connection with the fact that at that time the head of the country D.A. Medvedev, who, along with Azerbaijani President <span>I. Aliyev</span> , attended this important and honorable ceremony, came to its grand opening. </p>
