In this state, you can really spend your vacation inexpensively, and moreover, this will not affect the quality of the services provided.  In addition, often staying in a particular hotel is provided with discounts (and decent).  So, in the Bilem High Class Hotel 4 * two people can spend nine unforgettable nights in a double room for only 17 thousand rubles.  Such prices attract tourists, given that Turkey is famous for the quality of service. </p><h2>  <span>Rest in Antalya</span> according to the Fortune system </h2>

    <p>  You should pay attention to the system, which is called Fortuna 5 * (Antalya).  It is worth saying that this is a very popular service.  What does it consist of?  Potential tourists reserve the Fortuna 5 * service, and at the same time they are completely ignorant of where they will be accommodated.  Many people like to try their luck this way, preparing a pleasant surprise for themselves.  And after the tourist arrives in Turkey, he will be settled in the Fortuna 5 * hotel.  Thus, in addition, you can significantly save money, because such vouchers are not very expensive.  When buying a tour, a person is guaranteed accommodation in a hotel of those that meet all the agreed conditions.  But the name will be announced either on the eve of arrival, or immediately after arrival. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The essence of the system </h2><p>  What does it consist of?  Everything is based on the following principle: a few days before the tour starts, the hotels leave several free rooms, which the hotel offers at very low prices.  A person who decides to use this <span>type of service</span> will absolutely win: a good tour, bought cheaply, and a stay at a hotel with excellent service. </p>

    <p>  This is a spacious hotel, located on a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã3.5 thousand square meters.  m. The hotel offers potential guests 64 rooms, from whose windows a bewitching view of the sea, the beach and picturesque landscapes opens.  Of these, 40 are standard (a bedroom for two people, it is possible to place one more, plus a bathroom) and 24 are family (also for two, but you can also add two more, there is a bathroom, a living room and a bedroom).  Room service is carried out every day, bed linen is changed every other day.  The rooms can be equipped with individual air conditioning, a safe, satellite TV, telephone and many other small things are offered.  By the way, in each room the floor is covered with a soft, pleasant carpet. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Fortuna Antalya 5 * - leisure features </h2><p>  When making a voucher, a person must choose the class of the hotel, that is, the number of stars.  And also the desired type of food, the duration of the tour and, of course, the date of departure.  The 5-star Fortuna system is most often chosen because the cost of the tours is rather modest.  And if it‚Äôs already decided to use such a service, then why not provide yourself with top-level rest at an average price? </p><p>  The Fortuna 5 * system is especially in demand among people who do not want to get into a situation where ‚Äúforced relocation‚Äù is required, when the hotel, the room in which is booked in advance, is replaced by some other, as the places spontaneously run out.  This is done without warning, and tourists are definitely unpleasant. </p>

    <p>  But if you use the Fortuna 5 * service (Turkey), then this probability is excluded.  Or as a last resort, if the hotel, where it was planned to accommodate a tourist who decided to use Fortuna, would really be crowded, he would not know about it.  After all, as mentioned above, a person is not informed until the last moment where he will be accommodated.  So if the place suddenly changes, then he will not know about it.  This only improves the quality of rest, because the psychological factor is very important. </p><h2>  Comments of tourists </h2><p>  Based on the above advantages, we can assume that many want to use the Fortuna 5 * service.  Reviews are the factor that many rely on when deciding whether to book a ticket of this kind or not.  It should be noted that there is no risk if you contact the appropriate, verified companies.  Some people, of course, because of their superstition, prepare for the worst, but in vain - usually everything goes smoothly.  This is where opinions help, not just about the service itself, but about tour operators.  People who used Fortune mostly leave positive feedback.  Basically, it is recommended to try the luck of lovers of spontaneous relaxation, the hot sun and warm sea.  Of course, all polls mark the first thing the cost, which is lower by 20, or even more percent than usual.  Many even booked themselves such tours repeatedly.  Service, food, furnishings - everything is as it would be if a person had previously booked a vacation in a middle-class hotel. </p><h2>  Surprise lovers recommended </h2>

    <p>  Adherents of spontaneity prefer to relax in this way, but lovers will have to keep everything under control of ‚ÄúFortune‚Äù if they try it at least once.  After all, this is by no means an unpredictable lottery: everything is carefully planned by tourist operators, rooms can only be booked in good hotels in Turkish resorts.  And this has already been confirmed by many people who decided to use this method of rest.  One thing can be said with absolute certainty: a stay at Fortuna 5 * hotels will be unforgettable and pleasantly unpredictable.  After all, it is really interesting to inspect a hotel that has never seen before (and if a tourist has read anything about it, then clearly could not assume that it will get there), and to study it immediately after checking in, and not when viewing photos. </p>
