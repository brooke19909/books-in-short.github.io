    <p>  Nokia 6700 Gold phones have three protocols for sending and receiving emails.  More specifically, these are IMAP4, POP3, and SMTP.  There are not many communication opportunities here.  To transfer files wirelessly (after pairing with the appropriate device), the Bluetooth module version 2.1 is provided.  Yes, the transmission speed will not be so high that it can boast of something, and you won‚Äôt be able to connect a wireless headset due to the lack of an A2D2 profile.  But in general, the module copes with the main tasks assigned to it. </p><p>  You can connect to a computer or personal laptop using the MicroUSB standard port.  After the drivers are automatically installed on your computer, you will be able to work with the internal file storage or integrated external microSD drive.  The phone supports sending not only text messages, but also MMS messages.  To access the Internet, you can use the second generation cellular network protocols (GPRS and EDGE), as well as the third generation protocol (HSDPA).  An improved version (HSDPA +) is missing, but it is, in principle, not needed here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  The Nokia 6700 Gold Edition phone has only one camera.  But its module is designed for 5 megapixels.  For an ordinary phone, of which the model is, this is a good indicator worthy of respect.  Especially if we take into account the fact that the user can use digital four-time zoom.  The camera also supports the auto focus function on the subject.  To create pictures in low light conditions (or in its complete absence), an LED flash is provided. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Multimedia </h2>

If we talk about video formats, the 6700 Nokia Gold ‚Äúreads‚Äù 3GP and MP4.  A voice recorder is built into the phone.  As a ringtone, you can set 64-voice polyphonic files. </p><h2>  Offline work </h2>

    <p>  As a source of battery life, the 6700 Nokia Gold has a lithium-ion battery.  Its capacity reaches 960 milliampere-hours.  Such indicators are enough for the device to live in standby mode up to 300 hours.  If we talk about the time of continuous conversation, then the figure is several times less, which, in principle, is expected.  However, it is five hours. </p><h2>  Additional equipment </h2>

    <p>  The telephone delivery set provides, besides its availability, disks with MSN software.  There you can find a music file manager, as well as a text messaging program.  Also included in the package is a wire for synchronization with a USB 2.0 port on a computer or laptop.  There is also a case with a wired headset.  The package ends with a microSD memory card, which is designed for 8 gigabytes. </p><h2>  Phone story </h2><p>  What can be said about how the 6700 model was created in general?  We are now seeing the Finnish manufacturer on the other side.  After Microsoft bought them, Nokia devices gradually changed their names.  However, this does not change the essence of the matter: internal competition is sometimes more acute for the manufacturer than external.  Extremely suspicious is the fact that two devices for the same price have differing technical characteristics and compete with each other. </p><p>  This unpleasant trend has roots in the distant past of the company.  The Nokia 6700 model is also associated with it. Its creation was due to the fact that it was necessary to interrupt the success of the sale of the <span>Nokia 6300,</span> which at one time became a bestseller.  In parallel, a device is created with the code 6303. And these three models begin to compete with each other, forming a fancy triangle.  Probably, here the game is in the ‚Äú2 vs 1‚Äù format, but the fact is still a fact. </p><h2>  Overall dimensions </h2><p>  The gold model was created as a new color scheme, but its performance has not changed compared to other versions.  Before us is the same Nokia 6700. The dimensions of the device are as follows.  In height, it reaches 109.8 mm.  The width and thickness of the apparatus are respectively 45 and 11.2 millimeters.  With such indicators, the mass of the device does not exceed 116.5 grams. </p><h2>  Features of use </h2><p>  The size of the model can truly be called comfortable.  A surprisingly small mass appealed to many people who made their choice in favor of a golden model or other color design.  By the way, the back of the phone is made of a material that we call stainless steel.  It cools your hand nicely, the phone does not have the ability to overheat when used or due to weather conditions.  Although the golden color is not the most practical, because if not handled carefully, scratches will appear on it that will be noticeable to the naked eye.  Black color solution for the phone in this regard turned out to be much more successful. </p><h2>  Arrangement of elements </h2><p>  On the back surface, made, as was said earlier, of stainless steel, we can find a camera.  Its resolution is five million pixels.  There is also an LED flash.  There is a sound speaker on the other side of the camera module.  On the right side you can find a paired key that allows you to adjust the sound volume or change the sound mode.  Interestingly, in the decision of the Finnish company, even the camera button is implemented.  At the bottom there is a port that is provided for synchronization with a personal computer or laptop.  Next to it is a socket for connecting a 2 millimeter standard charger. </p><h2>  Material quality and assembly </h2><p>  There are no special comments on this phone.  Both of them correspond to the best samples.  Especially the golden model that we are talking about today.  Yes, maybe its practicality makes me doubt it, but in fact the phone was assembled soundly.  There are no backlash buttons or other elements.  The device does not creak.  By the way, not only the back cover, but also the front panel is made of metal. </p><h2>  Analogs </h2><p>  It would be very boring to talk about the external competitors of the model, since there are many of them.  But the internal counterparts are a rather interesting topic.  Especially given the fact that the Finnish manufacturer set himself up in this business, pursuing an incomprehensible pricing policy.  The closest competitor, as was said, is the Nokia 6303, created according to the same plan and with the same goals.  Leave her alone.  But the <span>Nokia 8800 Arte</span> variant looks more interesting.  This phone has similar materials, it is perceived in exactly the same way, and generally inferior to the subject of our today's review, far from everything. </p><h2>  Conclusion and reviews </h2><p>  Few people were unsatisfied with the purchase of the model.  Many owners of this phone note that it has long served faithfully.  What did they like so much?  Firstly, build quality.  Secondly, good photographic opportunities.  Thirdly, fundamental changes in the phone.  Now the model makes it possible to work with applications in the background.  Yes, there is no window, but they can be called from the menu.  In general, we will not be able to say anything bad about this model.  And it‚Äôs nice. </p>
