Not all complexes are suitable for families, especially if you have kids with you.  In our article we want to give examples of Costa Brava hotels for families with children.  Such complexes should have minimum conditions for kids: a playground, a pool, a mini club. </p><p>  It should be understood that the territory of hotels in Costa Brava is small, and therefore they often do not have a minimum set of services for children.  Nevertheless, among the institutions you can choose those that are good for families. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.blauhotelsblanes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Costa Brava Hotels" class="if uuid-2293159" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2293159.jpg"></div><p>  According to reviews, hotels of Blanes (Costa Brava) is the place to go with children.  The resort itself is ideal for couples.  In fact, the resort village can be safely called a city.  There is a well-developed infrastructure, entertainment, cafes and restaurants.  And in the evenings you will definitely not be bored.  In the city there is where to walk and have fun.  Many of his hotels are family oriented, including the four-star Blumar.  It is located just a hundred meters from the beach on the outskirts of Blanes.  Of course, you have to walk to the center, but there is a wonderful park area nearby where you can walk with the kids. </p><p>  For any tourist, food is of great importance, especially if you go on vacation with a child.  Nobody wants to be puzzled on vacation with nutrition problems.  So it is necessary to choose an institution where you can offer a decent diet.  The Blumar Hotel offers a wide variety of food, including all kinds of theme nights.  In addition, soups and cereals are prepared for children here.  So babies will always be something to feed. </p><p>  The territory of the complex is combined with the three-star establishment ‚ÄúBlausel‚Äù.  It has a spacious playground, a mini-playground for sports and a private pool for young tourists.  But the mini-club is open for guests only in the high season, which lasts only a park of months, so it makes no sense to rely on it.  As for the rooms, they are small and cramped, which is typical for most resorts in Spain. </p><h2>  Beverly Park </h2><p>  ‚ÄúBeverly Park‚Äù is another Blanes hotel (Costa Brava), reviews of which suggest that it is suitable for a good holiday with the kids.  It is located in a park area among coniferous trees.  The road to the sea does not take more than five minutes.  Moreover, going through the park area is a pleasure.  Near the hotel there is a recreation area, a playground.  The complex has a kids club, but, unfortunately, it works only one month a year.  By the way, according to tourists' reviews, it can be said that children's institutions, as a rule, are not Russian-speaking.  This point is worth considering.  Usually the animation is in Spanish or English. </p><p>  The hotel restaurant offers a fairly varied diet.  Among the dishes you can always pick up something for the children.  This 4 * hotel in Costa Brava (Spain) has more spacious rooms than, for example, the previous complex.  This apartment will accommodate an extra bed for your baby.  In general, Beverly Park is a hotel in Blanes (Spain, Costa Brava), which can be recommended for families with children. </p><h2>  Hotel Luna </h2><p>  Based on reviews, the Costa Brava hotel, called the Moon, can also be seen as a place to relax with children.  Spacious grounds, a swimming pool, a playground, a sports ground, an animation program - all this makes the complex attractive for couples.  They even feed their children in a mini club, and therefore there is no need to go to a restaurant.  The hotel rooms are as cramped as in any hotel in Spain. </p><p>  The only quite impressive drawback of the hotel is a fairly large distance to the sea.  The road to the beach is at least 300 meters long.  If you are not afraid of such a distance, then you can choose this institution. </p><h2>  Top Secret Hotel </h2><p>  Top Secret Hotel in Costa Brava is a four-star mid-range complex.  It is located in a very picturesque place, on top of a hill.  True, the distance to the beach is about 150 meters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.voyages-leonard.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Costa Brava Resort" class="if uuid-2293169" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2293169.jpg"></div><p>  In general, this does not cause inconvenience, since the second line for the beach resort is a perfectly acceptable option.  The hotel has at its disposal 246 rooms.  The territory has a swimming pool, a kids club and other infrastructure.  The complex is quite suitable for a relaxing holiday. </p><h2>  Hotel Moremar </h2><p>  Many tourists who first go on vacation to Spain tend to choose all-inclusive Costa Brava hotels.  The convenient concept of nutrition allows you not to worry about food throughout the day.  It is worth noting that most of the hotels in Spain offer their guests breakfast or half board.

There are always a lot of English and French, but there are much fewer Russian guests.  The hotel is interesting in every way.

The complex has its own beach, but you need to get to it only by car. </p><p>  The hotel is good at that.  That there are a lot of various entertainments in it, so the guests will definitely not be bored. </p><h2>  Oasis Park </h2><p>  Oasis Park is a modern high-level hotel.  On its territory there is a pool, terrace, fitness center, spa, massage room, games room for kids. </p><p>  The hotel has a restaurant, parking and a bar.

Before you go on your first trip to Spain, you should carefully consider the choice of a vacation spot.  In any resort village you will find a fairly large selection of hotels.  Of course, not all of them are the same in terms of service and provided numbers.  In general, it is worth noting that local resorts have hotels of all categories, so you can find accommodation at your own expense.  It is worth paying attention to what plan the hotel interests you.  For example, if you go on vacation with your family, it is better to choose family complexes.  You need to pay attention to the size of the hotel and the availability of playgrounds.  Very often hotels do not have a yard or garden.  Most of the complexes offer small-sized apartments.  And you need to be prepared for this.  Extensive rooms can be ordered only in the best and most expensive establishments. </p><p>  Spanish hotels usually don‚Äôt practice the all-inclusive concept beloved by our compatriots.  In this regard, Turkish and Egyptian resorts benefit significantly.  And yet, if desired, you can find hotel complexes that offer good nutrition. </p><p>  More experienced tourists opt for breakfast at the hotel or half board.  If you choose a hotel within the resort, then there will be no problems with food, since there are a huge number of restaurants and cafes everywhere, having visited which you can appreciate all the advantages of national cuisine.  And the local dishes are really very tasty. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.expedia.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Costa Brava Coast" class="if uuid-2293188" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2293188.jpg"></div><p>  Reviews of Costa Brava hotels give reason to talk about a good level of service in them. </p><p>         ,     .      .      .            ,       ,          .      ,      ,     . ,       ,        .      .    ,           . </p>
