    <h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  An excellent well-kept garden is what the Prassino Nissi Hotel 2 * (Corfu) can offer to all vacationers.  In the evening, hotel guests gather here, share their impressions, socialize and have fun together.  For the organization of leisure, a common relaxation room with a TV and the necessary equipment for watching movies is intended.

Everyone can take a dip in the outdoor pool, take sun baths here.  Almost always, the water bowl is empty, because most tourists spend their free time on the beach and visit local beauties on their own or as part of a rich excursion program. </p><p>  The pool is small, but rather clean: every night a robot vacuum cleaner is launched into it, which perfectly copes with all pollution.  From sports activities, the Prassino Nissi 2 * hotel can offer only table tennis. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  All those tourists who stay at the Prassino Nissi 2 * hotel can count on a <span>continental breakfast.</span>  Morning meals are served in the spacious, home-style restaurant.

Breakfast is typical for Europe and does not impress with its variety: granola, milk, eggs, sausages, cold cuts, cheese, yogurt, cottage cheese, sometimes fresh fruits and vegetables, drinks to choose from. </p><p>  For an extra fee, the hotel restaurant offers lunch and dinner.  But tourists recommend visiting local cafes, and preferably Greek ones.  Here you can have quite inexpensive tasty lunch and dinner.  And, of course, this is a great opportunity to get to know better the national cuisine, which has prepared many surprises for vacationers. </p>

    <h2>  Service and additional services </h2><p>  The reception is open around the clock, which allows you to quickly solve all the problems that tourists have.  Guest reviews suggest parking is available on site for an additional fee.  Quite often, tourists coming to Corfu rent a car in order to get to know the resort as close as possible as part of their vacation, to visit the most beautiful places and attractions.  So in this case, secure parking will be a real salvation. </p><p>  Moreover, everyone can use the safe for storing documents and valuables.  He is at the reception and is paid extra.  In addition, for an additional fee, you can put your things in order, as well as access to wireless high-speed Internet.  The cost of a week of use when connecting to one access point is 10 euros - for Europe it is quite an adequate price. </p><p>  Of course, many tourists can be confused by the abundance of paid services.  But do not forget that this is a 2 star hotel.  And in Europe, in principle, it is difficult to find hotels operating on an all-inclusive basis.  Rest here is not the most budgetary. </p>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Just 60 meters from the hotel there is an excellent sand and pebble beach.  The sea is crystal clear.  Entry into the water is not the most pleasant, small pebbles come across, but literally a few meters later a pleasant sand begins.  Of course, there are enough vacationers here in the season.  But lovers of a more relaxing and secluded holiday can stroll along the coast.  Surely they will find places remote from civilization for themselves. </p>
