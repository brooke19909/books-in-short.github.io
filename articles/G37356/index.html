It is not difficult to put a child in a shirt, pants and vest, but how to make a nose?  Pinocchio is a fabulous boy who was carved by Papa Carlo.  But do not make a nose out of wood!  And from what?  You will find the answer to this question in the article. </p><h2>  Paper nose </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a pinocchio nose" class="if uuid-2234387" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2234387.jpg"></div><p>  To make such an attribute of a fairy-tale hero is very simple.  Do-it-yourself Pinocchio nose can be done in 10 minutes.  You should buy yellow, brown, or flesh colored paper.  On it with the help of a compass you need to draw a circle.  Now this geometric figure should be divided into four parts.  How to make Pinocchio's nose out of a circle?  It is necessary to cut out ¬º of the part and make the craft from it.  If you make a cone out of half a circle, then it will be too wide.  Take a quarter and add it to the bag.  Fix the edges with double-sided tape or glue.  It remains to decorate the nose.  On the cone, you can draw stains and stains characteristic of a tree. </p><h2>  Papier-m√¢ch√© nose </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="make a pinocchio nose do it yourself" class="if uuid-2234392" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2234392.jpg"></div><p>  People learned to create decorative elements from paper a couple of centuries ago.  This is the easiest way to make Pinocchio's nose.  How to realize the idea?  You need to make a sticky mass of old newspapers.  To do this, tear the paper into small pieces.  Then you need to fill it with water and let it brew for several hours.  Now in the resulting mass should be added <span>clerical glue</span> and flour.  Mix the resulting slurry and let it brew for another hour.  Then you can begin to manufacture the mold.  How to make Pinocchio's nose?  You can see the photo of the final result above.  It is to him that one should strive.  First, make a cone from papier-m√¢ch√©.  The easiest way is to dazzle it, if you make a blank of plasticine in advance, and then just glue it with paper.  After the first layer has dried, plasticine should be removed.  Now you can go to the decor.  We create turns from paper pulp.  They should look like a cone carved from wood.  You can make various twigs and tubercles.  After the form is ready, give it time to dry.  Now you can go to the decor.  Ground the nose and cover it with paint.  Using acrylic paint the texture of the tree.  You can even draw a few leaves. </p><h2>  Tube nose </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a pinocchio nose photo" class="if uuid-2234393" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2234393.jpg"></div><p>  One of the easiest ways to make such a craft is to glue pieces of plastic that fit together in shape.  How to make Pinocchio's nose in this way?  We select plastic tubes of four sizes.  Cut them into pieces.  The thin tube should be the longest.  Now we put the blanks on top of each other according to the principle of the pyramid.  Fasten the tubes with each other should be superglue or a hot gun.  The base on the nose can be made of plastic.  We make a nose pad from this synthetic material, which can be purchased at any store for creativity.  This preparation should be baked in the oven.  We connect the parts of the nose together and paint the product in beige color.  Now with the help of acrylic paints you need to depict the texture of the tree.  It remains to make cheeks out of cardboard and stick them to the finished nose.  Now we thread the rubber into the cardboard, and our product is ready. </p>
