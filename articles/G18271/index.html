If you put aside spending on a variety of tuning, winter tires and all sorts of "lotions" such as seat covers for leather from a young antelope, then the most significant contribution to the vehicle is insurance.  But how and where to insure a car?  Reviews of companies offering such services are so diverse that making the right choice is sometimes difficult.  Turning to various insurance companies, many customers often face the fact that, in addition to the actual auto insurance, they are forced to pay for additional services.  We are talking about life insurance, transported goods and so on.  It‚Äôs important, but often it‚Äôs not necessary at the moment, is it?  And besides, if such a desire arises, the client himself can contact the employees with a corresponding request.  But this is lyrics.  So, how to insure a car without additional insurance and what is needed for this? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to insure a car without additional insurance" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/795185.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Types of policies </h2><p>  Most often, a vehicle insurance contract is concluded immediately after the purchase of a car and is renewed annually.  An exception may be situations when the age of the purchased car exceeds 10-12 years: in such cases, some companies may refuse to service at all.  Today, two types of policies are most popular: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  CASCO - it is possible to insure a car (one's own) both from theft and from any damage; </li><li>  OSAGO - involves covering losses to the owner of someone else's car that suffered from your negligence; </li></ul><p>  One important nuance: in the event of an insured event, it is impossible to receive payments under two policies at once, so if you have both compulsory motor third-party liability insurance and hull insurance, then in case of an accident you will have to choose where exactly you will demand compensation for the losses incurred. </p><p>  When acquiring a particular auto insurance policy, the vehicle owner first of all searches for the most favorable conditions for himself, and the price of the service in this case plays an important role.  Therefore, before signing this or that agreement, it is worth carefully familiarizing yourself with all its nuances. </p><h2>  How much life insurance is required </h2><p>  Concluding an agreement, many car owners are faced with the fact that in addition to the basic service they are offered to issue a policy for additional risks, for example, to insure the life of the driver himself.  Such payments are scornfully called ‚Äúdopa‚Äù.  Sometimes the refusal of these services entails the impossibility of issuing a policy or a significant delay in the timing of its receipt.  Is it possible to insure a car without life insurance?  It turns out that it is possible, however, sometimes the process can take some time.  Therefore, if you insure a car without <span>life insurance</span> in the "native" company they refuse, and the deadlines for registration are running out - it is easier to look for another company that provides similar services.  And what if I do not want to change the SK? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What to do if you are refused </h2><p>  Based on Russian legislation, you are not at all obligated to pay for additional options.  Therefore, if, for example, Rosgosstrakh refuses to insure a car without special stages, and there is no time or desire to change the company servicing the policy, you can try to influence the insurers by law.  As a rule, people making out insurance do not pay attention to overpayments, but if this is a matter of principle for you and a simple conversation with company employees does not bring any results, contact the court or the antimonopoly committee. </p><p>  In order to accurately win the case, you need to prove that managers force you to pay for an additional service that you do not need.  For this, a written refusal of the company is suitable, in which the impossibility of concluding an agreement without life insurance is indicated as a reason.  If you refuse to issue such paper, then the fact of refusal can be recorded on the phone or voice recorder - this can help prove your case.  Most likely, you will win the court, and all the overpaid amounts will be returned to you, but you will have to pat your nerves pretty well. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="insure a car without life insurance" class="if" height="280" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/795187.jpg" width="420"></div>

    <p>  In addition, there is a possibility that offended insurers will pass on information about you as a negligent client to their partners, and it will become problematic to issue a policy in the future.  If this happens to you, immediately file a complaint with the antimonopoly office, the prosecutor's office and the court.  Beat all the bells, the truth is on your side, because any specialized company is obliged to insure the car without additional insurance, and there is no law that forces you to pay for what you do not need. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Another way </h2><p>  If you don‚Äôt feel like spoiling your nerves and wasting your energy on <span>litigation</span> , you can try to do it without aggravating relations with the organization that services the policy.  Here is another, less "bloodthirsty" way to insure a car without additional insurance.  A small instruction: </p><ol><li>  We go to the site of the selected company and find there information on the basic rates of insurance tariffs and payment details. </li><li>  Using the instructions of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, we independently calculate the amount of the insurance premium.  It is not difficult to do this, there are a lot of instructions and examples on the relevant portals in this regard. </li><li>  We pay for the service, but so that you have on your hands a check or receipt indicating the purpose of payment, where you need to write "Payment of insurance premium, insurance policy, automobile" ... ", state number xxxx." </li><li>  We make photocopies of the following documents: passport, Title or certificate of registration of the car, the driver‚Äôs license of everyone who is allowed to drive this car, a diagnostic card or a certificate of inspection, a check on the payment of insurance premiums. </li><li>  We are filling out an application for concluding an <span>insurance contract (the form</span> can be found on the Bank of Russia website). </li><li>  We draw up a cover letter in two copies, in which we write references to the following laws: Federal Law No. 40, ed.  from 11/04/14;  clauses 1.4‚Äì1.6 of the ‚ÄúRegulations on the Rules for Compulsory Third Party Liability Insurance of Vehicle Owners‚Äù No. 431-P approved by the Bank of Russia. </li><li>  We attach to the cover letter an inventory of the above documents and their copies. </li><li>  We personally bring all of the above to the office of the insurance company and require you to put a note on the date of receipt on your copy of the cover letter. </li><li>  If the employees of the company refused to accept the documents in full, we send them by mail, with a notification of receipt, necessarily making an <span>inventory of the investments.</span> </li></ol><p>  Most often, after all these actions, the insurance company does not ask questions and draws up a policy without imposing additional services. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to insure a car under OSAG" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/795181.jpg" width="475"></div>

    <h2>  How and where to insure a car insurance </h2><p>  You can get such a car insurance policy in almost any company providing such services.  In the people, OSAGO is simply referred to as ‚Äúauto-citizen‚Äù, as the abbreviation stands for ‚Äúcompulsory motor third-party liability insurance‚Äù.  To get it, most often you do not even need to submit the vehicle itself for inspection, but the absence of compulsory motor liability insurance is punishable by a fine. </p><p>  So, where to insure the car for CTP?  At first glance, it may seem that the cost of the policy will be approximately the same in any company, but in practice this is completely different.  However, do not chase the cheapness, first of all you need to think about whether your IC will be able to compensate you for losses, if necessary.  Here are a few criteria to be guided by: </p><ul><li>  Price of insurance.  Low cost of the policy is not always good, it is better to stick to the middle price category. </li><li>  Rating of the insurer.  Reputable organizations often offer a variety of promotions and discounts, and their reputation is proven. </li><li>  The provision of additional services.  Sometimes behind the shares there is a camouflaged imposition of absolutely unnecessary services to you: health, property, life insurance, etc. </li><li>  Convenience of location.  Consider how convenient it will be for you to visit the office of the company if necessary. </li></ul><h2>  CASCO </h2><p>  Another fairly popular type of policy is CASCO.  In this case, it is possible to insure a car in addition to compulsory motor third-party liability insurance, although this is not mandatory.  In the list of risks under this agreement, you can include almost anything: </p><ul><li>  hijacking; </li><li>  damage in the event of an accident; </li><li>  broken glass from a pebble flying out from under the wheels of the car in front; </li><li>  cut wheels; </li><li>  the fall of any foreign objects, such as an icicle or brick; </li><li>  dents or scratches of unknown origin; </li><li>  any other risks. </li></ul><p>  In this case, it does not matter who is to blame for the occurrence of the insured event, the payment will still cover losses.  It all depends on the cost of the policy - the more all kinds of risks are included in it, the more expensive it is.  So, as you know, CASCO is not cheap, often the cost of a car insurance is 10-15% of the price of the vehicle itself.  However, despite the high cost, the CASCO policy is very popular, especially among novice motorists. </p><p>  In this case, it is rather difficult to answer the question ‚Äúhow to insure a car without additional insurance‚Äù.  Due to the fact that CASCO is exclusively voluntary, insurance companies try to set as many additional requirements as possible.  There are cases when "enterprising" managers suggested that novice drivers additionally issue an insurance policy in case of a sudden closure (it is supposedly impossible to insure a car from theft without this item).  Unfortunately, it is quite difficult to deal with such phenomena - it is easier to change the insurance company. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to insure a car without inspection" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/795182.jpg" width="482"></div>

    <h2>  What affects the price of hull insurance </h2><p>  Thinking about where to insure the car under CASCO, it is worth considering some factors that can affect the price of the policy.  Most often it depends on: </p><ul><li>  <span>car brand</span> and its value - the more it is, the more expensive the policy; </li><li>  the age of the motorist and driving experience - the more he is, the cheaper the policy; </li><li>  ‚ÄúAntiquity‚Äù of the car itself - the newer the car, the cheaper the insurance, and a vehicle older than 10-15 years may not be insured at all; </li><li>  the availability and level of anti-theft systems; </li><li>  places and conditions of car maintenance - yard, garage, guarded or unguarded parking; </li><li>  deductibles - damage not exceeding the deductible is eliminated at the personal expense of the client; </li><li>  the population density of the region where the car is used - for example, the risk of accidents in a metropolis is an order of magnitude higher than in a small village. </li></ul><p>  Also, the cost of the CASCO policy may increase: </p><ul><li>  list of insured events; </li><li>  the place of auto repair - a car service at the option of an insurance company will be cheaper, but the repair itself there may result in a tidy amount; </li><li>  the size of the interest limit for payment upon the occurrence of an insured event; </li><li>  amount of payment in cases when the car is not subject to recovery and must be disposed of; </li><li>  the possibility of providing a Green Card for traveling abroad; </li><li>  additional life insurance for the driver or passengers; </li><li>  the possibility of registration by installments; </li><li>  the complexity and timing of the procedure for considering the situation, to recognize the case as insurance; </li><li>  another. </li></ul><h2>  Internet insurance </h2><p>  Recently, regardless of which policy you are applying for, large insurance companies offer the service of drawing up a contract remotely.  So, how to insure a car via the Internet and how reliable is it?  To begin with, we note: although this service is very convenient, it is still not completely safe.  In this case, trust is only to stable, trusted companies.  Therefore, before deciding to insure a car via the Internet, carefully study the reviews about the organization offering such a service, or an intermediary agent. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="insure your car online" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/795184.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  The essence of the process is as follows: </p><ul><li>  choose an insurance company and go to its official website; </li><li>  carefully study the terms of the CASCO and CTP insurance policy, select the one you need and leave an online application for its execution; </li><li>  in some cases, you will have to additionally fill out a small questionnaire in which to indicate information about the car and other unclassified information; </li><li>  indicate the date and time at which it is convenient for you to receive the courier of the insurance company. </li></ul><p>  At the indicated time, after processing the information, a special one with a ready-made insurance policy will come to you, which will need to be paid on the spot upon receipt.  You can also choose the place where the document will be brought to you - home or at work, as you prefer, the main thing is to be there at the indicated time.  This is quite convenient, since there is no need to spend precious time going to the company‚Äôs office, you don‚Äôt need to ‚Äúhang out‚Äù in traffic jams, queue up for the manager and the cashier, and so on.  Your time and nerves will remain with you. </p><p>  In order not to waste time visiting the company‚Äôs office, you can also use the services of special intermediary agents, who often also have their own pages on the Internet.  An agent is an individual who has an agreement with an insurance company and provides intermediary services.  Most often, such people receive from 10 to 20% of the cost of the policy, so if you use the services of the same person all the time, he may even give you a discount, and the policy will cost a little cheaper.  However, here you need to be doubly careful not to "run into" a fraudster. </p><h2>  Credit car - forced choice of insurance company </h2><p>  But the question "where is it better to insure a car taken on credit" is not worth it at all.  The fact is that banks issuing a loan to buy a car most often send a client to a particular company with which they have an additional service agreement.  If you do not insure the loan machine exactly where you are told, then you most likely will not receive money. </p><p>  True, there is one caveat: most often banks cooperate not with one insurance company, but they ‚Äúforget‚Äù to inform the client about this.  So before applying for a loan, ask a representative of a banking institution for a list of all the organizations with which they work, and choose the one that suits you best.  In the future, when concluding a loan agreement, demand the opportunity to be serviced exactly where it is convenient for you.  Most often, banks do not want to lose a client because of such a ‚Äútrifle‚Äù and go towards it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out if the car is insured" class="if" height="282" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/795186.jpg" width="426"></div>

    <h2>  Insurance Nuances </h2><p>  There are also some special cases in which the design of the policy can be difficult.  For example, do you know how to insure a car without a vehicle inspection?  It seems to be nothing, but there are some nuances.  Some insurance companies offer their customers a ‚Äúconditional policy‚Äù.  This means that a document will be issued to you, but they will require you to write a statement stating that you undertake to provide a technical inspection ticket later, for example, within a week. </p><p>  You may also be offered to issue a short-term policy, that is, to insure the car for a month or two weeks.  This just means that during this time you will have time to pass the inspection and return for the main "security" document.  If the time has come to re-arrange insurance, and the old technical standard is valid for another six months, then you do not need to re-pass it, you can issue a policy according to what is.  And if you purchased a new car, then you do not need a technical inspection ticket at all, because then you will go through it only after three years. </p><p>  Due to the significant increase in the cost of the policy, some car owners would like to get it earlier, at the "old" prices.  But far from everyone knows whether it is possible to insure a car in advance.  It is possible to extend the MTPL policy validity period not earlier than a month before its expiration.  So those motorists for whom the compulsory insurance policy expired in early May could theoretically save a little, of course, if they guessed the date of the tariff increase. </p><p>  With CASCO, the situation is even worse - if you extend an existing policy, you can do this no earlier than two weeks before the end of the previous one.  And if you are registering a new one or want to change the insurance company, then the bill here does go on for days.  True, in some companies you can issue a policy ‚Äúwith reservation‚Äù.  This means that a note will be entered in the insurance contract that its validity period starts from the moment of repeated inspection of the vehicle, the date of which is the day preceding the expiration of the existing insurance.  It may be possible to save, but in the event of a critical situation such an agreement does not have force. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible to insure a car in advance" class="if" height="282" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/795183.jpg" width="425"></div>
