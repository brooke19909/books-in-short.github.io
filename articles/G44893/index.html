This company produces this type of equipment at the Krasnoyarsk plant.  In Soviet times, this conveyor produced equipment that was used not only on the territory of the Union, but also far beyond its borders.  At the moment, this manufacturer is creating Biryusa refrigerators, the customer reviews of which are excellent, for the European and Russian markets.  The production of <span>compressors, refrigerated</span> cabinets and freezers is gradually being established. </p><p>  Most of the modern models received a beautiful and stylish design.  At the same time, about 90% of all parts are created by the company's own efforts.  All products are fully suitable for European and international standards.  Considering that refrigerators are being created in Russia, their prices are much lower than import ones, but the characteristics are much better. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="biryusa refrigerator customer reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1975359.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Negative </h2><p>  Often, buyers of Biryusa refrigerators, the instructions for which are included, are fully satisfied with their functionality.  Even with the fact that the manufacturer is domestic, they have excellent recommendations from the owners.  However, of course, the device has negative aspects, like any other product.  Let us consider how critical they are? </p><p>  Most often, bad reviews from buyers of Biryusa refrigerators receive electronic models.  Their control unit often breaks or fails.  Sometimes sound alerts can be turned on, and additional functions stop working. </p><p>  Some buyers note that the electronic control unit has broken down already three to four months after the purchase.  Therefore, we must conclude that refrigerators with a mechanical panel are much more profitable and reliable. </p><p>  Consumers also have complaints about the quality and design of drawers.  Plastic is rather flimsy.  If the boxes are full, then putting them on the racks will be quite difficult.  They will turn over, so it is problematic to close the device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="biryusa refrigerator Price" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1975361.jpg" width="375"></div>

Door handles are made conveniently in most models, they do not protrude and are built into the structure.  Therefore, it is impossible to break them or catch on.  In addition, a little space is saved in the kitchen.  If the door of the refrigerator is open for a long time, the appliance will emit a corresponding sound signal.  When a power outage occurs, the cold in the device remains for a long time. </p><p>  Two-chamber models do not need manual defrosting.  They have a No frost system.  Each device is famous for its quiet operation.  Several compressors work very quietly.  The desired temperature is maintained in the cameras in automatic modes.  A quick cooling option is also integrated.  Thanks to this, it is possible to reduce the temperature of any products or liquids in a short time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="repair of biryusa refrigerators" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1975362.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Biryusa 130 KLSS2 </h2><p>  Customer reviews of the Biryusa 130 KLSS2 refrigerator are excellent.  Why?  What do owners highlight?  This device fits perfectly into a small room.  Due to the impressive internal volume and mobility of all shelves made of glass, you can easily store a huge amount of products.  If we talk about energy consumption, the device is economical.  As for noise, it is minimal.  The refrigerator does not have any unpleasant odors. </p><p>  But even with such advantages, this device has a minus.  He is quite critical.  If the voltage in the network accidentally jumps up, then immediately you need to prepare for a malfunction of the Biryusa refrigerator.  The fact is that it is not protected from differences.  Among the disadvantages are also the temperature indicators that are inside. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="malfunctions of a turquoise refrigerator" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1975364.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Biryusa 14 EK </h2><p>  The freezer got a volume of 110 liters.  He is a small camera.  Four compartments integrated.  They can store berries, fruits, and so on.  In each compartment there is <span>a drawer</span> made of plastic with a dense structure.  Freezing occurs with a sufficient capacity of 12 kg / day.  Electromechanical control.  The cold is stored when the mode is off for up to 10 hours.  The design is simple but attractive. </p><p>  The compressor was distinguished by quiet operation, however it is quite powerful.  This is stated by all buyers in the reviews.  The Biryusa refrigerator, the price of which is about 7 thousand rubles, provides quick freezing and reliable storage of products.  If you put food in containers for a long time, then it will be stored for a long time, while not being covered with ice.  The dimensions of the refrigerator are advantages, so it will fit perfectly into a small room. </p><p>  Only the temperature regulator causes dissatisfaction among buyers, since it is uninformative.  Also, the lack of a pallet does not contribute to a pleasant experience.  Because of this, during manual defrosting, you literally "sink" in the water. </p><h2>  Biryusa 134 KLA </h2><p>  Another two-chamber single-compressor refrigerator received a drip defrosting system.  The volume of space is 295 liters, and the freezer is 85 liters.  In the event that the refrigerator door is open for more than 40 seconds, the appliance starts to notify about this. </p><p>  Among the advantages, it is worth noting the easy repair of the Biryusa refrigerator, high-quality shelves that are difficult to accidentally scratch, the ability to adjust their height.  Due to all these qualities, this device allows you to store quite voluminous devices - pots and so on.  The refrigerator is convenient and easy to operate and maintain.  All containers and other parts can be easily removed and washed.  You also need to notice a sound alarm that will allow the owner to know about errors that may occur. </p><p>  Among the shortcomings, the compressor should be noted; it breaks quickly.  Customers also note fragile plastic near shelves and drawers.  Due to this, chips and cracks can still appear. </p>
