Probably no such person.  That is why an increasing number of people who are tired of the everyday office, decide to go to trade on the world currency exchange.  However, not everyone manages to earn the coveted profit.  What you need to know in order to succeed in the Forex market will be discussed in this article. </p><h2>  General recommendations </h2><p>  First of all, you should start trading on Forex with choosing a reliable broker.  A lot will depend on its correct operation and reputation.  Only after making sure that the exchange intermediary is reliable, you can proceed to the training stage.  Professional traders are advised to first understand the principles of trading on a demo account.  All actions on it are exactly the same as in real work, only the deposit is fake.  However, having tried your hand at the demo version of Forex, you can understand a lot.  The most important thing: whether this work can really become the main one. </p>

    <p>  After a novice trader tries himself in the role of a stock market speculator, he can move on to more serious training.  Only constantly replenishing the baggage of your knowledge, you can learn how to succeed in the Forex market.  Some players advise you to first get training, and only then start trading.  Nevertheless, the experience of professionals suggests that initially it is better to feel a sense of potential profit or loss.  Understand whether to plunge into this area of ‚Äã‚Äãactivity, at the very beginning of the journey. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Strategy selection </h2><p>  One of the important factors affecting the profitability of a trader is his chosen strategy.  Today there are a great many of them.  Moreover, the cost of each of them varies widely.  This is explained by the fact that experienced traders who want to make money on their sale put them up for general use for a fee.  In fact, if such strategies, which you can so often find on the Internet, generate income, it is unlikely that someone would sell them.  Knowing how to succeed in the Forex market, the trader will use these secrets himself.  Therefore, everyone should independently choose for themselves the optimal principle of work, taking into account their nature and acquired knowledge.  After all, someone prefers to conduct aggressive trading, while someone, on the contrary, is less risky. </p>

    <h2>  Self-discipline is the key to a successful trader </h2><p>  Self-discipline plays a huge role on the world currency exchange.  To succeed in the Forex market, you must have such a trait as cold-bloodedness.  If a person is prone to emotional outbursts, irritability or frequent changes in mood, then he does not have a place on the exchange.  To make a profit, you need to be able to quickly make decisions based on the analysis and control your risks.  Sometimes it is required to close a position, even if it is a little unprofitable.  In the event that the trader cannot make such a decision and hopes for the best, then he is on the path to failure.  Thus, in addition to replenishing one's luggage of knowledge, self-discipline should be developed and trained.  You need to learn how to get out of the game on time and not succumb to the temptation of easy profit when the market is not located.  In general, Forex trading is not a roulette game.  Here the rules and laws apply, subject only to a cold-blooded stock market speculator. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Considered risks, or How to trade profitably </h2><p>  As mentioned above, one should take risks only in cases where everything leads to the fact that the market will go in the right direction.  At the same time, you cannot risk the entire deposit, only a small part of it.  Everyone has a chance to succeed in the Forex market.  Not only those who have large capital, but also those who start with a few dollars.  Sometimes it‚Äôs even better to start with a small amount, which is not a pity to lose.  After all, if you put $ 1000 in your account and lose money right there, there will be nothing left but a negative attitude to trade.  In the future, reviews and impressions will be negative.  And if, having lost a small sum of money, the novice trader will draw his conclusions, then in the future he will have more chances to develop a profitable trading strategy and increase his capital. </p>

    <p>  In any case, knowing how to succeed in the Forex currency market, you can not immediately leave the old workplace.  Indeed, many who were inspired by the huge profits of the foreign exchange market and left their previous jobs, as a result, remained with a ‚Äúbroken trough‚Äù.  That is why at the initial stage it is better to combine two directions, and only then, having learned the secrets of successful trading, make a choice in favor of Forex. </p>
