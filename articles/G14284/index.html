Should I take a smartphone with a non-removable battery?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It is unlikely that anyone will argue that in the modern world a smartphone has become an integral attribute of many people's lives.  It is not in vain that he bears the title of ‚Äúsmart phone‚Äù and is capable of performing various functions - from entertaining to educational.  Every year, manufacturers release new models of smartphones for every taste and budget.  So, recently smartphones with a non-removable battery are becoming more and more widespread.  The pros and cons of such devices are very diverse and require detailed familiarization. </p><h2>  The role of the battery in a smartphone </h2><p>  The battery is one of the most important characteristics of a smartphone; you should pay a lot of attention when buying it.  Of course, the goals for which a smartphone is purchased are different for everyone, for some it is a phone for work, for others for entertainment, but everyone agrees that the long work of the device without recharging is a huge plus. </p>

    <h2>  Stylish design </h2><p>  It is known that demand creates supply.  And if it so happens that smartphones with non-removable batteries appear more and more, then there is something attractive to the consumer in them.  It really is.  It turns out that a non-removable battery gives manufacturers more room for imagination, expanding their capabilities in the manufacture of smartphones.  This technology allows you to make the device as thin and light as possible, which is certainly convenient for the user.  After all, hardly anyone wants to carry a brick in their pocket. </p>

    <h2>  Pros and cons of a non-removable battery in a smartphone </h2><p>  So, manufacturers explain the gradual departure from the production of phones with a removable battery by the fact that they can create modern stylish models with an ultra-thin body.  However, it is worth considering all the pros and cons of a non-removable battery in the phone. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The undoubted advantages of non-removable batteries include the following factors: </p><ul><li>  manufacturers are not limited in smartphone design capabilities; </li><li>  more reliable, durable case, its parts do not move away and do not break out over time, which provides better protection against dust and moisture; </li><li>  the manufacturer protects the user from rash harm to his smartphone: installing another battery of poor quality will not work; </li><li>  the capacity of non-removable batteries is greater than removable. </li></ul>

    <p>  Of the main disadvantages it is worth highlighting: </p><ul><li>  the inability to restart the device when it hangs by removing the battery; </li><li>  the impossibility of self-replacement of the battery after its failure; </li><li>  Replacing a non-removable battery is done in the service center and is not cheap. </li></ul><h2>  Points for and against </h2><p>  Many different reviews about the non-removable battery in a smartphone can be found on the Internet.  There are both positive and negative.  Supporters of non-removable batteries advocate a more modern appearance, for the ease and convenience of the device, for a higher capacity of such batteries.  Opponents point out that the durability of a smartphone is sacrificed to a beautiful design. </p><p>  It is also widely believed that manufacturers are switching to manufacturing phones with non-removable batteries, not at all because of concern for the beautiful design and user convenience.  Everyone knows the approximate battery life of a maximum of 4 years.  After that, its capacity begins to decline steadily, which leads to the inability to fully use this unit.  In a smartphone with a removable battery, this problem was solved quite simply - by acquiring a new battery and replacing the old one with it.  The new battery was inexpensive, and with the help of simple manipulations, the smartphone began to work like new.  With the advent of non-removable batteries, the problem cannot be solved in this way.  There are two options: either take the smartphone to a service center, which may be located in another city, and make an expensive replacement, or simply put up with the fact that the smartphone has worked out and go shopping for a new one.  It is easy to guess that frequent phone purchases are only in the hands of manufacturers, this significantly increases their profit. </p>

    <p>  In contrast to this opinion, supporters of non-removable batteries cite the argument that in 4 years any smartphone becomes outdated and bothers its user, and the majority in any case begins to look for a replacement from among more modern devices. </p><h2>  The trouble of the modern electronic world </h2><p>  Young people who are accustomed to updating their smartphones as new interesting new products are released will most likely not remember that the very first cell phones could serve for many years, and some still work properly. </p><p>  In modern society, everyone is so used to the fact that technology is a short-lived thing, quickly becoming obsolete and requiring constant replacement, which is unlikely to get away from this.  Manufacturers come up with new technologies, invent the most advanced devices, and in the end it comes down to reducing the life of the equipment.  You can endlessly talk about the pros and cons of a non-removable battery in a smartphone, but the trend is towards a complete rejection of removable batteries.  The world of technology and electronics is constantly evolving, every year there are more and more diverse new products and ideas for improving production, and no matter how I would like to return to the past, this is impossible.  It remains only not to take with hostility everything new and unusual and, if possible, try to find positive aspects in everything. </p>

    <h2>  To take or not to take - that is the question </h2><p>  You can find many arguments for and against a non-removable battery in a smartphone.  It is impossible to decide unequivocally which position is correct on this issue.  In any case, it is quite difficult to find a device that is ideal for all technical specifications.  For each customer, their own set of parameters is important, according to which they choose the phone.  If durability refers to them, you should pay attention to models with a removable battery.  And if modern design, performance, large battery capacity and other bonuses of modern devices are important, you need to choose from all currently available devices.  And if your favorite smartphone has only one drawback as a non-removable battery, do not refuse to buy. </p>
