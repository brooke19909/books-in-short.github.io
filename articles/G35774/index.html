  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Individual tax debts or how to go abroad without problems</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Last year, more than 70,000 thousand citizens were not able to go abroad, because they had <span>arrears of taxes on</span> individuals. </p><p>  Everything that we use in everyday life, one way or another, includes an accrued tax.  The goods purchased in the store include many taxes, from profit to social security contributions.  From our salaries we withhold income tax, take into account the costs of the enterprise, we pay transport for transport, property for property, and so on. <br><strong></strong></p><p>  <strong>What is included in the concept of income</strong> </p><p>  The amount of taxes is determined by law, and the executive body is the tax service, which exercises control over its implementation.  The law determines not only the size, but also the time frame when the payment of taxes to individuals takes place. </p><p>  Such payments are divided into federal and those that go to local budgets.  Amounts of money are formed from them, which can then be used for army maintenance, improvement, <span>social payments</span> or urban development, other necessary expenses, that is, for facilities that are used by all citizens. </p><p>  The tax on real estate owned by individuals is paid by all homeowners, except pensioners.  Transport (car or other type of motor vehicle) is also the basis for paying tax.  <span>Dividends,</span> stock <span>income</span> , land, donated property and cash, lottery winnings, fees and remuneration (other than core business), contract work, other income received during the year - all this is the basis for the declaration to be completed, and the tax is paid. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If during the year you received any income from a source other than performing work with the employer, then you must submit <span>an income declaration</span> to the tax inspectorate yourself so that personal tax arrears are not generated.  Even receiving an interest-free loan or a loan at a company or from a company at a minimum interest rate will be considered income with a mandatory tax payment.  But here the declaration is not needed, the tax should withhold the enterprise. <br><strong></strong></p><p>  <strong>Property and transport taxes</strong> </p><p>  These taxes are local, they are calculated at rates established by local authorities.  The value is determined based on the value of the property.  The cost of housing, garage, building or other premises, which is privately owned, is determined by the authorities that oversee and record all buildings in the city. </p><p>  If the property is shared, then each of the owners pays its share independently.  Joint ownership (if each owner does not have a certain share of housing registered) implies the payment of tax by any one participant in the property, except for those who are officially exempted from payment.  Timely payment will free you from the fact that arrears of taxes on individuals. </p><p>  Transport is taxed at recommended rates, and local authorities determine it as well.  Anyone who registers a vehicle, and anyone who is ‚Äúshod‚Äù in tires, is obliged to pay a fee for it.  Engine power is the basis for its calculation, which is done by the owner of the motor on his own. </p><p>  Tax benefits are also determined by local government.  If you own a boat with a motor not exceeding 10 horses, then you do not need to pay tax.  Wheelchairs and cars for the disabled are not taxed. <br><strong></strong></p><p>  <strong>Just go to the website or the tax office</strong> </p><p>  Perhaps the <span>legal literacy of the</span> population is currently at a very low level.  If you are going abroad on vacation or on business, by invitation or on a tourist trip, go to the tax office and ask if you have any tax debts.  You can use the Internet and on the site tax.ru to find out all the information on your tax identification number (TIN). </p><p>  <strong>How to find out about debt, generate a receipt, pay and transfer data to the tax?</strong> </p><p>  Such questions may arise in a person who has never paid taxes.  You can find out the debt at the tax office.  Just go in and ask, they will answer you if you have a passport.  The receipts are generated by the tax office; you cannot form them yourself.  You can pay at any branch of the bank or at the post office.  You don‚Äôt need to transfer data to the tax inspectorate, but you do not transmit data about payment for telephone, water or electricity.  In the same way, your payments will go to your tax office. </p><p>  Pay taxes before April 1 annually, and then you will not be credited with taxes on individuals.  The tax can be paid in advance and in equal installments during the year from April to November. </p>
