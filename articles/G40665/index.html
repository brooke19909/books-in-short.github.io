In the 90s of the XX century, a tourist boom began in these places.  The once modest fishing village quickly turned into an international resort.  Camyuva as a place of relaxation is ideal for lovers of comfort and excellent service. </p><p>  The name of the village from Turkish is translated as "pine nest."  This is a surprisingly beautiful area, surrounded by mountains and thickets of oleanders, palm trees, orange and olive trees.  The creation of the resort began in the 1980s, and today tourists enjoy the excellent infrastructure - comfortable hotels, cozy summer clubs and well-groomed beaches. </p>

    <h2>  Resort Description </h2><p>  Camyuva (Turkey) is divided into two zones - beach and residential.  Along the coast are modern comfortable hotels.  They are distinguished by reasonable prices and high quality service. </p><p>  The resort village is surrounded by three picturesque slopes.  <span>Taurus Mountain</span> is a popular spot for hiking. </p><p>  On one side of the resort area, the small river Agva flows, from the opposite you can see the ruins of the ancient city of Phaselis and the mountains.  Here the air is saturated with healing coniferous aroma and fragrance of oleanders. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A warm sea, a strip of equipped and well-kept pebble-sand beaches, a warm <span>turquoise sea, the</span> gentle sun - all this will make you forget about the noise and bustle of a modern city, and you will plunge into the atmosphere of magnificent nature. </p><h2>  Climatic conditions </h2><p>  Camyuva (Turkey) - the resort photo you see on the page is characterized by a mild and comfortable climate for a beach holiday.  Summer is quite hot: air warms up to +35 degrees, and water - up to +26. </p><p>  Those who do not really like the heat, it is better to come to the resort in May.  You can look here in the velvet season (September - October).  At this time, you can combine a beach holiday with excursions to the picturesque surroundings and attractions of the village. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="camyuva turkey photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/985155.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The high season begins in April and lasts until the end of October.  Winter in this region is mild, air temperature almost never drops below +16 degrees. </p><h2>  Holidays in Camyuva (Turkey) </h2><p>  The village has a rather long recreation area - several kilometers.  A small mountain river separates Camyuva from the nearest resort of Kirishi.  There is a cozy harbor with magnificent pebble-covered beaches. </p><p>  Many hotels have high-quality bulk beaches.  There are always enough umbrellas and deck chairs, there is no crowding.  It does not make sense to take a deck chair early in the morning - you can always find a free seat. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Camyuva (Turkey): attractions </h2><p>  Surprisingly, even such a small village as Camyuva (Turkey) has quite a few attractions.  Some of them are located not in the village itself, but in its environs, however, tourists are happy to visit them. </p><h2>  Phaselis </h2><p>  This ancient city was founded about three millennia ago by the Rhodes colonists who bargained the land for its construction from local residents for fish - in any case, as the ancient legend says.  Over the course of its long history, it has experienced a lot: Roman, Arab, Greek rule, and then the city fell into decay.  Today, from the former greatness and wealth of Phaselis there are only ruins, though very picturesque. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="camyuva turkey attractions" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/985148.jpg" width="500"></div>

There are hotels near the entertainment area. </p><p>  Guests of different ages are offered a rich program: an excursion to the dolphinarium with a fascinating show, a visit to cafes and shops.  You can swim in the pools (there are two of them in the complex), visit the mini zoo, play tennis on the well-equipped courts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Camyuva Turkey" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/985151.jpg" width="500"></div>
