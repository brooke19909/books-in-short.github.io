    <h2>  Vasilieva Larisa Nikolaevna: the childhood of the poetess </h2><p>  The future poetess was born on November 23, 1935 in Kharkov.  Her parents were engineers, which subsequently played an important role both in the life of the girl herself and in the fate of her native country.  After all, the first difficulties began even before Larisa had time to grow up - the roar of a terrifying war was heard all over the world. </p><p>  The only good news was that the head of the family was not taken to the front, since his talent was needed elsewhere.  He, along with other engineers, worked on the creation of new weapons for the Soviet troops.  By the way, they did it well - the father of Larisa Vasilyeva helped design the T-34 tank.  Later, she will describe in detail the whole path of creating this powerful tool in one of her books. </p>

    <h2>  The birth of the poet's talent </h2><p>  When did she create her first work Larisa Vasilieva?  She began to write poetry in early childhood, which greatly pleased her parents.  As for the first poetry-related memory, it refers to the age of six.  Then a very young girl wrote a poem, which became an adornment for one of the pages of the newspaper "Pioneer Truth". </p><p>  Later, the parents decided to send the works of their daughter to the poetess Anna Akhmatova, so that she would give them a fair assessment.  Alas, the criticism of the woman was very harsh, but, as the writer herself assures, very motivating.  And indeed, despite the failure, the girl continued to work on improving her writing talent. </p><p>  But how the poetess Vasilyeva Larisa took place became famous only at the beginning of 1957.  Perhaps the impetus for this was her marriage, which brought a flurry of new emotions to the girl’s life and made her take a fresh look at the world.  At the same time, the poetry of the writer instantly diverged through the pages of the well-known publications at that time.  For example, her works were published in the magazines Yunost, Moscow, Molodaya Gvardiya, and so on. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If we talk about the nature of her works, then first of all they are focused on the inner world of a person: his experiences, aspirations and struggle.  In addition, Vasilyeva Larisa often writes about love for Russia, her nature and about those people who live in her wonderful lands.  In general, more than 20 collections of poems, which were published both in Russian and in English, came out of her hands. </p>

    <h2>  Larisa Vasilieva: books </h2><p>  The first book of the writer was published in 1985.  It was a collection of short stories about the history of England called "Albion and the Secret of Time."  Her next work was the autobiographical novel “The Book of the Father.  The novel is a memory. ”  It was she who brought glory to Vasilyeva, as she found a response in the hearts of thousands of people. </p><p>  However, Vasilyeva Larisa herself believes that the era of perestroika was a turning point in her career.  It was during this period that she retrained from a poetess to a historical writer.  Her main bestseller was the book “Kremlin Wives,” which was released in 1994.  The success was so overwhelming that soon the writer was flooded with letters by fans calling for the continuation of this series. </p><p>  Vasilieva listened to the request of her readers and soon released several more similar books: Tales of Love (1995) and Children of the Kremlin (1996).  The latter was translated into many languages ​​and is in demand not only in Europe, but also in Asia.  After such a furor, Larisa Vasilieva finally switched to journalism, leaving poetry to young talents. </p>
