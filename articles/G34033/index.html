    <h2>  What can you see on the island of Kos? </h2><p>  When you stay at the hotel, be sure to take a sightseeing tour of the island.  Visit the Hippocrates Museum, the Sanctuary of Isis, and temples dedicated to the gods.  You might be interested to see the Knight's Castle, built in the 16th century.  From its top, an incredible view of the water surface and the rocky coast opens.  Under the fortress you can see the bay, surrounded by palm trees. </p><p>  On the Spit, you can see the ruins of Asklepion.  The Greeks believed that the building personifies the sky, through which the Sun overcomes the path around the Earth.  Previously, priests performed their rites here and healed people.  Pilgrims came to this place in order to tell about their dreams.  According to legend, Hippocrates himself studied there. </p><p>  Another place that every tourist should visit is the Temple of Heracles and the Ancient Agora.  It is considered a legacy of the Hellenistic and Byzantine eras.  Inside, you can see several statues of Orpheus and Hercules, a Christian basilica and <span>mosaic floors.</span>  In 1933, archaeologists found monuments of antiquity.  Later, a colonnade and a protective wall were partially reconstructed. </p><p>  In order to diversify your vacation in Greece, go to the wildest beach, called "Agrellia".  It offers stunning views of the coast and magnificent cliffs.  However, if you stayed at the expensive five-star Blue Lagoon Resort, you just have to look out the window to enjoy the picturesque view.  However, if you come for new experiences, often get out of the hotel room!  In the afternoon, see the sights, and in the evening, go to the Fashion nightclub. </p><h2>  Night life </h2>
