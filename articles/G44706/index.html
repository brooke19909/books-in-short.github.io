Every day, global manufacturers release new models that provide more and more new opportunities for photographs.  Today, it can be difficult for an ordinary person to decide on <span>a camera.</span>  Sometimes experienced shop assistants in the store are not even able to give sensible advice on their choice.  That is why a fan of photographing, and even more so a professional should know some features and characteristics of modern devices. </p><p>  The matrix of the camera is one of the main elements in such devices.  It is a sensor device with high photosensitivity, which is capable of converting the optical image projected onto it by the lens into a <span>digital signal.</span>  The matrix of the camera or camera has a direct impact on the detail and quality of the images taken.  Let's take a closer look at this particular element. </p><p>  The matrix of a digital camera includes many photosensitive elements that convert an optical image into an electric one.  Each pixel of the matrix forms one point of the final image.  By design, they can be divided into full-frame, progressive scan, column buffered, frame buffered, backlit, and interlaced.  In this case, the matrix can be divided into two main types, which are now usually found in the sold cameras. </p><p>  Types of Camera Matrices </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For a long time, metal oxide complementary semiconductors (CMOS) were used as matrices, whose sensitivity to light was discovered back in the sixties.  Here, the signal can be read from anywhere, you only need to specify the row and column numbers.  In addition, each pixel has an amplifier for the read signal.  A little later appeared devices that had charge-coupled communication (CCD), which at first significantly exceeded CMOS-matrices.  In such systems, the signal was read out similarly to a CRT <span>(cathode ray tube),</span> that is, from left to right and from top to bottom.  Silicon photodiodes acted in this case as photosensitive elements.  In the early nineties, a significant improvement was made to CMOS sensors.  Due to the features of this <span>type of matrix,</span> such as the ability to obtain normal sensitivity and high image quality only with significant matrix sizes, they are usually used in professional cameras with large sizes.  If we talk about inexpensive amateur models, it is better to choose those that are equipped with a CCD matrix.  Companies such as Canon and Nikon produce models of cameras that have modified CMOS matrices, which are a kind of transitional option. </p><p>  The camera matrix has such an important characteristic as resolution.  By <span>resolution is</span> meant the number of sensitive elements on the matrix, each of which perceives light and converts it into a specific <span>electric charge.</span>  It is important to understand that it makes no sense to chase the number of pixels, since the quality of the printed pictures is practically the same, and the difference can only be seen under the magnifying glass. </p><p>  Another significant characteristic that the camera matrix has is its physical size.  Most often, the larger physical size it has, the better the signal-to-noise ratio will be, which will allow to obtain a higher quality image with natural colors.  We can say that the larger the <span>size of the matrix</span> for a single number of pixels, the higher the quality of the photographs. </p>
