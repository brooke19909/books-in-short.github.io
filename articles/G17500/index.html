    <h2>  Device complete set </h2><p>  The manufacturer itself positions its device as an entry-level gadget with a very affordable price tag of <span>$ 100.</span>  Therefore, something unusual is not to be expected from the Lenovo A328.  Characteristics, reviews and its technical parameters once again indicate this.  But in terms of configuration, one can feel the competent approach of Chinese marketers.  There is something that many similar devices lack.  In addition to the device itself, the list of supplies also includes such accessories: </p><ul><li><p>  Battery with a capacity of 2000 mAh. </p></li><li><p>  Charger with a familiar USB output port.  Its output current is 1A. </p></li><li><p>  Standard interface cord with microUSB and USB connectors. </p></li><li><p>  Stereo headset. </p></li><li><p>  Additional protective film for the front panel. </p></li><li><p>  Silicone case - bumper. </p></li></ul><p>  A similar situation is with the set of documentation for the device: </p><ul><li><p>  Warranty card. </p></li><li><p>  Very detailed instruction manual. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div></li><li><p>  Quick start guide for a smart device. </p></li></ul><p>  In terms of configuration, this smartphone leaves far behind all its competitors.  The only thing missing from the above list is flash cards.  But even premium smartphones are not equipped with this accessory, to say nothing of a budget device.  This is not unusual, so this component must be additionally purchased. </p><h2>  Gadget design </h2><p>  Lenovo A328 cannot boast of something unusual in terms of design decisions.  Photos and reviews prove this.  It is typical to introduce entry-level devices.  Its front panel is completely made of plastic.  Accordingly, it will be difficult for the smartphone owner to do without a protective film, since there is a spare accessory in the original configuration.  The diagonal of the <span>touch screen</span> of this device is quite modest, as by today's standards, 4.5 inches.  Above it is an auxiliary camera and a speaker.  And below are three typical buttons for organizing device management.  The side faces and the back cover are made of glossy plastic.  It is very easy to scratch it, fingerprints remain on it.  To prevent this from happening, that is, the smartphone retained its original state, you need to use the silicone bumper cover, which is included in the kit.  Physical control buttons are introduced on the right edge of a smart smartphone.  This is a power button and a swing that allows you to adjust the volume level of the device. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Wired ports are located on the upper edge, namely, the microUSB and the usual 3.5 mm audio jack.  Only the conversational microphone is brought to the bottom.  On the back cover are the main camera, a loud speaker and backlight based on LED elements. </p><h2>  Computational basis of a smart smartphone </h2><p>  The most common entry-level processor is installed in the Lenovo A328.  The feedback from the owners of the device suggests that its processing power is more than enough to solve most everyday tasks.  In this case, we are talking about MT6582.  It consists of 4 computing cores, which are built on the basis of the architecture of "A7".  Their peak clock frequency can be 1.3 GHz.  Again, if there is no need for such a performance, then the frequency is automatically reduced, and all idle cores are put into the "hot reserve" mode.  That is, as soon as the demand for the computing resources of a smart phone increases, the modules put into reserve automatically start working.  Most of the tasks that are relevant today will work without problems on this smartphone model, including gaming ones.  Even one of the most demanding gaming applications, Asphalt 8, will work without problems on Lenovo A328.  Owner reviews <strong> </strong>  They say that it runs on it.  The only thing you need to pay attention to is that this toy is not at maximum settings. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Graphics adapter and screen </h2><p>  Almost the entire front panel of the device is occupied by a display, the diagonal of which in our case is a decent 4.5 inches.  It was manufactured using budget technology - TFT.  It is not necessary to expect impressive viewing angles close to 180 degrees, but this is an entry-level device.  Its resolution is 480px by 854px.  And this is enough for the normal image quality on a 4.5-inch display.  At the very least, distinguishing individual pixels on it is quite difficult. </p>

    <p>  The Mali-400MP2 in Lenovo A328 acts as a graphics accelerator.  The specifications, reviews about this component of the smartphone, as well as its graphic specifications, are certainly not impressive, but its performance is enough to run all applications.  Let it not be the maximum settings, but everything on it will go without problems.  This is still an entry-level smartphone and you should not require anything supernatural from it. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  A very modest 5 megapixel main camera is installed in the Lenovo A328 smartphone.  Reviews indicate that high-quality photos and videos with its help can be obtained only in daylight.  Text with its help, especially with a small <span>font size, is</span> quite problematic to photograph.  The lack of an autofocus system is the main problem that does not allow to obtain high-quality images with its help.  There is, of course, a system of LED backlighting, but its capabilities are very limited, therefore it is rather difficult to get high-quality photos at night.  A kind of compensation for the lack of autofocus and high-quality LED backlighting is digital zoom, but this does not fundamentally change the situation and the main camera can not boast of the phenomenal quality of photos and videos.  There is also a <span>front camera</span> in the Lenovo A328.  Reviews, photos, <strong> </strong>  filmed with her help, numerous videos speak of its very mediocre quality.  According to the documentation, its sensor element is based on a 2 megapixel matrix.  In reality, this is 0.3 megapixels, which are converted by interpolation to 2 megapixels.  Accordingly, the quality of photos and videos is very modest.  For a full-fledged ‚Äúselfie‚Äù, its capabilities will be clearly not enough.  But for making video calls, they are quite enough, since the image quality in this case is acceptable. </p><h2>  RAM, built-in storage and flash card </h2><p>  The memory subsystem in this device is very modestly organized.  Only 1 GB is integrated into the Lenovo A328 telephone.  Owner reviews indicate that about 600 MB of this 1 GB is occupied by system processes.  Accordingly, a user can use 400 MB for his software.  The capacity of the integrated drive is 4 GB.  Of these, 2 GB is system software.  Accordingly, the user can use 2 GB to store personal information and install new programs.  This is very small today.  Fortunately, there is a slot for installing an external drive.  Its maximum capacity in this case can be 32 GB.  If this is not enough, then personal data in the form of photos, music and videos can be stored on a cloud service, for example, Yandex.Disk is ideal for these purposes.  Finally, it is worth noting that the amount of RAM and the capacity of the built-in drive are quite enough for a comfortable, smooth and stable operation of this gadget. </p>

    <h2>  Battery and its features </h2><p>  The battery capacity is 2100 mAh for Lenovo A328.  Reviews <strong> </strong>  They say that one of its charge is enough for 3 days of work, again with an average level of use!  But all devices of this brand have always been distinguished by good autonomy.  Most likely, the basis of this is the good work of Chinese programmers to minimize battery consumption.  So in this case - when you turn on the mode of maximum saving of battery life and with a minimum load on the gadget, you can extend 5 days.  Given the battery capacity of 2000 mAh, a 4-core processor (albeit very economical from the standpoint of using battery power) and a 4.5-inch diagonal of the display, it turns out that the situation with the autonomy of this device is excellent.  Well, if you use it to the maximum, then the previously indicated value will be reduced to 2 days, which is also a sufficient indicator for an entry-level smart phone. </p>

    <h2>  Software basis of the device </h2><p>  A lot of additional software is installed on the Lenovo A328 phone.  Reviews highlight the presence of an antivirus, optimizer and, most interestingly, Asphalt 8.  But first things first.  In this case, ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù acts as the OS.  More specifically, its modification with serial number 4.4.  On top of it is the Lenovo Laucher.  A typical set of system software, utilities from Google and, of course, programs for working with international social networks are also available.  All this is supplemented, as noted earlier, preinstalled by the optimizer and antivirus.  Well, the developers did not forget about the games, among which Asphalt 8 stands apart.  But to run it, an external flash drive must be installed in the phone.  The capacity of the internal memory to solve this problem, alas, is not enough. </p>

    <h2>  Exchange of information with the outside world </h2><p>  An impressive set of different interfaces is implemented in Lenovo A328.  User reviews suggest that the stability and reliability of their work is not satisfactory.  And the list of wired and wireless interfaces in this case is as follows: </p><ul><li><p>  The 1st SIM card can work both in networks of the 2nd and 3rd generation.  That is, it can transmit data at a speed of several hundred kilobits (on 2nd generation networks) and several megabits for 3G.  But the capabilities of the second SIM card are limited only to 2nd generation networks and speeds of several hundred kilobits at best. </p></li><li><p>  The main interface for downloading information from the Internet is Wi-Fi.  It supports all the most common modifications and the maximum <span>data transfer rate</span> in this case can be 100-150 Mbit / s.  This is enough both to download larger files (for example, movies with good quality), and to view simple web pages or communicate in social services. </p></li><li><p>  Another important transmitter is the Bluetooth.  It is a universal means of data transfer, with which you can connect a wireless headset or a similar device to the smartphone with the exact same transmitter. </p></li><li><p>  To implement navigation, the gadget has support for 2 systems: GPS and A-GPS.  In the first case, the location of the device is determined using satellites in orbit, and in the second - from mobile towers. </p></li></ul><p>  Chinese engineers did not forget about the wired transmission methods, which are also equipped with the Lenovo A328 smartphone.  Reviews distinguish 2 ways: </p><ul><li><p>  The microUSB port, like Bluetooth, is universal.  Using it, a rechargeable battery is charged or information is transferred to a stationary PC. </p></li><li><p>  A 3.5 mm audio port allows you to output sound from a smartphone to external speakers. </p></li></ul><h2>  Pros and Cons of a Smartphone </h2><p>  As a result, we get one of the best entry-level smartphones - this is Lenovo A328.  Reviews indicate a good screen quality, a fairly efficient CPU, good autonomy of a smart phone and an impressive set of methods for transmitting information.  There are, of course, certain disadvantages of the Lenovo A328.  Customer reviews highlight such ones: a small amount of memory and a weak camera on the back of the device.  But all the shortcomings and comments fade against the background of the price, which varies today at around $ 100. </p>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  In addition to the previously mentioned advantages, it is mandatory to add a fairly rich bundle (case, headphones and an additional <span>protective film),</span> which not all devices of this class can boast of.  Plus, software is pre-installed (licensed antivirus, optimizer and Asphalt 8).  All this compares favorably with this device from similar devices.  With all other equal components, it is the latter advantages that leave competitors simply no chance. </p>
