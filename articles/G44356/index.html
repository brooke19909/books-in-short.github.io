But the result is worth it.  Iridescent figures, flowers, trees and various ornaments will not leave anyone indifferent.  It’s also a great hobby.  And you can please your loved ones by giving them one of their creations.  In today's article we will tell you how to make maple from beads.  So let's get started. </p><p>  For maple from beads we need: </p><ul><li>  beads red, yellow, green, orange, as in our case maple from autumn beads; </li><li>  wire 0.3-0.4 centimeters thick; </li><li>  ball of dense threads of brown color; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  thick wire for the trunk and branches; </li><li>  gypsum mixture; </li><li>  flower pot; </li><li>  Black tea. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="maple bead" class="if" height="487" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44266/1546767.jpg" width="478"></div></h2><h2>  Stage one </h2><ul><li>  Let's start creating an <span>autumn maple</span> from beads with an orange leaf.  We take a wire 30 centimeters long and orange beads.  We collect 3 beads on the wire.  After the last 2, we thread the wire back and tighten it. </li><li>  Next, we collect 3 more beads and do the same.  Then 4 beads, then 5 and 6. We do everything in the same sequence. </li><li>  Now we are starting to reduce the number of beads in each row.  That is, we collect 5 beads, tighten, 4, 3, 2 and 1. </li><li>  Twist the wire in a couple of revolutions.  It turned out such a rhombus.  This will be the middle part. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="maple bead photo" class="if" height="373" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44266/1549567.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Stage Two </h2><p>  We pass to the side parts of the tree.  Making maple beads with a step-by-step photo is not at all difficult.  To do this, take two pieces of wire 25 centimeters long. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  We start again with one bead.  Then 2, 3, 4, 5. </li><li>  The next step is that we collect 4 beads on one end of the wire, thread the other free end into our first rhombus between 5 and 4 near the bottom of the beads. </li><li>  And now we thread this end into strung beads and tighten.  And we draw the wire in the next row between 4 and 3. </li><li>  We collect 3 beads on the wire and tighten with the other end. </li><li>  We go down one more row and thread the wire between 3 and 2 next. </li><li>  We collect 2 beads.  Pass the wire between 2 and 1 side by side. </li><li>  String the last bead and tighten it.  Twist a couple of revolutions. </li><li>  By analogy on the other hand, we make exactly the same part of the leaf. </li><li>  We proceed to the smallest part of our leaflet.  She has a maximum number of beads - 4. That is, we do everything the same as before, but after a series of 4 beads we begin to reduce their number. </li><li>  After we went to decrease and scored 3 beads, we pass the free edge of the wire to the extreme part of our leaflet between 4 and 3 next.  Tighten by passing the wire through our 3 beads. </li><li>  Pass the wire between 3 and 2 side by side.  And so on until the last bead. </li><li>  From the other side of the leaf, we do everything the same. </li><li>  We have a leaf consisting of 5 parts. </li><li>  We divide the ends of the wires into two parts and twist them together. </li></ul><p>  Using the same technology, we make leaves from beads of other colors. </p><h2>  Stage Three </h2><p>  The colors can be arranged and the leaves are yellow-orange or yellow-green.  In general, the ones you like best.  After we have made the required number of leaves, pick up the thread and start wrapping it around the ends of the wire.  Slightly not reaching the edge of the wire, we tie a thread into a knot and cut off the excess. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  We begin to collect the tree. </p><ul><li>  In order to make “bare” branches from which the leaves have already fallen, we take pieces of wire (preferably dense, such as aluminum or steel), we wind them with a thread about one third.  With the help of these branches we will collect leaves and wind them to the trunk. </li><li>  Now we connect the leaves of 2-3 pieces between them with their "legs" and wrap them with thread.  We also attach bare branches. </li><li>  Then we gradually connect them all together with the help of wire and threads, forming large branches, each of which has 10-15 small branches with and without leaves. </li><li>  From two pieces of thick wire we form the trunk, fastening them together using a rope. </li><li>  Attach the thread to the trunk. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="maple bead with step by step photo" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44266/1546766.jpg" width="355"></div></h2><h2>  Stage Four </h2><p>  The tree is harvested.  It remains to "plant" him. </p><ul><li>  Knead the gypsum mixture and fill it with a small flower pot, leaving room for the “ground”. </li><li>  We plant there our maple from beads.  Leave until gypsum solidifies completely. </li><li>  Check if the gypsum is dry.  If so, then you can start laying in the pot "earth".  To do this, take ordinary tea, preferably granular, pour it into a pot, on top of gypsum.  So that our tea leaves do not fly apart, you need to fix them with a transparent varnish. </li></ul>
