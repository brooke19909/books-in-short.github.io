    <p>  A free-cut dress is not demanding on accessories: it looks great both with long neck ornaments and with large short beads.  When choosing shoes, you should start from the situation: a knitted everyday outfit will take ballet shoes, but a cover made of thin chiffon will not tolerate anything except open heeled shoes.  It is also worth paying attention to the belts that lie loosely on the hips. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The choice of accessories for the dress-cover should not be based on the style, but on the coloring and the immediate purpose of the dress itself. </p><h2>  The procedure for the manufacture of patterns dress cover </h2><p>  In the wardrobe of almost every girl there is a dress of a free cut.  The pattern of such a product will always be relevant, because it is worth modifying it a bit or choosing a more interesting fabric - and now a completely different model has turned out. </p><p>  Any slight flaw in the figure can be hidden with a free cut dress.  A photo of a pattern of such a product involves sewing a <span>light summer dress</span> from flowing material. </p>

    <p>  The best option for winter colds is a dense fabric, and for the summer - flying and light.  Building a pattern is impossible without taking the following measurements: </p><ul><li>  the total length of the dress (depending on the wishes of the client and can be both mini and midi); </li><li>  lengths from back to waist; </li><li>  semicircles of the neck, above the chest, chest, waist and hips. </li></ul><h2>  The procedure for constructing the main dress pattern </h2><p>  In the wardrobe of every woman there is a dress of a free cut.  Pattern of its main part involves the following sequence of actions: </p><ol><li>  At the very beginning, you need to draw a rectangle ABVG.  The size of the sides of AB and HB is equal to the value of the semicircle of the chest + 4 cm to ensure a loose fit.  This will be the width of the future product.  The sides AH and BV coincide with the length of the dress by measurement (total length). </li><li>  The depth of the armhole is marked as follows: 1/3 of the semicircle of the chest is postponed, then 4 cm is added and point D. is marked. </li><li>  From point D, a horizontal line is drawn in both directions until the moment when there is an intersection with straight lines AG and BV.  As a result, a chest line was obtained, which should be marked with the point D1. </li><li>  Point A - the beginning of the vertical line down - is the length of the back to the waist.  It will be called point E. The horizontal line from this mark to the intersection with the side of the BV - point E1 is the waist line. </li><li>  The hip line should be located 18 cm lower than the waist line and marked with the letter L. The values ‚Äã‚Äãof the waist and hips are approximate, since in the future they will need to be lowered by about 2 cm in front. </li><li>  The width of the back is calculated by the following formula: semicircle of the chest / 3 + 2.5 cm. The obtained value should be postponed from point D and designated as D2.  The resulting point is the beginning of the vertical line up to the intersection with the AB side - point K. </li><li>  Now you can begin to build an armhole or cutout for the sleeve.  The width of the armhole is ¬º of the semicircle of the chest. </li><li>  The front part involves raising the shelf, for which it is necessary to measure up ¬Ω of the semicircle of the head from point D1 and add 0.5 cm - point M. The same line should be drawn on the other side and mark it as point P. The intersection with the straight line AB - point P2 .  P and M need to connect a straight line. </li></ol><h2>  Free cut evening gowns </h2><p>  Photos of such products are found in almost every fashion collection of each season.  So, a free cut dress is present in the following types of <span>evening dresses</span> : </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  A-silhouette, whose name was given by Christian Dior himself, who created the eponymous collection. </li><li>  The balloon is able to ‚Äúrid‚Äù the owner of the main female shortcomings: a non-standard tummy, full hips.  The best setting is a light romantic evening. </li></ul>

    <ul><li>  Ballgown ball <span>gown</span> .  For the manufacture of an outfit, an expensive fabric with a lot of decor is usually used.  A delightful hairstyle and jewelry are considered the standard complement to a luxurious garment. </li><li>  Strapless.  Such dresses are often found among cocktail, evening and ball gowns.  An elegant hairstyle, a beautiful sweet neck or a magnificent decoration - all this can be presented in a more favorable light due to the absence of shoulder straps. </li><li>  Baby-dollars - a short dress of a free cut.  The presence of additional lace and quilling can turn it into an erotic outfit. </li><li>  For pregnant.  Any expectant mother wants to look attractive.  Highly raised waist frees the tummy, therefore, nothing restricts the movements of a woman in an interesting position. </li><li>  Imperial style: high waist and loose fit around the hips and waist.  The fashion for such outfits was introduced by Napoleon's wife Josephine. </li></ul><p>  Among such a variety of evening dresses, every fashionista will be able to choose a suitable outfit. </p><h2>  How to quickly sew a dress of a free cut </h2><p>  Self-creation of a pattern is a very difficult task not only for a beginner seamstress, but also for an experienced dressmaker.  Even the absolutely accurate transfer of all taken measurements to paper does not guarantee that the product will fit nicely in shape. </p><p>  The reason for these inconveniences is very simple - there are no people with ideal forms in the world.  It is the non-standard character of most of the figures caused by the lack of an ideal drawing-pattern. </p><p>  You can greatly simplify your life and sew a free-cut dress with your own t-shirt.  This eliminates the need to make grueling measurements and learn obscure terms needed to build a drawing.  It will take a maximum of one evening to make such a dress. </p><p>  So let's get started.  To make the dress look the most spectacular and attractive, you need to choose a bright neon fabric.  A blue or mint hue emphasizes a tanned body. </p><p>  When calculating the amount of material, it should be remembered that sewing will be carried out ‚Äúin one length‚Äù.  The presence of folds or a turn-down collar always requires additional centimeters.  If the volume of the hips is 130 cm or more, then the material will require ‚Äútwo lengths‚Äù.  In addition, when calculating the amount of fabric, you need to leave a margin on the seams (allowance) and on the hem of the bottom line of the product. </p><h2>  "Quick" pattern of a sheath dress </h2><p>  Since such a dress is considered the simplest, there is no urgent need for a pattern when sewing it.  A template for creating such a product can be your own t-shirt. </p><ol><li>  First you need to fold the knitted fabric in half with the front part inward. </li><li>  To create a straight dress, you should choose a t-shirt that fits as well as possible on the figure.  The pre-ironed product must also be folded along the line of symmetry.  The t-shirt must be applied so that the fold lines of both materials coincide. </li><li>  Now you need to attach the T-shirt to the fabric using pins and circle its entire contour with chalk, leaving allowances for the seams (1.5 cm) </li><li>  Then you need to pay attention to the back pattern and choose the optimal width and length of the product.  For example, you can add 50 cm in the axillary zone and 100 cm along the bottom line.  ¬Ω back + 12.5 cm + 1.5 cm = 14 cm under the armpits.  25 cm + 1.5 cm = 26.5 cm along the hem line. </li><li>  The hem of the product should be noted with a smooth line. </li><li>  Now proceed to the front.  The sequence of the process is similar to the manufacture of a part of the back, although a deeper neckline should be noted here. </li><li>  The sleeve of the dress can be made the same as for a T-shirt, only the length value should be reduced - ¬æ, for example. </li><li>  Based on what type of neck was chosen, one should begin to build a pattern of its turning.  It consists of two parts: one is the front side, the other is the back. </li><li>  It remains only to cut out all the details, while leaving an allowance for seams. </li></ol><h2>  Tailoring </h2><p>  Sewing <span>models of dresses of a</span> free cut implies consistent careful execution of the following actions: </p><ol><li>  The front and back of the dress must be folded with the front side inwards.  Particular attention is required to combine the shoulder line, as this is where the dress will be chipped.  The resulting line should be treated with a knitted seam or ‚Äúzigzag‚Äù. </li><li>  Then, pins should be pinned to the front and back.  The axis of symmetry of the sleeve should coincide with the seam along the shoulder.  We also flash these details. </li><li>  The seams located between the line of the sleeve and the waist should also be stitched. </li><li>  Side seams from the waistline to the bottom also need to be folded and stitched. </li><li>  Now it‚Äôs the turn of sewing and sewing the stitches to the neck.  In conclusion, it must be ironed so that each seam is flat. </li><li>  The sleeve and bottom of the dress should be pinned to the required length.  To do this, it is recommended to use a <span>hidden seam</span> or "goat".  We iron the product - and the dress is ready! </li></ol><h2>  Sleeveless Dresses </h2><p>  A woman is always in tune with concepts such as charm and tenderness.  Female beauty at all times inspired men to perform unprecedented feats, so that graceful beauties pay attention to them.  Following modern fashion has made a woman‚Äôs wardrobe very similar to a man‚Äôs.  Such an element of clothing, like a dress, is found less and less, it was almost replaced by casual sportswear.  A modern girl is increasingly thinking about comfort, not beauty.  However, only the dress is able to emphasize the feminine attractiveness and elegance, regardless of place and circumstances. </p><p>  A free cut dress is perfect for women who want to distract attention from the shortcomings of their figure and attract - to the merits.  This model is very diverse, it is represented by both thin summer and dense winter options.  A dress knitted free cut is a good option for the autumn-spring period.  But the model of guipure, silk, chintz or chiffon is an indispensable outfit for summer time. </p>

Moreover, in each case, the appearance should end with a stylish and harmonious hairstyle. </p><h2>  What to combine a knit dress with a free cut? </h2><p>  A loose knit dress can be worn with high lace-up boots.  A short fitted jacket will complete the look.  But the use of a jacket is not recommended.  The combination of a knitted dress with model high-heeled shoes or with boots does not imply the use of sports style in outerwear.  In this case, it is better to stay on an elegant coat, fur coat or short fur coat. </p>

    <p>  Equally important are the right accessories that can breathe new life into even the most ordinary-looking knitted dress.  For example, a thin leather belt will visually make the figure more slender and elegant. </p><p>  Jewelry is better not to use, but through jewelry - large beads, brooches, long chains and necklaces, you can not only refresh, but also refine the dress. </p>
