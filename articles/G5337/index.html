    <h2>  Functionality </h2><p>  This model is used for the preparation of many dishes.  For example, using a blender, you can crush ice, beat a cocktail, grind fruit or vegetable puree, and also use for desserts.  The power of 600 W, which has a small motor, is enough to process a large number of products.  Productivity is more than 12 thousand revolutions per minute.  <span>The Braun</span> MQ535 Sauce blender is equipped with a Turbo mode, which reduces the time spent on a particular function.  The device is equipped with two speeds. </p><h2>  Case and equipment </h2><p>  So, before buying a TM Braun blender, you should understand some points.  For almost every consumer, design elements play an important role.  That is why you need to consider the design of the case.  First of all, it is worth noting the small weight of the Braun MQ535 Sauce model.  In second place is such a parameter as strength.  The manufacturer used a lot of rubber parts, which are responsible not only for convenient use, but also for safety.  Thanks to this material, the handle does not slip at all.  And the last moment is the color.  It is made in classic colors (white and gray), so it fits perfectly into any space of the kitchen. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Now it‚Äôs worth talking about the configuration of the Braun MQ535 Sauce blender.  What exactly awaits a potential buyer when purchasing this device?  The manufacturer in the kit offers several important tips.  One of them is a universal chopper for various types of products.  <span>A measuring cup with a</span> capacity of 600 ml is used during the preparation of cocktails.  Importantly, there is a whisk with which you can completely replace the mixer. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs worth highlighting all the positive aspects of this device.  Having studied a large number of user reviews that have already purchased the Braun MQ535 Sauce blender, the following advantages can be highlighted.  The most important criterion during cooking is the noise level.  Many housewives noted that the apparatus is practically inaudible even when ice is cracked.  However, some believe that this reduces power.  This opinion is erroneous.  Performance and noise are not related. </p><p>  Of course, a significant advantage of the Braun MQ535 Sauce model is its ease of use.  As mentioned above, the rubberized handle makes it easy to carry out various manipulations, for example, beat eggs or a cocktail.  Also, a clear interface greatly facilitates the work with the device. </p><p>  On the front side there are two buttons that are responsible for switching speeds.  Well, of course, it is definitely worth saying about reliability.  According to a large number of <span>reviews, blenders</span> without serious damage can last about 5 years. </p>

    <h2>  Minuses </h2><p>  An ideal technique does not exist, so when buying any device it is worth exploring the negative aspects.  <span>The Braun</span> MQ535 Sauce blender (reviews from real customers helped make this list) is equipped with a too short cord.  Unfortunately, the German manufacturer for some reason did not take this fact into account.  However, according to users, it is not particularly critical, since the device is easy to put in the right place.  Also, many are concerned about the volume of the measuring cup.  If you cook for one person, then such a dosage will be quite enough.  But for a family of three, for example, a cocktail will have to be prepared at least three times. </p>
