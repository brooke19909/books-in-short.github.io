She must settle in the wardrobe of every fashionista.  This garment is a short blouse.  It is usually worn over blouses or dresses.  She gives the beautiful person charm, romance, sophistication, tenderness.  There are a huge number of models and options.  Therefore, each young lady will be able to find one that suits her.  In the material presented below, we will talk about how to knit a bolero for a girl.  Although, if desired, you can do a similar thing for an adult. </p><h2>  Choose yarn </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemaster.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knit bolero" class="if uuid-2965438" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2965438.jpg"></div><p>  Before you start knitting, you need to carefully consider your product.  For example, for beginners it is best to make a simple option.  And then to diversify it with the help of various decorative elements - beads, buttons, appliqu√©s and other things.  It is also worth noting: if the product is decorated with a pattern, experienced craftsmen advise considering plain yarn.  But to knit for a girl with knitting needles a shawl or hosiery knitting can be variegated, gradient, patchwork or other unusual yarn. </p><h2>  Buy knitting needles </h2><p>  To choose a good tool, craftsmen advise to be guided by the yarn prepared for the performance of the bolero.  For knitting patterned products, knitting needles equal to the thickness of the thread are needed.  If you want to decorate the idea with the now fashionable effect of elongated loops, you should choose those that are one and a half or more times larger in diameter.  The material from which the spokes are made can be selected based on your own taste.  But if a beginner takes on the matter, it is wiser to purchase metal knitting needles.  A bolero for a girl, connected with such tools, will turn out to be better and more beautiful.  In addition, the work can be done much faster, because the metal provides a good glide of the thread. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to tie a bolero" class="if uuid-2965442" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2965442.jpg"></div><h2>  Measuring Model </h2><p>  To perform the next step, you need to prepare a centimeter tape, a schematic image of the intended thing and a pencil.  Then we call the girl for whom we will knit a bolero.  She should be wearing a tight blouse or turtleneck.  After all, a bolero for a girl made with knitting needles will be worn on top of something, and not on a naked body.  Having completed the preparatory phase, we proceed to take measurements.  We need the following parameters: </p><ul><li>  estimated length of the product; </li><li>  sleeves length; </li><li>  distance from the lower edge to the armpit; </li><li>  chest girth. </li></ul><h2>  Choose a pattern </h2><p>  Professional craftsmen say that absolutely identical styles of any product look different if they are connected with different patterns.  Therefore, we offer the reader to decide in advance what ornament the bolero will be decorated with.  And here are some beautiful and easy-to-use schemes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting patterns" class="if uuid-2965132" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2965132.jpg"></div><p>  On which vertical and horizontal rapports of the pattern are also marked.  They should be taken into account when calculating the number of loops and rows needed for knitting a bolero cape on a girl. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  We knit a sample </h2><p>  Most beginners, having completed the preparatory phase, immediately begin to carry out the planned thing.  However, professionals say that first you need to prepare a sample of the pattern.  This will help to better understand the pattern and compare the selected ornament with the necessary parameters.  However, do not be scared!  You don‚Äôt have to do too much familiarization fragment.  Enough square with a side of 10-15 centimeters.  We carry it out using prepared knitting needles and yarn.  And after that we count the number of loops and rows in it. </p><h2>  The technology of calculating loops and rows to fulfill the idea </h2><p>  Professional experts say: if a product has several patterns, you need to make a calculation for each of them.  Therefore, it is better for novice masters to choose one for <span>knitting</span> bolero <span>needles</span> for a girl.  The scheme and description of the main actions must be thoroughly rehearsed, and after that the desired item of wardrobe should be supplemented with various inserts. </p><p>  When one or more samples of the pattern are ready, proceed to the calculations.  Divide the chest circumference and neck width by 10. We write down two new values ‚Äã‚Äãand multiply by the loops that were counted in the sample.  Add edge.  When knitting, the first is simply removed, and the last is knitted as the wrong one.  Then we divide the estimated length of the product, the distance from the lower edge to the armpit and the length of the sleeves by 10. We write down three new values ‚Äã‚Äãand multiply by the rows that were counted in the sample. </p><h2>  Model No. 1: we knit an elegant bolero with a front smooth surface </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.ravelry.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bolero for girls" class="if uuid-2965429" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2965429.jpg"></div><p>  To implement the idea presented in the photo, no diagrams are required.  According to the description, a bolero for a girl with knitting needles is very simple: </p><ol><li>  We draw on the needles the number of loops equal to the circumference of the chest. </li><li>  We knit, moving back and forth. </li><li>  To separate the edging, we knit several rows, alternating one front and back loop in each row. </li><li>  Then we knit the main part of the product with front stitch, and edging - trim in the same way. </li><li>  We reach the level of the armhole and finish the back and two front shelves separately. </li><li>  But when until the end of the bolero there are as many rows as left on the lower edging, we knit them with a series of front and back loops. </li><li>  Then close the loop. </li><li>  And we connect the bolero along the shoulder seams. </li><li>  We collect new loops along the armhole line and knit the sleeves of the required length, the edge of which is also trimmed with the edging. </li></ol><h2>  Model No. 2: openwork blouse </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.craftsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting bolero" class="if uuid-2965448" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2965448.jpg"></div><p>  Knitting a lace bolero for a girl is better as follows: </p><ol><li>  Subtract the distance from the lower edge to the armpit from the estimated length of the product.  The total number is multiplied by 2. </li><li>  Then, according to the technology described earlier, we calculate the number of loops for the set. </li><li>  We knit the product across an even cloth, that is, starting from one sleeve and ending with another. </li><li>  Its length is equal to the sum of such parameters: two sleeve lengths + 1/2 chest circumference. </li><li>  Having reached the desired size, close the loops and sew the fabric, forming the sleeves. </li></ol><p>  So, if you want, feel free to knit a bolero for the girl!  After all, it is really simple. </p>
