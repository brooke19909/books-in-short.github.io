The player features better video processing, the presence of two HDMI ports and the ability to play DVD-Audio.  In addition, the device works on the Web, i.e., plays content from media servers and the Internet. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  Pioneer BDP-450 is a classic type player.  With a depth of 252 mm and a height of 90 mm, it is difficult for him to go unnoticed.  Although its body is large, it is beautifully decorated.  The black matte aluminum front panel shines pleasantly in the light.  There are 4 buttons on it (turn on, play, stop and load the disc) plus a USB connector for multimedia.  The tray is located in the middle above the large LED screen, the labels on which are easy to read from afar. </p><p>  In the hands of the player it seems easier than you might expect, but the build quality is high thanks to the tightly screwed aluminum top cover. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hifi4sale.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pioneer bdp-450" class="if uuid-2654608" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2654608.jpg"></div><h2>  Connectivity options </h2><p>  At the back of the BDP-450 are 2 HDMI ports, primarily intended for owners of receivers without 3D support.  Through one of them, you can send 3D to the TV, and through the other, the audio signal to the AV receiver.  In addition, you can simultaneously broadcast the signal to 2 displays.  The mode of use of HDMI connectors is set in the menu: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Dual outputs video and audio to 2 ports. </li><li>  Separate transmits the image to the main port, and the sound to the secondary port. </li><li>  Pure Audio is limited to audio only. </li></ul><p>  There is an Ethernet port, a coaxial digital output, and another USB port.  Although the BDP-150 was cheaper, it had more outputs (except for the second HDMI), including analog stereo and composite. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.blu-ray.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pioneer BDP-450 rear panel" class="if uuid-2654555" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2654555.jpg"></div><h2>  Functionality </h2><p>  The player supports DLNA and can broadcast photos, audio and video from home servers or smartphones.  They can be controlled by mobile devices using the iControlAV2012 program, which allows you to control all the basic functions of the device. </p><p>  Users are unhappy that the player is not equipped with a Wi-Fi module.  This is a shame, especially since many cheaper competitors have this functionality.  However, the model is equipped with an additional wireless LAN-converter in the form of a separate unit, which is connected either through an Ethernet connector or a rear USB port.  He has his own power source.  There is a converter of 4-6 thousand rubles. </p><p>  The manufacturer has long been a leader in supporting various formats, so it is not surprising that the BDP-450 is capable of playing many files, including AVI, MP4, AVCHD, WMV, 3GP, FLV, DivX, XviD and MKV, FLAC, AAC, WMA, MP3, WAV.  Streaming FLAC is not possible, however this is Pioneer's only omission. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The player plays DVD-Audio and SACD with high resolution, which will appeal to many audiophiles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trustedreviews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LAN Converter AS-WL300" class="if uuid-2654661" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2654661.jpg"></div><h2>  Internet content </h2><p>  The BDP-450 firmware gives you access to Picasa, Netflix, and YouTube.  The latter is presented as an application with a simplified Leanback interface, which is easy to control using the remote control.  The YouTube graphical shell has 4 menu options: Channels, Search, My YouTube, and Favorites.  According to user reviews, the search requires input from the virtual keyboard, taking a lot of time, but the results appear instantly.  You can play SD and HD videos. </p><p>  The main menu of Netflix is ‚Äã‚Äãbright, with posters of all available films and a decent search mode. </p><p>  Picasa application, according to reviews, framed attractively.  You can enter keywords, and the corresponding results fill the screen with large, full-color images. </p><p>  Pioneer prefers web content quality over quantity and does not fill the screen with unused applications. </p><h2>  Video and Sound Formats </h2><p>  The player supports BD Live, 3D, 1080p24 output, HDMI CEC, DTS-HD MA and Dolby TrueHD.  You can output audio formats as a bitstream or PCM (7.1).  Useful is the Continue mode, which allows you to resume playback from the stop point, even if the player was turned off.  However, this will not work if Last Memory mode is enabled.  Quick Tray allows you to open the tray and insert a disc during software download, saving user time. </p><p>  Since the heyday of DVD, sophisticated video processing has made the Pioneer brand popular with AV lovers and the BDP-450 continues this tradition.  The player is equipped with the Marvell QDEO chipset, adaptive Motion and PureCinema conversion modes, a triple noise reduction system and Stream Smoother for streaming video such as YouTube. </p><p>  Pioneer PQLS eliminates distortion from synchronization errors when connected to the AV receiver via the HDMI port.  Sound Retriever Link allows the receiver to recognize an audio signal and automatically select an audio processing mode to improve its quality. </p><p>  The Video Setup menu section offers users more control over the image.  There is a choice of presets for different types of screens and projectors.  You can change the brightness, contrast, hue, color level, detail and noise reduction. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.av4u.cz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pioneer BDP-450 inside" class="if uuid-2654626" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2654626.jpg"></div><h2>  Quality of work </h2><p>  According to the owners, the Pioneer BDP-450 provides a pleasant and hassle-free video viewing.  The on-screen menu compares favorably with classic style and simplicity.  It is made on a deep black background with monochrome illustrations on the right.  The fonts are crisp and clear, all menu items are logically structured, which helps with the initial setup. </p><p>  You can access DLNA servers and USB drives in the Home Media Gallery.  The file list is located on the left in a gray window wide enough to fully display most of the names.  Here you can create playlists for videos, music and photos. </p><p>  The remote control is strewn with small buttons, but, according to the owners, the main controls are located within reach of the thumb, there is a Netflix button for quick access to this web service. </p><p>  The Quick Tray function is more useful than it sounds: according to users, the player loads disks quickly enough, much faster than most other models. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  According to owners, the Pioneer BDP-450 copes with FullHD video playback.  The player instantly detects and corrects image errors, and panning occurs without any distortion or noise - just turn off the Pure Cinema mode.  Moving white stripes of the Jaggies test are displayed with smooth, clean edges, which indicates proper diagonal filtering.  The device perfectly conveys a large number of details, giving the image complexity and texture.  The contrast level is good, the depth of the black areas of the screen is not lost, and the bright areas are transmitted with a clear, attractive brilliance.  This is achieved using presets, but you can experiment with custom ones if they are not enough. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="IControlAV2012 Application" class="if uuid-2654645" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2654645.jpg"></div><p>  Reviews note a good color palette and the fact that the movement is transmitted without delay or distortion when the screen is filled with many quickly moving objects. </p><p>  3D movies of users are fascinating.  The player reproduces the feeling of depth, which is achieved by liveliness of details and impressive colors.  In general, the BDP-450 is a terrific player, regardless of the type of disc being played.  He copes with music perfectly, broadcasting digital audio signals to the receiver without distortion.  SACD multi-channel discs sound great, immersing listeners in music with high-frequency detail, rhythmic bass and a smooth mid-range. </p><h2>  Verdict </h2><p>  The Pioneer BDP-450 is an expensive Blu-ray player, but it is worth the price.  The build is high-quality, the view is magnificent, and the player reproduces excellent high-definition images from 2D and 3D discs.  There is access to Picasa, YouTube and Netflix, DLNA multimedia streaming, remote control from a smartphone, many formats and settings are supported. </p><p>  The player has 2 HDMI outputs and viewing Blu-ray discs is much more convenient due to the functions of fast loading of the disc and continuing interrupted viewing.  However, customers who want to have built-in Wi-Fi and more extensive web content can look for something else. </p>
