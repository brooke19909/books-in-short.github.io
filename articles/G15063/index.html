  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Restore contacts after reset</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the most unpleasant problems that can occur with a smartphone is the loss of contacts.  The reasons for this are not so many: accidental deletion, loss of a gadget, as well as a SIM card, or, as in our case, a phone reset.  Regardless of the current scenario, there is a problem and it must somehow be solved. </p><p>  So, we will figure out how to restore contacts after a reset and make it as painless as possible, both for the user and for the mobile gadget.  First of all, we will consider standard tools for resuscitation, and then third-party tools. </p><h2>  SIM card </h2><p>  If in the process of filling up your phone book you wrote down subscribers to a SIM card, and not to the smartphone‚Äôs memory, or at least duplicated them, then resuscitation will only take a couple of minutes.  To restore contacts on the SIM card after resetting the device, just pull it out of the standard slot and reinsert it with the subsequent reboot of the gadget. </p><div class="photo" data-original="techpilipinas.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="restore contacts on android" class="if uuid-2744746" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2744746.jpg"></div><p>  After a few minutes, all numbers previously recorded on the card should appear in your phone book.  In some cases, the device itself will suggest restoring contacts in the phone by issuing a window ‚ÄúCopy contacts from SIM?‚Äù.  The appearance of the tooltip and its wording may vary and depends on the version of the platform and the current firmware. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is also worth noting one nuance.  After restoring contacts to Android, the names may be incomplete and cropped.  The fact is that the names on a good half of SIM cards are limited to 11 characters in Cyrillic and 16 characters in Latin (with spaces), that is, in this case, Sidorov Ivan Ivanovich will be recorded in the book as "Sidorov Iva". </p><h2>  Google Account </h2><p>  Another very simple way to restore contacts on Android.  To complete this procedure, just go to your Google account and the service automatically synchronizes your phonebook with cloud storage. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="restore contacts on your phone" class="if uuid-2744748" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2744748.jpg"></div><p>  This option is enabled by default, so if you touch it, then after a couple of minutes your book will be filled with lost names.  If you previously manually disabled this feature, then to restore contacts you need to go to a special page (https://contacts.google.com/) and there you can already perform synchronization, as well as import with export.  There is also a section with the cancellation of changes, that is, it is a kind of analogue of the basket on the PC, only contacts are used instead of files. </p><p>  Next, we consider third-party applications that allow you to restore contacts on your mobile gadget.  All of the software described below can be downloaded both from the official resources of the developers, and on Google Play from the App Store. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Tenorshare data recovery </h2><p>  This is a desktop multi-platform application for restoring contacts on Android and iOS devices.  Before you begin, you must connect the gadget to the computer and enable debugging via USB. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tenorshare-android-data-recovery-pro.en.softonic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="restore contacts after reset" class="if uuid-2744750" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2744750.jpg"></div><p>  Then the program will scan your device for deleted contacts on all media.  Regardless of what kind of OS reset you did - ‚Äúhot‚Äù or ‚Äúcold‚Äù, the platform in any case leaves entries in the system files.  With the help of the latter, contacts are being restored. </p><p>  The product is distributed under a paid license, but as a guide, the utility offers to scan your device and indicate what exactly and in what quality it can be restored.  If the result suits you, then you can buy a key.  It is also worth noting that the percentage of contact recovery for this program is much higher than for free counterparts. </p><h2>  Easeus mobiaver </h2><p>  This is a free product from developers from the Middle Kingdom.  The utility allows you to restore not only contacts and other data from your mobile gadget.  The program, in fact, is a kind of local storage. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.easeus.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="contact recovery sim" class="if uuid-2744747" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2744747.jpg"></div><p>  After installing the utility, it will offer to synchronize your gadget with a PC and make a backup of all data.  The easiest way to restore contacts after resetting your phone is to connect your gadget to your computer and enable synchronization. </p><p>  If you didn‚Äôt do it earlier, then, as in the first case, the utility will scan your device with the available drives, after which it will display a list where deleted entries that can be reanimated are indicated in orange. </p><p>  The developer also offers a paid version of the product.  It significantly facilitates the routine associated with transferring restored contacts to the phone, and also opens up more detailed export and import sections. </p><h2>  MiniTool Mobile Recovery for Android </h2><p>  This application works on the same principle as the previous ones.  To reanimate contacts, you need to download the program from the official website of the developer, and then install it on your PC.  Then connect your mobile gadget in USB debugging mode, and then start scanning. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.filehorse.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to restore contacts" class="if uuid-2744751" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2744751.jpg"></div><p>  The utility processes the phone's memory and other drives for quite some time, but the results are encouraging.  Most, or, as a rule, all records can be restored.  After the diagnosis, the program will provide a list where existing and deleted contacts will be displayed. </p><p>  The only thing worth clarifying is that for a higher percentage of resuscitation of records, administrator rights (root) are required.  Otherwise, only a small part of the information will be restored. </p><p>  The utility is distributed under a paid license, but the developer has provided a trial version, which allows you to reanimate up to 10 contacts.  If you are not a local star with a hundred other friends or a businessman, then you can do without buying a key.  In other cases, you have to shell out. </p><h2>  Undeleter </h2><p>  Another sensible program that allows you to reanimate not only contacts from a notebook, but also other data, such as images, videos and other files.  To get started, you will need to install the application on your computer and then synchronize with the mobile gadget in USB debugging mode. </p><div class="photo" data-original="play.google.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="reanimate contacts" class="if uuid-2744749" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2744749.jpg"></div><p>  The utility can conduct both superficial and deep scans.  The first is useful if your contacts were located only in the phone‚Äôs memory and you reset it less than a day ago.  With a deep scan, everything and everything is analyzed, starting from the residual dumps of RAM and external drives and ending with the cloudy images of Vatsap, Viber and other instant messengers related to the phone book in one way or another.  If you have been actively using your smartphone for more than a day after a system reset, then this mode is for you. </p><p>  It is also worth clarifying that to increase the percentage of resuscitation, you will need administrator rights.  The basic version of the program is distributed free of charge, but is limited in functionality (the number of contacts to restore) and burdened with advertising.  Pro-modification will help to restore almost anything, without aggressive pop-up blocks. </p>
