    <p>  <strong>Title holders duke of cambridge</strong> </p><p>  The first Duke of Cambridge was Carl Stuart (1660-1661) - the eldest son of the Duke of York, Jacob.  However, the titled child died in early childhood, and <span>Queen Anne</span> transferred his title to Prince George of Hanover.  After the Queen‚Äôs death, George Arthur‚Äôs father ascended the throne, and automatically became Prince of Wales.  After 13 years of British rule, Arthur died, leaving the throne to his first-born George.  After ascending the throne, George added his title of Duke of Cambridge to the crown.  It was the first in the <span>history of England,</span> Prince George of Cambridge, who became king.  Then this title passed to Prince Adolf Frederick, after him - to his son George, who did not even think about the crown.  His element was military affairs, so he rose to the rank of Field Marshal.  Prince George of Cambridge during the war in the Crimea was a division general and took part in the battles of Inkerman.  Since 1887, he became the successor to the legendary Duke of Wellington and was appointed commander in chief of <span>the British Army.</span>  He initiated many military reforms.  Prince George of Cambridge married Sarah Ferbrozer, who was an actress, which is unacceptable for an English prince.  From their marriage, three sons were born to whom he could not give his last name, and they wore a mother.  After the death of Georg, the sons, of course, did not inherit the title of father, therefore the title returned to the Crown and remained under her protection for exactly 107 years. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  <strong><span>Prince William</span> - Duke of Cambridge</strong> </p><p>  In April 2011, the most grandiose wedding of the 21st century took place.  On this day, the wedding of a young English prince, the son of Prince Charles of <span>Wales, William</span> and Katherine Middleton, was scheduled.  As a wedding present, the grandmother of a young prince, whose full name is William Arthur <span>Philippe Louis,</span> Elizabeth II of England presented her grandson with the title of Duke of Cambridge.  In an instant, Katherine and William began to be called Prince and Princess of Cambridge.  So, the title, which 107 years ago was owned by Prince George of Cambridge, the commander in chief of the British army, passed for a long time to the son of the legendary princess Diana. </p>

In addition to these regalia, William also has other titles.  For example, he is the Earl of Strathat and Baron Carrickfergus.  From an early age, his mother instilled in him a sense of equality with ordinary people who live outside the royal palaces.  Therefore, when he went to school, he easily found a common language with the rest of the students.  During his studies, he was engaged in hockey, rugby, football and basketball, participated in school marathons.  For modesty and friendliness, life was bestowed on him by many friends from different classes.  This is one of the most democratic princes in the most conservative country.
