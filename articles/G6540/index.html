    <p>  In addition, when the gadget went on sale, Megafon launched a special campaign that made the phone with good features more than affordable.  Its price was about 3000 rubles.  True, for such a cost it was necessary to connect a special tariff plan.  But this did not stop anyone. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  I want to talk about each detail in a rather dense and high-quality box separately: </p><ul><li>  Headphones are not always present, and even if there are, that joy from them is not great, because the sound quality wants to leave the best.  Depending on the color of the smartphone, the color of the headphones changes, for example, in a box with the Micromax Q415 White device reviews from different sites emphasize that a white headset is put. </li><li>  A classic cable for charging or connecting a device to a computer. </li><li>  A power supply with a red diode of 700 mA, which is a very low indicator for a modern charger.  Therefore, be prepared to purchase an additional more powerful device. </li><li>  Screen protector and cloth to wipe the screen.  This is a very nice nuance, as recently not every device has been given such a gift. </li><li>  Documents.  What is surprising, among different papers you can find not only instructions, but also a full description of all the characteristics of the device. </li></ul><h2>  Visual perception </h2><p>  This is a classic candy bar, which is available in two colors - black and white (if you want not a classic, but some terracotta, there are a large number of covers and bumpers of any color).  This, of course, does not affect the operation of the gadget, but for some it may be a fundamental factor. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The reviews for the Micromax Q415 Black are pretty straightforward: it lies comfortably in your hand and doesn't slip.  By the way, for such an effect on the back cover there is a coating that is vaguely reminiscent of a soft touch, as if a thin layer of rubber were applied.  However, the phone does not collect fingerprints or dirt.  A thin gray bezel is observed along the edge of the black smartphone. </p>

    <p>  Many people ask about how well the Micromax Q415 White smartphone is.  The reviews here are less positive, since the gray piping on the side looks cheap, and the case itself quickly gets dirty, and without a cover the phone becomes gray and dirty (some say that even the cover did not help).  The back cover is also rubberized, but in this case it is a huge drawback, because the dirt seems to be absorbed into the surface, although the phone does not slip in the palm of your hand. </p><p>  Otherwise, this is an unremarkable, most ordinary touch-screen phone at a low price, which was brought to us from China, although the brand itself is Indian.  This is normal practice, and many branded devices are now assembled in factories in China.  On the quality of the assembly, as many argue, this did not affect in any way. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  If we talk about the back cover, then the company logo is striking on it.  Some argue that this is a fist, others that a hand holding a smartphone, others that it‚Äôs just the first two letters of the brand name (Mi) of one of the ten largest phone manufacturers in the world.  It is not so important.  The very essence that it looks worthy and for a long time cuts into memory. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Above the logo is a camera, which we will talk about later, a diode flash, a slot for a speaker and a microphone for recording video.  Everything is thought out so that it does not irritate the perception and looks very harmonious. </p>

    <p>  On the front of the device is a screen, front camera, speaker, two proximity sensors and lighting.  Below you can observe three touch buttons and a slot for a microphone.  Everything is quite simple, without any special differences from any other device. </p><p>  Let's talk about the ends.  On the left side is the power and lock key, as well as the volume rocker.  These buttons practically do not protrude and are not different in color from the rim.  This is the case when the Micromax Q415 reviews are very different, because, as you know, how many people, so many opinions. </p><p>  The right side and the lower part of the smartphone is smooth without keys or anything else, and on top there is a connector for micro-USB and for headphones or a headset.  Everything is very simple, concise and unremarkable. </p><h2>  Screen and memory </h2><p>  The diagonal of the device is 4.5 inches, or 11.5 centimeters.  The screen has a resolution of 854 by 480 pixels.  The viewing angles of the smartphone are small, but for its value, the TFT-display meets all expectations.  The color rendering is pretty nice.  RAM in the Micromax Q415 - 1 gigabyte.  Such an indicator will allow you to work with several programs and tabs at the same time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  The internal memory is only 8 gigabytes, and about half are occupied by system files.  Therefore, when buying this smart, it is necessary to purchase a memory card up to 32 gigabytes in size, since a large phone simply can not be mastered. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The smartphone has a 1800 mAh lithium-ion battery.  It is thin and light, which is why the phone itself weighs so little.  Smartphone Micromax Canvas Pace Q415 battery reviews are often negative.  But when used wisely, the battery lasts for a whole day.  In addition, you should not expect huge numbers from a phone that positions itself as a budget option. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  The smartphone has a built-in mono speaker.  The sound comes out quite bright, but users note that there is not enough low frequencies.  This is a very common problem in budget phones. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  According to what the reviews say about the Micromax Canvas Pace Q415, the phone works quite quickly and copes with average loads.  It has one of the latest systems - Android 5.1.1, and manufacturers promise that the smartphone is able to upgrade to the next version. </p><p>  The processor costs a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 210 MSM8909 with a clock frequency of 1.1 GHz.  These indicators are enough to install popular games, such as Minecraft or Tanks.  If we talk about the performance of testers, then the familiar ‚ÄúAntutu‚Äù showed almost 18,500 ‚Äúparrots‚Äù.  And this is a great result! </p>

    <p>  It is worth immediately mentioning the Adreno 304 graphics accelerator. Thanks to combining it with a processor, any video sequence runs quite smoothly and does not irritate the eye. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  The smartphone has two built-in cameras.  The main one is 8 megapixels, and the front one is only 2. The main drawback of the cameras is the lack of autofocus, so you should not expect rave reviews about the photos in the budget Micromax Canvas Q415.  In addition, in good lighting, pictures are colorful and vivid.  On video, the sound quality will not differ.  So it‚Äôs worth preparing for this. </p><h2>  the Internet </h2><p>  This, perhaps, is the very moment for which the Micromax Q415 reviews collect rather enthusiastic.  What causes this? </p><p>  The thing is that one of the SIM card slots supports 4G.  But what's so special about that?  The fact is that 4G is a high-speed Internet, which has a speed five times higher than already bored 3G.  Such indicators are practically not inferior to conventional wired Internet and are suitable for those who, for some reason, can not carry a cable into their housing.  And it's all available in the budget Micromax Q415.  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãreviews depend on the place of residence of the smartphone owner. </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  How do users position the Micromax Q415 Black smartphone?  Reviews are various everywhere, but there are a number of advantages and disadvantages that should be taken into account when deciding whether to purchase such a device. </p>

    <p>  Let's start with the advantages: </p><ul><li>  Price.  Of course, to buy a smartphone at an affordable price is everyone‚Äôs dream, and it seems that with the advent of the Micromax Q415 this question will no longer arise. </li><li>  Dimensions  The smartphone has a diagonal of 4.5 inches and weighs only 148 grams. </li><li>  Ergonomics  Thanks to its special coating, the phone does not slip and lies pleasantly in the palm of your hand. </li><li>  CPU.  For a budget smartphone, the quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 210 MSM8909 with a clock frequency of 1.1 GHz is the best indicator for quality work. </li><li>  Ability to work with <span>4G.</span>  <span>A smartphone</span> on the Internet just flies. </li></ul><p>  If we talk about the shortcomings, then among them there is a battery with a low capacity, very small viewing angles and a small amount of internal memory - only 8 gigabytes.  The sound of the device is light, but somewhat ‚Äúbarrel-shaped‚Äù.  Such a smartphone is not suitable for students, since without autofocus it is impossible to take photographs of texts.  The image will be soapy and not clear.  And those who want to take a lot of photos will not be able to work with this camera.  Some users openly make fun of the inscription that appears when loading, as its design is slightly outdated.  But you can eliminate this embarrassment without any problems - you just need to change the firmware. </p>

    <p>  The main disadvantage of a smartphone is the need to unlock the device if it is not purchased from Megafon.  When buying a gadget in other stores, (although this, of course, is complicated), you can use the services of craftsmen or conduct a series of manipulations yourself.  This work is laborious and boring, but the result is worth it. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  What do we have in the end?  A cheap smartphone with poor cameras and a battery, but stylish, easy to fly on the Internet and with excellent performance.  Should I buy such a device?  Perhaps, yes, because, in fact, this Indian Chinese is the perfect combination of quality and price. </p>
