Ecotourism is very well developed in the surrounding areas; numerous pilgrims seek to visit the holy places of Balaam.  Fishermen marvel at the diversity of species of fauna (there are more than 50 species of commercial fish in the lake).  Families with children come by car to better explore historic sites. </p><p>  It is not surprising that with such a massive attendance of Ladoga there was a great demand for accommodation facilities.  Among the numerous tourist complexes, I would like to highlight the recreation center "Krenitsy", which will be discussed in our article. </p><h2>  Lake Ladoga: you need to know </h2><p>  Due to its enormous size (more than 17 thousand km <sup>2</sup> ), it is located immediately in two territorial districts: in the Republic of Karelia and the Leningrad Region.  It is the largest freshwater lake in the European part of the continent.  On the vast territory around Lake Ladoga, you can see the marvelous diversity of both plant and animal life.  The connection with the seas at this lake of glacial origin lies through the Belamor-Baltic Canal.  Initially, the lake was called Nebo, it was still known from the chronicles of Nestor of the XII century.  The real hydronym appeared due to the formation of a settlement on its shores - Ladoga. </p><p>  Severe weather conditions (a combination of temperate-continental and temperate-sea climate) absolutely do not affect the attendance of the lake by travelers and vacationers.  Leaden heavy clouds that go low above the reservoir, the rare rays of the sun, an almost English nebula and powerful winds - all this creates a unique and attractive image of the northern beauty. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The coastline stretches for 1,500 km, the average depths are about 40-50 m, and the maximum is 200-230 m. The northern part of the lake resembles the Scandinavian countries: there are skerries and fjords, consisting of unusually beautiful granite blocks.  In addition, numerous islands forming the archipelago are concentrated in this part of Ladoga.  It is here that you can see the largest island of the archipelago - Valaam. </p><p>  The southern coast is low, territorially refers to the Leningrad region.  He is famous for the fact that Peter I himself founded the city of Novaya Ladoga here, and then at the beginning of the XVIII century the entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe lake began to belong to the Russian Empire. </p><h2>  Features of the recreation center "Krenitsy" </h2><p>  The Volkhov Bay protrudes into the southern shore of the lake, this place is very picturesque.  Three rivers flow into it from different sides: Volkhov, Syas and Voronezhka.  The shores are low, overgrown with reeds, shrubs, and forest areas.  In the village of Krenitsy you can see the relict juniper grove, famous throughout the region.  The air here is clean and healing. </p>

    <p>  "Krenitsy" is associated in many with a fishing base.  It is difficult to find another place where they provide a wide range of rental equipment.  The large parking lot houses water transport (boats, motor boats, kayaks) and winter equipment (snowmobiles, special cushioned vessels for transporting guests to the ice fishing site). </p><h2>  Accommodation options for tourists </h2><p>  Prices at the recreation center "Krenitsy" (St. Petersburg) depend on the type of accommodation.  An economical summer option is auto trailers for 2-4 people.  The cost of such accommodation starts from 1200 rubles per day and depends on the number of people, weekdays or weekends / holidays.  Auto trailers like to choose men who come for fishing.  In winter, it is cold in them, and in the warmer time of the year - just right.  A toilet and outdoor shower are on site.  Inside the mobile home is very cozy and comfortable: comfortable beds, a kitchenette with stove, fridge, TV.  In hot weather, such trailers often book families with children.  For children, this vacation turns into a real adventure. </p>
