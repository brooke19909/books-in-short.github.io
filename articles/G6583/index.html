  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Rep ribbon brooch - ideas, manufacturing methods</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When dressing in a school or office, we must adhere to the form: white blouses, black skirts ... This is very boring and quickly boring, I want to stand out from the faceless crowd of equally dressed people.  Unfortunately, very often this is not permissible. </p><p>  In search of a compromise solution, some fashionistas began to decorate uninteresting blouses with elegant and stylish brooches.  It‚Äôs not difficult to get them; stores do not stop pampering us with beautiful accessories. </p><p>  And if you don‚Äôt buy, but do it yourself by purchasing fifty rubles worth of materials?  How do you like this idea? </p><p>  Let's try and create stunning rep ribbon brooches.  They will transform your appearance, give you an elegant aristocratic look, and it will become the most striking and stylish! </p><h2>  Ribbon brooch tie </h2><p>  With our own hands creating any thing, we begin to create magic.  Just now it was just a piece of ribbon, a few beads, a beautiful button, and suddenly a unique product appeared! </p><p>  Brooches are exquisite accessories that emphasize the individuality of their owner.  Handwork in jewelry has always been very appreciated, because it gives the appearance of exclusivity and originality. </p><p>  Remember the old films - the ladies are very often presented there very elegant, refined, and a brooch was necessarily present as the main accessory.  Let us also try to create it in the form of a tie, taking as a basis the rep ribbon. </p><p>  So we need: </p><ul><li>  Lacy ribbons (wide and narrower). </li><li>  Sections of rep ribbons of shade 1, width 2 cm. </li><li>  Reps shade 2 4 cm wide. </li><li>  A beautiful button. </li><li>  Centimeter tape (can be replaced with a ruler). </li><li>  Glue. </li><li>  Thread and needle. </li><li>  Felt and pin. </li></ul><p>  Let's start making brooches from rep ribbon. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": Maresina Aguasvivas, "><img itemprop="image" alt="ribbon brooch" class="if uuid-2931587" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2931587.jpg"></div><p>  Cut four strips of 14 cm from the ribbon of color rep. 2. Do the same with lace. </p><p>  Combining lace and reps, make loops, bending the tape to the center, and fix with glue.  Now put everything in a bow and sew it together. </p><p>  The next step is to cut the ribbon from rep 1 into 3 pieces 25 cm long. Also fold and sew into a bow. </p><p>  Take a wide rep and lace ribbons, cut 2 pieces of 21 cm. Fold together and make a bow. </p><p>  All the received details - fold the bows together, sew and wrap the place of fastening with lace.  Put a ring from a narrow ribbon on top, gluing in the middle to a large bow. </p><p>  Now you need to prepare the strips for a long tie.  Cut 2 strips of rep 2 and lace (their length will be 14 cm) and rep 2 2 11 cm long. </p><p>  Reps 2 and lace must be connected and cut obliquely.  Cut the end of a thin strip in the form of a wedge.  Fold all the strips together, placing a narrow one in the middle.  This item is attached to the back of the bow. </p><p>  Now cut a small square from the felt patch and use it to attach a pin.  A button with glue will need to be attached in the center. </p><p>  Everything, the tie is ready.  Dress up! </p><h2>  Brooch from rep ribbons: master class </h2><p>  The next option is a very simple, but no less stylish brooch.  A wonderful little thing for your wardrobe, and a great gift. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": , "><img itemprop="image" alt="brooch - tie from rep" class="if uuid-2931589" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2931589.jpg"></div><p>  Materials and tools: </p><ul><li>  Ribbons from rep - for example, yellow and blue. </li><li>  Metal button, cabochons. </li><li>  Pin for fastener. </li><li>  Felt. </li><li>  Glue gun. </li><li>  Sewing threads, needle. </li></ul><p>  First decide what size the result will be.  Based on this, cut several strips - three (2 yellow and 1 blue) of the same length, one yellow shorter and two (yellow and black) even shorter.  Fold to the middle with loops, glue. </p><p>  Now we collect all the bows together - first two yellow and blue, then a smaller yellow one on top, and yellow and blue combined together on it. </p><p>  After everything is fastened together, cut off 2 strips of 10 cm from both ribbons and lay on each other - this is the "tail" of the brooch.  Cut the edges along the oblique, singe and fix on the back of the bow. </p><p>  We sew the button, and it remains to attach the fastener to a felt piece, and then to the brooch itself. </p><p>  <span>Stylish brooch</span> from rep ribbon is ready.  You can choose your color combinations, focusing on your own taste and preferences. </p><h2>  Simple brooch for baby </h2><p>  For little ladies, you also need to look at 100. Therefore, the presence of jewelry in clothes is important.  Let's make a brooch from a rep ribbon for the baby. </p><div class="photo" data-original="deskgram.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bright brooches" class="if uuid-2931592" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2931592.jpg"></div><p>  For it, cut a narrow (2.5 cm.) Ribbon into 8 segments 16 cm long. Fold each strip to the center with the edges and fix.  Now, put all 8 bows you got on top of each other, forming a rounded shape, and sew in the middle. </p><p>  Hide the stitching place with a decorative button, a bright cabochon or simply embroider with beads.  Glue the clasp and a piece of thick fabric to the back. </p><p>  Done.  Now your little fashionista will be irresistible! </p>
