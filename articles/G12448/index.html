Especially those who spent many years in <span>the Ilizarov</span> Kurgan <span>Center</span> treating and rehabilitating the effects of injuries and orthopedic ailments. </p><p>  The city, which recently seemed stuck in the socialist past, is now dynamically developing.  Progress is evident. </p><p>  Once upon a time, exiled Decembrists lived in Kurgan, which means that the climate in it is quite severe.  Unwomen here will have to abandon shortened winter jackets.  It is better to admire the wonderful nature in insulated fur coats and down jackets.  And there is something to see.  After all, Kurgan places are really beautiful: with blue lakes, fed by the cleanest cool water from the very bowels of the earth. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.4649113" data-lng="65.30535120000002" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="11"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/0/5/6/8/10568.png"></div><h2>  Where is the Kurgan </h2><p>  From the windows of a train gliding across the steppe, one can observe in the distance slightly flattened, cone-shaped hills covered with forest.  Apparently, these are mounds.  This word became the name of the city.  It is saturated with the mysterious aroma of antiquity and endless distances. </p><p>  Not every traveler knows where the city of Kurgan is, and in what area to look for this miracle.  Kurgan is the city of Trans-Urals, from here Siberia begins.  In the Kurgan region, Siberian wilds are still not visible, but the Ural Mountains have already gradually retired.  All suburban nature - rare forest pegs and fields with farmland. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="railwaymansj.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Entrance to the city of Kurgan" class="if uuid-2916195" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106013/2916195.jpg"></div><h2>  Kurgan is a historical city </h2><p>  In the Urals, Kurgan is one of the elder cities.  Important intersections of regional transport routes are located here. </p><p>  The historical path of the city was not easy, and therefore it does not have a specific foundation date and birthday.  The documents were redone, the facts were confused, but the first mention still dates back to 1553.  Timofei Nevezhin first appeared on the Tobol River where the city of Kurgan is now, and built a house.  Behind the first peasant, other people moved into the settlement, so the village appeared.  These events took place near the ancient mounds.  One of them was distinguished by larger sizes - Tsarevny mound. </p><p>  After 126 years from the first date, in 1679, the settlement was called Tsarevo settlement.  The date of this event was the official anniversary of the birth of the city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="steemit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kurgan: a mixture of times" class="if uuid-2916068" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106013/2916068.jpg"></div><p>  Over the years of its formation, the city also experienced barbaric attacks, and was in the role of a reference camp, but still gradually acquired the features of a modern industrial city. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In Kurgan there are many old wooden houses.  The cathedral of Alexander Nevsky is noteworthy.  Famous throughout the area is the Drama Theater of the city.  The visitors of the Museum of Local Lore of the Kurgan Region respond with warmth to the unique exhibits of antiquity and Soviet times. </p><h2>  What the city lives </h2><p>  The cultural and historical significance of the capital of the Kurgan region and progressive industry development are the basis for the success of the region. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ilizarov.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Center for Traumatology and Orthopedics Ilizarov" class="if uuid-2916083" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106013/2916083.jpg"></div><p>  The main enterprises in Kurgan: </p><ul><li>  For many years, a medical center has been functioning, created by the famous academician G. A. Ilizarov, where the Ilizarov apparatus of the same name was developed and used for orthopedic correction; </li><li>  enterprise creating military equipment: infantry fighting vehicles and Kurganets; </li><li>  KavZ bus factory. </li></ul><p>  Where the city of Kurgan is located, in Russia there is an excellent opportunity for the development of natural tourism.  River beauties in city halls - is this not a luxury? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.xn--80aadkevhbkvnxnq8km.xn--p1ai" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="At the Kurgan Interregional Festival" class="if uuid-2916121" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106013/2916121.jpg"></div><p>  And if you consider that not one river, but four flows through the mound?  In addition, around the modern urban settlement, like eighteen pearls of rare decoration, blue saucers of lakes and mysterious bowls of swamps scattered everywhere.  There is where to look for fishing luck! </p><p>  Guests of the city will be offered to stay at modern recreation centers, visit the ethno-courtyard for travelers, spend leisure time in unique institutions of delicious food.  There are a lot of guest offers. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="iBZ9tlSK36Y" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBZ9tlSK36Y" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/0/5/6/7/10567.jpg"></div><h2>  Prospects for the region </h2><p>  The region of Russia, where the city of Kurgan is located, has noticeably improved its position in the ranking of large cities.  The Trans-Urals has entered the top ten investment-attractive regions of the country and has become a leader in terms of the positive dynamics of rating growth. </p><p>  Favorable trends in tracked areas create the conditions for a successful business.  The main focus: “Institutions for business”, “Support for small business”, “Regulatory environment”, “Infrastructure and resources”. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="YYUTm-Sk8cI" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYUTm-Sk8cI" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/0/5/6/9/10569.jpg"></div><p>  Kurgan invites tourists to visit for new experiences.
