They can make wonderful toys for kids.  Children especially value what they have done themselves.  And nobody needs this material, which can be found in any home.  Parents will not swear if something does not work out of the box and they will have to throw it away.  But children's imagination will tell you what can be done from the used box.  Parents can be proud of such a child who can use improvised material for their work.  A toy made by a baby alone or together with parents will bring more joy than bought in a store. </p>

You can prepare gifts for the <span>New Year</span> or Women's Day.  Make granny a beautiful box for storing balls of wool.  Mom will be glad if the baby makes a <span>box with her own hands and</span> makes an appliqu√© for her decoration.  Mom‚Äôs treasures will be stored in it.  Only let him do everything himself.  In this case, sharp tools may not be needed at all, and you won‚Äôt have to worry about the safety of the baby.

And then together they will dress up the obligatory attribute of the New Year holiday. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY cardboard boxes" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/1017215.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Crafts from milk boxes will help the baby dream, plan his puppet life first, and then his own.
