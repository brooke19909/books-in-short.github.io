  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Uzbek Khanate: history, political system, geography</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Uzbek Khanate is a Turkic state in the territory of modern Kazakhstan and the southern part of Russia, formed in the 1420s.  after the collapse of the Golden Horde.  Also, in some historical documents, the country is called the State of nomadic Uzbeks. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  Due to internecine strife, the Golden Horde was weakened and split into several separate khanates.  First, the eastern wing, called the Blue Horde, separated.  The wars between the new and old khans did not abate, and the newly-formed state continued its disintegration.  So, as a result, the Nogai Horde and the Uzbek Khanate were formed, which occupied the territory of modern Kazakhstan and a small part of the south of Russia.  The khanate was headed by Abulkhair, who ruled the country for 40 years.  His power was fragile.  Numerous descendants of the previous rulers claimed the throne and two years after the formation of the Uzbek Khanate, Khan Abulkhair was forced to enter into a fierce struggle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gizliilimler.tr.gg" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The battle between the khans" class="if uuid-2542476" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2542476.jpg"></div><p>  The army of the khan won the battle one after another.  Losing rivals were executed, and their property and wives, according to the tradition of that era, passed to Abulahair.  Victories strengthened the power of the Uzbek Khanate and significantly replenished the state treasury, however, the war continued.  In 1457, there was a battle between the troops of the Uzbeks and Oirats, in which Abulakhair suffered a brutal defeat.  He was forced to retreat and helplessly watch how the Oirats looted and then destroyed Tashkent, Turkestan, Sharukh.  After that, the enemies concluded a peace treaty humiliating for Abulahaira. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="indy-guide.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Way to Tashkent" class="if uuid-2541604" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2541604.jpg"></div><p>  The Uzbek Khanate was extremely weakened by defeat from the Oirats.  Some subjects of the Khan, dissatisfied with his policy, went east, to Mogulistan, where they formed their own state - the Kazakh Khanate.  Residents began to call themselves Uzbek Cossacks, which in Turkic meant "free Uzbeks." </p><div class="photo" data-original="uzbek-travel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Uzbekistan during the Khanate" class="if uuid-2541606" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2541606.jpg"></div><p>  Wanting to punish the obstinate subjects and demonstrate his power, in 1468 Abulhair went on a military campaign.  However, before reaching the enemy‚Äôs positions, the khan died along the way.  After his death, new feuds began in the Uzbek Khanate, and the state collapsed. </p><h2>  Political system </h2><p>  At the head of the country was the khan.  All the heads of clans and tribes living in the territory of the Khanate obeyed him.  The political elite, which could influence decision-making, included the Islamic clergy and officials of the administrative apparatus.  To discuss important issues, the khan convened a general meeting of the elite, called the kurultai.  Also, ministries existed in the state, and governors represented the khan‚Äôs power in the regions.  The country's population was taxed, which went to replenish the state treasury. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="maxxtravel.uz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="History of the Uzbek Khanate" class="if uuid-2541602" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2541602.jpg"></div><h2>  Geography </h2><p>  Due to continuous hostilities, it is not possible to determine the exact borders of the Uzbek Khanate.  The country under the control of Khan Abulakhaira occupied the southern part of the territory of modern Kazakhstan along the Syr Darya River.  The capital of the Uzbek Khanate in different periods were such cities: </p><ul><li>  Chingi-Tura (on the site of the city of Tyumen) - from 1428 to 1446; </li><li>  Horde Bazar (150 km from the modern Kazakh city of Zhezkazgan) - in 1446; </li><li>  Sygnak (existed until the 19th century, then was destroyed) - from 1446 to 1480; </li><li>  Kazhi-Tarkhan (on the site of the city of Astrakhan) - from 1468 to 1501 </li></ul><p>  In the west of the khanate‚Äôs possessions was the Nogai Horde, in the east - Mogulistan, in the south - the state of the Timurids, and in the north - the Siberian Khanate. </p><h2>  origin of name </h2><p>  In the period from 1313 to 1341, the Golden Horde ruled the Uzbek Khan.  In historical documents of that period of the earth, under his authority, they called the ulus of the Uzbeks.  Even decades after the death of the ruler, many sources continued to refer to the country as the "state of the Uzbek Khan."  The state created by Khan Abulkhair was traditionally called the Uzbek ulus.  In historical literature, the country of Khan Abulkhair was called the Uzbek Khanate, as well as the State of nomadic Uzbeks. </p><p>  During the entire period of the existence of the khanate in the country did not stop internecine wars.  The state created by <span>Khan Abulkhair</span> was unstable, although his power was strong and extended to a vast territory.  After the death of the khan, the country existed for several more years, and then broke up: part went under the rule of the Nogai Horde, part went to the Kazakh Khanate, and part - to the Genghisides, direct descendants of Genghis Khan. </p>
