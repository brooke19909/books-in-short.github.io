Numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers offer a wide selection of colors, fabrics and patterns that will appeal to everyone, even the most demanding fashionista.  However, to create a truly exclusive design, you will have to individually order panties in a sewing studio.  But how much more fun it will be to figure out how to sew the most underwear, and create something unique with your own hands, as our grandmothers and great-grandmothers once did ?!  Seems to be very difficult?  Not at all, you just need to show a little patience, attentiveness and imagination. </p><h2>  A brief excursion into the history of underwear </h2><p>  Panties as part of the women's wardrobe appeared recently - in the XIX century. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew lace underwear" class="if" height="481" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/1531489.jpg" width="376"></div>  At that time, they, of course, were very remotely similar to modern underwear.  Due to the underdeveloped industry, wealthy ladies ordered this intimate piece of clothing from experienced tailors.  And those who did not have enough money for the services of a fashionista, figured out how to sew underwear with their own hands.  Many peasant women even went without clothes for several decades of the 20th century.

    <p>  With the development of the textile and <span>clothing industry,</span> panties began to be sold in most stores at affordable prices and gradually turned into a mandatory part of the outfit not only for women, but also for men.  And with the invention of gum and elastic synthetic fibers and the method of mixing them with natural ones, the design of underwear has become incredibly simple and practical, as everyone knows it today. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Design choice </h2><p>  First of all, you need to choose what the future ‚Äúdesigner‚Äù underwear will look like.

Slips come with elastic at the hips and at the waist.  To add elegance, this model is usually decorated with lace.

And today, looking at the graceful short shorts, entirely consisting of openwork lace, it is difficult to believe it.  There are two types of boxers: with a seam in the middle and with seams on the sides.  The second type is more convenient, but often inferior in grace to the first.  It is worth noting that shorts are sewn much easier than slips.

    <ul><li>  Other varieties.  In addition to the three main types, there are a huge number of subvarieties: tanga, culotte, asset, Brazilian, tong, shorts-thongs, corset shorts and others.  Before proceeding to sewing such panties, it is worth mastering 3 basic types in order to ‚Äúfill your hand‚Äù. </li></ul><h2>  To do a pattern or not? </h2><p>  Having heard the word ‚Äúpattern‚Äù, many do not so much want to sew something, because everyone remembers from labor lessons in high school that building it requires various measurements and incomprehensible mathematical calculations.  For those who do not know how to do all this, you can purchase any sewing magazine where ready-made patterns are presented, or download them from the Internet. </p><p>  There is an easier way.  As a pattern, you can use a suitable model of your own underwear.  However, for this procedure it will have to be disbanded.  In this case, it is worth making sure that the fabrics of the panties and the future sewing masterpiece coincide in properties.  Otherwise, the finished product will be either small, or it will be ugly to sit when trying on. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Gusset - what is it and what should it be sewn from </h2><p>  When preparing for how to sew underwear, it is worth remembering some aspects.  First of all, regardless of the model chosen, there should be a gusset in the panties. </p><p>  This name is part of the underwear and pantyhose located between the legs.  It is always made from natural fabrics, as they have better absorbency and are better washed.  As a rule, several layers of cotton or terry cloth are used for gusset. </p><h2>  Elastic band, threads and seams </h2><p>  Another important element in the design of underwear is elastic.  Usually the widest one is sewn in at the waist and two small ones are near the legs.  Sometimes underwear is made without elastic, but this requires a specialized synthetic fabric.  When choosing a design for a future product, you need to immediately think about whether the elastic is hidden under the fabric or will serve as an element of decor, as is the case with sports underpants. </p><p>  Seams are also quite an important element in underwear, which should be given attention.  Ideally, when sewing panties, you should use an overlock that creates a <span>flat seam</span> that does not rub.  However, in the absence of this unit, you can use a conventional sewing machine using a zigzag seam, but you should choose very thin threads, smooth, elastic, with a long <span>fiber (polyester,</span> nylon). </p><h2>  Fabric selection </h2><p>  This stage is one of the most important in the process of preparing for how to sew underwear.  Most often, natural <span>fabrics (cotton,</span> linen, silk) with the addition of 5-10% elastane or lycra are used as fabric for panties.  This combination allows the product to sit well on the figure, and also not to interfere with air circulation.  In addition, natural fabrics absorb moisture well and do not cause allergies. </p><p>  However, the modern textile industry does not stand still and is constantly evolving.  Thanks to this, a huge number of synthetic fabrics have been developed, perfectly suitable for sewing underwear.  Among them are microfiber, layosel, sensitex, simplex and others. </p><p>  Very lucky today for those who are considering how to sew <span>lace underwear.</span>  Indeed, most modern lace is made with the addition of elastane, and it stretches perfectly, which means that panties from such a fabric will be not only beautiful, but also comfortable.  However, choosing elastic lace, you should not buy cheap Chinese fabrics, because after a few washings, threads will start sticking out of them or they will be covered with spools. </p><p>  In Canada, cashmere has recently begun to be used as a fabric for underwear.  As for a harsh winter - the idea is very good.  Of course, this fabric is somewhat rude for intimate places, so gusset will need to be made of cotton, but it may well turn out beautiful and warm underwear. </p><h2>  How to sew underwear from knitwear </h2><p>  The process itself is divided into several stages. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew underwear" class="if" height="376" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/1531509.jpg" width="579"></div>

    <ul><li>  Knitwear, unlike synthetic fabrics, can shrink, so before starting work, it must be washed and dried twice.  Only then can you go to ironing. </li><li>  Iron such a fabric with a very gentle iron at medium temperature. </li><li>  After ironing, you can proceed to the cutting.  Carefully lay a piece of fabric on a flat hard surface (without stretching), patterns of the future product are placed on it.  So that they do not slip, you can attach them with pins, masking tape (when it is laid out on the upside) or press the pattern with something heavy. </li><li>  Slippery knitwear must not be cut in two layers. </li><li>  When all the patterns are pinned to the fabric and circled, the details of the future product are carefully cut out.  For the low-waist slip model, there will be four of them: a back part, a front part and two parts for gusset. </li><li>  Having fastened everything with pins, the parts are stitched together alternately (in this case, use a specialized knitted needle, which is more careful about the fabric).  First, the bottom of the gusset is sewn to the back part, then - in front.  Then the product is turned out, and the second part of the gusset is sewn to it.  Only after this panties are sewn together on the sides. </li></ul>

    <ul><li>  After the secret gum is sewn to all three holes of the panties, the finished product can be measured. </li></ul><p>  This example described how to sew underwear of the simplest design without any decor.  If you want to make this model more elegant, you can sew it from a plain fabric, and instead of elastic at the waist, sew elastic lace.  You can also cut the front part of the product from another fabric or make it in two layers: lining and lace on top. </p><h2>  How to sew lace underwear </h2><p>  Paradoxically, sewing lace shorts is much simpler than a similar product from any other fabric. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew underwear" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/1531439.jpg" width="300"></div>  It‚Äôs easier to sew underwear (lace) with your hands or on a typewriter, because you don‚Äôt need to sew in elastic bands, since they are not necessary because of the elasticity of the fabric.  But it is worth remembering that this applies only to this model and fabric, in other cases, you should sew an elastic band at least in the waist area.

    <p>  Underwear similar to the one presented in this example can be sewn by any craftswoman, not even very experienced, so you can choose just that for your sewing debut. </p><h2>  How to sew a T-shirt </h2><p>  Under the category of ‚Äúunderwear‚Äù are suitable not only panties, but also sconces or T-shirts.  If not every experienced seamstress will take on sewing a bra, then it is very simple to sew a shirt in addition to slip-ons or <span>lace shorts</span> even for a not-so-skilled craftswoman. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew underwear" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/1531442.jpg" width="280"></div>

    <ul><li>  Most of the shirts are sewn from knitwear; instead of elastic bands, the beginning seamstress should use elastic lace matching the panties. </li><li>  As a pattern, you can use your favorite T-shirt, and it does not even need to be ripped open. </li><li>  We cut out the main part, then the future shirt is sewn on the sides, and at the bottom it is trimmed with double stitching (done on a regular machine using a double needle). </li><li>  Further, lace is sewn along the top of the product, while in the chest area it is worth making one undercut on each side. </li><li>  Lastly, harnesses made from the same lace are sewn. </li></ul><p>  Beautiful woman‚Äôs underwear today is not a tribute to fashion, but a manifestation of the eternal desire to be beautiful both outside and where few people see it.  And to be unique, creating a unique design of panties or T-shirts is not so difficult.  It is important to show a little patience and carefully study all the tips before sewing underwear. </p>
