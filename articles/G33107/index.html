    <p>  As mentioned earlier, the corresponding product line of a South Korean manufacturer is a sequence built on the principle of improving each next model compared to the previous one.  A very interesting fact related to the first flagship of the line.  Of course, its launch on the mobile technology market was a very important step for the company.  We explain why: the first device set a minimum performance bar.  The next time it was impossible to fall below it, which set a trend quite definite in direction, which consisted precisely in raising this bar. </p><p>  If you imagine that the moment of release was a bit of a crucial battle or a very important battle, then the competitors of the South Korean manufacturer lost the battle simply with a bang.  Again, we explain why, so that everything falls into place: the debut flagship, in comparison with similar devices of competing manufacturers, had the same (and in some cases less) cost, but, of course, the best hardware, as a result, better performance, and also more original and cute design. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you carefully analyze the relevant data, you can see that not even the Samsung Galaxy S 3 i9300 is popular, but the ‚Äúfirst esque‚Äù of the lineup.  So much time has passed, and the phone‚Äôs rating is practically not falling.  In general, we note that this device appeared on the smartphone market back in 2010, in June.  But the device is relevant to this day, and the South Korean manufacturer seems to be counting on maximum profit from its sales. </p><p>  Perhaps the reason lies in the fact that the model perfectly demonstrates its commitment to the ratio of "price-quality".  The South Korean company, by the way, uses this principle as a base.  Which is noticeable.  But the main thing is that the company's products (namely, the mobile plan in this situation) have one important property.  It lies in the fact that devices have a life cycle of two years or more.  Well, of course, you shouldn‚Äôt throw the phone everywhere, throw it at the walls, kick it and so on.  However, with careful consideration, the device will last a very long time.  In this regard, only the Apple devices can compete with the brainchild of the company, which includes Samsung C 3 I9300. </p><h2>  Positioning </h2>

    <p>  In the market of mobile devices, the Samsung Galaxy I9300 is declared as a logical continuation of the first and second devices of the corresponding product line.  And of course, he is sold with them.  In this regard, no changes are absolutely not visible.  It is understood that the flagship will be acquired by users who focus on functionality.  There is a calculation for those who love the latest smartphone market.  Already secondarily mentioned fans of proprietary technologies of the South Korean manufacturer.  Well, the ‚Äúbronze" we get people who want the device to work not just without failures, but for several years.  ‚ÄúSamsung I9300‚Äù, the photo of which you can find in this article, is just that, along with this, demonstrating, as a basic principle of creation, the adherence to the price-quality ratio. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Problems </h2>

    <p>  But if a year before the release of the model everything was still clear, the situation inside the line was in an optimal way, but now everything has changed a bit.  Yes, the new flagship - C3 - was released.  But the release in the product line of such a model substantiated internal competition.  In the role of the adversary of the subject of our review today - Galaxy Note.  He dominates his opponent due to the larger screen diagonal.  Another important difference is the ability to use special devices for drawing on the screen or entering text.  This, of course, is about re.  In general, the model automatically becomes more attractive because it has a different positioning, a different level, and also a completely different price.  How did the South Korean developer try to solve this problem?  Simple enough: the device was stopped updating to a new version of the operating system.  And it‚Äôs time for us to move from positioning to analysis of technical issues. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúSamsung I9300‚Äù.  Specifications.  Communication </h2>

    <p>  What can be said about the characteristics of the model?  Phone "Samsung I9300" supports cellular networks of GSM standards.  Access to the international network is possible due to several technologies.  The best option is to use EDGE standards, as well as 3G.  However, it also supports the work of technologies such as GPRS and WAP.  Standards have long been outdated, out of fashion with push-button phones, but <span>what the hell is not joking,</span> right? </p><p>  Software and hardware stuffing make it possible to use a smartphone as a modem with a SIM card.  Thus, the owner of the device can create an access point, as they say, to distribute Wi-Fi to other similar devices.  To exchange data wirelessly with mobile devices, the Bluetooth module version 4.0 is provided.  The signal quality is good, no problems should arise.  The same can be said about Wi-Fi.  It works in the ranges b, g and n.  The signal reception quality does not suffer.  By the way, the cellular network also does not disappear, which can not be written down in the advantages of the phone. </p><p>  For business people, as well as for those who simply use e-mail for messaging, a built-in E-mail client is provided.  It is possible to synchronize the smartphone with a personal computer or laptop using the MicroUSB standard port. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  In this model of the phone there are two cameras.  The main one produces pictures of good quality.  Well, this is understandable - its resolution is about eight megapixels.  The function of automatic focusing on the subject is supported.  Away from the main camera is an LED flash that allows you to take pictures in low light.  Video on it is also shot in a resolution of 3248 by 2448 pixels, which is not bad at all.  The front camera will be worse: its resolution is only 2 megapixels (or rather, 1.9). </p><h2>  Hardware stuffing </h2>

    <p>  It is represented by an Exynos 4412 Quad processor in the phone.  This is a proprietary South Korean manufacturer.  It‚Äôs clear from the name of the chipset that the processor has four cores.  Their maximum clock frequency is 1400 megahertz.  This is enough to launch and use games that fall into the ‚Äúabove average‚Äù category of demanding.  Yes, of course, rare friezes and hangs are possible, but only occasionally, at certain moments of the chipset loading, as they say, with a head.  In the role of the video chip - Mali 400 MP. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  The user is allocated 16 gigabytes for data storage.  However, let's not forget that the operating system with software crushes the part for itself.  It is possible to expand the volume by using a microSD card.  To the maximum, the device supports 64 gigabytes.  In this case, the amount of RAM is 1 GB.  Not so much, but not enough.  Not golden, but still the middle. </p><h2>  Multimedia metrics </h2><p>  From this category I would like to note the presence of a TV output.  Otherwise, everything is standard: a player for playing audio files, as well as video clips and movies.  There is also an FM radio.  To use it, you will need to connect a wired stereo headset to the phone.  For this, a 3.5 mm standard jack is provided in the device.  According to this criterion, another recorder can be distinguished from software.  The recording quality is good. </p><h2>  OS </h2><p>  On board the subject of our review today, the Android operating system is installed.  Its version is 4.0. </p><h2>  Navigation and SIM </h2><p>  To use satellite maps, GPS technology is provided.  GLONASS is missing.  The smartphone has a place for only one SIM card, so the choice of operator will need to be determined.  Before installation, it will have to be processed according to the MicroSIM standard. </p>
