The solution is not long in coming; you should not rack your brains.  The ideal option is Bulgaria.  A country of beautiful alluring nature, comfortable climate, pleasant service and, of course, sea, sea, sea.  After all, when traveling with children, I want the trip to meet all the possible and impossible expectations from the rest, for which most families go to Bulgaria.  Having visited the resorts of this wonderful and popular country, you will definitely come back with a lot of entertainment impressions for both adults and children.  Fresh air, plenty of greenery, gentle sun on a soft sandy beach, warm and clear sea.  One of the most popular resorts, where it is best to relax with young children, is the complex "St.  Konstantin and Elena ‚Äù(Bulgaria).  The location is very convenient, it is located near the city of Varna, about 8 km. </p><h2>  Weather and nature </h2><p>  The resort is located on the North coast, so the best period for a family holiday will be such months as June (second half), July and August.  In September, the weather becomes unpredictable: the temperature can be + 27 ¬∞ and the sun shine, and maybe + 15 ¬∞ with wind and rain.  The climate here is so good that children can easily tolerate hot days.  In summer, the temperature reaches about 28 degrees, and the sea warms up to 25 degrees above zero. </p><p>  Choosing the resort "St.  Konstantin and Elena ‚Äù(Bulgaria), you will plunge into the idyll of human communication with nature.  Exotic vegetation, pines and spruces, charming cypresses and fig trees, a park zone and alleys will not be left without attention. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Resort infrastructure </h2><p>  The resort has 2 boardwalks with shopping malls.  All hotel complexes are located so that even if you live on the second line, then go to the sea very close.  The beaches in Bulgaria are mostly urban, the entrance to the territory is free for everyone.  For an additional fee, you can rent a deck chair, canopy, umbrella.  The inconvenient high coast and stairs leading to city beaches are the only unpleasant moment in all resorts in Bulgaria.  If you have small children, then access to the sea can become difficult.  On the beach there are attractive bays, the entrance to the sea here is either on stones or on sand. </p><h2>  Rest and Wellness </h2><p>  Resorts in Bulgaria mainly differ in specific features, for example, St. Constantine - a resort with hydrogen sulfide hot springs.  Pools with hydrogen sulfide or mineral water are located directly on its territory.  Taking a walk you can observe them in different corners of some hotel complexes.  For an additional fee, you can relax and unwind in one of the municipal swimming pools for a fee.  Some hotels offer healing water treatments with mineral water.  One of these complexes is the Sirius Beach 4 * hotel. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  There are not so many entertaining events in St. Constantine and Elena, as this is a medical and health resort.  But still, several surprisingly colorful trams run through the territory.  Children will be interested and fascinating to ride them in their free time from swimming.  You can also visit a small town with attractions and various trampolines.  In special tents there is an opportunity to show your talents in painting gypsum figures.  And if it‚Äôs really boring and nothing to do, then you can go on an excursion to Varna, which will offer a lot of entertaining and interesting events for every taste.  Of course, you should take care of staying at the resort in advance.  In this article, the hotel <span>complex Sirius</span> Beach Hotel 4 * will be presented. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Description </h2>

    <p>  Many choose Bulgaria not only for the warm sea and sun, but also for lower prices.  Compared to many overseas resorts, this country is noticeably more profitable in terms of pricing policy and a favorable location, so today, tour operators are increasingly recommending Bulgaria. </p><p>  Sirius Beach Hotel 4 * (St. Konstantin and Elena) - a worthy place to stay in the resort.  The rooms here are comfortable.  The only negative is not a very convenient extra bed for the child.  Often parents have to sleep on it, as the children are not used to such discomfort.  Adult beds, on the other hand, are very comfortable and large.  They can accommodate both children and parents.  You don‚Äôt even need to order an extra place. </p>

    <p>  If possible, it is better to book a room with a picturesque view of the sea coast.  From the windows of other apartments, instead of the declared park, you can see the not very attractive building of the neighboring hostel. </p><h2>  About nutrition </h2><p>  The food is very tasty, but less varied than, for example, in Turkey.  But this is rather a plus.  Since here you can eat everything that is offered.  Dishes are prepared very high quality.  For a Russian man, there is everything he‚Äôs used to - kharcho soups, baked chicken, young potatoes with herbs, delicious desserts. </p><p>  There are several free bars in the area and in the hotel itself.  You can have a good time at the hotel's rooftop bar while enjoying a cup of coffee at the picturesque surroundings and the sea. </p><p>  The <span>Sirius</span> Beach 4 * <span>hotel</span> (Bulgaria, St. Konstantin and Elena) is mainly vacationed by Europeans.  There are not many Russian speakers.  But for most tourists - this is rather a plus. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  The distance to the beach is only 20 meters.  Umbrellas and sun loungers are provided for a fee of 4 leva.  Paid beach is also an advantage.  There are few people here, but you can relax for free if you have your own umbrella and towel.  Unfortunately, you cannot do without the first attribute.  Too scorching sun. </p><p>  The hotel has a wide coastline.  At high tide, it brings a lot of algae and jellyfish.  During this period, you can swim at the municipal beach, located 50 meters away. </p><p>  In the vicinity there are many souvenir shops both with exclusive goods and with all sorts of little things.  There are grocery stores with a huge variety of ripe fruit. </p><p>  Local restaurants serve delicious food in huge quantities and for little money. </p><h2>  Holiday Tips </h2>

    <p>  Be sure to take along a first-aid kit with medicines for otitis media, colds, conjunctivitis and tonsillitis.  Local doctors do not provide medicine, they only prescribe. </p><p>  Hotel St.  Constantine Elena Sirius Beach 4 * is located in a quiet place, so there are practically no pharmacies here.  The nearest is in Varna.  If necessary, the hotel can provide a car with a driver. </p><p>  It is especially necessary to carefully visit the pools for children.  The hotel has an area with healing mineral hot water.  If you immediately get under the air conditioning after visiting the pool, then you can not avoid inflammation. </p><h2>  General impressions </h2><p>  In general, the Sirius Beach 4 * hotel complex is a great place to relax in Bulgaria.  It has everything you need for a comfortable stay at the resort.  For an additional fee, you can go on excursions in the surroundings, visit local restaurants with excellent cuisine and get a lot of impressions of the local color.  Moreover, many go to these places in order to improve their health.  And the hotel is happy to provide such an opportunity.  On its territory there are pools with healing mineral water, a visit to which is included in the price. </p><p>  The food at the hotel is delicious and satisfying.  The food is always fresh and quality cooked.  The staff does a good job.  Of the minor flaws, not very fresh repairs in the rooms and the lack of qualified medical care that may be needed, especially for children, can be noted.  Tip: take medicine with you and take care of your children, avoiding overheating in the sun or a long stay in the pools.  Also, sometimes there may be problems with the Internet, but you don‚Äôt go on vacation to sit on the World Wide Web for days.  Dishes in the restaurant are not signed, therefore, observing the diet, it is necessary to further clarify the composition of a particular dish. </p><p>  Especially hotel guests note interesting entertainment programs.  The animation team organizes fun discos every day. </p><p>  Many spoiled travelers recommend this particular hotel for a wonderful holiday in the sunshine. </p>
