The construction scheme of the Central Ring Road</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Without exaggeration, one of the most significant infrastructure projects of federal significance over the past few years is the reconstruction of the Central Ring Highway.  Of particular importance to this project is the geopolitical events that are taking place at the moment - various sanctions and embargoes on imported materials and equipment from <span>Western Europe</span> and the United States, and the restriction of Russian companies' access to cheap foreign capital markets. </p><h2>  What is the Central Ring Road historically? </h2><p>  For many post-war decades of the twentieth century, right up to the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Central Ring Road was the military-strategic artery <span>of the air defense forces of the</span> Moscow region.  Where the Central Ring Road passes, the movement of goods and troops was carried out between <span>military units</span> located in the immediate vicinity of the Central Ring Road and armed with missile systems around the entire circumference at a distance of about 30 km from Moscow.  During these years, the exit, and especially the passage through the Central Ring Road, was strictly limited to military posts.  Of course, this road did not have the necessary attributes of a general-purpose road, that is, road dividing markings, lighting, fencing.  And the road surface did not meet international standards, it was concrete and was intended for the passage of heavy military equipment without much comfort, but at any time of the year and in any weather.  That is why the people called the road where the Central Ring Road is called "betonka". </p>

    <p>  In some places, they repaired the old destroyed pavement, laid asphalt, made road markings, and repaired the bridges. </p><p>  However, after the change in the economic formation in Russia, the introduction of widespread industrial decentralization, a large-scale increase in cargo turnover between the regions, Moscow became the main cargo transshipment center of the country, and such a road did not meet modern requirements.  Millions of tons of cargo on radial motorways arrive in the Moscow region and, after processing at the warehouse terminals, on the same motorways, travel back to the regions. </p>

Such a volume of transport is not able to "digest" not even one very wide and modern highway.  Under these conditions, it was not just a question of comfort, but a vital issue of reconstruction of the Central Ring Road, where grand construction will take place, since without it all the vehicles of the Moscow region will end up in one big traffic jam.

    <h2>  The Central Ring Road - where will it go? </h2><p>  The road of the Central Ring Road will pass through the bypass sections of the cities near Moscow, connecting Domodedovo, Odintsovo, Zvenigorod, Solnechnogorsk, Mytishchi, Shchelkovo, Bronnitsy. </p><h2>  Features of the financial and economic component of the Central Ring Road </h2><p>  Given the difficult financial and economic conditions described in the preface, it was decided to implement the construction scheme of the Central Ring Road on a public-private partnership.  What does this mean? </p><p>  Large road-building Russian and foreign holdings on the terms of the tender conclude a contract with the state for a period of thirty years.  Under the <span>terms of the contract, the</span> company for its own or attracted finances builds and operates a specific section of the road, but at the same time has the right to charge a fare for a specific section of the road. </p><p>  Of course, PPP is a new form of organization of construction for modern Russia.  However, given the kind of competition that unfolded at the competitions for each section of the reconstruction of the Central Ring Road, this form is very promising. </p><p>  As for the development of the Moscow region districts adjacent to the Central Ring Road, of course, the presence of such a modern highway will give impetus to housing construction (such serious construction companies as Morton, SU-155, PIK, etc. have already announced their intentions .d.).  In particular, on the outskirts of Zvenigorod adjacent to the Central Ring Road, the SU-155 company intends to build several residential areas.  And these are new residents, new <span>jobs</span> and taxes. </p>
