It is so easy to solve working issues with him anytime, anywhere.  You can always be sure that everything is in order with loved ones.  But there are also enough worries with him.  You need to constantly monitor the balance and know, for example, how to check connected services at MegaFon.  This will help save money.  The benefit is to make it easy, simple and fast. </p><h2>  What can be connected? </h2><p>  But before you figure out how to check connected services at MegaFon, you should also understand what they are.  Firstly, even if the subscriber did not do anything on their own, there is a so-called basic package.  It already includes the ability to receive and send calls and SMS, use the Internet, determine the number of an incoming call, long-distance and international calls and roaming services.  All of them are free, but if desired, the subscriber can always turn off any of them, and then reactivate them. </p>

    <p>  Quite often, MegaFon customers connect additional options.  They help optimize the existing base rate for the personal needs of the client.  It can be discounts on various directions of calls, SMS and minutes packages, unlimited Internet and discounts on roaming.  There are a lot of them, and MegaFon customers have plenty to choose from. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition, various additional services can be activated, such as Black List, Anti-AON or Replace beep.  Of course, they require payment, but they help customers solve a number of other issues.  But, perhaps, most often, MegaFon subscribers want to check connected services with mobile subscriptions.  They are often the most expensive and opaque to the average person. </p><h2>  Ask an expert </h2><p>  The simplest solution to the problem is to inquire about the current state of affairs with specialists from the contact center and service office.  And more recently, you can ask questions on the company's website.  To get the information you need, you will need to provide passport data or name the code word to a contact center employee.  And the specialist in the office will even speak only with the owner of the number in person, and even then only with a passport. </p>

    <p>  True, in order to communicate with a call center specialist, you will have to wait on the line of his response.  At rush hour, waiting can be delayed up to 10 minutes.  And the offices work up to a maximum of 9 hours, which is not always convenient.  On the company's website, you can submit a request and get an answer at any time, because it works around the clock.  However, this does not mean that you will receive information instantly.  In addition, you will have to resend the request if you need to disable any of the services.  But you can independently check which services are connected.  MegaFon has provided more than one opportunity for its customers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Service Guide </h2><p>  For active Internet users, it will be more convenient not to communicate with a company specialist, but to "My Account" or "Service Guide".  It can be connected immediately, or later.  It is with its help that you can remotely manage your number, which means that the question of how to check connected services at MegaFon simply does not arise.  Just go to the "Service Guide" and in the "Options, Services and Tariff" section, view all the necessary information.  In addition, for the convenience of customers, information about already activated services is available on the main page of the "My Account". </p>

    <p>  Also worth a look in the sections "Call Forwarding and Call Barring" and "Additional Services".  In the first one, you can check for installed redirects and bans, as well as manage the Black List.  Such information may be needed for missed calls.  But in the second section, you can check for mobile subscriptions, connect and disconnect Navigator and Video Portal. </p><h2>  Good old USSD and not only </h2><p>  However, even today, a situation may arise when it is not possible to turn to a specialist, but there is no access to the ‚Äúcabinet‚Äù.  And then how to check what services are connected to MegaFon?  You can do this directly from the device, without access to the Internet, using the USSD request (* 105 #).  With it, you can view information about all available services and options, as well as get settings and check the bonus balance.  In fact, this is a mini version of "My Account". </p>

    <p>  The same version is also available for the voice menu by number 0505. With a speakerphone function, this portal can completely replace even a contact center specialist.  All the necessary information is provided, although in a concise form, but is understandable and accessible.  In addition, you can listen to it as many times as needed.  Yes, and such a "Personal Account" is available 24 hours a day and 7 times a week.  This is also important. </p><h2>  But what about mobile subscriptions? </h2><p>  So, we found out how to check connected paid services at MegaFon.  It‚Äôs not clear how to deal with mobile subscriptions.  Often their presence is a complete surprise to subscribers (succumbed to advertising, activated and forgotten).  For a long time, many people have no idea about writing off money for all these "joys."  Of course, all the necessary information can be viewed in a special section of the official website of the company.  But you can just send an SMS with the text "info" to the number 5051. The request is free, and after a couple of minutes the answer to your question will appear on the phone‚Äôs display.  In addition, there will be information on how to disable existing subscriptions.  Convenient, isn't it? </p>
