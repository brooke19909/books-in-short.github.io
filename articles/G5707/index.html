The first evidence of human settlement on this earth dates from the Paleolithic era.  Even then, the first monuments appeared that belong to various cultures of archeology. </p><h2>  History of the Republic of Tatarstan </h2><p>  With the development of craft and the change of eras, the results of human labor also changed.  During the transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age, Anan'in culture arose and developed, the creators of which settled on the Volga-Kame.  There is evidence that between the VIII and VII centuries BC, tribes of Sarmatians and Gorodets culture appeared on this territory. </p><p>  The history of Tatarstan indicates that at the stage of transition to a new era, cultural monuments called ‚ÄúPianoborsky‚Äù appear.  They are concentrated in the Lower Prikamye.  In the period of the III-IV century, Turkic and Ugric tribes from Siberia began to penetrate this land, which subsequently managed to oust the indigenous population from the banks of the Kama River.  This is evidenced by the found Turaevsky mounds, which are historical monuments.  They found soldiers buried with weapons.  During the 4th and 7th centuries, the main territory of the modern republic of Tatarstan was inhabited by the people of Imenkovsky culture. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="history of Tatarstan" class="if" height="443" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23608/615071.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The history of Tatarstan mentions the existence of the Volga Bulgaria in the period VIII - XIII centuries. </p><p>  The written data from those times do not provide reliable and detailed information about this state.  However, it is generally accepted that part of the territory of the Northern Volga region was included here: Zakamye, Prekamye, and Volga.  Some historians agree that the northern borders of the <span>Volga Bulgaria</span> passed along the right bank of the Kama River, and the western ones along the Sviyaga River.  The eastern border went around the Shishchma river, and the southern one was near Samara Luka.  Meanwhile, some researchers are inclined to a different opinion, suggesting that the borders of Bulgaria were much wider. </p><p>  The next period in the history of the development of the Republic of Tatarstan is the formation of the Kazan Khanate.  Its founder is Kazan Khan - Ulu Muhammed.  Having captured Kazan in 1438 and having deposed the Bulgarian prince, he proclaimed the khanate and founded his dynasty.  As a result, the formed state became the successor of Bulgaria.  Soon, in 1552, Kazan was captured by Tsar Ivan IV, and the conquered territories joined the Moscow state.  From this moment begins the active development of Tatarstan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nature of Tatarstan" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23608/615134.jpg" width="600"></div>

In this place two largest rivers merge - the Volga and the Kama.  The presence of a mild temperate continental climate allows you to develop ski resorts that have no analogues in our country.  The nature of the Republic of Tatarstan fascinates with its beauty.  The view of the panorama <span>of the Kama River is</span> stunning, and the indescribable beauty of the mountain-plain landscapes bewitches, forcing tourists to return here again and again.  Even the indigenous people do not cease to admire the nature of their native land.  Tatarstan leaves no one indifferent.  In clear sunny weather, the belfries of Christian churches and the minaret of Muslim mosques in Elaburga flaunt the horizon.  The sparkling riverbed and numerous lakes, giving a bright reflection, and the famous Bolshoi Bor do not cease to please true fans of natural landscapes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nature of the native land of Tatarstan" class="if" height="457" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23608/615085.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  National Health Resort </h2><p>  The nature of Tatarstan is also famous for its healing properties.  The combination of the steppe air, the healing microclimate of the mixed forest, saturated with medicinal substances - volatile, and mineral water sources together contribute to the rapid healing of the body.  In this regard, for many years tatarstan sanatoriums and health resorts have been carrying out active climatotherapy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nature of the republic of Tatarstan" class="if" height="346" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23608/615089.jpg" width="500"></div>

Within the republic, it is the most diverse and rich forest.  This includes such interesting logs as Maly Yerkhov, Raspberry, Rich, Big.  These natural objects have not yet been affected by active human life.  Here bicentenary giants lurked: beautiful fir, pine, linden.  In the northern part of the boron there is a flexible line of small lakes, the depth of which ranges from one and a half to seven meters.  Such reservoirs are of great interest to science.  Rare species of plants listed in the Red Book of Tatarstan grow in their vicinity.  In the waters of lakes and on their shore you can meet such representatives of the animal world as muskrat, lizard, song and waterfowl, elk and roe deer.  And this is only a small part of the species of living inhabitants with which the nature of Tatarstan is rich.  Photos of her beauties are unusually bright and memorable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nature of Tatarstan photo" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23608/615093.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In order to preserve the heritage of nature of the Republic of Tatarstan, the authorities founded the Volga-Kama Reserve in 1960.  It is located in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Western Ciscaucasia, and includes Raifsky and Saralovsky plots.  The total area is more than eight thousand hectares, most of which is covered with forests. </p><h2>  Picturesque natural corner </h2><p>  The Raifsky site is isolated, located in Zelenodolsky district, only twenty-five kilometers from the capital of the republic - Kazan.  Mostly flat terrain prevails, but there are significant fluctuations in absolute heights from fifty to one hundred and forty meters.  Of great interest is Lake Raifa, as well as a dendrological garden in which plants grow from almost all continents of the planet.  Fifty-five species of animals, almost two hundred species of birds and more than thirty species of underwater inhabitants live here.  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãcoastal shallow waters are incredibly rich spawning grounds. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="natural monuments of the republic of Tatarstan" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23608/615096.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Natural resources </h2><p>  The resources with which the nature of Tatarstan is rich led the republic to the second place among Russian entities in oil production.  The state balance records the reserves of one hundred and forty-five deposits, which are estimated at 1.734 billion tons. According to preliminary forecasts, potential reserves of natural resources are estimated at 2.7 billion tons. The total raw material base, which includes two hundred and fifty deposits, is represented by eighteen types of raw materials.  This includes mining, construction and agromineral species.  Of great value are bentonite, expanded clay, sand mixtures.  They provide a significant share of the needs of the republic and the country as a whole. </p><h2>  Natural monuments </h2><p>  The republic is rich not only in mineral reserves.  Of considerable interest are the natural monuments of Tatarstan.  They are of particular value.  In this regard, one of the most important goals of the region‚Äôs authorities is to preserve the biological and landscape diversity, unique geological objects and habitats of the rarest species of plants and animals on the territory of the republic.  This is especially true for representatives listed in the Red Book who are in danger of extinction. </p><p>  The natural monuments of the Republic of Tatarstan include the preserved natural complex ‚ÄúFloodplain of the Kyrykmas River‚Äù.  Scientific studies conducted in this area have shown results: twenty-seven species of fish live in the waters of this river.  This includes brook trout, <span>common minnow,</span> European grayling, <span>common sculpin.</span>  All of them are listed in the Red Book of the Republic of Tatarstan.  In addition, seventy-five species of birds were observed on the banks of the arm of the Kƒ±rƒ±kmmaks River, seventeen of which were ‚Äúredbooks‚Äù.  The latter include field harrier, meadow harrier, white-tailed eagle and others.  On the territory of the monument there are also such rare representatives of flora and fauna as the fragile spindle, <span>common viper, and</span> red-bellied toad. </p><p>  The nature of Tatarstan is rich in such a reserve as the Krasnoborsky geological section.  Its occurrence refers to the ice age, the era of the Dnieper glaciation.  The special legal status of the protected area allows preserving unique geological objects on the territory of this natural monument that have environmental and scientific importance. </p><h2>  Limitations within nature reserves </h2><p>  Within the borders of the Krasnoborsky geological section and the ‚ÄúFloodplain of the Kyrykmas River‚Äù, established prohibitions apply.  It is impossible to carry out economic activities that have a potential negative impact on natural monuments and their inhabitants.  There is a complete ban on any geological exploration in the Krasnoborsk geological section, the development of mineral resources within it.  Within the boundaries of the natural monument ‚ÄúFloodplain of the Kyrykmas River‚Äù any movement on water-motor transport is excluded, plowing of land, construction of buildings and structures, as well as any communications and infrastructure are not allowed.  There is also a ban on the storage of toxic chemicals and the implementation of any activities that may contribute to the disruption of natural processes. </p><h2>  Who owns the natural heritage? </h2><p>  <span>The natural monuments of</span> Tatarstan belong to lands with agricultural purpose.  They are owned by the state and are located in the following territories: Krasnoborskoye, Staroslyakovskoye, Devyaterninskoye rural settlements of the Agryz municipal district. </p><p>  In order to preserve these natural complexes, there are protected areas (specially protected natural areas).  According to the state cadastre, their total number is 163. </p><p>  Thus, the Republic of Tatarstan has a rich history.  Due to its favorable geographical location and unique natural places, this territory has always been of particular value to many peoples.  Currently, there is an active development of Tatarstan.  Every year the influx of tourists is increasing, wishing to get acquainted with the nature reserves and monuments of this beautiful and amazing republic. </p>
