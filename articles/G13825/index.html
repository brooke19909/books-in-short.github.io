    <p>  Most Djerba hotels are concentrated along the north and west coasts.  There is a small resort area in the south-east of the island, in the town of Medun.  You can get to Djerba by ferry (for only ten) or use the services of air services. </p><h2>  Local attractions and activities </h2><p>  In Gellal you can visit the museum of folk traditions, which tells about the life of the native Djerbins.  The local history museum on the outskirts of the city is known for its stunning collection of traditional clothes, ceramics, jewelry, wood carvings. </p><p>  From the island you can go on an excursion to the Sahara, see the Barbary settlements, honeycombs. <strong> </strong></p><p>  At the local Medina you can see a lot of interesting things.  Three mosques are located next to it: Jamaa Ettruk, Ash Sheikh, Jemaa el Gorba.  On the island is the oldest Jewish village in which there is a 2600-year-old synagogue of Grib. </p><p>  There is a lot of greenery on Djerba, pink flamingos spend afternoon hours in its shadow.  There are an incredible amount of them and they are not at all afraid of people.  The island has many underground sources, thanks to them it is rich in vegetation: palm trees, fig, olive, fruit trees.  Flocks of marabou live on the sea coast.  Djerba is famous not only for its beautiful sandy beaches, but also for its incredibly warm climate and clear waters.  The warm sea, washing the island with palm and olive groves, is not subject to temperature fluctuations, so you can sunbathe and swim here all year round. </p><h2>  Sensimar Palm Beach Palace 5 *: reviews </h2><p>  Having a conversation about the hotel, I want to discuss the reviews of tourists who managed to visit such a beautiful place.

    <p>  Rooms are cleaned daily; towels are also changed every day.  There are no claims to cleanliness. </p><p>  The hotel has very good food.  A large number of various dishes are served daily in the restaurant: mashed soups, broths, meat, fish, fruits, ice cream, pastries.  According to the all-inclusive system, guests are offered local champagne, wine, beer.  All drinks are of acceptable quality.  For a surcharge, you can order imported alcohol.  Once a week (on Thursdays) a "director's dinner" is arranged, which must be attended in certain clothes.  The event is very solemn.  The local chef deserves special praise, which delights tourists with delights; here you can taste kidneys in sauce, beef tongues, shrimps, mussels, grilled tuna and much more. </p><p>  The hotel has its own spacious beach with normal sun loungers and reed mushrooms.  On the shore there is a shower, a foot washer, a bar and a toilet.  The sea is very warm and clean, although sometimes after storms it can bring a lot of algae, but this is nature, nothing can be done about it. </p><p>  The complex has beautiful pools, the relaxation pool with hydro-massage waterfalls is especially good.  It is located near the shore and is equipped with a good bar.  There are few people in the pools, everyone has enough space. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="palm beach palace sensimar 5 deluxe" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1496131.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel has animators.  In the mornings, you can work out with them aerobics or water aerobics, then play darts, volleyball or soccer.  In the evenings, guests are invited to an entertainment show (magicians, belly dancing, etc.). </p><p>  The tourist area is fenced by roadblocks with police and military personnel.  The beaches are also patrolled, they are not allowed on the local ones, even merchants should not be approached by tourists.  If you are interested in their product, then go to them yourself.  At the entrance to the hotel, be sure to check all the cars and bags.  Daily checks are even employees.  There are also cameras on site. </p><p>  The hotel is located at some distance from civilization, but here it is always quiet and calm.  If you wish, you can visit the nearest attractions, go to Medun and make purchases. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Summing up the conversation and based on reviews from tourists, we can recommend Sensimar Palm Beach Palace 5 * to vacationers.  Tours to Djerba are quite popular, because here for quite reasonable money you can have a good rest in decent conditions.  Therefore, people planning a vacation in Tunisia can consider this hotel as an option for a vacation.  Excellent food and a beautiful complex will make your stay unforgettable. </p>
