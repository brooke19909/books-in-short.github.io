Possible options, design rules</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Young entrepreneurs who want to start their own business are primarily faced with the problem of financial loans.  In fact, obtaining a loan is not so simple.  The most convenient option is to borrow money from relatives, but not everyone has the opportunity.  In this case, you can‚Äôt do without bank services: in fact, in any financial institution you can get a loan for the development of small businesses from scratch.  It is recommended to visit some of the most reliable banks with a good reputation and collect information on the conditions under which they provide loans. </p><h2>  Small <span>business</span> loans <span>from scratch:</span> how and where to get? </h2><p>  After choosing a bank, you can send documents to the branch.  Large financial institutions almost always offer several types of loans with different conditions.  These are standard programs with various additions - they have a similar essence.  Employees may suggest you study the offers of partner banks.  The next step will be to draw up a business plan taking into account the selected program, marketing steps and adjusting other issues. </p><p>  Having collected all the required documents, you need to apply for cash.  It is necessary to prepare money for the down payment: usually this is a third of the amount of the desired loan.  If all the requirements are met, the bank will most likely meet its client. </p>

This is due to taking into account the risk of the institution, because it is much more than when issuing a loan in other directions.  Due to the unstable economy of the country, banks with great care give loans for the development of small businesses from scratch.  To increase your chances of a successful outcome, you need a competent and effective business plan.

It is very useful to supplement the document with accounting calculations - so specialists will be able to see from what means you plan to pay off the debt.  The business plan should be as convincing as possible, and also supported by a description of the collateral: real estate or cash.  The loan committee may regard the refusal to provide collateral as the borrower's uncertainty about the return of funds.  In this case, obtaining a loan for the development of small businesses from scratch will be very difficult. </p><h2>  Additional factors </h2><p>  The bank will certainly require a document on the income of an individual.  It is issued by the tax office.  This certificate may significantly affect the amount of the established percentage.  And it‚Äôs better to take care of getting the paper in advance, since its design will take some time.  Such a certificate is, in principle, a perpetual document, but when considering a request for a large cash loan, the bank can set specific terms for issuing and indicate the period for which reporting is required. </p>

In addition, you will not receive money if employees have doubts about the organizational capabilities in relation to the scope of the project.  A key role is played by collateral, its absence or lack of liquidity, the absence of a guarantor or doubts about its impact.  The inability to compete with companies of the same profile in which it is planned to start a business, and the lack of significant advantages also play a significant role. </p>

    <h2>  Methods for obtaining funds </h2><p>  The decision to grant a loan is based on two methods.  The first is the conclusions of credit experts and subjective analysis.  The second is decision-making by the scoring system.

The whole process takes about an hour.  From the documents you need only a passport and a certificate of income from the company.  The percentage is slightly higher than in the standard program, but you can get the required amount almost instantly. </p>
