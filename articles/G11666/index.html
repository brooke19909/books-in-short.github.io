You are just at the very beginning of the journey to the heights of sewing craftsmanship. </p><p>  Do not worry and think about possible failures.  All the craftswomen began with the study of simple techniques of needlework and became real craftswomen.  So, it will work out for you too.  Let's look in detail how to sew a hidden zipper.  Having tried to do this several times on various materials, you will easily be able to perform a simple technique for making a fastener. </p><p>  There are two ways to sew a hidden zipper.  We will consider each of them.  One method is designed for a small clasp, and the second is for a long zipper.  In modern clothes, a secret fastener is used everywhere.  It makes the pants or dress more harmonious and improves the look. </p><p>  <strong>How to sew a hidden zipper in a skirt?</strong> </p><p>  In this case, the option used for short fasteners is more suitable.  If you are afraid of skewing the fabric, then place the zipper in the back middle seam, and not in the side.  Slices of parts are processed on an overlock.  We fold the blanks with their sides inward and grind them at a distance of 0.7-1 centimeter from the edge, leaving the section intended for fastening open.  After this, iron the allowances.  Do not forget, the prepared zipper should be two centimeters longer than the distance you left for it. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  We lay out the stitched details on the table with the wrong side up.  We open the zipper and impose one of its sides on the seam allowance so that the teeth are located strictly along the ironed edge.  We fix it with the help of needles and carefully sweep it to the allowance, observing the exact location of the cloves.  The stitches finish exactly at the beginning of the middle seam.  In the same way, we notice the second half of the lightning.  We only begin to move not from the top of the part, but from the slider.  The fabric on the allowances are positioned evenly, do not stretch and do not fit.  This will help to avoid distortions and bumps on the finished product. </p><p>  We install on the sewing machine a specialized foot designed to sew in zippers and, guided by the outline, we lay two lines.  Bindings are not worth it.  Leave a thread of sufficient length at the end of the seam and tie knots manually.  Only after that, remove the basting threads.  Close the zipper and iron parts of the product. </p><p>  <strong>How to sew a hidden zipper in a dress?</strong> </p><p>  Since the fastener is of sufficient length, in this case it is more convenient to use the second option.  We take the back details of the dress and process the seam allowances on the overlock.  We smoothly bend 1.5 centimeters inward along the entire length of the seam and stab with needles.  We apply a zipper, equalizing the cloves with the fold.  After that, we sweep it into the allowance.  Using a specialized foot, we sew a line until we hit the zipper slider.  In the same way we sew the second side of the fastener.  Only after this we grind the middle seam on the back parts of the back, starting from the zipper down.  Ironing allowances. </p><p>  Now you know how to sew a secret zipper, and you can use any of the proposed options.  Choose the one that seems most simple to you.  Try to make such a fastener using two pieces of cheap fabric.  Do not be discouraged if the first time you get not as good a result as you would like.  After all, skill comes with experience. </p><p>  Having spent a little time, patience and performing all operations with accuracy, you will surely achieve a positive result and will be able to use a secret fastener in the manufacture of a fashionable wardrobe. </p>
