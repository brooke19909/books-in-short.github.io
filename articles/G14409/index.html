It can be clothes, shoes, interior, workplace, hairstyle, manicure and much more.  Knowing about this human weakness, manufacturers are constantly coming up with something new and beautiful, for example, rhinestone applications that will not leave any girl indifferent.  Probably every fashionista has at least one product, strewn with them. </p><h2>  Bright decorations of things and objects </h2><p>  These small baubles are pebbles of glass imitating precious stones.  Due to their high refractive index and dispersion, they shine like real ones. </p><p>  There are many varieties of rhinestones.  They are transparent, colored or nacreous, they can be glued with glue, but self-adhesive are also sold.  Most often they decorate the back of a jacket, pants or jeans. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rhinestone Appliques" class="if" height="456" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44175/1518687.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It is quite simple to work with rhinestones, only one thing is important - to fix them qualitatively on clothes.  It is best to choose a thing that is rarely worn, respectively, less erased and practically does not get dirty. </p><p>  Now there are many ready-made schemes for attaching such jewelry, but if you have artistic abilities, you can create your own unique drawing.  However, you can use thermal decals, working with them is simple and easy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Rhinestone decal </h2><p>  For decorating various wardrobe items, there are many options for this type of jewelry.  They will help to decorate any, even the most ordinary-looking thing.  Of course, rhinestones can be purchased individually, but if you need to depict any ornament or pattern, then it will be very difficult to do. </p><p>  But the rhinestone decals are ready-made images with selected stones of different colors and sizes.  All that is required is to choose the picture you like.  These jewelry are made of heat-resistant materials, and working with them is quite simple. </p><h2>  How to glue <span>rhinestones on clothes:</span> step-by-step instructions </h2><p>  In order to glue the application qualitatively, you need to adhere to a certain sequence of actions: </p><ol><li>  Remove the back paper from the drawing.  To change the picture (if necessary), you can use tweezers. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rhinestone decal" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44175/1518692.jpg" width="430"></div></li><li>  On the ironing board, clothes are laid out and applications from rhinestones are placed with the sticky side to the fabric. </li><li>  The material with the image is turned face down.  A small piece of thin cloth should be placed on top.  If rhinestones are of different sizes, soft cloth should be placed under the applique so that elements of a larger size do not stand out in height. </li><li>  The iron is installed on the program "cotton" or "wool", turning off the humidification mode.  It is placed on top of the appliqu√© and does not move.  The average waiting time, if the fabric is thin, is about 15 seconds, for a dense fabric, the waiting time is about 30 seconds. </li><li>  If the material is very dense, the procedure can be repeated from the front so that the glue penetrates well into the fabric.  These manipulations should be performed on the front side only if all the rhinestones are the same size. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rhinestones on clothes" class="if" height="301" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44175/1518685.jpg" width="500"></div></li><li>  The product must be allowed to cool.  After that, the film is carefully removed from the picture.  If some elements remain on the film, they must be removed with tweezers and repeat the procedure with the iron in this place again. </li><li>  Removing glue from the top of the rhinestone is removed with a cloth moistened with white spirit. </li></ol><h2>  Clothing decor with sewn rhinestones </h2><p>  Benefits of sewn on rhinestones: </p><ul><li>  Easy to handle.  Sewed rhinestones have a pair of holes with which they are sewn to the product.  In each of the holes, the needle is threaded twice, the thread is fixed on the wrong side and, without trimming it, proceed to sewing on the adjacent stone.  Thus, using one thread, up to 10-12 elements are sewn. </li><li>  The undeniable advantage of this type of decoration is that an incorrectly sewn rhinestone can always be removed without damaging the surface of the fabric and without spoiling it with glue. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sewed rhinestones" class="if" height="481" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44175/1518683.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><p>  Sew-on rhinestones have only one drawback - the edges of the hole and the stone itself can fray the thread over time. </p><p>  Thinking of decorating clothes with rhinestones, you need to familiarize yourself with how to care for them in the future.  As for washing, the water temperature should not be higher than 60 degrees.  If it is a decal - no more than 40 degrees.  It is best to use a liquid detergent, while you should refuse to soak and wash the products by hand. </p><p>  Avoid prolonged contact with the iron in places where rhinestone applications are glued, otherwise the adhesive layer may melt. </p>
