Artists delight the audience with national dances, songs, acrobatic numbers and torch juggler shows. </p><p>  And by the way, this hotel has really good soundproofing.  Not so long ago (a little over a year ago) in the building all the windows were replaced with new ones.  So the inside is very quiet. </p><p>  In general, this is an excellent hotel for those people who want to get the most out of their vacation, enjoy the good service, delicious food and at the same time pay a modest amount. </p>
