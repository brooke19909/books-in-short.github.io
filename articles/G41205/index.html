    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Designers worked very hard, developing the design of the packaging box.  Outwardly, it looks simple, but quite attractive.  You may find distant similarities with Apple products.  The basis was taken in white.  Against his background is a photograph of the smartphone Xiaomi Redmi 4 Pro.  It depicts a gadget from both the front and the back.  In the upper right corner is the company logo, highlighted in orange.  Directly below the image is the name of the phone.  Everything is quite simple, but tasteful. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Looking inside the packaging box, you can see that the device is packed very tightly.  Directly beneath it are a USB cable, a power adapter and a paper clip that opens the SIM card tray.  There is also a package of documents.  In it, in addition to the manual, the manufacturer provides a certificate and a warranty card.  Headphones and other accessories are not provided.  They will need to be purchased separately. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  Review Xiaomi Redmi 4 Pro must begin with a description of the design.  The appearance is pretty ordinary.  For him, the manufacturer used a standard, generally accepted style.  A rectangular case with slightly rounded corners looks quite manly.  The first thing that catches the eye of buyers is the unusual material of the back panel.  With a cursory glance, it is almost impossible to determine that it is metal.  It feels a little rough, but quite pleasant.  The only thing that testifies to the metal surface is a pleasant cold during touch.  A plastic insert is located only at the top of the gadget.  The Xiaomi Redmi 4 Pro phone is assembled perfectly, there are no gaps. </p><p>  By purchasing this model, users checked the build quality.  Comments to her did not arise.  All parts are fitted as accurately as possible.  Squeaks and backlash are absent.  If you do not look closely at the manufacturer, then at first glance the phone will be difficult to call a state employee.  In the hand, according to users, the device is quite comfortable.  It‚Äôs easy to manage. </p><p>  The Xiaomi Redmi 4 Pro has a fingerprint scanner.  The need to unlock the device using the key disappears by itself.  The scanner is located on the rear panel at the top.  The location of all communication connectors is identical to the Redmi 3S model.  The changes affected only the camera lens, which is now closer to the center, and the location of the speaker hole (brought to the bottom). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  According to users, the only drawback is the lack of backlight control panel.  All keys on it are touch-sensitive.  They have special designations.  The lack of backlighting affects only the aesthetic perception, but during operation it does not cause the user any particular inconvenience. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi redmi 4 pro 32gb" class="if" height="486" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2006470.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Talk about the screen </h2><p>  In Xiaomi <span>Redmi 4 Pro, the</span> display <span>specifications</span> impressed everyone without exception.  Few people expected such indicators from the state employee.  Its size is 5 ∫.  It is manufactured in compliance with IPS technology.  The manufacturer used 2.5D glass.  The resolution with which the picture is displayed can be considered amazing.  It equals 1920 √ó 1080 px. </p><p>  High-quality color reproduction, excellent contrast and maximum viewing angles are significant advantages of this phone.  The brightness range allows you to comfortably work on your smartphone both in a dark room and in direct sunlight.  The developers have provided in the settings special options that provide the user with a choice of any mode - calm or saturated.  There is also an automatic function for adjusting the lighting.  However, according to users, there are several flaws.  If you accidentally cover the sensor, the device instantly reacts and changes the brightness level, which is sometimes quite annoying.  In most cases, this option is very rarely used.  The owners claim that the most comfortable is the brightness set at 40%. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The glass that protects the screen has excellent properties.  It is most resistant to scratches and scuffs.  When falling from a small height, it prevents the appearance of cracks.  The developers did not forget about the oleophobic coating.  Unfortunately, it does not fully protect against the formation of fingerprints on the surface, but still reduces the level of soiling. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone xiaomi redmi 4 pro" class="if" height="278" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2006471.jpg" width="600"></div>

Also, the camera does not work well if there are a lot of light sources.  In this case, it is recommended to use manual focus. </p><p>  Now let's talk about permission.  For the main camera, a 13-megapixel matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãused.  It is equipped with phase detection autofocus.  It is the latter that allows you to significantly increase the quality of photos.  There is a flash.  Optics can not be called the strongest side of this gadget.  But as for its price range, it does pretty well.  Users say that it is necessary to adapt to it. </p><p>  In order to take pictures with the Xiaomi Redmi 4 Pro phone while on the street, it is recommended to activate the HDR mode.
