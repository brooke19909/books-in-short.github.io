    <h2>  How to activate roaming service? </h2><p>  In order for roaming in Abkhazia to be provided on a Beeline SIM card, the presence of the International Roaming service is required.  In total, there are two types: inside the country and beyond.  Both services are connected on the room and are basic.  If necessary, the subscriber can turn them off, for example, if he does not plan to use mobile communications outside his region or country.  How to connect roaming in Abkhazia to Beeline?  As mentioned earlier, roaming on the subscriber‚Äôs number exists initially and you do not need to activate it additionally.  Except when the subscriber initiated their disconnection.  In order to check whether the service works on the SIM card, you should call the contact center dispatchers, since only they can view the activity and, if necessary, connect it or, on the contrary, deactivate it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  What should I take care of before departure? </h2><p>  Not all subscribers know that when traveling outside the country the cost of communication services increases quite seriously, therefore they continue to use services, for example, the Internet, as usual.  What is their surprise when, after some time, impressive amounts of money disappear from the account.  This is especially true for countries in which tariffing is not online.  If roaming in Abkhazia is connected on the Beeline number, this does not mean at all that you can use the connection like at home.  It just provides the ability to make calls, send text messages and use the Internet.  Thus, it is necessary to clarify the tariffication of communication services in advance, before leaving the country. </p>

    <h2>  Useful tips for those planning a trip to Abkhazia and other countries </h2><p>  Activating Beeline roaming in Abkhazia on a SIM card is half the success.  You should also pay attention to the following nuances: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  At the time of your stay abroad you should abandon all the call forwardings installed on the number (for this you can dial a request of the form: ## 002 # - this will turn off all available call forwardings at once). </li><li>  You should take care of your balance, namely, deposit into your account an amount in excess of the amount you plan to spend on communication services, since unexpected situations can always occur.  You should also think about how you can replenish the balance in another country (for this it is convenient to link a bank card to your account in your account).  Warn relatives and friends that a ‚Äúbeggar‚Äù may come from you and this will mean that the money on the balance is coming to an end. </li><li>  In countries with online billing it is convenient to use a mobile application through which you can view full information about your number: expenses, current balance, etc. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Roaming Beeline (Abkhazia) </h2><p>  Tariffs in this hospitable country are the first thing that excites subscribers.  What tariffing will be waiting for everyone who visits the cities of Abkhazia?  For Beeline subscribers, the cost of services will be the same.  This is ensured by the option ‚ÄúMost profitable roaming‚Äù.  Its use is provided for all customers of the yellow-black operator outside the country.  The activation of the option is carried out automatically, at the time of the first use of communication services in roaming from a Beeline SIM card.  Roaming (Abkhazia), whose prices previously scared subscribers by its size, can currently cost quite favorably.  Especially considering the fact that the special package from Beeline does not imply a subscription fee or additional charges for connection.  If no actions are taken while in another country from a mobile device, then funds will not be debited.  There are no other proposals designed to reduce the costs of subscribers. </p>

    <h2>  The cost of communication services under the option "The most profitable roaming" </h2><p>  As soon as the subscriber starts using communication services, for example, makes a call or receives an incoming call, the option will be activated.  In this case, ten minutes for 100 rubles will be provided.  These minutes can be spent on both incoming and outgoing calls.  The action of a ten-minute package automatically ends in a day or when the entire limit is exhausted.  From the new day, the same package is provided for one hundred rubles in case of making a call or accepting it on a SIM card.  Until the end of the day in case the limit of minutes is exceeded, the cost of the connection will be ten rubles.  These are the conditions for making calls for Beeline subscribers (Abkhazia).  Roaming, the cost of which is given in this article, also implies the ability to send text messages at a price of 10 rubles for SMS.  Please note that saving on the minutes that are provided for 100 rubles is not worth it, because in a day they will be eliminated, even if you did not have time to spend them completely. </p>

    <h2>  Internet usage in Abkhazia </h2><p>  As part of the ‚ÄúBest Profit Roaming‚Äù option from Beeline, roaming abroad in Abkhazia also implies an Internet package of 40 megabytes.  The cost of this option is two hundred rubles.  The validity of this package is one day.  With the advent of a new day, another same package is activated, provided that the user establishes a connection.  If before the new period the existing limit was spent, then each megabyte will cost 5 rubles.  It is important to note that if 40 megabytes could not be spent on the same day when they were activated, then they cannot be saved until the new day.  Thus, the validity of the Internet package is 24 hours, regardless of whether the traffic was spent.  Please note that Internet access in roaming must first be enabled in the gadget settings.  By default, this feature is not installed in the devices to avoid unnecessary charges. </p><h2>  How to connect communication services in another country? </h2><p>  Activation of communication services is carried out automatically: the mobile device searches for available networks and connects to the one with which Beeline has a contract in this country.  If the device could not find the available networks in automatic mode, then you should do it manually.  In the settings of mobile devices there is the ability to manually search networks.  As a rule, this measure allows you to restore the availability of communication services.  Alternatively, you can restart the device: when you turn on the gadget again searches for available networks and connect to them (if possible). </p>

    <h2>  Which operators provide communication services in Abkhazia? </h2><p>  According to the information posted on the operator‚Äôs official portal, in Abkhazia there is one mobile provider available for connection.  It should be connected to it.  This is A-Mobile.  With the correct settings for the mobile gadget, you do not have to force it, because registration on the network will be carried out automatically.  Please note that the number 112 should be used to call emergency services. </p><h2>  Reviews of subscribers about Beeline roaming in Abkhazia </h2><p>  The feedback of subscribers traveling abroad with a Beeline SIM card is quite contradictory: some do not like the fact that they immediately charge the amount for a ten-minute package, although they did not plan to communicate for so long.  It was more convenient for someone to use a number of specific options that were previously provided by the operator for trips.  However, with regard to the quality of communication, there were fewer claims to this important factor than those who were dissatisfied with the new conditions of the operator company.  Many clients of mobile operators completely refuse the services they use in Russia, in favor of local companies, purchasing their SIM cards.  This option, of course, will cost much more profitably - so say the users. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In this article, we examined how you can manage the service "Roaming" ("Beeline") abroad.  Tariffs (Abkhazia and for other CIS countries) are also given earlier.  A distinctive feature of the provision of roaming services by Beeline is the absence of any monthly fee.  Activation of minutes / Internet traffic packages is carried out only after the subscriber himself calls or receives an incoming call, or makes a connection to the Internet.  In all other cases, if the client does not use the connection, does not send messages or does not go to the global network, the balance will not change.  This pricing principle is the same for all customers of this operator. </p>
