With the help of this or that rug, you can create a different look of the hallway, the main thing is that it is combined with the surrounding interior.  In stores there are a huge number of various special products, but lovers of needlework even prefer to create this item with their own hands.  They turn the rug into the hallway into a work of art!  But this does not mean that anyone can do it.  The main thing is to understand what it should be and what materials will be used. </p><h2>  From what to knit a rug in the hallway? </h2><p>  In fact, the choice is unlimited!  Everything rests only on imagination and money.  The most common materials are: </p><ul><li>  Yarn.  It may be new, but in most cases use leftovers or dissolve unnecessary things.  Knitted yarn can also be used.  To create rugs from such material is quite comfortable, and the finished products collect dirt well, absorb a small amount of moisture and dry for a long time. </li><li>  Jute.  The rug in the hallway, made with your own hands from this material, is very environmentally friendly.  As part of this rope, only the fibers of the same plant without the addition of chemical elements.  Such a rug will fit well into almost any interior. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.independent.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jute rug" class="if uuid-3083051" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/3083051.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Ropes  Carpets are very original and durable.  You can simply bind such material together as a canvas, or you can perform mizuhiki using the Japanese technique, which will make the rug not only beautiful, but also original.  In practical terms, such a rug will collect sand well, but it will not relieve street moisture. </li><li>  Old t-shirts.  This is a budget version of knit yarn.  Knitting from such a material is quite comfortable and very cheap.  You can use things in any condition, since areas with spots or holes can simply be cut off.  These doormats absorb water and dirt well, dry quickly enough and can withstand machine wash with spin at high speeds. </li><li>  Plastic bags.  This material is quite convenient to use, and the rugs are ideal for the offseason, as they clean dirt off the shoes well, but do not absorb moisture. </li></ul><p>  When the material of the product is determined, it is necessary to choose the execution technique.  You can make a rug in the hallway with your own hands in several ways: knit, crochet or knit, weave or weave.  The doormat may be integral or composite, made on an additional basis or be from one type of material.  Depending on the chosen technique, the product will have different characteristics. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Crochet </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.dailybulletin.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Package rug" class="if uuid-3083036" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/3083036.jpg"></div><p>  The classic way to create a rug in the hallway is to crochet the rug, as you did in the old days.  It can be a round, oval, rectangular or square product.  It makes no sense to use a complex pattern, so they are knitted with simple or elongated columns without a crochet.  Such rugs are quite dense, tough, keep their shape well, and the relief of the finished canvas collects sand well.  The hook is chosen comfortable for knitting, it can be either specialized for carpets, or simple, small size, for example, No. 4. </p><p>  Fingers are knitted on the same principle.  The role of the hook is performed by the index finger of the left hand.  Such rugs are more loose and voluminous. </p><h2>  Knitting </h2><p>  This tool for making do-it-yourself rugs in the hallway is not popular.  This is due to the fact that the finished products are excessively elastic and poor in shape, but some still use this technique.  For example, in the photo there is a rug of t-shirts, knitted with needles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="makezine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mat with knitting needles" class="if uuid-3083040" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/3083040.jpg"></div><h2>  Homespun </h2><div class="photo" data-original="capeporpoisetradingco.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Homespun rug" class="if uuid-3083068" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/3083068.jpg"></div><p>  Another way to create a rug is to weave it from yarn, rags, bags or ropes.  To make it, you will need a frame whose dimensions will be slightly larger than the carpet.  You can weave without this device, but in this case, the carpet will be more loose.  For a square or rectangular carpet, the strings are stretched.  They can be the same size as the weft threads, or thinner.  The distance between the threads in the first case is better to make equal to 1-2 thickness of the thread, in the second - after 1 cm. Weave with a snake, alternating the location of the weft both in rows and in columns above and behind the shared thread. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To weave a round rug, the threads must be pulled crossly through the center, for example, 1-11-2-12-3-13, etc., should be connected to 20 points. In this case, the weaving will be on the principle of a web. </p><h2>  Nodular flat </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.nigeriaoc.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Flat knot" class="if uuid-3083042" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/3083042.jpg"></div><p>  The wicker rug in the hallway in this technique also has ancient roots, in this case the principles of macrame are used.  Knitting of such a carpet begins with a track of four tapes, then, after a turn of work, the left tape always stretches over the edge of the previous track.  To do this, it is better to use a hook, although with a certain dexterity, you can thread the tape between the nodes of the finished part of the mat with your fingers. </p><h2>  Fluffy doormat </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.craftster.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fluffy rug" class="if uuid-3083065" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/3083065.jpg"></div><p>  This technique is possible only when using additional material - mesh.  It can be plastic or made of ropes, it can also be crocheted according to the pattern: double crochet / 2 air loops.  You can make a do-it-yourself rug from old things, bags or yarn.  To do this, the material is cut into pieces of about 6-9 cm, after which each shred is tied on a grid without missing a single cell.  If yarn is used, then on one jumper between the cells, you can tie 3-4 threads immediately in a bundle.  The main thing in this technique is to choose the right cell size so that the flap folded in half fits well in them, but there is no extra space left.  When all the pieces are tied on the base, you can gently trim the overly protruding elements with scissors. </p><h2>  Pompons </h2><div class="photo" data-original="craft.ideas2live4.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rug from pompons" class="if uuid-3083033" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/3083033.jpg"></div><p>  Do-it-yourself rug in the hallway of the pompons is very exciting.  You can use classic yarn, but for the front door it is better to opt for plastic bags, in particular - garbage bags.  It is convenient to cut them into fibers, and then form pompons, and various colors without additional patterns allow you to make interesting ornaments on the rug.  First you need to make separate elements.  Unroll the rolls of garbage bags, cut them into ribbons about 1 cm wide, smaller, then fold them into 2-3 layers of tape on each roll, tie them at the same distance with a thread or the same tape, and then cut the workpiece between the nodes.  This will make pompons.  Distribute the blanks on the basis of a plastic mesh or fabric, attach by tying on the wrong side of the edge of the fixing tape. </p><p>  Composing various combinations of equipment and material, you can make many unique rugs in the hallway, and at the same time get rid of the remains of yarn, accumulated bags or old things.  Therefore, the creation of such a rug will be an interesting completion of the general cleaning of the house. </p>
