    <p>  Sigmund Freud (May 6, 1856 - September 23, 1939) - the founder of the <span>theory of psychoanalysis.</span>  Having received higher medical education in Austria at the end of the 19th century, he wrote works on the topic of systemic speech disorders and diseases of the nervous system.  However, he did not succeed in gaining success in this field, since anti-Semitism, which was gaining momentum in society at that time, prevented him.  Because of this, he turned his attention to psychiatry, which was less developed and not particularly interesting.  This step was a turning point in this branch of medicine, since Freud first examined the appeal to an unconscious person, considering him to be the source of all mental and psychosomatic diseases.  Psychology according to Freud is ambiguous, it causes a lot of controversy to this day.  What is at least Sigmund's official affection for cocaine worth!  He used it himself and strongly shared with his surroundings, enthusiastically commenting on the effect of the drug, which cast out depression and contributed to digestion.  During the experiments, it was found that the "healing powder" can be used as anesthesia for eye operations.  Cocaine in scientific works was elevated by Freud to the rank of panacea, which, in turn, provoked a wave of drug addiction, which did not cease until the 1920s.  Because of this, the psychiatrist underwent universal condemnation, as he became a kind of initiator of drug addiction among residents of Europe and the United States.  In addition, due to progressive Nazism and anti-Semitism, the life of the psychiatrist and his family was under constant threat, and only because of his popularity did the government allow him to leave Austria and settle in London.  <span>The capital of Great Britain</span> welcomed Freud with joy, incorporating it into the Royal Society and ensuring honor until the end of his days. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Freud's personality: fundamentals, structure </h2><p>  As mentioned above, Freud was an innovator in the field of psychiatry, as he appealed to the unconscious person, bypassing his conscious manifestations.  His works are extensive and specific, but it is possible to isolate the main provisions on which they rely. </p>

    <p>  The figure schematically depicts a personality according to Freud, we consider all the elements in detail: </p><ul><li>  Id - "It."  The animal component of man, based solely on base desires and needs.  "It" has one goal - the pleasure. </li><li>  Ego - "I".  This is the person himself as he is from a social point of view.  “I” reflects an awareness of what is happening, which means, according to Freud, the most complete interaction with the world, the ability to connect the past, present and future, to draw conclusions.  It has a <span>protective mechanism that</span> protects against the "It." </li><li>  Superego - "Superself."  This is what a person seeks to become under the pressure of society.  The “Super-Self” dictates to a person exactly how he should act, based on an instilled morality and conscience. </li></ul><h2>  Substitution theory </h2>

In practice, the ideal according to Freud is unattainable, because everywhere there is an advantage.  For example, among psychopaths, “I” suppresses “It,” a thirst for pleasure breaks loose, crushing all foundations.  In neurasthenics, on the contrary, the role of the first violin is played by the Super-I, eternal dissatisfaction with oneself and rejection of one’s imperfection are growing. </p><p>  What does Freud mean for treating mental disorders?  The basic principle is the substitution of “It” or “Super-I” for “I” by the interpretation of dreams and free associations. </p><h2>  Personal development </h2><p>  The psychologist was not only the first to recognize human sexuality, but also emphasized it, claiming that <span>he drives</span> libido (a thirst for sensual pleasures).  Development according to Freud is tied to sexuality, moreover, it appeared together with a person, and did not appear only during puberty.  Based on this, the following stages of personality formation were identified: </p><ul><li>  Oral (birth-1.5 years).  All the pleasures of the world are concentrated in the mouth.  The baby not only enjoys during the feeding process, but also explores the surrounding objects with his mouth. </li><li>  Anal (1-3 years).  The area of ​​the anus is the focus of pleasure, since the child is trained to cope independently, is able to control the intestines and is not so fully dependent on the care of the parents. </li><li>  Phallic (3-5 years).  Libido manifests itself in an interest in the genitals, with which the child enjoys contact.  At this stage, the <span>Oedipus complex</span> may form in the boys <span>,</span> which means Freud’s attraction to the mother, in girls the analogue is the Electra complex, or “penis envy”. </li><li>  Latent (6-12 years).  Libido subsides, social self-awareness comes to the fore. </li><li>  Genital (from 12 years old).  <span>Puberty,</span> sexuality takes first place. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Freud development" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19614/393012.jpg?1399713829185" width="400"></div></h2><h2>  Is there a conclusion? </h2><p>  An explanation of what Freud means is human is debatable.  It is not worth considering a person only from the point of view of his sexuality, because it is one-sided.  However, the psychologist himself acknowledged that his judgments were not complete and should be challenged if new data appeared.  And do not forget about the fact that the works of a psychologist serve as the basis for modern sexology, in them you can find a description and treatment method for any deviation. </p>
