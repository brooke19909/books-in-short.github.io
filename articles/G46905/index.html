    <h2>  <span>DIY daytime running lights</span> </h2><p>  Making <span>DRLs with your own hands</span> from LEDs is quite simple.  In this case, the adapter is selected contact type.  An expander is used to improve current conductivity.  Most often, it is selected open or impulse type.  Some models use a fuse for protection.  To assemble the model, LEDs are first installed.  You will also need a powerful converter.  A 3 A model works great. </p><p>  Then, to make DRL with your own hands from LEDs, you need to take a tetrode.  The maximum resistance parameter must be no more than 50 Ohms.  In some cases, the controller is used without an isolator.  A two-wire wire is used to connect daytime running light. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
