    <h2>  Programs </h2><p>  Not without reason VES SK A20 mini-oven is called a ‚Äúsorceress‚Äù and ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù in reviews.  After all, with its help you can cook many different dishes: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Bread. </li><li>  Pies, cookies. </li><li>  Pizza </li><li>  Grilled meat. </li><li>  Casseroles. </li><li>  Sweets. </li><li>  All kinds of vegetable culinary masterpieces. </li></ul><p>  In addition, in the miracle oven, it is possible to heat cooked food. </p><p>  The VES SK A20 model can be used in two forms: </p><ul><li>  How to bake. </li><li>  Like an oven. </li></ul><h2>  Baking bread </h2><p>  About the VES SK A20 oven, reviews often write that it copes with the preparation of many varieties of bread.  The manufacturers provide such programs for the test: </p><ul><li>  Kneading </li><li>  Rise. </li><li>  Butter dough preparation (can be used not only for bread, but also for other products, for example, buns). </li></ul><p>  Other programs: </p><ul><li>  Baking bread. </li><li>  Adjusting the color of the crust (ruddy, medium, light). </li><li>  Weight adjustment of the product (450 grams / 680 grams). </li><li>  Deferred time for which bread should be ready (up to 12 hours).  This function is not provided in the oven.  You can use it, for example, if you need a fresh loaf of bread for breakfast.  Having loaded the dough into the oven in the evening, you can set a delay program, indicating the time when the process should be completed.  This does not mean that the bread will be baked longer (from evening to morning).  The smart machine itself will calculate at what time it should start working to fulfill the given condition. </li><li>  Notification of completion of the process (sound signal).  This function is convenient because there is no need to be present in the kitchen and periodically look in the oven, checking the readiness of baked products.  The machine itself will follow this, giving the hostess time for other things. </li></ul><p>  Bread can be baked classic (3-4 hours) or ‚Äúfast‚Äù (up to 2 hours).  The duration of the process depends on the recipe. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  VES SK A20: instruction manual </h2><p>  We have already noted that this technique is produced in China.  Since Russia is the customer, all accompanying documents for the furnace are printed in Russian.  It‚Äôs not difficult to understand the instructions, as all actions are scheduled step by step.  In addition to using the oven for cooking, you need to take care of your assistant and at the end of the process, since fat can accumulate on its internal surfaces, plus the oven is always saturated with various odors. </p><p>  After use, it must be washed from the inside.  To do this, you can use the classical method (detergent, sponge), or you can do steam cleaning.  It lies in the fact that water is poured into a baking sheet and the oven is heated to 100 or slightly more degrees.  The resulting hot vapors melt the fats, which are removed very easily after this procedure. </p><p>  The instruction warns that you can only use a working stove.  If, after turning it on, strange odors or sounds are noticed, as well as if there are problems with installing programs or operating buttons, the unit must be turned off and a service center should be contacted. </p><p>  It is important to remember that after the start of the work of the bread machine, it is no longer possible to change the installed program.  If you try to do this by clicking on the buttons or disconnecting the unit from the network, you can cause it to break. </p>

    <p>  In their reviews of the VES SK A20 furnace, customers note the following disadvantages of the device: </p><ul><li>  There is no backlight, although it is stated in the description attached to the miracle oven. </li><li>  The convector is too noisy.  To reduce noise, a pallet is required. </li><li>  Uneven heat (you have to turn the baking sheet over the products), since the heating element located closer to the back wall works more intensively. </li><li>  Some respondents in their reviews report that the factory assembly of the furnace may not be of high quality (there are not enough bolts).  But this defect is fixed without problems. </li></ul><p>  Some buyers wish that the VES SK A20 model should be available not in one color (black), but in several.  This does not affect the operation of the oven, but it is important for the design of the kitchen. </p><p>  Another wish of the housewives is that it would be great if there was a device in the kit that protects against splattering of fat during cooking of some dishes.  Without this accessory, the entire interior of the oven is very dirty. </p><p>  Some housewives like the compact size of the stove, which is why it is mini.  But among the respondents there are those who consider this to be a flaw, since too few products fit on the baking sheet, which increases the cooking time, for example, of pies. </p>
