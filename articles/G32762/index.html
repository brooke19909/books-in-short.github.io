    <p>  Just for the price, ‚ÄúAdmiral‚Äù earns not the best reviews.  It has already been said about food - it is unprofitable to eat here.  The same goes for living.  For example, a standard camping site costs 5900 rubles per day, and a luxury one - 7500. The hotel prices are approximately the same.  Standard rooms cost 5500 rubles per day, deluxe suites - 7500, Admiral suites (superior) - 8500. You will have to pay the same amount for a penthouse.  Usually breakfast is included in the price. </p><p>  As you can see, not too cheap.  But you can come to the Admiral without spending the night.  This is what those who want to use the services of an eco-park do, but do not want to spend big money on accommodation. </p>
