Human impact</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Everyone knows that our <span>globe is</span> surrounded by a magnetic field.  Absolutely everything on Earth is exposed to special, invisible force rays of this field.  But the magnetic field exists not only around the Earth, it is also in the body of every person.  Many doctors and biophysicists, studying the influence of the magnetic field on living organisms, including humans, note that it has a huge impact on the circulatory system and on the general condition of all blood vessels. </p><p>  What does a magnetic field mean for a person?  Its influence has been proven more than once and continues to be studied constantly.  Remember how a sharp change in the external magnetic field <span>(magnetic storm)</span> worsens the well-being of a person.  However, do not forget that such a state of the magnetic field is a temporary phenomenon.  There are more dangerous changes to it. </p><p>  Our era is characterized by especially rapid development of various equipment, the creation of a large number of all kinds of machines, structures and products from complex alloys.  All this huge amount of metal surrounding us leads to the fact that the magnetic field is redistributed incorrectly.  Metal attracts it to itself, thereby depriving the organisms of humans and animals of its effects.  Thus, a deficit of the magnetic field in the body is created, the result of which is a violation of the various systems of the body, organs and tissues. </p>

    <p>  There is a theory that it was the deficit of the magnetic field that was responsible for the fact that in the first place among all diseases in terms of frequency of occurrence are <span>cardiovascular diseases.</span>  The reason for this phenomenon is to some extent related to the magnetic field, under the influence of which the epithelial and vascular permeability increases, therefore, the resorption of edema and the <span>healing of wounds are</span> accelerated <span>.</span>  This effect is widely used in magnetotherapy. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  As a rule, the effect of a magnetic field on living organisms, on a person as a whole and on his individual organs does not cause an increase in body temperature, the formation of endogenous heat or skin irritation.  For therapeutic purposes, it is necessary to correctly dose the magnetic field, the effect on the person in this case will be only positive.  Its good tolerance is noted in very weak patients, as well as in the elderly.  Today, the lack of a magnetic field is compared with the lack of vitamins and minerals in the body. </p>

    <p>  About 50 years ago, the Japanese scientist Nakagawa described a new disease - the syndrome of magnetic field deficiency in humans.  The main symptoms are weakness, decreased working capacity, increased fatigue, headache, <span>poor sleep,</span> changes in the functioning of the cardiovascular system, and skin disorders.  And this is not a complete list of violations that can cause a lack of magnetic field.  Of course, the magnetic field in itself, or rather, its deficit, is not the main cause of all these diseases, but becomes an important component in their development.  One of the methods of treatment, Nakagawa proposed procedures to restore normal magnetic field. </p><p>  Scientists have also described the mechanism of action of a magnetic field on any living organism.  The metal ions that make up <span>the blood</span> circulate throughout the body, so a magnetic field forms around the vessel.  Since blood flows through the vessels to all parts of the body, a magnetic field exists everywhere in the body.  As soon as a decrease in the magnetic field occurs, circulatory disturbance occurs, a failure occurs in the transport of oxygen to the organs, and the disease develops.  So it is not in vain that the deficit of the magnetic field is compared with a deficiency of vitamins, minerals and nutrients in the body. </p>
