    <p>  The same goes for numbers.  The furniture in the rooms is not new, but in excellent condition.  Cleaning is carried out daily, as well as a change of snow-white towels, which employees beautifully fold and stop in real scenery.  The work of cooks deserves praise as well - in any of the restaurants you will find a huge number of dishes, all of which are really tasty and fresh (some are cooked in your presence).  The beach is clean and well maintained, with enough sunbeds even in the midst of the beach season. </p><p>  Travelers express special thanks to the service staff.  Everything here, including concierges, waiters, administrators and animators, is extremely polite and welcoming, but at the same time unobtrusive.  By the way, almost all employees speak Russian well, so there will be no communication problems.  By the way, the majority of tourists here are Russian speakers. </p>
