The dream of free flight in the cloudless blue of the sky did not leave the minds of scientists, philosophers and ordinary inhabitants.  Observation of the flying birds led the mythological Icarus to create wings and fearless flight to the sun.  Years pass, and people, raising their heads to the sky, with a slight envy look after the flying birds. </p><h2>  Wintering birds </h2><p>  With the onset of cold weather, many birds fly to southern countries, but some remain wintering in their former habitats.  Watching birds in winter can be a great pleasure for curious kids.  Caring parents are willing to answer the unthinkable questions that arise in children's heads. </p>

    <p>  Among wintering birds, a titmouse can be especially distinguished.  This small bird with a bright yellow breast is a frequent visitor to human-made feeders.  It is very interesting to watch her. </p><p>  Also important are the important and sedate ravens walking around city parks in search of food.  Shiny feathers, cast in resinous shades, shimmer in the sun, giving the birds a special pride. </p><p>  On snow-white snow, like droplets of red blood, placers of rowan berries attract bullfinches.  The red-breasted winter guest is a real symbol of crackling frosts, fluffy snow and the New Year. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Birdwatching at the trough causes a touching sense of concern for the tiny ubiquitous sparrows.  Familiar and native birds in winter cold flock in large flocks to them in search of food.  It seems that only the brisk magpie is not afraid of the arrival of winter.  Filling the space with a flood of cod, she jumps with special excitement along the branches of trees. </p><h2>  Tit - a bird familiar from childhood </h2><p>  An interesting, exciting and informative winter walk can be.  Bird watching allows you to notice the features and habits that are not given much importance in everyday life.  The nimble tit familiar from childhood is actually a forest inhabitant.  Only with the onset of a harsh winter, she is forced to fly to settlements in search of food. </p>

    <p>  Few people know that the usual winter residents can not be fed <span>with brown bread.</span>  Tits leave part of the feed in the goiter, where the crumbs begin to swell, causing fermentation.  Such a process can lead to the death of a yellow-breasted songwriter. </p><h2>  Tit Flight Features </h2><p>  Birdwatching in winter will notice an interesting feature.  A tiny tit never eats a whole seed.  Clutching her paw to the branch, she pecks the shell and only then starts the meal, plucking small pieces of pulp.  The flight of the titmouse is a separate topic, on the example of which one can notice the bird's ability to economically expend energy. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Birds fly very quickly, but rarely flap their wings.  Observing the flight, you can notice how tiny yellow breasts dive down, then rush into the heavenly heights, making dizzying stunts in the air.  It is very interesting to observe the flight of the bird in slow motion video, however, even with the naked eye you can see the characteristic features. </p><h2>  Crow is a smart bird </h2><p>  Crows, contrary to popular belief, are very intelligent birds, it is about them that the story will go further.  Watching birds from the Raven family can sometimes make you notice really amazing things.  Frequent guests of city squares and parks, <span>black crows</span> seek out shiny objects on the ground.  Constant observers tell fascinating stories about how birds collect pieces of foil, candy wrappers, bottle caps.  Having previously made a small hole in the snow, the crows reliably hide their finds, carefully hiding secret places with snow. </p>

    <p>  A raven dwelling is worthy of special mention.  Birds build their nests on the tops of trees, while doing so in such a way that no wind can drop the nest from high crowns.  Breaking off thin twigs, sedate crows carefully carry them into the nest.  It would seem that there are many old branches on earth, but they are not of interest to the bird.  Last year's sticks can be too dry and brittle, produce an unpleasant smell of rot.  Such material is completely unsuitable for building a reliable nest. </p><h2>  Bullfinch - a messenger of winter </h2><p>  Watching wintering birds is especially interesting when the winter messenger arrives - the bullfinch.  Since the days of the Soviet Union, the owner of the red breast has been remembered as a frequent character of New Year's cards.  A bullfinch arrives with the onset of winter colds from the northern countries, staying in our area for the winter. </p>

    <p>  A feature of bright birds can be called their inexplicable relationship.  Bullfinches pair up once, being faithful to their chosen partner throughout their lives.  Warm relations between birds are noticeable in caring courtship.  It is often possible to observe how a bright male feeds his female, the coloring of which is much more modest than that of a winter handsome. </p><p>  The nesting period in birds begins in mid-April.  A simple nest that can accommodate up to 5 eggs, the female incubates for two weeks.  And after 18-20 days, the appeared chicks leave their native nest.  In one year, the female is able to bring two broods of representatives of the family Reed. </p><h2>  House Sparrow - The Most Common Bird </h2><p>  Sparrow is the most famous representative of birds, not only among those who observe birds at the feeder, but also around the <span>globe.</span>  A small bird with a characteristic plumage and tweet familiar to each often settles near the settlements.  Arriving from the <span>countries of Northern Europe, the</span> sparrow easily adapts to the changing living conditions.  In places of human settlement, a feathered inhabitant easily finds food. </p><p>  Due to the high fecundity, sparrows form large flocks living in the neighborhood.  Already at the beginning of March, birds break into pairs and begin arranging the nest.  Egg laying, consisting of 7-10 pieces, is incubated by the female for 12-14 days.  Already on the 10th day after hatching, young sparrows leave their native nest. </p>

    <p>  Birdwatching in winter shows that sparrows spend a cold period in places of constant nesting, unlike some breeds that fly away for wintering to warmer climes.  People who are not indifferent to birds equip feeders, to which an increasing number of birds flies every day. </p><h2>  Autumn bird migrations </h2><p>  Especially popular among bird watchers in the fall.  After the breeding period, many representatives of birds go on an active search for food.  Most <span>migratory birds</span> already in late summer begin to prepare for migration.  The period preceding departure to the southern countries takes several months.  At this time, the molting begins in birds, the plumage changes.  Abundant food allows you to create a subcutaneous fat reserve, helping birds to make long flights. </p><h2>  Farewell to the fall </h2><p>  The beginning of the fall season is the most interesting time for lovers of educational excursions.  It was during this period that birds massively left their homes, beginning the autumn migration.  It is probably difficult to find a person who has never seen cranes fly to warmer countries.  A beautiful flat wedge, consisting of many birds, with a loud croak goes to the southern expanses.  Farewell song of cranes brings to many a light precipitate of sadness as evidence of the end of the warm season. </p>

With the onset of the first cold weather, wildlife connoisseurs are again eagerly awaiting the moment when it is possible to arrange bird watching in winter. </p>
