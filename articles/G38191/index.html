    <h2>  Kumskoe reservoir </h2><p>  There are a lot of reservoirs in this region.  Most of them are of natural origin.  But there are those that were formed artificially.  For example, in the <span>north of Karelia</span> there is an amazing place, which is considered a real paradise for fishermen.  This is the Kumsky reservoir, formed in 1960 as a result of the confluence <span>of the Kuma River</span> and three lakes, which have very original names: Pyaozero, Topozero and Kundozero.  But we'll talk about them a little later. </p><p>  As you can see on the map, Karelia borders on several regions at once: Arkhangelsk, Murmansk, Vologda and Leningrad.  And I must say that from all these regions avid fishing enthusiasts come to the shore of an artificial reservoir. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Karelia on the map" class="if" height="323" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1969618.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It was decided to form the Kumsky reservoir during the construction of the dam of the same hydroelectric power station.  A few years later - in 1992 - the Russian government adopted a decree on the formation <span>of the Paanaj√§rvi</span> <span>National</span> <span>Park</span> on its northern and western shores <span>.</span>  Kumskoe reservoir has an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than one thousand nine hundred square kilometers.  The water level in it is regulated within two meters.  It is difficult to overestimate its economic importance.  Water supply and energy, a convenient rafting - all this provides the Kumskoe reservoir in the region. </p><h2>  Fishing on Topozero </h2><p>  This natural pond is amazing for its beauty.  In addition to rich fish stocks, Topozero makes not only an indelible impression with its picturesque panoramas, but also makes you want to return to its shores again and again.  However, fishing on it, although it is remembered for a long time, is not as simple as it seems at first glance.  It has its own characteristics, which are associated with a rather large depth of this lake.  On average, it reaches fifteen meters.  However, in Topozero, there are depressions with a depth of 57 m. Moreover, the bottom topography in this part of the Kumsky reservoir is rather complicated.  It consists of pits, hollows, ridges, ridges, etc., although fairly even sections are found in places.  Fishing in Topozero, which is part of the Kumsky reservoir, is quite interesting.  There are sixteen species of underwater inhabitants, including such valuable ones as trout, palea, whitefish, grayling, vendace.  Fishing for smelt, perch, pike, bream, roach, chub and burbot is quite popular. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kumsky reservoir fishing" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1969615.jpg" width="600"></div>

The first is Topozero.  Piaozero's area is almost six hundred and sixty square kilometers.  There are many islets on the lake.  The depth of the reservoir is quite serious: as experienced fishermen say, they came across sections up to seventy meters.  In Piaozero there are a lot of very sharp dumps, and in some places they are quite close to the coast.  Here, judging by the reviews, trout and roast, whitefish, ide, perch and pike are perfectly caught.  Locals most often fish for spinning trolling. </p><p>  The season here begins with the first days of summer.  It was at this time that the armies of fishing enthusiasts rushed to the Kumsky reservoir to enjoy their hobby in full. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Karelia Kumskoe reservoir" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1969614.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Production </h2><p>  In summer, fish are caught in a variety of ways.  Of the gears, fishing rod and spinning are the most common.  Brown trout feeding on vendace can be found in the upper layers, where it is kept in small flocks.  They catch it from June until the ice of Piaozer with fly fishing, using a fly, a wobbler or a spinner when trolling.  The best catch is from late spring to mid-summer, if you fish in the center of the lake at a depth of more than ten meters.  A bit lower is the trout.  She pecks at such large baits as swings or deep-sea wobblers.  The average weight of the catch of the palate that the Kumskoye reservoir can give is up to four kilograms. </p><p>  It‚Äôs good to go to the pike with a spinning rod with a spinner, it also pecks at the lapworms, especially near grassy shores, as well as in quiet, without surf, areas where the fish has been standing since June until the water freezes.  In winter, this predator is actively caught on ice.  By the way, this season you can also fish for burbot, perch and grayling.  In the summer of the latter, they fly with a spinning rod or fly fishing rod - there are especially a lot of it in places near coastal cliffs, on ores and shallows. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kumskoe recreation center reservoir" class="if" height="358" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1969617.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Organized vacation </h2><p>  Many residents of neighboring regions prefer to break out on the Kumsky reservoir for the weekend.  <span>Recreation facilities</span> here, of course, are not five-star, but a minimum set of services is still provided.  No less than fish, the banks of the reservoir are rich in the gifts of the forest: mushrooms, berries (cloudberries, blueberries, cranberries, raspberries, etc.). </p><p>  Many locals call the Kumskoye reservoir ‚Äúthe sea‚Äù.  The clear water of the lakes and the beautiful coast attract tourists here even from distant St. Petersburg.  Many people prefer to come to the National Park.  In Paanaj√§rvi there are many houses remotely resembling Finnish cottages.  It is impossible to rent them for a long stay, but for a temporary stay in the park they are great. </p><p>  On the banks of the Kumsky reservoir, in particular in the Loukhsky district, there are many quite decent fishing bases: Niska, Keret, Peschanaya, Sidorov, Tiksha.  Several hotels and guest houses have been built here. </p>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  You can get to the Kumsky reservoir from neighboring areas by train.  To do this, you need to catch any train stopping at the Loukhi railway station, and from there to your destination - by private motor vehicle.  If you go by car from St. Petersburg, you can choose one of two routes - Murmansk or Kola. </p><p>  Then, before reaching the Louhi station, you need to turn left.  The final point will be Pyaozersky village, from which the reservoir is twenty kilometers away.  The distance from St. Petersburg is about 1150 km.  You will need to go to Topozero along the Murmansk highway, and then turn to the village of Kestenga. </p>
