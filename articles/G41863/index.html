    <h2>  Flight, airport </h2><p>  The first vivid impressions that tourists receive are flights.  If you fly <span>Tunisian Airlines,</span> then the impressions, according to the reviews of passengers, are not at all pleasant.  In all likelihood, the task of the carrier is to seat people as many as possible, since the seats in the cabin are installed extremely close.  In a passenger below average height, his knees rest in front of the seat; a tall person during this four-hour hour flight experiences a real nightmare. </p><p>  At the airport, travelers are greeted by smiling Tunisians with very annoying offers of various services, for example, to help bring things for free to the bus.  Near the bus for services from the traveler will insistently require money. </p><h2>  Hotel </h2><p>  Truly unforgettable, vivid impressions gives travelers Tunisia.  Hotel Riadh Palms 4 * (Tunisia, Sousse) reviews are characterized as corresponding to the category 3 *.  It is striking that everything here, in the opinion of tourists, is "some very shabby." </p><p>  The pool may turn out to be hot, and African mosquitoes may attack vacationers who leave it. </p><p>  The building of the Riadh Palms 4 * hotel is not at all as white and beautiful as can be seen in the photo, vacationers say.  In general, they share, the hotel is not bad.  Two large stairs go down from the reception, there is a good bar with comfortable sofas.  In the evenings, music sounds here. </p><h2>  About rooms </h2><p>  Tunisia never ceases to attract lovers of relaxation under the hot southern sun.  Reviews Riadh Palms 4 * hotel is characterized as a place that impresses with its contradictory, full of incomprehensible contrasts service.  Conceived as comfortable rooms, according to reviews, impress with scruffy, dirt, dust, unwashed floors and wallowing tufts of other people's hair.  Guests can get a room with a view of the construction site or trash cans, air conditioning, plumbing, etc. can work poorly in them. Sometimes, according to vacationers, the balcony door does not work in the room.  Often the window smells like an extract from dry cleaning. </p><h2>  Nature </h2><p>  Nature and weather will not deceive anyone's expectations.  Heat, palm trees - that is what everyone who wants to rest in Tunisia strives for.  Some tourists call nature beautiful, but monotonous.  Many people call the climate here mild, and the water here, according to vacationers, is ‚Äúamazing - warm, clear blue.‚Äù </p><p>  But all the tourists who have been there are shocked by what they have seen already on the way from the airport to the hotel.  According to them, "everything is filthy terribly, everywhere dirt, stink, garbage." </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  The hotel offers many beautiful interesting excursions: Solonchak, Colosseum, Berber dwellings, decorations for Star Wars, which, according to many guests, are carried out by a good, prepared guide.  But in general, excursions to Rriadh Palms 4 * (Tunisia) reviews 2016 characterize ambiguously. </p><p>  On the one hand, travelers are recommended to buy them, calling them very interesting and fascinating.  The most important thing is not to miss a two-day excursion to the Sahara, which will give a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãimpressions.  The trip is called very busy and interesting.  This is the most expensive tour of all offered, but it is worth it to not skimp on it.  They also advise you to visit the "stunning, simply fabulous, Fridgia Nature Reserve" and generally not spare money on excursions. </p><p>  On the other hand, reviewers point out flaws. </p><p>  About the ride offered in Riadh Palms 4 * by ATVs around the Ssus, guests respond as an excursion to a local dump.  Sometimes at the same time tourists are not given <span>motorcycle goggles.</span>  The eyes of holidaymakers can be affected by wind with dust and sand rising from the quadro in front.  In addition, partly the route passes along the freeway, where trucks and buses pass, the drivers of which, according to tourists, their cultural level is very similar to some domestic minibus drivers. </p><p>  In general, many may like the two-day excursion to the Sahara.  But you should prepare for the fact that the bus will have bad air conditioning (this is typical for Tunisia), and you will have to experience all the delights of a trip through the desert in the 45-50-degree heat. </p><p>  At the ostrich farm, which was offered for tourists to visit, ‚Äú3 ostriches walk‚Äù, in the zoo (‚Äúin a cage behind the curtain‚Äù) you can see one monkey or ‚ÄúPekingese on a chain‚Äù. </p><p>  In the water park in Port El Kantaou, it is difficult to withstand more than an hour, as many have shown.  It represents "3 small slides, a pool with artificial waves that often do not work." </p><p>  In shops where it is proposed to stop on the road, there is nothing special to buy, in addition, a special agreement between the owners and the guide on the delivery of buyers to their establishments is noticeable. </p><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  There are a lot of shops and shops in the district.  This is noted by all living in Riadh Palms 4 * (Tunisia).  The reviews of 2015 and previous years are not much different in this from the impressions of tourists this 2016.  Sellers are still inviting tourists as they pass by, but if you do not go in, you can hear a lot of unpleasant words about yourself in the back. </p><p>  Those who wish can purchase relatively inexpensive souvenirs in Tunisia.  Especially valuable purchase made here, travelers call a relatively inexpensive and high-quality olive oil. </p><h2>  About the culture of local taxi drivers </h2><p>  Staying at Radh Palms 4 *, Tunisia (reviews of tourists inform about this), it is easy to get acquainted with the working style of local taxi drivers.  Those who have refused their services, vacationers can ‚Äúunobtrusively‚Äù pursue for quite some time, dropping the price.  In case of a decisive refusal, they will ‚Äúcover‚Äù them with selective non-literary expressions. </p><h2>  City, nightlife </h2><p>  Sousse is advertised by travel agencies as a youth party area, where there are many clubs, discos and other entertainment venues.  Not so characterize Riadh Palms 4 * (Sousse) reviews.  Tunisia is famous for places where you can have fun and interesting day or night activities.  But, according to the guests of Riadh Palms 4 *, this hotel does not apply to those.  This, in the opinion of tourists living there, is rather a ‚Äúsanatorium for pensioners‚Äù. </p><p>  In the city itself, the streets, according to vacationers, are unsafe, especially at night.  The shock of what was seen in the Tunisian city of Sousse by some tourists is beyond description.  ‚ÄúIt's something on the verge of good and evil,‚Äù they say.  Arabs shout something to travelers, Tunisian flags hang from open windows, local music sounds very loud.  There are three times more cars at night than during the day, they drive at a terrible speed, they constantly honk.  All this can be seen and heard, riding along the night streets. </p><p>  Reviewers do not recommend tourists wandering around the streets of Sousse at night.  The city has a very high crime rate.  If you want to go to the club, it is better to take a taxi. </p><p>  For shopping, you should go to Medina, but alone - in no case!  Souvenirs are best bought in a shopping center (souvenir) near the market, although there they are a little more expensive, but it is safer and calmer.  Walking around the city is better in the morning, experienced travelers advise. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Dining at the hotel, according to tourists, is good, varied.  According to many vacationers, the food here is ‚Äúamazing, they cook meat very well‚Äù.  There are always a lot of vegetables and fruits for every taste.  But seafood, according to hotel guests, the choice is small.  It seemed to some that the meat was first cooked first, and then stewed or fried, so some vacationers do not like its taste.  And still, no one leaves hungry from dinner.  Also, vacationers report that for lunch and dinner it is necessary to come strictly at the allotted time and take a table reserved for the tourist.  If you want, you don‚Äôt want, but at a certain time you should have lunch (breakfast, dinner), otherwise you can miss the meal time, because after the allotted half an hour the table will be given to other guests next in line. </p>

    <p> Waiters, tourists share, will smile, clean dishes and bring water if you tip them.  Otherwise, they‚Äôll never go to vacationers for the whole lunch.  It is necessary to give the waiter 10 dinars on the first day, and every next day vacationers will expect a humanly set table: flowers, drinks.  All vacationers do this, do not be greedy.  Otherwise, you will have to sit down to dinner at an uncleaned table, push aside other people's dirty appliances, or watch the waiter simply turn the tablecloth over on the other side, without changing it after having finished the previous queue. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  According to vacationers, the service at the Riadh Palms 4 * hotel leaves much to be desired. </p><p>  On the beach, they complain, you cannot take water with you.  If you want to drink to quench your thirst, you need to go to the hotel. </p><p>  Daily cleaning of the rooms, in their opinion, is very superficial.  In addition, it can be carried out ‚Äúat the most inopportune moment‚Äù, in the presence of vacationers.  Just without knocking an employee will open the door and begin cleaning, despite the dissatisfaction of the residents. </p><h2>  Staff </h2><p>  Vacationers at the hotel are mainly Germans, French, British.  There are fewer Russians; without English, they have a very difficult time here. </p><p>  The attitude of the staff towards the Russians, as tourists say, ‚Äúspoils everything‚Äù.  According to the authors of the reviews, in Riadh Palms 4 * ‚Äúfor some reason they don‚Äôt like the Slavs,‚Äù and this is manifested in many ways.  You will have to face this for the first time at check-in: Russians arriving at 8-00 will have to wait until 12 hours to check in. </p><p>  At the same time, waiting, they can watch how they will be resettled immediately upon arrival of Europeans who arrived later, give them the best rooms (which provide a view of the sea, not the construction site). </p><h2>  Animation </h2><p>  Reviews characterize her as "weak, boring and monotonous."  There is nothing special to see, the authors say.  During the day, the animators ‚Äúseem to be trying‚Äù to entertain the holidaymakers: they carry out exercises, dances, and games.  But the animators especially fail to arouse the desire of vacationers to join the ‚Äúfun‚Äù.  They do not insist, to the pleasure of the residents of the hotel. </p><p>  It is unpleasant that the authors of the reviews share that, for example, it is very difficult for a Russian to get tennis rackets and play before dinner.  ‚ÄúOnly after dinner,‚Äù without any explanation.  Although other vacationers (Europeans) play at any time.  ‚ÄúHave they come to rest with their rackets?‚Äù  - the Russians are asking. </p><h2>  Beach holiday </h2><p>  The sea is clean, white sand, everything is wonderful on the beach, tourists respond.  A lot of algae in the morning, but you can put up with it.  The presence of a large number of jellyfish - this, they believe, is also not scary.  The bad thing is that the urns are located near the water itself, sometimes they roll over in waves, and all the garbage falls into the water. </p>

    <p>  Local merchants, constantly ‚Äúsnooping‚Äù along the beach, are bored.  Bedouins can also show up on the beach.  In general, the beach in Riadh Palms 4 *, in the opinion of vacationers, looks like a passage yard.  Here "local men constantly roam", allowing themselves liberties in relation to the guests. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Determining where to go on vacation, tourists usually read a large number of reviews about the hotel, as well as about the city in which it is located, and, in general, about the country. </p>

    <p>  The advantages of the Riadh Palms 4 * hotel include a wonderful warm sea, a wonderful clean beach, animation, varied and well-fed food, convenient location, some note the courtesy of the staff.  The downsides are called dirt on the territory and in rooms, poor service in the restaurant, ‚Äúunrealistic‚Äù lines for food, to the elevator, to the bar, lack of cutlery and crockery in the restaurant, old furniture, lack of repair and poor housekeeping, the need to pay even basic services.  In addition, many are saddened by cases of rudeness of staff and disrespect for Russian tourists.  A lot of reviews about Riadh Palms 4 * are sharply negative. </p><p>  Those who are scared by the abundance of minuses noted by tourists, the authors of the reviews advise not to forget that Africa is not Europe.  There is no need to complain and be upset about the dirty streets of the city, "arrogant and annoying Arabs" and other things.  Everything should be perceived, they believe, as the color of the country.  In this case, the attitude to the flaws will be different, and, accordingly, the mood will improve. </p><p>  They come to Tunisia for their impressions of Africa.  You should not expect to see a European resort here.  With such a mood in Riadh Palms 4 * a lot can be liked. </p>
