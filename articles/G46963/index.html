Moreover, they all have a similar mentality and language of communication.  Nevertheless, the state is a slightly different phenomenon than the one we are all thinking about.  To understand its features, you need to look into the origins of the emergence of countries.  Initially, they simply did not exist.  There were only tribal communities on earth that united people on a tribal basis. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the concept of the state mechanism the structure of the state mechanism" class="if" height="392" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26556/1642704.jpg" width="600"></div>  Over time, this feature has completely changed.  It became clear that the tribal community cannot effectively organize the activities of a large group of people.  Therefore, people are developing a more perfect and cumbersome structure, which the state becomes.  It differs from similar systems in its size, the presence of a regulator of social relations and, of course, the existence of a mechanism.  At different times, there were different views on the problems of the state mechanism.  With the development of fundamental legal sciences, knowledge of this category has streamlined and acquired a better quality.  However, the mechanism of the state is not just a theoretical category.  It is a regulatory structure that is built on certain principles and has a number of its own functions.

Thus, in order to analyze the mechanism of the state, the concept, structure, value, the functions of which will be presented later, it is necessary to highlight the features of the title category.  Such, as we understand it, in this case is a power.  Features of this category explain many rather interesting points.  In the classical version, the state is a peculiar form of organization of society in a certain territory.  However, each country should have some features that give it the right to be called a power.  These features include territory, sovereignty and, of course, the rule of law.  Only in the presence of these moments of reality does a socio-political association be recognized by the state.  However, with this definition, a logical question arises: what is the mechanism of the country? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mechanism state apparatus concept structure" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1642796.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  State mechanism: concept </h2><p>  Over the centuries, people have perfected the mechanism of governing countries.  Theoretical work in this area led to the creation of the principle of separation of powers, different political and territorial regimes, etc. But the most important result of activities in this industry was the mechanism of the state.  The concept, signs, structure of this category today is actively considered by many scientists.  However, there are general views on this issue.  If we take into account the most general specifics, then the mechanism of the state is a concept that characterizes all bodies and institutions of state power.  That is, in this case we are talking about official departments that directly carry out the most important functions of the country.  The category has many features and its own composition of fundamental principles.  Its existence and quality plays a large role in the process of activity of each individual country.  Therefore, improving the mechanism of the state is not only a theoretical issue, but also a practical one.  Indeed, the standard of living of the population depends on this. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Distinction of concepts </h2><p>  Many scientists in their scientific works very often raise the issue of the correlation of the terms ‚Äústate mechanism‚Äù and ‚Äústate apparatus‚Äù.  The bottom line is that some theorists completely identify the concepts, while others speak of their complete opposite.  This begs the question: how do the mechanism, apparatus of the state, the concept, the structure of which are quite similar, relate?  According to one theory, the state apparatus is a term that characterizes all the authorities existing in a particular country.  The mechanism of the state is in this case a broader phenomenon.  It characterizes not only all official departments, but also their functions, features and principles of the system, etc. Thus, the mechanism, apparatus of the state, the concept, the structure of which are similar, are completely different phenomena. </p><h2>  Key category features </h2><p>  The mechanism of the state, the concept, structure, the significance of which we are now considering, is endowed with a number of specific features.  They talk about the most interesting moments of the entire system of public authorities and their activities.  In addition, it is precisely thanks to signs in science that today there are such categories as the mechanism of the state, the concept, structure, and functions of this phenomenon.  Among the most obvious features of the category are: </p><ul><li>  exceptional integrity of the whole structure; </li><li>  hierarchy of the system (the existence of organs in conditions of strict subordination); <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the structure of the state mechanism includes" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26556/1642700.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  specific subjective composition, which includes only official bodies; </li><li>  specific goals and functions; </li><li>  the availability of logistics provided directly by the state. </li></ul><p>  Thus, such key features indicate the exceptional position of the mentioned category not only in legal science, but also in the practical activities of the country as a whole.  Therefore, the concept of the state mechanism, the structure of the state mechanism are those immediate objects that should be studied as fully as possible. </p><h2>  Fundamental Principles of Operation </h2><p>  The concept of the state mechanism, the structure of the state mechanism are all those factors that exist due to the presence of the initial provisions of the category mentioned in the article.  It should be noted that the principles of the state mechanism determine its specificity and, most importantly, help highlight the main areas of its work.  To date, there are five fundamental provisions on which the entire category is built.  Their number may vary depending on the specific theoretical view of the whole problem.  But classical theory still takes its toll.  In accordance with its provisions, the basic principles of organization and all activities of the state mechanism are: subordination, transparency, legality, competence, professionalism.  Therefore, the concept of the state mechanism, the structure of the state mechanism should be studied taking into account the presented features.  This must be taken into account. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="state mechanism structure briefly" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26556/1642702.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The structure of the mechanism of the state of the Russian Federation </h2><p>  Any system consists of a number of specific elements, each of which has its own level of importance.  The structure of the state mechanism incorporates three interrelated elements.  Each of them performs its own functions, and also has a certain place in the general hierarchy.  Thus, the structure of the state mechanism includes: </p><ul><li>  authorities; </li><li>  state organizations; </li><li>  civil servants. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="state mechanism concept structure value" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26556/1642709.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><h2>  Features of authorities </h2><p>  The structure of the state mechanism, briefly discussed in this article, contains such an element as official departments.  They are special associations of employees and are engaged in the implementation of the country's policies.  A distinctive feature of state bodies is the presence of power.  In other words, departments can use coercion in order to ensure certain legal relations.  In addition, the activities of such bodies embody the basic principles of the country's mechanism. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="structure of the state mechanism of the Russian Federation" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26556/1642708.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Features of government organizations and employees </h2><p>  The smallest link in the entire apparatus of the country are employees.  They are included in the structure of certain state bodies, and their legal status is distinguished by the presence of special powers that are exclusive at some points.  Employees directly implement the functions of departments in which they work, as well as modernize their activities. </p><p>  The concept of the state mechanism, the structure of the state mechanism are interconnected categories that make it possible to understand the features of the whole phenomenon.  When analyzing them, it becomes clear that the country can be governed not only through imperious orders.  Organizational issues are of great importance.  Therefore, the structure of the mechanism of Russia includes state organizations, institutions and enterprises.  They are not endowed with authority, but their functions are no less demanded.  As a rule, such organizations include scientific, medical, etc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the structure of the mechanism of the state, its concepts and elements" class="if" height="461" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26556/1642707.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, in the article we examined the structure of the state mechanism.  Its concepts and elements were also presented earlier.  In conclusion, it should be noted that a theoretical study of this category is still required, since it is extremely important for the activities of the Russian Federation as a whole. </p>
