It would seem like this can be: after all, each power has only one main city, which has been formed over many centuries?  And then there are as many as three metropolitan cities.  Moscow is the capital of Russia, which the whole world knows.  Well, what other two cities bear such an honorable name?  We will talk about this in our article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russia is the third capital" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/690339.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Briefly about Moscow </h2><p>  <span>Moscow (the capital of</span> Russia) has come a long historical way of its formation and formation.  It is quite difficult to describe this whole stage, but it is still worth mentioning the most important points. </p><p>  For the first time, Moscow is mentioned in chronicles related to the end of the 12th century.  It was just at that moment when the monarchs were in constant war because of power over Kiev.  In 1147 (in the spring) Yuri Dolgoruky - Prince of Suzdal - ordered his army to go to Novgorod.  This trip is directly related to the first memory of Moscow in history.  The prince ordered one of his associates, namely Svyatoslav, to arrive in a small new city.  The news that a meeting of the princes will take place in Moscow before the start of a great civil war, which threatened to end the campaign, turned this city into a village known throughout Russia.  This is where Russia originates from, the third capital of which will appear in a rather long period of time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Dolgoruky did not plan to turn Moscow into a capital.  But fate itself predicted such a role for the settlement, because it was a junction located between several principalities, and it was here that waterways and roads came into contact.  Therefore, willingly or unwillingly, but Moscow still became a capital city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="northern capital" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/690340.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Museum on the Islands </h2><p>  When it comes to St. Petersburg, then everyone immediately mentions that it is the northern capital of the Russian Federation.  The city is located on the 47 islands of the Neva Delta and is a real <span>open-air museum.</span>  Petersburg is considered one of the most beautiful cities in Europe.  During the history of its existence, he had to survive three years of the blockade, 11 emperors, economic reform and several dozen floods.  And all this for some three hundred years. </p><p>  In 1703, the first cobblestone laid at the base of Leningrad.  It was at this time that <span>Peter the Great</span> decided to build a new capital city.  It was supposed to be open to European trends and sea winds.  The northern capital grew spontaneously among marshes and swamps, and it was almost completely rebuilt by foreign architects.  The appearance of St. Petersburg for the Russian became as unusual as the habit of reading newspapers or shaving his beard.  During the construction of the city, more than one thousand workers died, so it is often said that it is built on bones. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Become the capital </h2><p>  <span>St. Petersburg (</span> northern <span>capital of Russia</span> ) turned into the main city of such a powerful empire during the reign of Peter the Great.  But when exactly this happened, it is not known for certain.  On this occasion, not even a special decree was issued.  Everything happened somehow by itself.  In 1708, Peter I transferred the entire Romanov family from Moscow to Peter.  Immediately for the king was built the first Winter House on the left <span>bank of the Neva.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow is the capital of Russia" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/690341.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  When it became clear that the monarch intended to turn the new city into his residence, foreign ambassadors began to move here from Moscow.  Also, the movement of all state institutions and their employees gradually took place.  In 1712, the Governing Senate, the highest organ of state power, also moved to a settlement on the Neva.  This year is considered to be the date when St. Petersburg became the capital of the state. </p><h2>  Nizhny Novgorod or Kazan </h2><p>  Russia (the third capital - Kazan) acquired a new capital city not so long ago: just a few years ago.  Two cities fought for the right to bear the title of the third capital - Kazan and Nizhny Novgorod.  Rospatent was engaged in the consideration of such applications.  He also decided that the capital of Tatarstan will also be the next main city of the entire Federation. </p><p>  Kazan immediately registered the corresponding trademarks with Rospatent.  It is no secret that the slogan ‚ÄúKazan is the third capital of Russia‚Äù began to be used by the city in early spring 2007.  This provoked a conflict between Nizhny Novgorod and Tatarstan.  But he was successfully resolved.  And now the Russian Federation has another capital city - Kazan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kazan is the third capital of Russia" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/690343.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Kazan </h2><p>  Russia, the third capital of which is Kazan, can be proud that there is such a magnificent city on its open spaces.  The history of Kazan has a thousand years.  The past of the settlement is closely connected with the ancient civilization of the Volga Bulgars and their direct heirs to the Kazan Tatars. </p><p>  For more than three centuries, Kazan served as the outpost of the Bulgarian state.  In the XIII century it turned into a large administrative center of one of the villages of the Golden Horde.  One hundred years later, the city became the capital of the Kazan Khanate.  And in 1552 he was annexed to Russia.  In 1920, Kazan turns into the capital of Tatarstan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Petersburg, the capital of Russia" class="if" height="344" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/690344.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Three capitals </h2><p>  Russia (the third capital is indicated above) is an amazingly beautiful country.  And no matter which of its capitals you visit, you will see that each of them is different and incredible in its own way.  All cities have many historical sights, enchanting nature and people who are always ready to tell about the most outstanding moments in the life of their village.  And naturally, Muscovites will persuade you that Moscow should be the capital, in St. Petersburg they will bring thousands of evidence that this is the only and only metropolitan city, and in Kazan they will demonstrate the local Kremlin, which will cast aside all doubts about why this settlement cannot be the main city of the Federation. </p>
