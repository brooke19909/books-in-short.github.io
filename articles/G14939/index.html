    <h2>  Accommodation options </h2><p>  Chalet "Seaside" offers several accommodation options that differ in the availability of amenities, price and remoteness from the beach.  In the areas "Grove", "Mountaineer" and "Lunar" guests are offered houses built in Soviet times.  They are not equipped with amenities. <br>  Shower, toilet and washbasins are located in the base.  In the houses the rooms are two, three and four local.  In the areas of "Sputnik" and "Sunny" are also summer houses without amenities, only new buildings.

There is also a private dining room. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Two types of trips - either with three meals a day, or only accommodation in the chosen house offers the Primorskaya camp site.  Feedback on such a system is very positive, since anyone who does not want to pay extra money or eat on time can choose any cafe located on the territory of the base or outside it.  If vacationers decided to eat at the base, a dining room works for them, where there are two spacious halls.  The service in them is organized so that vacationers come to the dining room by the appointed time, when dishes are already waiting for them on the set tables.  No flea market, no queues.  Everyone knows the number of his table, sits down and starts a meal.  Complex meals, including breakfast, lunch and dinner.  For breakfast, the porridge menu (with and without milk), coffee, tea, cheese, bread, butter.  At lunch, the tables are always first and second courses, salads from fresh vegetables, fruits.  Dinner is complete without baking.

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Wonderful beaches are famous for the village of Novomikhailovka.  The Primorskaya camp site is located almost on the coast.  The distance from the buildings to the beach is different, but not more than 250 meters.  The beach at the camp site is own, very clean, well maintained and well equipped.  Coverage - small pebbles, on which it is not painful to walk barefoot.  Entry into the water is very convenient for all categories of citizens.  Depth begins seven meters from the coast.  The peculiarities of the geographical location of the base create wonderful conditions for a beach holiday, since the water here is much warmer than on other beaches of this section of the Black Sea.  Behind the prominent cape you can find the greatest solitude and peace, since there is no beach tourist service, only the coast and the sea.  The people converge there only when the sea is turbulent, since there are almost never waves behind the cape.  The main beach is equipped with a toilet, canopy, shower, cabins where you can change clothes.  There are also a lot of attractions, such as riding a "banana", "tablet", water skiing, catamaran.  There is an inflatable slide for children. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Calm and pleasant vacation offers its guests the camp "Primorskaya" (Novomikhailovsky).

Fresh water in the pool, free sunbeds and sun loungers with umbrellas around are always available.  Using the pool costs 150 rubles for the whole day.  In the evening, guests of the Primorskaya camp site can relax in any of the 6 cafes located near the beach.  There, until 12 at night, music plays, a billiard room.  Fans of a more relaxing holiday will enjoy <span>evening walks</span> along the promenade, admiring the sunset, and during the daytime active tourists can walk along the territory of the reserve adjacent to the base.  At the very base of "Seaside" animation, as such, no.  But on the concert stage, evenings of music with dancing are often arranged, competitions are held, holidays are organized.  In addition, in just 3-5 minutes a quiet walk is the Mikhailovsky Plovdiv Territory, where a beautiful promenade stretches along the sea with bars, restaurants, discos in the evening and at night, and in the daytime with water attractions for children and adults.
