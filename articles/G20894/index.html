In some cities of Russia, this mobile operator has appeared recently.  And so there are some doubts about the transition to it.  What is so special that Tele 2 can offer?  Where does this operator work?  Should I connect to its tariffs?  Let's try to figure it all out. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tele 2 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1084741.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Coating </h2><p>  To begin with, coverage and reviews (Tele 2) play an important role in the company's reputation.  Before connecting to this operator, you need to understand that it will not work everywhere.  Especially when you consider that in some cities this organization has appeared recently. </p><p>  The <span>Tele 2</span> connection is <span>"</span> caught" in Russia and Ukraine (in some of its places).  If you look at the interactive map of the coverage area, then in the western part of the Russian Federation there are most access points.  The central part of the country has almost no connections to Tele 2, reviews of which are mixed.  Southeast Russia has just begun acquaintance with this operator.  The corporation plans to connect its connection throughout the country. </p><p>  True, in this regard, the <span>Internet "Tele 2"</span> receives far from the best reviews.  And a little later we will figure out why.  It should be noted right away: if you are in doubt about changing the operator, then it is better to wait.  Not everyone likes the services of "Tele 2".  And there are reasons for that. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="internet tv 2 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1084739.jpg"></div>

Including mobile.  And the <span>Internet "Tele 2"</span> receives not the best reviews.  After all, the network is available only in some cities of Russia. </p><p>  So, for example, the coverage area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe 3G network is currently available in approximately 100 cities across the country.  In Ukraine, the Internet is caught only near Lugansk.  Thus, if you need an operator who will give access to the network from a mobile, then it is better to refrain from connecting to this option.  Especially if you plan to travel a lot. </p><p>  <span>"Tele 2" reviews</span> also earn not quite good in terms of 4G-network.  At the moment, there are already as many as three cities throughout Russia where there is such a service - St. Petersburg, Moscow, Tula.  No one knows what the operator repelled from when he made the network only in these cities.  But he plans, as you know, to fill all of Russia with 3G and 4G Internet.  How much time it will take is a mystery.  In any case, according to customers, the operator is not in a hurry with this matter.  Thus, "Tele 2", reviews of which are left by users more and more often, is by far not the best choice. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="communication tele 2 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1084738.jpg"></div>

In our situation, everything is not as good as it seems at first glance.  Many users of the Tele 2 network leave reviews about it that are not the most flattering. </p><p>  Not only has this operator not yet connected all of Russia to its services, there are plenty of interruptions in its work.  For example, in Kaliningrad, where the company has already become famous, the network may be lost several times a day. </p><p>  In case of bad weather, you can generally be left without means of communication with the outside world.  The operator <span>"Tele 2" in</span> this sense receives mostly negative reviews in comparison with competitors.  Probably, all this is due to the fact that this company has not quite mastered the market of mobile services.  Nevertheless, now, after the occurrence of numerous connection problems, the company is losing its clientele.  Not completely, but the flow of those interested in this plan is decreasing. </p><h2>  Communication cost </h2><p>  In principle, network failures can still be somehow reconciled.  The world is not perfect, anything happens.  But ‚ÄúTele 2‚Äù receives reviews from its customers as an expensive operator.  Perhaps you can compare it with the well-known "Beeline".  No, this does not mean that you will pay exorbitantly.  If you choose the right tariff plan, then "Tele 2" may seem like a very good offer.  But, as practice shows, often the cost of some services is overstated. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="modem tele 2 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1084740.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For example, there are such tariff plans that imply a monthly fee.  As a rule, it is not too high.  And this attracts new consumers to Tele 2.  But if you carefully read the conditions for the provision of communication, you will notice that you will pay several rubles more for a minute of conversation with your operator, for a couple more with others, and the Internet is most likely to be paid separately.  All this translates into rather large bills for a mobile phone at the end of the month. </p><p>  If you pay attention to tariffs that do not require a monthly fee, then in general many will be surprised.  In some cases, you are required to pay 3-4 rubles per minute.  This is a very high cost.  Therefore, we have to abandon the Tele 2 operator.  Not always, but it happens.  Especially if you are a sociable person, and even constantly using all the functions of your mobile phone.  Internet including. </p><h2>  Internet price tag </h2><p>  To be honest, the connection "Tele 2" reviews, as you see, receive far from the best in terms of cost and quality of service.  And with the Internet, things are a little better.  After all, the tariffs for access to the World Wide Web in ‚ÄúTele 2‚Äù can be selected quite favorable. </p><p>  Often used scheme without a monthly fee.  This is not the best technique.  But if you consider that in this case you will give about 1.8-2 rubles for a megabyte of Internet, then your opinion will change for the better.  Of course, such tariffs are not suitable for particularly sociable users.  They better choose an option with a monthly fee and unlimited Internet.  If the World Wide Web is rarely used on a mobile phone, then, as consumers of Tele 2 assure, it‚Äôs better to connect yourself to the Internet for Devices. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tele 2 tariff black reviews" class="if" height="344" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1084737.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Internet for computer </h2><p>  For a long time, all mobile operators have been offering their consumers a computer Internet connection on favorable terms.  And Tele 2 is no exception.  In truth, in this sense, most operators have the same network operation.  And users are not very happy with it. </p><p>  For example, the <span>‚ÄúTele 2‚Äù modem</span> receives far from the best reviews, as it picks up a signal poorly.  The cost of tariffs for a computer network for this operator is pleasing, but the quality of service is not very good.  At a remote point in a city or region, you will wait a very long time for processing and downloading information.  The excellent and stable operation of the Tele 2 modem is observed only in the central parts of cities.  Where there are many transmission lines. </p><p>  In principle, blaming the operator here is simply stupid.  After all, as already mentioned, a similar trend is visible in most companies.  Few people are able to provide high-quality 3G and 4G communication to a computer through the most common USB modem at the moment.  So if this moment is the only one of its kind that forces you to abandon the Tele 2 operator, you better not do this.  Just remember that in the country you should not expect an ultrafast connection from computer Internet. </p><h2>  Additional services </h2><p>  Fortunately, the company offers a lot of additional services to help diversify the standard features of the phone.  And all this, according to consumers, at fairly competitive prices.  For example, without problems, you can set up an answering machine, caller ID and anti-caller ID, connect music instead of a beep, and also pick up a special SMS and MMS package that allows you to send messages to mobile numbers of any operators for free for a month. </p><p>  On the Tele 2 website you may find that there is also the possibility of sending SMS from a computer.  Anonymous and free.  You only need to go through authorization using virtual accounts.  Both Mail, Facebook, and Classmates will do.  Most operators simply do not have such a service.  And this, of course, pleases. </p><p>  Also, the operator "Tele 2", reviews of which are left mixed, has the service "Dating".  You can easily and for a reasonable fee meet someone who also uses this operator. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="coverage area and tele reviews 2" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1084736.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Tariff "Black" </h2><p>  Particular attention is paid to consumers tariff "Black".  It is called the most profitable for this company.  Especially for those who prefer to communicate inside their city. </p><p>  At <span>"Tele 2" tariff</span> "Black" gets good reviews.  Firstly, he has a small monthly fee - only 90 rubles.  Secondly, you can send 100 messages within Russia for free per month, as well as talk for free within your home region.  In addition, as a gift you get 1 GB of traffic to mobile Internet. </p><p>  In the region, the price of 1 ruble per minute applies to other mobile operators.  Outside the region, you can call ‚ÄúTele 2‚Äù at 2 rubles, and in Russia at other numbers ‚Äî at 8. Each SMS in the region will cost more than 100 messages in 1 ruble, and outside of it ‚Äî 2.5.  In principle, not a very expensive tariff.  It is he who often attracts consumers. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  So we met with "Tele 2".  As you can see, this operator is not much different from the rest.  Perhaps satisfied and dissatisfied customers are always there.  The operator has few significant drawbacks.  But they are able to repel most consumers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tele operator 2 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1084742.jpg"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  If in doubt whether to connect to "Tele 2", for now, leave this venture.  This operator, by the way, offers favorable conditions for communication among customers.  Are you the only potential customer of the operator in your environment?  Then you should not change your current tariff.  So you can avoid many problems. </p>
