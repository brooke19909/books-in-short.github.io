    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The Grand Ring Hotel looks like a chic palace in the midst of an amazing mountain landscape.  It is decorated with marble, everywhere - richly decorated stairs.  This hotel can be called a suburban, because it is located away from the bustle of megacities.  To the first large conglomerate - Antalya - from it about thirty-five kilometers.  And to the resort village of Kemer - about ten.  Far enough to the Antalya airport - forty-five kilometers.  Although, of course, it is much closer than the resorts of Alanya.  The road from the airport takes forty minutes.  Although sometimes you have to go for about an hour.  The Grand Ring Hotel (Kemer) is actually located on the seashore, although there is a road between the beach and its territory.  But this is the specificity of the entire resort village of Beldibi.  Getting to the hotel is very convenient, and this can easily be done not only by transfer from the travel agency, but also on your own.  Among the advantages of collective ‚Äúdelivery‚Äù, tourists called the fact that they were the first to be brought to this hotel and the last to be taken.  The hotel is located on the main highway connecting Antalya and Kemer.  On it every ten to fifteen minutes go minibuses dolmushi.  They depart from the Anatolian bus station.  A hundred meters from the hotel there is a gallery of shops.  The center of Beldibi can be easily reached by shuttle bus.  It takes no more than a few minutes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Grand ring hotel 5" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/716949.jpg" width="440"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Kemer, Beldibi </h2><p>  This is one of the youngest resort villages.  It is halfway between Antalya and Kemer and occupies a narrow strip of the coast.  Beldibi is practically sandwiched between the sea and the mountains of Tor (Taurus).  Here they come closest to the shore, and therefore the landscapes of the village are unusually picturesque.  We can say that the resort itself is one street - named, of course, by the name of Ataturk - on which all the hotels are built.  In all other respects, it is similar to other such villages, which tourist Turkey has been famous for recently.  Grand Ring Hotel is one of a series of hotels that stretch along the sea for several kilometers.  She stands closer to the outskirts of the village.  Due to the fact that the mountains come very close to the water, the beaches of Beldibi are mostly coarse.  But local hotels, luring tourists, are trying to find a way out of this situation.  Some specifically bring bulk sand, while others ‚Äî like the Grand Ring ‚Äî build piers to enter the water.  In the village you can walk along the coastal parks, of which there are a lot, and breathe the sea air, saturated with healing pine volcanoes.  The main historical attraction, which is easily accessible by minibus, is the ruins of the ancient Greek city of Phaselis.  It will take a whole day to inspect them, but it's worth it.  You can go to Phaselis at any time of the year, including very hot.  All archaeological sites are located in the forest, in a shady area, and overlook the sea.  Therefore, walking there is not only interesting, but also pleasant.  The guides claim that Alexander the Great was buried somewhere here, although this is most likely a legend.  And if you like to wander in the mountains, then just south of the village is the village of Goynuk, where you can walk or drive to a very picturesque canyon. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="grand ring hotel kemer 5 4 4" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/717220.jpg" width="500"></div>
