What is Iklaud in the iPhone</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The user saves various files on his iPhone, such as music, photos and others.  From time to time, he needs to back up his data, especially if he plans to update or restore the mobile device.  There is an excellent service for this action - iCloud.  Users showed interest in it instantly, since it‚Äôs a free option, easy to use, and in order to access Iklaud on the iPhone, you don‚Äôt need a computer or cable, and the cloud has 5 GB of free space. </p><h2>  User account in icloud </h2><div class="photo" data-original="9to5mac.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="User account in icloud" class="if uuid-2863474" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2863474.jpg"></div><p>  It contains what is most important for each person.  Usually these are such things: contacts, applications, files, photos, notes, reminders, mail and, most importantly - backup copies of the phone.  iCloud shares this information on all devices, including iDevices and user computers.  Before entering the ‚ÄúIkloud‚Äù in the ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù, the user is registered on iCloud.com.  Then he can view and change any information that he has saved in his account. </p><p>  When you enter the site from a browser, you can check multiple accounts.  During authorization, you can use any application and any changes or updates that are made are automatically saved and updated on all connected devices. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After entering the cloud, iCloud accounts that are connected and not connected with the iPhone and other iDevices are checked.  On a mobile device, you can only have one account and an Apple ID to connect to the phone.  Nor does Apple do account verification on iPhone and iDevices mobile devices. </p><h2>  Configure iCloud Drive </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.macrumors.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Configure iCloud Drive" class="if uuid-2863491" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2863491.jpg"></div><p>  Before entering the "Iklaud" in the "iPhone", the user sets up the operating system on the new phone for the first time, the system asks him if he wants to turn on the cloud.  Apple gives 5 GB of storage to each user for free, but if the owner starts synchronizing all his documents, files and photos in the cloud, he will quickly exhaust his free space, after which he will need a subscription.  Subscription prices for more storage range from $ 0.99 to $ 9.99 per month. </p><p>  Here is what Iklaud in iPhone is for free: </p><ol><li>  With iCloud Drive, you can synchronize files on all devices in supported third-party applications, as well as with Apple's built-in programs.  These operations consume a lot of memory.  Therefore, it is better to sync files on iPhone, iPad and Mac. </li><li>  The user can manually change the list of applications, which of them should or should not be used. </li><li>  When synchronizing files and data, a special folder is created for storing them. </li><li>  You can create new folders in iCloud or in Files to manually add or move files. </li></ol><h2>  File sync </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.idownloadblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="File sync" class="if uuid-2863495" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2863495.jpg"></div><p>  There are dozens of large cloud storage services that are used to synchronize files on different devices.  A user can have photos on Google Drive, documents on Dropbox, and music on OneDrive.  If he prefers to save all the contents of the cloud-synchronized content in one place, then you need to learn how to make "Iklaud" in the "iPhone", after which it is easy to move everything to iCloud. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Starting with macOS Sierra, you can store all your desktop documents in iCloud and access from any device.  This saves space on the device, making it easy to get important files on any other device that supports iCloud.  The versions of iOS 11 and macOS High Sierra allow you to exchange documents and work in them in real time directly from the iCloud Drive application and files. </p><h2>  Access files on iPhone </h2><p>  It used to be that you could have access to settings by going to the settings section with the name ‚ÄúiCloud‚Äù, but the new version of iOS has changed - before you go to ‚ÄúIklaud‚Äù in ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù, you need to: </p><ol><li>  Open the ‚ÄúSettings app‚Äù on your device.  At the very top of the screen there is a ‚ÄúName‚Äù under it Apple ID, iCloud. </li><li>  Click on it to access the Apple ID settings, and then the iCloud settings. </li></ol><p>  What a user can get from their account via iPhone is limited only by files on iCloud Drive and cloud settings.  They include a lot of information in the form of all backup files and the contents that are stored.  To access them, you will need a tool that acts as a connection between a computer and an iCloud account. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.iphoneincanada.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iMyFone D-Port iCloud Data Exporter" class="if uuid-2863549" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2863549.jpg"></div><p>  One of the best is iMyFone D-Port, a data exporter that allows you to access all the content on your iCloud account.  Listed below are some of the features of the program that are used before watching "Iklaud" in the "iPhone".  Key Feature: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  Allows you to selectively export up to 18 different types of data from your backup account. </li><li>  Displays all available backups for selection. </li><li>  Used to backup the device or just WhatsApp and messages. </li><li>  Provides access to data without having to have the device with you.  Very easy to use and compatible with Windows and Mac OS. </li></ol><h2>  D-port for computer access </h2><p>  To use D-Port to access account data on a PC, you must download the program to your computer.  Once it is installed, follow these simple steps: </p><ol><li>  Run the program on the computer, and then select "Extract data from backup" from the options in the main window.  Copies detected by the program should appear.  If there is no access, you need to click "Download".  Log in to iCloud with an Apple ID and password. </li><li>  After logging in, select the desired backup file and click "Next".  On the next screen, you will need to select the type of data that you want to access.  This will reduce the time spent by the program on scanning the backup copy. </li><li>  If you want to see everything, just check the "Select all" box.  Click "Next" after making a selection.  The program will continue to download and scan the selected file for the specified data.  You can view and select the desired data on the next screen. </li><li>  Select the desired file types and click "Extract" to save the selected files in a folder on your computer. </li></ol><h2>  Checking Cloud Files </h2><p>  If the user tries to see what is in iCloud on the iPhone, he will notice that he can only access iCloud settings and files from the iPhone.  Everything else is inaccessible from the device.  In the iCloud Drive app in iOS 10, you can see all the files stored directly on the iPhone.  To do this, you need to understand what is ‚ÄúIklaud‚Äù in ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù, and do the following: </p><ol><li>  Make sure the iCloud app is enabled on your iPhone or iPad. </li><li>  Open the settings application on the device.  Click on Apple ID&gt; iCloud. </li><li>  Enable iCloud Drive so that the application appears on the main screen.  With the launch of iOS 11, the best way to view files on the iPhone has appeared.  The Files application allows you to access all folders. </li><li>  Launch the Files app on your iPhone. </li><li>  Click "Browse" below. </li><li>  Click "iCloud Drive" in the "Location" section, before entering the "Cloud" cloud from the "iPhone" and you can see all the files that have been saved. </li></ol><h2>  Log in to your account from a browser </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.aiseesoft.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Log in to your account from a browser" class="if uuid-2863584" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2863584.jpg"></div><p>  It's easy enough to log into iCloud using any web browser on your computer (PC or Mac).  But this is not the case for Apple iPhone and mobile iDevices.  For quick entry, Safari and Firefox have this feature.  To quickly request the desktop version of iCloud or any other site, press and hold the Refresh symbol in the address bar of the browser URL for Safari or at the bottom of the screen for Firefox.  Pressing and holding Refresh brings up a quick action menu with the ability to query the desktop.  Select this button and it will transfer the user to the desktop version. </p><p>  To access through the Chrome browser: </p><ol><li>  Open Chrome. </li><li>  Visit the webpage of the cloud. </li><li>  Click on the settings menu (3 dots on the screen on the right). </li><li>  Select ‚ÄúDesktop Query‚Äù in the menu.  If the desktop version does not appear, re-enter i.cloud.com in the web address bar. </li><li>  Log in to the working version with an Apple ID. </li></ol><p>  Using browsers other than Safari on iDevice makes the iCloud server think that the user is accessing the site from a desktop Mac.  The biggest advantage of logging into the cloud from a browser is that you can check multiple accounts, including non-iPhone and other iDevices.  Since it allows you to connect to the device only one iCloud account and Apple ID, using a browser to access your accounts, the icloud storage on the iPhone, where you can move photos and other information. </p><h2>  Clear storage space </h2><div class="photo" data-original="iphone-tricks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Clear storage space" class="if uuid-2863600" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2863600.jpg"></div><p>  To free up storage space for files in the cloud, documents are cleared and backups are disabled for specific applications.  These actions are useful, free up a lot of space for new information.  However, there is one important way that can actually restore a lot of storage space at once - by deleting old iCloud backups from your iOS device. </p><p>  Before <span>cleaning the iceloud,</span> make sure that the latest version of the device is received.  This method is especially well suited if a person has used several iDevices in the past and does not need them.  An iCloud backup consists of many files, including device settings, application data, iTunes purchase history, photos and videos, iMessage, text messages, MMS messages, ringtones, health data, HomeKit settings, visual voicemail password, etc. If left untouched, they can clutter up the device or take up a lot of precious space. </p><p>  Procedure: </p><ol><li>  Before cleaning Iclaud, launch the Launch Settings application on your iOS device. </li><li>  You must log in to your profile in iCloud. </li><li>  Click "Storage Management" and then "Backups". </li><li>  In the "Backups" section, select a device. </li><li>  Click "Delete backup." </li><li>  Then click ‚ÄúDisable‚Äù and ‚ÄúDelete‚Äù to confirm. </li></ol><p>  Removing unwanted backups from Mac and Windows computers is as easy as removing them from iOS. </p><h2>  Reset Lost Password </h2><div class="photo" data-original="keywordsuggest.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reset Lost Password" class="if uuid-2863624" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2863624.jpg"></div><p>  A very common situation is with the user when he forgot the password from "Iklaud" on the "iPhone", and does not know what to do.  If the user cannot restore the backup password, the only option to regain control of the device is to erase all data and then restore the system from iCloud.  To do this, you must: </p><ol><li>  Open "Settings" on the device. </li><li>  Click on your name and then on iCloud. </li><li>  Go to Backup. </li><li>  Turn on the switch, then click "Back". </li><li>  Create backups.  This can take a lot of time depending on the amount of data backup and the bandwidth of Internet traffic.  You may need to leave the device overnight.  If so, make sure it is plugged in.  Delete the system, then restore it from the backup. </li><li>  Go to Settings&gt; General&gt; Reset&gt; Erase All Content and Settings. </li><li>  After erasing the data, restore it from the backup. </li><li>  When the device reboots after erasing, the assistant launches, which guides the user through the necessary stages of legalization. </li></ol><h2>  Device backup </h2><p>  Users can back up their device using iTunes or iMazing, after making sure encryption is enabled.  Backup features are free on iMazing, and encryption is fully supported on Windows.  iMazing can add a backup password in Windows Credential Manager so that the user does not accidentally lose the password.  To try iMazing, first download and install it, then perform sequential operations: </p><ol><li>  Launch the application and connect it to a Mac or PC, the application will appear on the iPhone or iPad. </li><li>  Select it in the left side panel and click the "Back" button, the Backup Options wizard will open. </li><li>  Enable Backup Encryption, and iMazing will take care of saving the password in the key fob or Windows credentials if the option "Remember password" is selected. </li><li>  Next, perform a backup of the device. </li></ol><h2>  Delete account </h2><div class="photo" data-original="9to5mac.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Delete account" class="if uuid-2863478" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2863478.jpg"></div><p>  If the user has several accounts, he may need to delete some iCloud account associated with the iPhone or iPad in order to change it to another account and get a new ‚ÄúIkloud‚Äù in the ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù.  This process can be difficult if you forget your password. </p><p>  To do this, you will need to do the following: </p><ol><li>  Go to Settings on the device - General, and then About to confirm the system settings. </li><li>  Go to iCloud Settings and then ‚ÄúFind My iPhone‚Äù.
