Sewing ribbons for beginners, the master class of which will be discussed in this article, is a rather fascinating occupation.  In the Middle Ages in Byzantium invented all <span>kinds of embroidery</span> ribbons.  But this type of art received a real impetus during the reign of the French kings.  Using tapes from various materials, you can create things that will always be above fashion.  At present, embroidery with ribbons for beginners, the master class of which can be simpler or more difficult, is finding more and more of its adherents among needlewomen. </p><h2>  Where ribbon embroidery is used </h2><p>  Embroidery using ribbons was most often used to decorate clothes.  But today, when this kind of art received a rebirth, it was not only blouses and dresses that began to decorate with ribbons, but also various accessories, such as belts, bags and even jewelry. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="embroidery ribbons for beginners master class" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30716/741491.jpg" width="600"></div>  But that is not all.  Plots embroidered with ribbons on caskets, cosmetic bags and other small items that women love to use so much when storing on their dressing tables look wonderful.

    <h2>  What you need to get started </h2><p>  If you decide to master <span>embroidery with ribbons</span> for beginners, a master class will require the presence of some materials and tools.  First of all, you need to decide on the fabric on which you will embroider.  It can be cotton, linen, wool or even <span>silk.</span>  The main condition that must be observed when choosing the basis for embroidery is that the material should be dense, but at the same time it is easy to pass a needle with a ribbon through it.  Pick a needle so that its eye is wide and the end sharp.  You will also need a hoop or frame, the size of which will depend on the size of your work.  Naturally, the ribbons themselves will be needed.  They can be satin or silk and have different widths.  Also get floss thread, scissors and a water soluble marker.  The latter will be needed to transfer the pattern to the fabric.  Remember that, when studying the embroidery with ribbons for beginners (master class) step by step, you need to work through these steps immediately.  Then to master this kind of needlework is not difficult for you. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Embroidery ribbons for beginners.  Master class "Flowers" </h2><p>  Most often, <span>flowers are embroidered with ribbons.</span>  They look equally beautiful both on clothes or accessories, as well as on interior items.  Such things look very gentle and feminine.  There are several basic techniques that are used in almost all works.  Also, based on them, certain elements are created.  Then these elements are assembled into more complex compositions. </p><h2>  Seam "straight stitch" </h2><p>  The simplest of all existing methods of ribbon embroidery is a straight stitch.  It is performed very simply.  The needle is withdrawn from the inside out at one point and inserted at another.  The needle insertion point is located from the first point at a distance equal to the length of the element that must be performed.  After the needle is removed, the tape should be leveled and pulled to the wrong side until a stitch is formed.  With this seam, buds of various colors are very well created.  But it can also be used for petals or leaves.  Here a lot will depend on the width of the ribbons used and the length of the stitch. </p><h2>  Stitch seam </h2><p>  The next stitch is a stitched seam.  Withdraw the needle with the ribbon from the inside out at one point, then stick it into another, located on the same line as the previous one, and withdraw again at the starting point.  Then stick the needle in the third point and withdraw to the second.  All points must be on the same line and at the same distance.  It is important to ensure that the tape does not twist.  It is on how it lies, and the final <span>look of the stitch</span> and, accordingly, the whole picture will depend on it.  Such a seam is often used to make plant stems or tree branches. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sew "Leisi Daisy" </h2><p>  The suture ‚Äúleisi daisy‚Äù is also called the attached loop.  Remove the needle with the tape from point A, form a loop from the tape and, holding it with your finger, enter the needle at point B, which is located next to point A. Now, again bring the needle out at point C, which is located at the top of the loop on the inside. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="embroidery ribbons for beginners master class step by step" class="if" height="285" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30716/741488.jpg" width="285"></div>  Grab the top of the ribbon loop and pull the needle inside out.  This way you attach the loop to the base.  Based on this seam, many different elements can be made.  Including a chain consisting of loops coming out of one another.  This seam is also used for buds or petals.

    <h2>  French knot </h2><p>  To complete the <span>‚ÄúFrench knot‚Äù</span> seam <span>,</span> you need to bring the needle out, leaving the wrong side of the tape about a centimeter long.  Pull the tape slightly and wrap around the needle twice. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="embroidery ribbons for beginners master class flowers" class="if" height="285" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30716/741489.jpg" width="285"></div>  Now insert the needle at a distance of about two millimeters from where it was pulled out.  Do not tighten the tape too tight, as the knot should turn out to be voluminous.  Such nodules are often used to make the middle of flowers or as part of other elements, as well as to depict too small vegetation in the picture.

    <h2>  Ribbon Poppies </h2><p>  Studying embroidery ribbons for beginners, the master class "Poppies" can not be left undeveloped.  To create a poppy, sew a piece of tape along the edge and collect it.  The assembled ribbon is laid out in a circle, forming <span>a poppy flower.</span>  The center of the flower is made using French knots and beads. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="embroidery ribbons for beginners master class maki" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30716/741492.jpg" width="525"></div>  Stalks of poppies should be performed using a stalk seam.  The size of the poppy flower can be changed if you use ribbons of different widths.  There is another option for creating poppy petals.  They can be cut according to the pattern.  Each petal is cut from a ribbon.  The edges are seared with a candle.  And then sew all the petals, stacking them in the correct order.  Poppy buds are created using straight stitches, and their size is controlled by the width of the ribbons used.

    <h2>  Embroidery ribbons for beginners.  Master class "Daisies" </h2><p>  Chamomile ribbons can be embroidered using two different stitches to make their petals.  For larger flowers, the ‚ÄúLeisi Daisy‚Äù stitch is used, and the petals of those instances that are smaller are sewn with a straight stitch. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="embroidery ribbons for beginners daisy master class" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30716/741493.jpg" width="483"></div>  The middle of daisies, as a rule, are made by small French knots.  For petals, tapes are used wider, and for the middle, it is better to take tapes as thin as possible.

    <h2>  Roses from ribbons </h2><p>  The next lesson, which is worth considering when studying embroidery with ribbons for beginners, is a master class "Roses".  These are some of the most beautiful flowers.  Consider the simplest option for creating roses using embroidery ribbons.  Mark the point from which to sew five straight seams in different directions with a thin tape. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="embroidery ribbons for beginners master class roses" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30716/741494.jpg" width="500"></div>  Then insert the tape wider into the needle and, twisting it, pull through the seams in a checkerboard pattern.  This is done in a circle until the length of the straight stitches is completed.  In order for the flower to be uniform, the auxiliary stitches must be equal in size.  In such a flower, fill the middle using a suitable bead.  There are more complex ways to make roses, when each petal is laid out separately.  And its center is formed separately and then sewn between the petals.  Such a flower looks more natural.

    <h2>  Sewing ribbons of lilies </h2><p>  In this article, we will consider another lesson, completing the study of embroidery with ribbons for beginners - a master class "Lilies".  To create such a flower, use seams, which are based on a straight seam.  They are called ‚Äúcurl stitch‚Äù and ‚Äúcurved stitch‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="embroidery ribbons for beginners master class lilies" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30716/741495.jpg" width="503"></div>  The first option is the same as a straight stitch, but only the needle is pierced through the tape before being turned inside out.  This is done in the center or on one side.  And in the second version, the tape is wrapped, and the needle is inserted not on the same line with the starting point, but away from this conditional line.  To make middles in such colors, you can use French knots or artificial stamens.  Leaves are made with wider ribbons, but often in the same way.  The size of the flower is created, as a rule, by adjusting the length and bends of the petals.

    <p>  Sewing ribbons for beginners, the master class of which in different versions was considered in this article, is not such a difficult task.  Choose inexpensive materials, as well as the simplest schemes for training.  Mark the canvas first with a fading or water-soluble marker.  Do not be afraid to use additional materials to decorate embroidery, and you will surely have your own unique plot, which will successfully transform into a fashionable wardrobe item or an interesting accessory. </p>
