  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The history of the Tajik people from antiquity to the present day</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Since ancient times, where the territory of Tajikistan is now located, one of the most ancient peoples of the world lived, which is now universally called Tajiks.  However, despite such a long history of this people, now a very small number of people not only in the world, but also in Russia perceive the ancient history and culture of the Tajik people.  In particular, this was due to the huge number of labor migrants who came to earn money.  It was they who removed that halo of mystery from the ancient people.  This article will reveal the origin of the Tajik people, as well as its formation to date. </p><h2>  Neolithic Age </h2><p>  In 1980, excavations were conducted in the Kulyab region.  It was they who gave the world the knowledge that the ancient history of Tajiks begins in the Neolithic era, which was about 500 thousand years ago.  Then in this area lived one of the first primitive people.  Gradually, they began to populate the highlands, including <span>the Pamir mountains.</span>  Unique cave paintings from the early Neolithic period were found here - more often the images show fragments of hunting, since people in these places were mostly wandering hunters. </p><p>  However, in addition to the hunters themselves, tribes belonging to the Hissar culture lived on the territory of modern Tajikistan.  Their main activity was cattle breeding, although they did not disdain agriculture.  During the Bronze Age, they left numerous evidence of their existence, leaving objects of pottery, metallurgy and mining in the north of the country. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the south, the history of the Tajik people is connected with agriculture and the manufacture of beautiful works of art from ceramics. </p><h2>  Bactria and Sogd </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.centralasia-adventures.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ancient picture" class="if uuid-2666550" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46104/2666550.jpg"></div><p>  It was two tribes - Bactrians and Sogdians - that over time turned into citizens of Tajikistan, which exist at the moment.  Their history begins in the 1st millennium BC, when two large states with a slaveholding form of government were formed.  They were called Bactria and Sogd.  However, the cities themselves were rather weak, and therefore could not resist the invasion of one people - the Persians, led by the great conquering king Cyrus, completely subjugated this people.  So Tajikistan entered the vast Persian empire, which subjugated vast territories. </p><p>  However, even the great people of the Persians could not hold it for a long time.  In the next century, the greatest conqueror of all time appeared - Alexander the Great.  The Macedonian king simply crushed the majestic Persian empire, and therefore the territory where the Tajik people lived became a part of his kingdom.  After his death, she passed on to the heirs - the Seleucids. </p><h2>  Tohara </h2><p>  The heirs of Alexander, unfortunately, did not possess his military genius, and therefore simply could not fully maintain his empire.  The king‚Äôs generals tore it in pieces.  The Greco-Bactrian kingdom was also separated.  However, the power of the Macedonians was completely removed from the state after the people of the country rebelled against the invaders.  The Tohara tribe had a considerable influence here, which not only had a huge impact on the culture of the Tajik people, but also on its political life.  Over time, the Tochars became so organically integrated into the ordinary people that they became an essential part of the Tajik nationality that began the process of its formation.  The new state changed its name - instead of Bactria, it became known as Tokharistan.  This happened already in the 4th century AD, so the development process took quite a long time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Empire Kushanov </h2><p>  In the 4th century, most of Asia, which belongs to modern Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Northern India, belonged to a huge empire ruled by the Kushan dynasty.  The full development of the history of the Tajik people can begin precisely from this period.  It was then that the true prosperity of the economy and culture for this country began.  Several monuments of culture and history of that period have survived to this day, which fully reflect the amazing merger of Hellenistic, Indian and Central Asian art.  However, even in this form, this people could not remain under one rule for a long time - the period of steppe nomadic tribes began.  Already in the 6th century, the territory of the country was ruled by the Turkic Kaganate. </p><h2>  Arab caliphate </h2><p>  Gradually, in the 5-6 centuries, the history of the Tajik people began to go into the field of feudalization.  The period of feudal relations itself lasted almost until the end of the 19th century, although it was constantly changing.  The biggest economic recovery began just before the start of the Arab conquests, which caused a great stratification between social groups.  In addition, the development of culture began.  Penjikent can be safely called one of the examples of the culture of the early Middle Ages that exist on the territory of Central Asia - its frescoes, as well as structures speak of an unprecedentedly high cultural level, as well as the presence of great achievements in the field of architecture and art. </p><p>  However, the country simply could not exist on its own.  Although the people showed considerable resistance to Arab expansion, over time, Tajikistan became part of the Arab Caliphate.  The conquerors, constantly fighting the rebellious people, practically destroyed its culture and cities, and also imposed huge taxes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Samanids </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.eupedia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tajik people" class="if uuid-2666533" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46104/2666533.jpg"></div><p>  The process of ending the formation of the Tajik people ended when Tajikistan was part of the Samanid state.  It was during this period that 2 cities - Samarkand and Bukhara, which became famous as the greatest centers of culture and science, began to take first place.  An important role for the history of the Tajik people was played by the fact that the West Iranian Tajik language became dominant, crowding out all the others.  This allowed the active development of Tajik history, culture and art.  Unfortunately, this led to the fact that the people living near the Pamirs took a slightly different path, since it was geographically quite isolated.  It began to take shape their own ethnic formations with a distinctive culture. </p><h2>  The first of the rulers </h2><p>  It is Samani that can be considered the greatest emir from the Samanid dynasty, because he became the founder of the state.  Although most of its history lies precisely on the territory of modern Uzbekistan, in Tajikistan it is very revered.  In addition to numerous monuments, the Tajiks themselves recognize him as their first ruler.  At the moment, a banknote with its image of 100 somoni is used in everyday life.  In 1999, the country celebrated the 1100th anniversary of the Samanid state, where an architectural ensemble was erected in honor of Ismail Samani. </p><h2>  Conquest period </h2><p>  The next few centuries, the territory of modern Tajikistan passed from one state to another, it was constantly conquered.  All this did not allow Tajikistan to establish itself on the world map, to become an independent country.  And in the 13th century, in addition, the invasion of the troops of the commander Genghis Khan began.  Despite the fact that there was strong resistance against him, the conqueror was able to subjugate Central Asia, but this was accompanied by blood, as well as destruction.  After that, the country became part of the Chagatai ulus of the vast Mongol empire. </p><p>  An important event occurred for the Tajik people during the conquest.  T√ºrks and Mongols began to penetrate into their ethnic group, which led to the fact that Turkization began to occur in the plains peoples, which to a lesser extent penetrated the hill tribes and the cities. </p><h2>  Khanate period </h2><div class="photo" data-original="english.ts.cn" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="National instruments" class="if uuid-2666549" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46104/2666549.jpg"></div><p>  After the death of Genghis Khan, the <span>territory of Tajikistan</span> began to be thrown again, but only between the khanates.  In the 14th century, it became part of the state of Timur, and later its heirs.  During this period, the development of science and art, in particular astronomy and literature.  However, after two centuries, they passed under the auspices of the Uzbek khans, who constantly formed new khanates.  Basically, the Tajiks divided among themselves the Bukhara and Kokand khanates.  But this does not mean at all that the people began to live in peace - the political situation itself was constantly in a state of martial law.  External and internal wars for power led to the decline of agriculture, exploitation of people and destruction.  During this period, feudal dependence simply flourished - because of huge taxes, the people went in constant debt to their feudal lord, and therefore had to perform forced labor.  Culture, art, Tajik art word and language - everything was in an unprecedented decline. </p><h2>  Joining Russia </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.taghribnews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nowruz ceremony" class="if uuid-2666559" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46104/2666559.jpg"></div><p>  A new round of development of the people began only in 1868.  Constantly in need of new sales markets, the Russian Empire, struggling with England, accelerated the annexation of Central Asia to itself.  Almost the entire emirate became part of the Turkestan governor-general, which automatically deprived itself of the opportunity to conduct independent trade and diplomatic relations with other countries.  <span>The Bukhara emirate</span> became a vassal territory of Russia, and later the northern part of modern Tajikistan was annexed to it in 1976.  Gradually, the border was drawn between Tajikistan and Afghanistan, which were divided between England and the Russian Empire. </p><p>  One cannot but admit that during this period the Tajiks were under double oppression, both of their rulers and of Russian emperors.  That is why there were a huge number of popular uprisings that tried to overthrow the exploiters.  However, joining Russia had its own bright moments.  The first thing that ended was the internecine wars, and gradually capitalism began to penetrate the country.  Tajiks gradually joined the Russian people, a mixture of Russian and Tajik words took place, and a working class began to form. </p><h2>  Red revolution </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.womenofchina.cn" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rite of greeting" class="if uuid-2666555" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46104/2666555.jpg"></div><p>  After the overthrow of the empire in Russia, a period of civil war began between the Reds and the Whites.  The revolution came to Bukhara precisely with the Reds, and therefore already in 1920 the Bukhara People's Soviet Republic was formed.  True, it did not exist for long, and the Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was created as part of the Uzbek SSR in 1924.  Initially, it included 12 volosts, which captured Turkestan, the eastern part of Bukhara and part of the Pamirs.  However, since the Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was considered subordinate, the main political centers remained part of Uzbekistan.  Only in 1929, this republic was given the opportunity to become independent and began to be governed by the all-Union model.  But at the same time, the traditions of numerous ethnic groups simply began to be ignored, which led to the loss of many cultural values.  After that, until 1991, the country remained under the authority of the USSR, but also completely became independent from the Uzbek SSR. </p><h2>  Culture </h2><p>  Despite the fact that during the Soviet period, Tajikistan had several prominent writers and scholars, none of them became as famous as Sadriddin Aini.  It was this man who became the founder of Tajik Soviet literature, as well as a prominent public figure and scientist.  In addition to compiling several books on the history of Central Asia, he helped create the Samarkand State University.  It was Sadriddin Aini who was honored to be called the first president of the Academy of Sciences of the Tajik SSR, and also to be among the deputies of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.  As you can see, he left his mark not only in the culture of the country, but also in its politics. </p><h2>  The collapse of the USSR </h2><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tajik girls" class="if uuid-2666564" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46104/2666564.jpg"></div><p>  Tajikistan appeared on the world map as an independent state quite late.  The first step towards independence was the option of a declaration of the government of the country, which was invented by the deputies, but at the same time formulated quite vaguely. </p><p>  The second step in the struggle for independence was not taken at all by the government, but by the Rastokhez movement, which members sent to the press for review.  They wrote a different version of the declaration, because they believed that <span>Tajik citizens</span> simply could not be satisfied with a government document that contained numerous ambiguities.  In addition to the text itself, they posted critical comments.  They proposed to use the second version of the declaration as a basis for the new Constitution, and therefore the text was very large and contained more than 20 points that related not only to independence, but also to the state structure and branches of power in the country. </p><p>  He declared one of the last republics his sovereignty, since only on August 24, 1990 the declaration itself was adopted.  The final text contained excerpts from both documents. </p><p>  Tajikistan became fully independent only on September 9, 1991, when the decree "On State Independence of the Republic of Tajikistan" was adopted.  At the moment, it is customary to celebrate the Independence Day of the Republic of Tajikistan on September 9, which is considered officially a non-working day. </p><h2>  Civil War </h2><p>  The first year after independence was declared, it seemed that Tajikistan and its people were gaining momentum.  The entry into the CIS and the UN confirms the fact that the country began to be accepted on the international stage, but the Civil War of 1992-1997 put an end to this.  At its core, it became an intra-ethnic conflict that developed between supporters of the central government and the opposition, uniting different groups.  It is impossible not to recognize the fact that the start of the war was largely laid by the clan worldview of the people themselves - Tajiks, as well as their attitude to religion.  All this was superimposed on the difficult economic situation in the country.  After everything was mixed, there was an explosion - the Civil War.  And the riots in Dushanbe in 1990 only aggravated the situation.  The most fierce battles occurred only in the first year after the outbreak of war - during this period the country was simply split into 2 parts, however, it was completely stopped only in 1997 with the mediation of the United Nations. </p><h2>  Present day </h2><div class="photo" data-original="life.ansor.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="National dance" class="if uuid-2666557" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46104/2666557.jpg"></div><p>  Despite the fact that the Tajik SSR was recognized as one of the smallest and undeveloped, now the republic is considered a completely independent state.  Unfortunately, the country's territory is separated by mountains, which in many respects impedes international trade.  However, despite this, Tajiks have a rich history, considering themselves descendants of the Persians, which in general does not contradict history, since the settlement of the country's territory began precisely with the territory of Ancient Persia. </p><p>  Tajiks are the dominant nation in the country, almost 85% of all residents belong to this ethnic group.  In fact, a country that has been under the rule of other nations for so long has even been at the first stages of its development.  A small degree of urbanization, constant problems with water supply and electricity, constant migration - all this significantly undermines the country.  The indigenous population practically cannot find work, which leads to the fact that young and healthy people leave their region and go to work, often completely illegally.  However, given the fact that the Republic of Tajikistan appeared on the political map only in 1991, it achieved very great success with a small amount of resources. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  As you can see, the Tajik people have a history from ancient times, and therefore it is impossible to completely trace its movements.  Answering the question about how many Tajiks currently live in the world, scientists call the minimum figure of 20 million people, including the Iranian people who speak different dialects related to Persian-Tajik.  They not only inhabit Tajikistan directly, but also a small part of Afghanistan.  They have an independent culture, culinary traditions and many other attributes.  At present, about half a million Tajiks who live in the country illegally, live and work in Russia, although this figure is gradually decreasing. </p><p>  But, despite the current political and migration situation, it is impossible not to admit that this people has a distinctive identity.  Although for many years it was subordinate to other states, it was constantly transferred from empire to empire, but the population survived, preserved cultural monuments and is rightfully considered one of the most ancient nationalities in the world, leading its history back to primitive tribes.  Tajiks are now a large nation, bright enough to attract attention, but not yet developed enough to occupy a significant place in politics and interstate trade. </p>
