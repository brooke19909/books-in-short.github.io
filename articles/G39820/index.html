    <h2>  Price policy </h2><p>  A huge number of accommodation options can offer visitors to the capital of the hotel in Moscow.  Prices for accommodation in them range from quite small amounts (about 1000-1500 rubles) to impressive numbers, which contain five or more zeros.  This indicator may depend on many factors.  The first is, of course, the status and level of service, as well as the availability of accreditation (stardom).  In addition, an important indicator is the area in which certain Moscow hotels are located.  Prices in the central part of the city can be quite high even if the institution does not differ in high rates of service.  Also, the cost may be affected by the availability of related services. </p><p>  The cost of living at the Hilton Moscow Leningradskaya can also vary depending on several factors.  So, for example, during the holidays, as well as during the holidays and in the warm season (tourist period), prices will be the highest.  Also, rates can take off if the hotel has too few guests.  On average, accommodation in this hotel will cost from 7,000 to 200,000 rubles per night (depending on the category of apartments). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the Hilton Hotel (Moscow) has a rather high status, there are some shortcomings in its work.  They are fully reflected in negative reviews and customer comments: </p><ul><li>  even if at the time of booking you indicate that the room is for two guests, you will still be put only one set of slippers and a bathrobe (you will have to ask for additional ones yourself); </li><li>  <span>the shaving machine,</span> which is included in the set of free hygiene products, is simply disgusting: it does not cope with bristles and leaves terrible irritation; </li><li>  in the bathroom of some apartments in the Hilton Moscow Leningradskaya hotel there is a stale unpleasant odor (apparently, there are problems with sewage or ventilation); </li><li>  sometimes there is confusion with the rooms (they may not be accommodated in the apartments that were originally booked); </li><li>  the cost of dishes in the Hilton hotel restaurant is too high compared to other similar establishments; </li><li>  despite the fact that, on the whole, the hotel staff is qualified and polite, for some reason the spa staff sometimes behaves defiantly and inappropriately; </li><li>  there are serious problems with the pressure of water on the upper floors (this is unacceptable for a hotel of this level, and it is also worth bearing in mind the fact that the most expensive apartments are located at the top); </li><li>  in many rooms the windows are very dirty, and since the main feature of the hotel can be considered a beautiful view from the window, this drawback is striking even more; </li><li>  despite the fact that the reception is open around the clock, it is almost impossible to get through to it in the evening and at night (employees do not explain the reasons); </li><li>  the elevator is very slow, making the trip to the upper floors seem endless; </li><li>  if you want to order food in your room, then you have to go down to the restaurant. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  If you need a chic hotel room in Moscow, then Hilton is just the perfect solution.  Here, a high level of service is combined with an elegant interior, and an extremely advantageous location will be a nice addition. </p>
