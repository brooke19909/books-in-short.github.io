Overview and Characteristics of iPad Models</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Tablet technology is constantly evolving and improving.  This process is continuous.  It can be traced on the example of the iPad range.  This is the name of the gadgets produced by the American company Aplle.  The devices of this brand are equipped with the most modern accessories and the latest features.  Many experts believe that iPad in the near future will completely replace conventional desktop computers from the market.  After all, modern tablets surpass them in terms of ease of use and mobility. </p><p>  The iPad is the most popular tablet in the world.  The first prototype of this gadget appeared in 2000. But soon the "apple" company focused its efforts on developing a new phone.  The success of iPhones has allowed the corporation to return to the development of the tablet.  Every year, the company introduces new device models.  Often, the appearance of the gadget remains the same, only the functions and "internals" of the device change. </p><h2>  The first iPad 1 </h2><p>  For the first time, Aplle's <span>tablet model was</span> introduced in San Francisco.  The iPad with a screen diagonal of 10 inches was launched for sale in New York in 2010. Cheap iPads in Moscow could be purchased only after a year.  The novelty has become a revolutionary device for its time.  In the first month, more than 1 million tablets were sold.  Over the year, the corporation sold 7 million devices.  Due to the high demand for a tablet in the USA, the company had to postpone the start of sales in other countries. </p><p>  The advantages of this model include IPS-display, a powerful processor, 64 GB of internal memory, high speed.  The silver case of the device had distinct side walls.  The front panel was painted black.  It housed stylish buttons for switching the volume and screen lock. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first model is the heaviest in the line of iPads.  It was an experiment, so its creators could not avoid the shortcomings.  Among the minuses of the tablet, users called short battery life.  The operating system and huge screen required a more capacious battery.  The gadget was not thin enough and had no camera. </p><p>  The first model was the cheapest iPad. </p><h2>  Second iPad 2 </h2><div class="photo" data-original="999.md" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iPad 2" class="if uuid-2624556" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88575/2624556.jpg"></div><p>  Another model was released in 2011. How much does iPad 2 cost?  The tablet could be purchased for $ 299.  The iPad model again broke sales records.  Speculators sold the place in lines.  The device received a reduced body with a rounded frame.  The speaker was moved to the back of the tablet.  The manufacturer increased the RAM of the device to 512 MB.  The model was equipped with a dual-core processor and two cameras.  The front panel is made in two colors: black and white. </p><p>  Updates have made the device even more popular.  This model has long been the most common on the market.  Many gadget lovers were worried about how much iPad 2 costs. The second option was successfully sold for four years.  For a long time, this model was the cheapest iPad. </p><h2>  Third ipad </h2><div class="photo" data-original="999.md" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iPad 3" class="if uuid-2624559" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88575/2624559.jpg"></div><p>  A year later, the "apple" company updated its lineup.  The third model was released a few months after the death of the founder of the company - Steve Jobs.  The iPad is slightly thicker, the width of the charging connector has increased.  The disadvantages of the model include the rapid heating of the device during operation.  The device received a more capacious battery, a clear Retina-screen, 1 GB of RAM and an improved camera. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The innovations include the ability to recognize faces when shooting videos and the emergence of a voice assistant.  By the size of the lens on the cover, you can distinguish the third iPad model from others.

According to the technical specifications, these devices were a copy of the iPad 2. At the same time, it had a Lightning connector, a modern camera and supported 4G.  The buttons on the device are made of metal.  The model received an additional bluish-gray color.  The disadvantage of the tablet users attributed to the trimmed screen frame, its poor resolution and low battery capacity.  The volume keys are made as separate buttons. </p><h2>  iPad Air </h2><p>  The manufacturer refused the serial numbering of the device.  The word Air ("air") in the name symbolizes the ease of the device.  The weight of the tablet was reduced by 200 g compared to the first iPad.  It is convenient to hold it even in one hand.  The device was positioned as the best tool for the designer.  Apple tried to combine the large screen and compact size of the device.  For this, the thickness of the frames of the device was reduced.  The model is considered the thinnest tablet in the world.  In appearance, it resembled an enlarged copy of the iPad mini.  At the bottom of the gadget, stereo speakers appeared. </p><h2>  Updated iPad mini 2 </h2><p>  The second model of the reduced iPad outwardly practically did not differ from the first.  The device received a new Retina-screen with improved resolution and a more capacious battery. </p><h2>  iPad Air 2 </h2><p>  The next gadget was released in 2014. The model received a fingerprint sensor, 2 GB of RAM, a new 8 megapixel camera and a thinner body.  The design of the speakers has been changed.  The model was available in three color options.  The disadvantages of the device include vibration when listening to music at maximum volume. </p><h2>  Superior iPad mini 3 </h2><p>  The third model of the mini-tablet was released a year after the second.  By technical characteristics, the device was not much different from the previous mini-tablet.  The model received a more powerful processor and an updated Home button.  The device received an additional gold color option. </p><h2>  New iPad Pro 12.9 </h2><p>  The name of the tablet was given in honor of the new screen with a diagonal of 12, 9 inches.  The company for the first time increased the <span>diagonal of the tablet.</span>  The screen received the maximum resolution.  The device is equipped with four speakers.  On the left side of the tablet is a special port for connecting a keyboard.  The iPad has received 4 GB of RAM and a powerful processor.  This model could already replace a regular computer.  The user can use the stylus and run two applications at the same time. </p><h2>  Refined iPad mini 4 </h2><p>  The thickness of the tablet was reduced to 6.1 mm.  The model is much longer than its predecessor.  The orientation key has disappeared from the device.  The amount of RAM has doubled.  The model received an improved graphics processor and an 8 megapixel camera.  The amount of memory increased to 256 GB.  Also, the device received new accessories: a stylus and a keyboard. </p><h2>  Cheapest iPad </h2><div class="photo" data-original="history.eis.net.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iPad 4" class="if uuid-2624565" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88575/2624565.jpg"></div><p>  iPad Pro 9.7 received a matrix with improved color reproduction.
