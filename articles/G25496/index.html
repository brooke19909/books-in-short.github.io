Bogdan Kobulov was a security officer, as they say, to the very bone marrow.  It is noteworthy that for his merits in his work he was awarded a whole series of medals and orders.  However, then the court will take away all the awards from the security officer, and Bogdan Kobulov himself will be shot for his bloody atrocities.  What was remarkable in his biography?  Let's consider this question in more detail. </p><h2>  Years of childhood and youth </h2><p>  Kobulov Bogdan Zakharovich was born on May 1, 1904 in the capital of Georgia.  His father earned by sewing clothes.  The future security officer, after graduating from high school in 1921, entered the service in the Separate Caucasian Red Army. </p>

    <p>  At that time, he conducted active propaganda of Bolshevism in cavalry brigades.  In addition, Bogdan Kobulov was one of the initiators of the creation of a detachment of 26 Baku commissioners. </p><h2>  Work in the power departments of Georgia </h2><p>  In the period from 1922 to 1926, the young man worked in the Cheka of Georgia.  Then it is transferred to the GPU. </p><p>  In the early 30s, Kobulov Bogdan (nationality - Armenian) already holds senior posts in the secret-political department of the State Political Administration of Georgia.  A few years later he will go on a business trip to Persia.  In 1936, the Chekist‚Äôs career began to develop rapidly: he was entrusted with a leading position in the UNNKVD GSSR.  A year later, Bogdan Kobulov was already acting as assistant to the People's Commissar of Internal Affairs of Georgia, and a few months later he became deputy minister of internal affairs in his homeland. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Top echelons of power </h2><p>  In 1938, Bogdan Zakharovich was transferred to Moscow, to the investigative unit of the NKVD of the USSR.  This was facilitated by Lavrenty Pavlovich himself, who provided Kobulov with serious patronage and assistance in operational work, when he was still an employee of the GPU of Georgia.  Very soon Bogdan Zakharovich became the right hand of Beria: they even worked together on the Yezhov case.  In the late 30s, Kobulov was already at the head of the Investigative Unit of the NKVD of the USSR. </p>

    <h2>  Repression </h2><p>  Shortly before the start of World War II, he was one of those who initiated the reprisal of captured Polish officers.  In total, about 40 thousand people died then. </p><p>  In 1944, Kobulov Bogdan, whose biography is of great interest to historians, participated in the deportation of Soviet peoples, including Kurds, Crimean Tatars, Ingush, Chechens.  At the same time, large-scale genocide was carried out: often people were shot directly at the echelons.  Those few who miraculously survived, the subordinates of Bogdan Zakharovich planted in a clean field without drinking and medicine.  For the eviction of peoples Kobulov was awarded the Order of the Patriotic War of the 1st degree and the <span>Order of Suvorov of the</span> 1st degree. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Another area of ‚Äã‚Äãwork for Beria‚Äôs proteges is attempts to punish Ukrainian nationalists who left for Germany.  In the middle of the war, Bogdan Zakharovich organized the deportation of German prisoners of war from the frontline zone.  His direct leaders in the person of Beria and Stalin, as a rule, did not attract a devoted Chekist to political affairs, giving him orders for public actions of awesome nature. </p><p>  Kobulov personally did not participate in the torture of people serving sentences.  For this, there were specially trained people in his department.  The exception was those who previously held senior positions in the Soviet state. </p><p>  In 1945, he received the post of assistant to the People's Commissar of the USSR State Security.  But a year later, Kobulov was transferred to the Office of Soviet Property Abroad, and in this structure he worked until 1953.  Then the ‚Äúleader of the peoples‚Äù dies, and power in the country passes briefly to Beria, who appoints Bogdan Zakharovich as the first assistant to the Minister of Internal Affairs of the USSR.  But a few months later Lavrenty Pavlovich was arrested.  This fate befell Kobulov. </p>

    <h2>  Execution </h2><p>  He was accused of espionage and sabotage.  However, he did not admit it, refusing to sign typewritten copies of interrogations.  In December 1953, Bogdan Kobulov was shot by court order.  Two years later, the brother of the Chekist Amayak, who was in no way connected with politics, was recognized as a spy and saboteur.  A relative was also shot. </p>
