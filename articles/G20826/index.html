But very rarely the opposite happens. </p><p>  They dig the earth with excavators, hammer the firmament, take out sand until they find it on the aquifer of the soil.  So a new miracle of nature appears - a flooded quarry.  As a rule, the water in such <span>artificial lakes is</span> clean, and the shores are sandy.  Depth?  It depends on the development of a career.  Some time after the miners of sand left with their equipment to look for new reserves, life begins in the lakes.  Fish and crayfish appear, birds flock to the pond. </p><p>  Lake Maluksa, which will be discussed in our article, is just such a former spent quarry.  How to get there?  And is it worth going there to spend the weekend?  Read about it below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Malux lake" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1641615.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where are the careers of Malux </h2><p>  There is more than one lake.  Near the village of Staraya Maluksa, sand-diggers dug several quarries, and almost all of these depressions were filled with water.  This network of artificial lakes has no official name, but locals call them Maluksinsky quarries.  Most of these ponds are very modest in size, except for one.  This lake has several names among the local population. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is called the old quarry due to the fact that for many years it has not functioned as a place for the extraction of sand.  It is called near, because it is located very close to the village.  And finally, the name of the South Quarry Lake Maluks owes its geographical location relative to the center of the village. </p><p>  And where is the village itself located?  Old Maluksa is located in the Kirovsky district of the Leningrad region.  The <span>village is</span> separated from <span>St. Petersburg</span> by 96 kilometers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Malux Lake how to get there" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1641630.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Relaxation </h2><p>  Have you tried swimming in careers?  The authorities do not really encourage such an activity.  After all, as a rule, careers have steep banks, and for inept swimmers, rest can turn into a tragedy.  In addition, in such places no one conducted a water analysis.  Perhaps, in addition to sand, other deposits of minerals: aluminum, iron, were also brought to the surface of the earth.  But did it somehow stop those who like to plunge into the cool waters of the northern lakes? </p><p>  The banks of an abandoned quarry are surrounded by forests, in which there are a lot of berries in the summer, and in the autumn - mushrooms.  Lake Maluks, since it was abandoned by the industrialists before the rest, managed to acquire fish.  So they come here not only for a beach-bathing vacation, but also for the catch.  Of course, in such places there are no bases or boarding houses.  And the nearest housing is available only in the village of Old Maluksa.  But on weekends with a tent you can come here, especially if you are lucky with the weather. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Malux lake" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1641616.jpg" width="600"></div>

Electric trains in the direction of Budgoszcz depart both from Ladoga and from the Moscow railway stations of St. Petersburg.  Exit should be at the station "Old Maluksa".  From the railway platform to the lake you need to walk about ten minutes. </p><p>  Do not want to be connected with the train schedule?  You can visit the lake by car.  But this carries the risk of touching the bottom of the car on some boulder in the final phase of the journey.  But basically the road pleases.  Motorists advise driving along the Kirov highway.  After driving through the district center, you should turn onto the Moscow road and go to Pukholovo.  An excellent asphalt is laid to the village of Petrovo.  Then you will find a very decent primer, which stretches about ten kilometers.  But then the railroad tracks begin.  After moving, the primer disappears and a winding sandy road appears along which dump trucks scurry along (some quarries still work). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Malux lake reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1641617.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Fishing </h2><p>  Swimming, boating - all this is summer fun.  But Lake Malux is glorified among fishermen.  It is best to go here in the fall, not earlier than August for sure.  It is better to fish from a boat.  The best fish is found at a depth closer to the middle of the lake.  Both maggots and wobblers are used as bait.  Zander, pike, lines are found in the lake.  Fishermen also say that perches weighing 800 grams and a lot of bleak came across a hook. </p><h2>  Vacation Reviews </h2><p>  Beautiful nature, rich catch, excellent pine forest, in which there are a lot of mushrooms and berries - this is how tourists and fishermen characterize Lake Maluksa.  Reviews of vacationers assure that the former quarry is filled with so pure water that you can contemplate your feet, standing up to the neck in the water.  For those who are not good at swimming, tourists recommend going from the spit.  This is a small peninsula that cuts into a long lake with a cape. </p><p>  There are downsides to this place.  They concern, first of all, the vacationers themselves.  Unfortunately, not all who come to the shores of Lake Malux are cultural people.  After themselves, such vacationers leave mountains of garbage and bald spots from bonfires.  A lot of complaints about the road.  On weekdays, trolleys with sand rumble along the railroad tracks, and dump trucks sprinkle along the bulky roads. </p>
