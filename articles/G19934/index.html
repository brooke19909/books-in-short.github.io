You won‚Äôt surprise anyone with such devices for a long time.  However, there are currently a lot of mobile operators that provide different conditions.  Thanks to one, you can save on calls, the second offer cheap Internet, and the third - a promotion for using communication in roaming.  To save as much as possible, a phone that works with two SIM cards is not always enough. </p><p>  What solution can be found from this situation?  Purchase two gadgets.  The first, for example, a smartphone will be used to access the Internet and for personal communication, and the second unpretentious - for calls to work. </p><p>  But it is not necessary to surround yourself with a large number of devices.  It is difficult to argue that this is not always convenient.  The only optimal solution will be a phone equipped with three slots for SIM cards.  However, there are pitfalls here.  There are not so many choices in this category. </p><p>  It is simply impossible to find a device that meets all the requirements of the user.  As they say, you have to sacrifice something.  Manufacturers still do not dare to implement this technology in all their models.  Similar devices are found in the lines of BQ, Fly, Sigma, teXet, Philips, Nokia, Explay. </p><p>  The hero of this article was the mobile phone of the latest manufacturer.  Explay Titan 3 SIM went on sale in 2012.  It will not surprise the modern user with the features.  It is a typical button device for making calls.  Does it have any features?  Let's get it together. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="ruarrijoseph.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Manufacturer Explay Titan" class="if uuid-2290726" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2290726.jpg"></div><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  Review Explay Titan start with a complete set.  The packaging of the phone has a fairly stylish design.  The manufacturer has chosen combining colors.  As a basis, a white tone was used, which is quite originally tinted by blue elements of an unusual shape located at the bottom of the box.  On the front panel flaunts the image of the phone.  In the upper left corner are presented three SIM cards that indicate the advanced features of the device.  Next to it is the name of the manufacturer and the model itself.  Not without its advertising slogan, which reads: "A stylish phone with three active SIM cards."  On the side end there is a brief description. </p><p>  The phone is packed in a box.  All necessary documentation is attached to it.  There is also an entry-level headset, battery, interface cable and charger.  It is worth noting that the presence of headphones pleasantly pleased buyers, especially given the low cost of the gadget. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mobilespecs.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Explay Titan Specifications" class="if uuid-2290730" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2290730.jpg"></div><h2>  Appearance Features </h2><p>  Phone Explay Titan looks like most of these mobile devices.  Case type - monoblock.  By its size, the device can be safely attributed to the middle category - 117 √ó 52 √ó 14.3 mm.  It is not very large, but not small, which makes interaction with it quite comfortable.  Users in the reviews say that you can wear it in the pockets of any clothing, be it pants or a shirt.  The mass of the phone (110 g) can hardly be called small, so for some it is still heavy. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  What about the Explay Titan?  It is made of plastic.  Designers have chosen a beautiful color scheme.  There are three options in the line: black with silver, just black, and also black with golden.  The last copy looks pretty - it is moderately strict.  But the model with a silver insert looks more formal.  This option is more to the liking of a strong half of humanity. </p><p>  Now let's figure out the location of the connectors and other elements.  A narrow speaker hole is located above the screen.  It is covered with a metal mesh.  The upper end has become the place where the audio port and the flashlight bulb are displayed.  The side faces are also equipped with functional elements.  On the left side is a USB port.  An elongated shape displays a volume button on the opposite side.  The progress of this key is tight, clear.  When pressed, a characteristic click is heard.  At the bottom there is only a small microphone hole. </p><p>  The back cover is removable.  Most of its surface is flat, and the side faces are streamlined.  At the top is the "window" of the camera.  It protrudes slightly beyond the line of the hull.  A silver rim extending around the perimeter of the lens adds originality.  Below, the manufacturer has posted his company logo.  At the bottom of the lid you can see a narrow hole with an elongated shape.  Behind him is a speaker.  Under this cover is the battery.  Having taken it out, the user gets access to the slots.  There are four of them.  Three of them are used for SIM cards and the remaining for an external drive. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.gsmchoice.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Explay Titan Keyboard" class="if uuid-2290729" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2290729.jpg"></div><h2>  Keyboard </h2><p>  Explay Titan is controlled by a mechanical keyboard.  The button block is located directly below the screen.  The control panel consists of two soft keys, a joystick.  There are also buttons with which a call is received and reset.  They are on the same plate.  Only the joystick can be distinguished by touch, since the remaining keys are devoid of relief.  The center button is programmed in four positions.  Its inner part is deeply recessed inward.  It performs the function of confirmation.  Users in the reviews claim that there are no complaints about the keyboard.  All buttons work clearly, erroneous clicks are excluded.  However, if you carry the phone in a narrow pocket, it often unlocks spontaneously. </p><p>  The digital unit consists of 12 buttons, which are located three on one plate.  The last four.  They are flat, a relief designation is available only near the button "5".  The applied letters and numbers on the keys are black.  The backlight is there, but it is uneven.  The keyboard is convenient to use, as the key travel is clear and moderate. </p><h2>  Screen: specifications and reviews </h2><p>  Continuing to study the characteristics of Explay Titan, we need to talk about the screen.  The manufacturer advertises its model, focusing on a large display.  Indeed, he, as for a device with a mechanical keyboard, is rather big.  The device has a TFT matrix.  Talking about its quality is unnecessary, since many are already familiar with the disadvantages of this technology.  However, on a screen with a diagonal of 2.4 ∫, the image is displayed in pretty good quality.  The maximum resolution is 320 √ó 240 px.  As for the color gamut, the screen is capable of producing only 262 thousand shades. </p><p>  Now consider the reviews about the screen.  Most users believe that the manufacturer installed a low-quality display in the device.  It is not possible to read anything in the sun, as everything fades very much.  Colors are not expressive, brightness and clarity are not enough.  The viewing angles received many comments.  They are very narrow.  The plastic with which the display is protected quickly scratches, which affects the image quality. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.i-dex.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Benefits of Explay Titan" class="if uuid-2290727" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2290727.jpg"></div><h2>  Menu </h2><p>  Explay Titan is not a smartphone, so the operating system is not installed in it.  The user is offered a simple menu.  It is the same as in most similar devices.  The service screen is displayed on the main screen.  On it are signal indicators of each SIM card, battery icon and other symbols indicating missed events.  The shortcuts below are the application shortcuts that you can quickly access.  The user can choose them at his discretion.  The screen also displays the clock and date.  If the device enters standby mode, the current time is displayed on the black splash screen. </p><p>  To enter the menu, use the soft key, which is displayed on the left side.  Applications are displayed as 4 √ó 3 tiles. A symbol is shown below each label.  Use the joystick to turn pages. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gsmchoice.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Features Explay Titan" class="if uuid-2290746" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2290746.jpg"></div><h2>  Phone book </h2><p>  The Explay Titan menu has a phone book.  It is designed for 500 contacts.  You can also optionally use the memory provided by the SIM card.  There are several items in the phonebook menu: groups, all numbers, memory. </p><p>  When creating an entry, the user is prompted to enter the first and last name of the subscriber.  They are entered in one field.  The maximum number of characters is 30. You can also save additional information, for example, specify a fax, email address, home phone number and more.  If desired, an individual melody and picture can be set for the subscriber. </p><p>  Positive reviews noted the presence of a blacklist.  Not all phones have it.  If you enter a specific number in it, then calls will not be made.  Find an entry in the phone book is not difficult.  The search is carried out by the initial letters. </p><h2>  Call log </h2><p>  For the convenience of working with Explay Titan, a call log is provided in the menu.  You can enter it by pressing the call reception key.  In total, this item has three tabs: dialed, missed, and received.  You can also display information in a general list. </p><p>  For all SIM cards, the magazine is shared.  The screen displays the number, subscriber name and time of the call.  There is also a special designation indicating which or from which SIM card the call was made.  However, most users find this icon useless.  The fact is that it is very difficult to notice. </p><p>  To make a call, you will need to select one of the SIM cards.  But you can answer with any key. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.themodernman.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Firmware Explay Titan" class="if uuid-2290731" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2290731.jpg"></div><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  Now let's talk about the features of Explay Titan.  It consists in supporting three SIM cards.  This is the main advantage of the device.  The developers have provided the possibility of assigning a name to each of them.  You can also set specific functions.  For example, from the first to make calls, through the second to connect to the Internet, and from the third to send notifications.  This is what will help to save as much as possible on cellular communication. </p><p>  Now we need to talk about the shortcomings.  They include the fact that the phone has only one radio module.  What does this mean and how is it displayed at work?  Even with the fact that three SIM cards are installed in the device, only one will be in the active state.  The rest are automatically blocked during a conversation. </p><h2>  Battery specifications </h2><p>  Which element in the mobile phone are considered to be the main ones?  Of course, the battery.  Explay Titan has a lithium-ion battery.  Its capacity is 1 thousand mAh.  Let's get acquainted with the characteristics that the manufacturer provides.  The device is fully charged with standby time is able to work up to 150 hours.  You can talk on it continuously for no more than 5 hours, after which the phone will have to be connected to the network. </p><p>  Now let's see what users say about the battery life.  In Explay Titan, the battery is not very powerful, but with an average load, you need to charge the phone no more than after 2-3 days.  Music lovers can count on 15 hours, but only subject to the use of headphones. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  In this model, a camera is installed.  Its capabilities are limited by a 1.3 megapixel module.  The maximum resolution is VGA.  To activate the viewfinder, you have to go to the menu.  A standalone button is not provided.  Shooting is done through the center key.  In the menu, you can change the quality of photos, setting normal, high or low.  In practice, this does not help much.  Pictures are still blurry and dull.  Many users do not want to evaluate the capabilities of the camera, since there is no particular sense from it. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  Specifications Explay Titan is rather mediocre.  The memory in the phone is very small - only 16 MB.  But the developers have provided a way to increase storage.  We are talking about using drives with a capacity of 16 GB.  In the reviews, users pay attention that the phone works well with such memory cards.  Recognition is fast and, most importantly, correct.  No freezes and malfunctions were noticed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lg.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Explay Titan Features" class="if uuid-2290732" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2290732.jpg"></div><h2>  How to flash Explay Titan? </h2><p>  It happens that over time, the phone malfunctions.  As a rule, they do not indicate any damage.  Advanced users recommend fixing problems in the system by simply changing the firmware.  This can be done both independently, but this is associated with certain risks, and in the service center.  Using the services of professionals, you have to shell out.  Those who do not have the funds, you can try to take a chance.
