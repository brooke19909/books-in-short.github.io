    <p>  If you think that chemical compounds such as nitrates have nothing to do with your life, then you are deeply mistaken.  They come into close contact with almost all branches of the national economy and industry, and it is simply impossible not to know about them.  Aluminum nitrate in its composition is an <span>inorganic compound of</span> white or color.  It may also be colorless.  By chemical composition, aluminum nitrate is an aluminum salt of <span>nitric acid,</span> that is, it is aluminum compounds that react with acids under the influence of certain reagents.  Aluminum has basic and anhydrous nitrates, although the scope of both of them is almost the same. </p><p>  Anhydrous aluminum nitrate is hygroscopic, it has a unique ability to absorb water vapor from the air.  Moreover, the substance itself is crystalline in shape and smokes in air.  In addition, aluminum nitrate is very soluble in water and in polar solvents of an organic nature.  Another distinguishing feature of this substance is that it is a very strong oxidizing agent.  Its anhydrous form reacts with a wide variety of organic solvents.  An aqueous solution of aluminum nitrate is obtained by dissolving aluminum in nitric acid using laboratory methods. </p><p>  The main field of application of aluminum nitrate in the modern world is the textile industry.  Since the density of aluminum is relatively low, the composition based on this substance processes the surface of the tissues.  This is done before staining.  In this case, aluminum nitrate is the best way to pickle any textile material.  That is why this substance is so familiar to us all. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition, aluminum nitrate is widely used in the oil refining industry, in particular, for the production of basic fuels and lubricants.  So, the substance serves as a catalyst for the process of refining oil from unwanted impurities.  Another unique property of aluminum nitrate is its ability to protect various surfaces from corrosion.  After all, an aggressively tuned environment will not allow one or another metal product to exist quietly.  Many formulations based on this substance are very popular in their field. </p><p>  Aluminum nitrate is also found in several other industries.  It is used for the manufacture of molding compounds, insulating paper, when creating heating elements, for the formation of special incandescent filaments.  A special place is aluminum nitrate in nuclear physics.  But this is a completely different topic, because there we will have to examine in more detail the chemical formula of this element and the changes that will occur in it under the influence of certain reagents. </p><p>  It is worth noting another interesting property of aluminum.  The fact is that in all compositions that contain its elements, any one percent acid is necessarily added.  This is due to the fact that improper storage of the mixture can lead to the start of the spontaneous combustion process, and this is fraught with serious consequences.  In a slightly acidic solution, such a reaction cannot occur, but alkalis instantly activate this action. </p><p>  Do not forget about safety when working with aluminum - a respirator, gloves and protective clothing are required.  Moreover, in premises designed for the storage of compounds using it, all fire safety measures must be observed.  Also, do not forget about properly designed air ventilation and exhaust hoods.  Only compliance with all these rules and regulations will allow you to safely receive a variety of products that we actively use in everyday life. </p>
