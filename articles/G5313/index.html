    <h2>  Folders </h2><p>  But this is only one option.  Thinking about where the recorder is in an iPhone, a person should be ready to search for an application in the bowels of the gadget. </p><p>  Sometimes on the iPhone desktop there is no corresponding icon.  But this does not mean that there is no voice recorder.  Just the application is not displayed.  In this case, it is recommended to search it in the folders of the device. </p><p>  Where is the voice recorder in the iPhone?  All standard applications can be found in Applications.  It is recommended to take a closer look at the proposed content.

    <h2>  Cydia </h2><p>  Where is the voice recorder in iPhone 6?  As already mentioned, you need to look at the desktop.  There will be a microphone image.  This is the recorder.  If you do not want to use the "native" application, you can download a more universal version.  For example, through Cydia.  This utility allows you to work with jailbroken "apple" phones. </p><p>  Where can I find a voice recorder initialized with Cydia?  It is enough to go to the address private / var / stash.  Here you need to find the Applications folder, and in it - the recorder.  A separate document will be assigned to this application.  The exact name depends on the name of the program. </p><h2>  Main menu </h2><p>  Interested in a voice recorder in iPhone 6?  Where is this application located, if it was installed independently?  In addition to the proposed scenarios, regardless of the version of the "apple" gadget used, you can search for the desired utility in another place. </p><p>  If the recorder (paid or free - it is not so important) was installed by the user on his own, it is easier to search than it seems.  Just visit the main menu of the device.  All available utilities and settings are displayed here.  You just need to carefully study the icons - among them there is sure to be a downloaded and installed voice recorder. </p><h2>  Make a record </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear where you can find the application that interests us.  But how to use it?  This question also raises a lot of questions among some smartphone owners. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="voice recorder in iphone 6 where is" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1743256.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Having figured out where the recorder is in the iPhone, you can start creating your own recording.  In the case of the standard iOS application, the algorithm of actions is reduced to the following manipulations: </p><ol><li>  Click on the microphone icon or launch the program from the corresponding folder. </li><li>  To start recording, you must click on the button with a red circle.  You can use the central control on the headset.  A pause and continued operation are activated in the same way. </li><li>  Press the red button again to stop creating the track.  Click on the "Finish" button. </li></ol><p>  That's all.  When installing more universal voice recorders, the algorithm of actions will be only slightly different.  All this knowledge is enough to make your own recordings on the iPhone and play them directly on the device. </p>
