An incredible number of historical monuments in the state makes a huge impression on tourists. </p><h2>  Mystical Stonehenge </h2><p>  The prehistoric period of England's architecture is associated with places of worship, the most famous of which is the famous Stonehenge.  The mystical monument is a complex of stone blocks placed in the middle of the Salisbury Plain.  The megalithic structure, which appeared before our era, was originally a ring-shaped shaft surrounded by a deep moat.  Multi-ton boulders are made of calcareous sandstone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.english-heritage.org.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mystical Stonehenge" class="if uuid-2461635" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2461635.jpg"></div><p>  Inside the man-made circle were 30 stones, inferior in size to the outer boulders, and in the center there was a so-called altar - a monolith, whose weight exceeded 30 tons.  Scientists believe that the unique structure is the oldest observatory that appeared in the Stone Age. </p><h2>  Adrian's shaft </h2><p>  In addition, many attractions relate to the period when Roman mercenaries appeared on British territory, who built military settlements and roads.  For several hundred years, they built defensive fortifications, and some of them are partially preserved.  Adrian Val - an outstanding antique monument, which became a symbol of the rule of the Roman Empire.  The mysterious wall of peat and stone is an example of engineering. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Famous tower </h2><p>  When it comes to the architecture of England during the Middle Ages, it can be confidently said that the main refinements of architecture were embodied in the construction of churches.  However, after the Normans seized the country, a new style appeared - the Romance.  And its bright representative recognized the Tower of London.  For several centuries, a large defensive structure played an important role in the history of the state.  Built by order of William the Conqueror, it is a four-story tower, which can only be accessed via an attached staircase.  No matter how many rebellions against the invading conquerors, the British have never been able to storm the Tower. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tower of London" class="if uuid-2461652" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2461652.jpg"></div><p>  Romanesque style is a heavy building with tall towers and small windows.  It has long sunk into oblivion, and the strict outlines of stone castles inspire modern architects to borrow various elements. </p><h2>  Gothic </h2><p>  The Gothic style that engulfed Europe came to England quite late - in the middle of the XII century, when the Anjou and Norman provinces joined the country.  For more than three hundred years, it remained the most popular direction in the architecture of England, which emphasized the insignificance of man before the Lord, and it was not by chance that this style was most often used in religious buildings - cathedrals.  Pointed-up buildings with <span>lancet arches</span> and huge windows decorated with colored stained-glass windows are now admirable.  And their inner space was struck by an abundance of light, which caused emotional shock among believers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Bright representative of medieval Gothic </h2><p>  <span>Salisbury Cathedral</span> is an ideal example of Gothic England.  The architecture of the stunningly beautiful building, built about 40 years, is distinguished by the grandeur and perfection of the execution of the plan.  The amazing creation of human hands, the lines of which emphasize aspiration to heaven, is famous for the highest spire in the state.  Located on the outskirts of the city, it is the oldest religious monument.  It is amazing that a very complex clockwork, which appeared at the end of the 14th century, is built into the walls of the temple. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.inlinguabroad.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Salisbury Cathedral" class="if uuid-2461653" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2461653.jpg"></div><p>  Salisbury Cathedral won the hearts of tourists with its grandeur, and the luxurious interior decoration leaves no one indifferent.  A bright representative of the Gothic architecture of England, he still accepts parishioners. </p><h2>  Classicism </h2><p>  Following the Gothic style comes classicism, which appeared in those countries where capitalism was born.  He carried the features of bourgeois ideology.  A rationalist approach to the assessment of the world was transferred to art, including architecture.  The style is characterized by clarity of proportions, simplicity, repeating lines, restrained decor. </p><p>  Classicism in the architecture of England appeared at the beginning of the XVII century, and the Banquet House, which has been perfectly preserved to this day, is recognized as an example of this style.  The building, which delights in its perfect proportions, was intended for ceremonial receptions.  The two-story majestic structure fully reflects <span>English traditions.</span>  The upper floor is decorated with pilasters of the Doric and Ionic orders, and the lower - with a relief tab. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.dayoutwiththekids.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Banquet house" class="if uuid-2461654" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2461654.jpg"></div><p>  For a long time, the mansion was a model for all architects in England. </p><h2>  Mixing styles </h2><p>  After the Stuarts ascended the throne, combining Scotland and England into a single Britain, in the 17th century a significant turning point occurred in architecture.  The country, which was an important center of European architecture, is catching up with other states in its development.  Graceful buildings, in which the features of classicism and baroque are skillfully intertwined, become models for structures in other countries.  During this period, none of the styles of architecture in England exists in its purest form. </p><h2>  Religious attraction </h2><p>  London's most recognizable landmark is St. Paul's Cathedral.  It is curious that not a single building in the city can be higher than the magnificent buildings of the Renaissance.  A visiting card of the capital of the country often appears on tourist brochures.  The cathedral, which appeared on the site of the burnt temple, according to residents, magnified the glory of the city.  It is made in a mixed Baroque-classical style. </p><p>  The tall, 111-meter high dome of religious sites rests on eight columns, and the walls are designed to be very thick to support the roof.  In addition, the vault of the temple is strengthened by external stone arches - arcbutans. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": Eluveitie, "><img itemprop="image" alt="St Paul's Cathedral" class="if uuid-2461657" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2461657.jpg"></div><p>  An important detail of the <span>symbol of London</span> is the western facade, which is a two-tiered portico, the levels of which are supported by twin columns.  From its two sides towers rise, and in one of them the clock is placed. </p><h2>  New style, born in England </h2><p>  According to the researchers, the 17th century became a period of apprenticeship for the architecture of England, and in the 18th century, when the country entered the world stage, art took first place.  The new ruling class, who saw his ideals in the culture of ancient Rome, again turns to the classics. </p><p>  However, architects understand that established rules limit creativity by hindering the realization of an idea.  Classical creations are being replaced by neoclassical ones.  Thus was born the aesthetic direction, which was inherent appeal to antiquity. </p><h2>  Antique style palace </h2><p>  Chiswick House is a small summer palace, the owner of which traveled a lot.  The Lord remembered the ruins of Ancient Rome, and when he returned home, he decided to erect an antique-style mansion.  The independent work has two stairs, a balustrade, and the facade of the building is divided into a basement and a portico.  All office and utility rooms were located in a small extension, and not in the main building. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.english-heritage.org.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cheswick house" class="if uuid-2461658" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2461658.jpg"></div><p>  It is curious that each of the stones that adorned the facade was covered with a special carving that resembled wormholes.  Elements of antiquity are noticeable in the entire appearance of the palace: columns with human faces, bizarre chimneys resembling Egyptian obelisks.  A fine example of the architecture of England in the 18th century after the death of the owner passed to the new owner and became even more beautiful.  An antique bridge and fancy serpentine paths even appeared here. </p><h2>  Neo-gothic </h2><p>  At the beginning of the 19th century, the ruling elite felt the threat of social tension.  The upper classes were afraid to lose control of society.  Everywhere there were thoughts of returning to the romantic Middle Ages.  All this is reflected in a new direction - neo-Gothic.  However, the architecture of <span>England in the 19th century</span> differs from the architecture of past centuries in the appearance of modern building materials, which provide many opportunities to express your view of the world.  New production processes are being introduced into the construction, which leads to a decrease in the role of the architect in the overall process. </p><p>  Many were protesting against such industrialization, and at that time a generation of young and motivated craftsmen was growing up, combining an individual look and modern materials. </p><h2>  Station, more like a cathedral </h2><p>  St. Pancras Station is not in vain called the "Cathedral of the Railways."  This is a genuine monument of neo-Gothic architecture in England, opened in 1876.  The unique work is made of stone, mosaics, steel structures.  After the construction is completed, the famous landmark is recognized as the national British style. </p><p>  The station is a landing stage covered with a glass dome - a place of arrival and departure of trains.  The facade of an unusual masterpiece of architecture is the hotel building, decorated with pseudo-slaughter houses, tall towers with sharp spiers and arcades.  Neo-Gothic is replete with a large number of decorative elements.  An English medieval cathedral was taken as the basis of the structure of bright red brick. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.homeaway.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="St Pancras Station" class="if uuid-2461660" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2461660.jpg"></div><p>  The main feature of modern English architecture is the continuity of styles.  Young talented architects who accept innovations always honor the country's historical traditions. </p>
