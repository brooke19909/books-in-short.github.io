For example, when there are photos and videos that you want to share with family or friends on a large modern screen.  A few years ago, not everyone would be able to cope with this difficult task, but today new technologies make it easy to solve it both for modern TVs and for older models.  To do this, you must first select the necessary computer devices and applications. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hughes.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung Screen Duplication" class="if uuid-2280354" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2280354.jpg"></div><p>  There are three common ways to transfer images from an external screen to a TV: </p><ul><li>  HDMI cable </li><li>  Chromecast </li><li>  Miracast </li><li>  EZcast </li><li>  AirServer </li></ul><h2>  Mirror photo and video to TV via HDMI </h2><p>  The easiest and most high-quality way to send a PC screen to a TV receiver is to use HDMI.  <span>High Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) is</span> usually bundled with a TV.  It can be purchased at any mobile hardware store.  Digital devices of modern TV models using HDMI receive and transmit high-quality images to the screen simultaneously with sound transmission.  This method can be used for any mobile devices and laptop models without an HDMI port through a special micro-USB to HDMI adapter, which can also be bought at any gadget store. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Screen mirroring using HDMI </h2><p>  Sequencing: </p><ul><li>  Find the HDMI port, connect one end to the TV, and the other to the PC. </li><li>  Turn on both devices and press ‚ÄúEnter‚Äù with the TV remote control. </li><li>  Select HDMI from the options.  Now you can see your monitor on TV. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="beebom.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="HDMI screen duplication" class="if uuid-2280248" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2280248.jpg"></div><p>  Sound setting: </p><ul><li>  you need to right-click on the speaker icon on the PC; </li><li>  select the following options sequentially: ‚ÄúPlayback device‚Äù&gt; ‚ÄúPlayback‚Äù tab&gt; ‚ÄúDigital output device (HDMI)‚Äù&gt; ‚ÄúYes‚Äù. </li></ul><p>  Everything, the connection is ready. </p><p>  As you can see, this method is easy, reliable and high-quality, but it has drawbacks caused by certain inconveniences for users due to the limited cable length, which can interfere, for example, children playing in front of the TV. </p><h2>  Transfer video to a TV via Wi-Fi </h2><p>  Duplication of the screen is easily feasible if the mobile equipment and the TV are manufactured by the same manufacturer, most likely they will have the function of ‚Äúmirror screen display‚Äù (or something similar) on both devices.  This will allow without hassle to immediately see on TV everything that is on the smartphone.  If the devices are produced by different manufacturers, you need to enable the DLNA (Wi-Fi Direct) function on the TV and download the DLNA application to your smartphone via GooglePlay. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.komputerswiat.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chromecast Screen Duplication" class="if uuid-2280259" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2280259.jpg"></div><p>  You can use the good AllCast app (free for iOS and Android).  For those who have an AppleTV, iPhone or iPad, you can connect through the AirPlay app to share with TV.  Older brands of TV and mobile equipment do not have such built-in functions, so you will have to use special Chromecast, Miracast and EZcast adapters. </p><h2>  Chromecast streaming device </h2><p>  Duplication of the screen on the TV is a very reliable and widely used method worldwide.  This is a streaming device designed to connect a PC and any mobile gadgets release 2010 and above to the TV.  Use it to listen to your music or watch photos and online videos from sites such as YouTube. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gogostuff.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Computer screen duplication" class="if uuid-2280270" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2280270.jpg"></div><p>  Chromecast connection sequence: </p><ol><li>  Connect the Chromecast HDMI cable to the TV port, and then connect the USB cable to a compatible port on any gadget. </li><li>  Install the Google Cast extension on your mobile gadget by downloading it through the Google Chrome Store. </li><li>  Open a new window in the browser and click "Yes" when the gadget detects external devices, find the TV icon and click on it. </li><li>  There is only one drawback of such a connection - it works over Wi-Fi, if the connection is weak or overloaded, then the quality and transfer speed of photo / video / voice files is probably low. </li></ol><h2>  Screen duplication using the Miracast adapter </h2><p>  There is a second way to transfer images through a newer standard called Miracast, which will be especially useful for users of Windows 10. It is often called ‚ÄúHDMI via Wi-Fi‚Äù because it allows various devices to establish a connection using wireless networks.  It was first used in Windows 8.1 and later.  Almost all laptops and upgraded OSs use the technology mentioned.  Miracast is able to play not only HD-video on the TV, but also display all the current monitor activity. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yayvo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Duplication of the screen on the TV" class="if uuid-2280273" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2280273.jpg"></div><p>  Miracast Connection Sequence: </p><ol><li>  Go to your computer‚Äôs settings and click on ‚ÄúDevices‚Äù. </li><li>  Then go to the ‚ÄúConnected devices‚Äù tab and click ‚ÄúAdd device‚Äù. </li><li>  Wait until the computer completes the device discovery from the available options, and click on the TV icon. </li><li>  If the computer does not automatically connect the TV, right-click and select ‚ÄúDisplay Settings‚Äù, set up multiple displays on the ‚ÄúDuplicate These Displays‚Äù tab, and then click ‚ÄúConnect to Wireless Display‚Äù. </li><li>  After detecting the TV, press the ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù button to display the PC on the TV receiver. </li><li>  Although this gadget can be considered a breakthrough in terms of connectivity, it has one drawback, as it cannot detect some TV models. </li></ol><p>  Not happy with screen mirroring with Miracast?  Here is another wireless solution - a device for transmitting media content to an EZcast TV. </p><h2>  Transferring images to a TV using EZcast </h2><p>  Features of EZcast: </p><ul><li>  multimedia support: Miracast, DLNA, Airplay for mobile devices and PCs; </li><li>  highly integrated SoC (600 MHz); </li><li>  reliable in operation; </li><li>  compact, energy-efficient, high-speed H.264 1080P Full HD; </li><li>  automatic channel selection; </li><li>  supports Wi-Fi module; </li><li>  USB port of TV. </li></ul><h2>  Connecting PCs and mobile devices to Sony TVs </h2><p>  Before you can duplicate a Sony screen, you need to read the user manual and check the output ports on your PC in order to clarify the connection parameters and choose the right connecting cable.  If possible, it is better to use an HDMI connection or a DVI connection, since these parameters combine video and audio signals in one cable, and also offer a high definition extension for the TV receiver screen. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.insideci.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Screen Duplication" class="if uuid-2280275" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2280275.jpg"></div><p>  Connection Sequence: </p><ul><li>  Connect one end of the connection cable to the appropriate port on the side or back of the computer, and the other to the corresponding port on the back of the TV. </li><li>  Each port on the TV is clearly marked by its function, so there should not be any problems with determining the correct port.  Turn on Sony. </li><li>  Press the AV or EXT button on the TV remote control until the PC output appears on the TV screen. </li><li>  If the display is stretched or cropped around the edges, you will need to select the resolution settings on the computer. </li><li>  To configure the settings for displaying a PC on a TV, you must click the "Start" button on the taskbar on the desktop, go to the "Control Panel", and then select the "Appearance and Personalization" tab. </li><li>  Click on the ‚ÄúSet Screen Resolution‚Äù function and select your preferred resolution from the drop-down menu. </li><li>  Experiment with different resolutions until you find the setting that will display correctly on Sony. </li><li>  Click the ‚ÄúApply‚Äù button to confirm and save the settings. </li></ul><p>  Duplication of the Samsung screen, PC screens, smartphone of other mobile devices is carried out using the Screen Mirroring function, which is present on Samsung F, J, K, M-series TVs.  If mobile devices or a TV do not have this function, then Smart View software is used for transferring, even with iOS.  The screen mirroring procedure is similar to the above. </p><h2>  Universal Mirror Receiver Using AirServer </h2><p>  Duplication of a computer screen on a TV using AirServer is popular and can easily convert a simple large screen or projector into a universal mirror receiver.  It does this by combining all major mirroring technologies such as AirPlay, Google Cast and Miracast into one universal receiver.  Thanks to AirServer on the big screen, users can use their own devices, such as iPhone, iPad, Mac, Android, Nexus, Pixel, Chromebook or Windows 10 PC, to wirelessly display video on the big screen. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pbs.twimg.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Screen mirroring on AirServer" class="if uuid-2286687" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2286687.jpg"></div><p>  Thus, today there are quite a few different technologies that can duplicate the screens of iPad, PC, laptops in offices, educational institutions, conference rooms or at home and turn any plasma TV into an ultramodern multimedia center. </p>
