  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Chromosomes. Haploid and diploid chromosome set.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Certain genes are passed on to children by inheritance from their parents.  As you know, the younger generation "takes" from the older face shape, especially the head, arms, hair color, etc.).  A substance such as <span>deoxyribonucleic acid</span> is responsible for the transmission of symptoms to children from parents in the body <span>.</span>  This unique substance contains biological information about variability.  It is recorded as code.  It is stored by the chromosome. </p><p>  A human cell contains twenty-three pairs of structurally functional units such as chromosomes.  Each such ‚Äúduet‚Äù contains two absolutely identical structural and functional units.  The difference is that these pairs are different from each other.  Chromosomes numbered forty-five and forty-six are sexual.  Moreover, this duet is the same only for girls, while for men they are different.  All structural and functional units, with the exception of genital ones, are called "autosomes."  It should be noted that chromosomes are largely composed of elements such as proteins.  They are different in appearance: some of them are more subtle, others are somewhat shorter than the others, but each of them has a twin.  The chromosome set (or, as it is also called, the karyotype) of a person is a genetic structure that is responsible for the transmission of heredity.  It is better to consider such structural-functional units under a microscope during <span>cell division</span> (metaphase stage).  During this period, chromosomes are formed from a substance such as chromatin, and already begin to acquire a certain amount, i.e.  ploidy. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As noted above, a human cell has twenty-three pairs of important structural and functional elements.  Living organisms have their own individual ploidy. </p><p>  Haploid and diploid chromosome set.  The concept of ploidy is defined as the number of chromosome sets in cells (mainly) in the nuclei.  In living organisms, chromosomes can be unpaired and paired.  In human cells, a diploid set of chromosomes is formed, that is double.  Such a set of structural and functional elements is characteristic of all somatic cells.  It is worth noting that for each person, the diploid set of chromosomes consists of 44 autosomes and 2 sex chromosomes.  The haploid set of chromosomes is a single set of unpaired structural and functional elements of <span>germ cells.</span>  This kit contains twenty-two autosomes and only one sex chromosome.  The haploid set and diploid set of chromosomes may be present at the same time.  This occurs mainly during the sexual process.  At this point, the haploid and diploid phases alternate.  With the help of division, the complete set forms a single.  After that, two single ones are connected and form a complete set of structural and functional elements, etc. </p><p>  The diploid set of chromosomes is the totality of chromosomes that is inherent in all somatic cells.  In it, all chromosomes that are characteristic of a given biological species are presented in pairs.  Each person has a diploid set of chromosomes capable of containing forty-four autosomes and two sexual structural and functional elements.  The diploid set of chromosomes is characteristic of the zygote and all somatic cells, except for anzuploid, haploid and polyploid cells. </p><p>  It also happens that there is a violation of the set of structural-functional units.  Failures can affect the formation of <span>chromosomal diseases</span> (for example, Down Syndrome - the formation of a triosomy, i.e. violations in the twenty-first pair and the appearance of an <span>extra chromosome</span> (third)).  The study of chromosomes is very important, since these elements have a very serious effect on the human body. </p>
