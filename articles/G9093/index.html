Throughout history, they tried to explain it with etheric vortices, quirks of <span>multidimensional spaces,</span> magnetic monopolies and many others. </p><p>  We all know that magnets, turned to each other by poles of the same name, are repelled, and by opposites, they are attracted.

It turns out that the described object creates a magnetic halo around itself.  At the same time, when two alternating fields with the same frequency are applied, when one is shifted in space relative to the other, an effect is obtained, which is called a ‚Äúrotating magnetic field‚Äù.

    <p>  The magnitude of the studied subject is determined by the force with which the magnet is attracted to another or to iron.  Accordingly, the greater the attraction, the larger the field.  The force can be measured using conventional <span>mechanical scales: for</span> this, a small piece of iron is placed on one side and weights are designed on the other, designed to balance the <span>force of attraction of the</span> metal to the magnet. </p><p>  For a more accurate understanding of the subject matter, one should study the <span>properties of the magnetic</span> field: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  generated by electric <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Magnetic field properties" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10523/52151.jpg" width="500"></div>  current, i.e.  moving charges; </li><li>  detected by its effect on electric current; </li><li>  exists independently of our knowledge of him and of ourselves. </li></ul><p>  What is <span>a person</span> ‚Äôs magnetic <span>field?</span> </p><p>  Answering the question of what a magnetic field is, it is worth saying that a person also has it.  At the end of 1960, thanks to the intensive development of physics, the SQUID measuring device was created.  Its action is explained by the laws of quantum phenomena.  It is a sensitive element of the magnetometers used to study the magnetic field and such </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rotating magnetic field" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10523/53228.jpg" width="366"></div>  quantities, for example, as an <span>electric current.</span>

    <p>  SQUID quickly enough began to be used to measure the fields that are generated by living organisms and, of course, by humans.  This gave impetus to the development of new areas of research based on the interpretation of the information supplied by such a device.  This direction is called "biomagnetism." </p><p>  Why, then, when determining what a magnetic field was, research was not conducted in this area?  It turned out that it is very weak in organisms, and its measurement is a difficult physical task.  This is due to the presence of a huge amount of magnetic noise in the surrounding space.  Therefore, it simply does not seem possible to answer the question of what a person‚Äôs magnetic field is and to study it without using specialized protective measures. </p><p>  Around a living organism, such a ‚Äúhalo‚Äù arises for three main reasons.  Firstly, thanks to ionic dots that appear as a result of the electrical activity of cell membranes.  Secondly, due to the presence of ferrimagnetic tiny particles that accidentally enter or are introduced into the body.  Thirdly, when external magnetic fields are superimposed, an inhomogeneous susceptibility of various organs is obtained, which distorts the superimposed spheres. </p>
