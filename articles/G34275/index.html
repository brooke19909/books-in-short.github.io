    <p>  The meaning of the word ulus is multiple.  This tribal association among the population of Central and Central Asia, and the administrative-territorial unit in the eastern and northern parts of Tsarist Russia, and the village of some peoples of Central Asia and Siberia.  The ulus is <span>the inheritance,</span> part of the <span>empire of Genghis Khan, the</span> most famous of which are the Central Asian Chagatai, the son of Genghis Khan (Chagatai ulus), as well as the Golden Horde.  As for modern Russia, these are villages and villages of Kalmykia and Buryatia, regions of Yakutia.  The most common meaning of the word ulus is people, generation.  Sometimes you can find the use of this concept in the sense of the estate, for example, "chora-ulus" - "vile, black people." </p><h2>  History of uluses </h2>

    <p>  The people who form the ulus did not establish any boundaries between them, recognizing the steppe as common to all.  The Buryats, who migrated from Mongolia to Lake Baikal in the 16th and 17th centuries, were also located on the earth in large groups of genera and to this day they own it together.  Until the end of the 19th century, the Mongol and Kalmyk uluses retained the same basic features as during the time of Genghis Khan: each of them formed a nomadic horde, ruled by the clan chieftains - noions.  They depended on Taisha.  Taisha owned the best and largest ulus; he gave the less affluent to hereditary noyons in accordance with their tribal eldership.  Their rule was not limited, but was largely regulated from ancient times by customary law.  Its spokesmen and carriers were the honorable old people - the best people of the ulus.  The internal structure corresponded to the features of tribal life.  The ulus is a union that was divided into small patrimonial groups - khotons, aimaks and edemas.  Each of them was under the control of the oldest hereditary ancestor.  He was responsible to noyons or taisha for order and prosperity, and maintained the integrity of such a fluid social group as the ulus.  Thus, these settlements perfectly organized their defense and could carry out an attack themselves. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  3 basic principles </h2>

    <p>  The generic nature of the device is reflected in 3 basic principles: 1) tribal solidarity;  2) responsibility;  3) mutual responsibility.  Tribal solidarity means compulsory charity for the poor and mutual assistance.  Rich people came to the aid of the poor, sharing with them food, livestock and everything necessary.  Mandatory was the free exchange of services between their members.  Mutual responsibility was expressed in the fact that, for example, not only the guilty person was responsible for the guilt, but also all the relatives of the union to which he belonged.  In the case when it was impossible to detect, the fine had to be paid to the whole family or ulus.  There was also a cleansing oath, which sometimes completely freed a suspected member of society. </p><p>  Several similar neighboring uluses formed a clan, or <span>clan community.</span>  The duties of their members can also include the presentation of gifts to the bride after leaving their relatives, for the poor groom they paid kalyma to the fold.  The mutual guarantee remained for a long time at the Selenga Buryats in the form of payment for stolen things or cattle.  If one or several close relatives swore an oath, verifying the honesty and decency of the suspected person, he was released from punishment. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Recent changes </h2>

    <p>  However, over the past century, the device drilled quite seriously changed.  The main reasons for this are the spread of Lamaism and tillage, as well as the mixing of childbirth.  Government measures also contributed to the decomposition of the ancient tribal organization of the Buryats.  Ancient law ceased to function, giving way to new legal relations, in parallel with this, many foundations fell, which gave the ulus fortress and unity. </p><h2>  Yakutia </h2><p>  The uluses of Yakutia are located in northeastern Siberia and have a common border with the Magadan region and the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug. </p><p>  At present, this territory has 32 uluses (including 3 national ones).  Let us dwell on some of them. </p><h2>  Namsky ulus </h2><p>  This ulus, located in Central Yakutia, covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã11.9 thousand km.  The largest river is the Lena, with many tributaries.  It is known that within the current borders this ulus was formed on February 10, 1930.  Peter Beketov erected a prison and founded the city of Yakutsk.  In the Namsky district, for a long time, they were engaged in the cultivation of cattle.  Most of the people settled in the low part of the valley, the rest along the Alas and near taiga rivers.  Their main occupation in the 17th century was cattle breeding.  Agriculture as such was not until 1804.  Namsky ulus in ancient times was similar to many other corners of Yakutia.  If a person became ill, they turned to healers and shamans.  In olden times, this ulus existed in the absence of medical facilities on a scientific basis. </p><h2>  Hangalass ulus </h2>

    <p>  This ulus has a huge tourist and recreational potential, in particular, unique natural complexes, flora and fauna, untouched nature.  All this is of great interest to tourists.  Khangalassky ulus, located in central Yakutia, covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã24.7 thousand square kilometers and is represented by more than 50 nations and nationalities.  The administrative center is the city of Pokrovsk. </p><p>  In conclusion, I would like to supplement the article with etymology.  From Fasmer‚Äôs dictionary, we learn that the ulus is a ‚Äúnomad camp‚Äù and ‚Äúa series of straight fields‚Äù.  In some sources, these are "state forests provided for use by peasants." </p>
