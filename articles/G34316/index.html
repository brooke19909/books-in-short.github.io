It is about faith and religion, which, having undergone seventy years of oblivion, is reborn in the souls of people.  Blessed times have come for believers, now you can openly revere saints, as well as practice your faith.  Such a popular destination of world tourism, as a pilgrimage, also began to actively develop.  And there are more and more people who want to recover on such a tour.  People strive to give rest not only to the emaciated city bustle of the body, but also to their starving soul.  Well, if you have the opportunity to combine a <span>vacation at sea</span> with a pilgrimage, then this is a great success. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="saint stefan montenegro" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/272891.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  <span>Sveti Stefan</span> (Montenegro) is a unique example of how a wonderful city-hotel was created from an unremarkable fishing village.  And a large role in this transformation was played by the presence of several ancient churches on the island, one of which was built in honor of the patron saint of the village.  People who have been here say they visited the Middle Ages.  And it is true.  When the <span>restoration work</span> was carried <span>out, the</span> craftsmen made every effort to preserve the authentic appearance of the buildings, and the slightest doubt that the visitors were in the old town did not creep in.  St. Stephen (Montenegro) - recreation, sea, sun.  Here is such <span>an associative row</span> to build every tourist who has been here.  And no matter what the purpose of his trip was: a pilgrimage to ancient churches or a secluded luxury vacation, the experience will be unforgettable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="saint stefan montenegro rest" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/272893.jpg" width="600"></div>

Due to all kinds of services that have come to the rescue of lovers to independently organize their own holidays, a trip to these places will be easy, and you can get to know all the beauties in private, and not in a noisy company of tourists, which is doubly pleasant.  St. Stephen (Montenegro), a map of which is in any tourist guide, is open to the public and will amaze you with its hospitality. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="saint stefan montenegro map" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/272892.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  But young people love to travel independently, older people will enjoy a more measured rest, where everything is already provided.  Even the most demanding tourists will be pleasantly surprised by the quality of service and the hospitality of this cozy place.  Despite the fact that St. Stefan (Montenegro) was opened to tourists only in 2008, interest in it is growing rapidly from the first days.  And the most compelling argument is that it was this place that members of the European royal families chose for themselves.  Not every resort will be honored with such distinguished guests.  Perhaps the secret is in the charms of solitude, which the world‚Äôs powers are so devoid of in everyday life, or perhaps in the unique nature, picturesque landscapes and amazingly clear sea.  Be that as it may, Saint Stephen (Montenegro) is a place worth visiting.  And it is worth making a trip there to your wish card if you want to really spend an unforgettable vacation. </p>
