In earlier versions of the operating system, there was a function that allowed combining internal and external resources, but over time it disappeared.  What are the proven ways to transfer memory from a drive to a phone (and vice versa), and how to install applications on an SD card?  Read about it below in the article. </p><h2>  What is an SD card? </h2><p>  Most low-cost smartphones have a rather scarce amount of internal memory, which is why many owners of electronic devices are wondering about transferring data to a memory card on Android.  Although in some cases, users do not even have enough 16 gigabytes, because they want the phone to fit as many photos, videos and games as possible.  In this case, SD cards come to the rescue, allowing you to store gigabytes of useful information. </p><p>  After installing an external drive, you need to set a new path for saving files downloaded from the Internet.  To do this, go to the settings and select the "Applications" section.  In it you will find a line that determines whether new files will be saved to the internal memory of the smartphone, or the system will give preference to an SD card.  Although, if everything was so simple, then people would not have questions about how to transfer memory to a memory card on Android. </p><h2>  Do functions work for moving? </h2><p>  In Android 6.0, transferring memory to the card and vice versa could be done using the internal tools of the operating system.  It was enough just to go to the "Settings" section, and then select "Application Manager" from the list.  However, after updating the devices to Android 7, the transfer of memory to the card was somehow removed.  Perhaps the developers found this feature too useful, since it was easier to buy an SD card than a phone with 16 gigabytes of internal memory. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="flipboard.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Transfer applications to a USB flash drive." class="if uuid-3198339" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/139667/3198339.jpg"></div><p>  If you are the proud owner of a smartphone running Android 6.0, you can safely use the built-in application manager to move not only free memory, but also various programs that have already been installed on an external or internal drive.  As for the more advanced versions, you will have to resort to other methods of moving. </p><h2>  Transfer files to an SD card using a PC </h2><p>  One of the easiest ways to transfer programs to a memory card on Android.  Also, the method allows you to easily transfer various multimedia files (music, videos, photos) to an external SD drive without any difficulties. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pt.wikihow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="SD card in a laptop." class="if uuid-3198341" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/139667/3198341.jpg"></div><ol><li>  We connect the device to the computer using a USB cable. </li><li>  We go into the folder with the smartphone operating system and look for the desired file. </li><li>  Cut a picture or video clip.  Then we put it in the folder of the SD card. </li></ol><p>  When viewing the contents of drives, it is also possible to create additional folders for the convenience of finding the necessary files.  Just click on the right mouse button in the desired section and select "Create Folder". </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There are also special applications that allow you to manipulate the transfer of multimedia files without using a computer.  The best option for beginners is the File Manager, which can be downloaded for free from Google Play. </p><h2>  Memory Transfer Applications </h2><p>  Since we are talking about third-party programs, we should mention a couple of interesting utilities that allow you to transfer several gigabytes from an SD drive.  For example, a good app for a novice user is AppMge III, which allows you to transfer memory to an Android memory card in a matter of seconds (or vice versa). </p><p>  Also a pretty useful addition is the function for moving installed applications.  The user can mark several programs at once that need to be transferred to the SD card, or click on the "Move All" button.  Also in this way you can simply check the list of installed applications and their size. </p><p>  However, it should be understood that not all applications can be moved from the built-in drive to an external one.  Typically, such restrictions are set by developers of the operating system or the program that the user has downloaded.  A vivid example is the social network Facebook and the WhatsApp messenger - it will not be possible to transfer these applications to the SD card. </p><h2>  Link2SD </h2><p>  In addition to the aforementioned AppMge III, there are other programs that allow you to transfer applications to a memory card on Android 8 and above.  One of the most striking examples is a utility called Link2SD, which has many useful functions, but requires detailed settings.  For example, the application will require giving it root access, as well as creating a hidden area in the file system on the SD card that will be used for emulation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="techviral.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Application shortcut for Android." class="if uuid-3198344" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/139667/3198344.jpg"></div><p>  A few words about the operation of the application itself.  Link2SD allows not only to transfer files and installed programs from the internal memory of the smartphone to an external drive, but also has the following functions: </p><ul><li>  create shortcuts on the desktop; </li><li>  reinstallation and removal of programs; </li><li>  distribution of installation APK; </li><li>  RAM cleaning; </li><li>  application freezing. </li></ul><p>  The utility provides all these features absolutely free of charge, however, owners of an advanced version of the manager can automatically clear the cache, as well as remove annoying ads that appear at startup. </p><h2>  Create a hidden area </h2><div class="photo" data-original="everycafe.com.tr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hidden area." class="if uuid-3198348" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/139667/3198348.jpg"></div><p>  Link2SD is pretty good of its kind, but even experienced users often have questions about using the program.  Especially often, people are interested in how to create a hidden area in the phone necessary for the normal operation of the application.  We answer: this can be done using the Recovery mode built into the smartphone.  It is activated on different smartphones in different ways: </p><ul><li>  press the unlock button, and immediately after that - the volume button; </li><li>  hold both volume buttons together with the smartphone‚Äôs power button; </li><li>  simultaneously press the power, volume and home button. </li></ul><p>  Once in Recovery, you need to select Advanced mode, and then click on the Partition SD Card section.  After that, you just need to create an ext3 file system.  The size will have to be specified independently.  It is best to spare no memory and allocate 1 gigabyte (1024 megabytes) to the hidden area.  Otherwise, too large applications will not be able to move from the phone to the SD card.  In the swap file column, you must set the value to zero. </p><h2>  Creating emulations using a program </h2><p>  Many users hesitate to experiment with Recovery functions, however, creating a hidden area is a mandatory task that must be completed before using Link2SD.  Emulation can also be done using a third-party computer program - the EaseUS Partition Master, which was originally intended for working with hard disks, but now the tool is used, as a rule, to create ext3 file systems. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tipspintar.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phone connected to the computer." class="if uuid-3198350" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/139667/3198350.jpg"></div><p>  After installing the utility on a desktop computer or laptop, you need to connect a smartphone with a built-in SD card.  In the main window of the program, you should find the section with the external drive, then right-click on it and select the Delete Partition function, which deletes all data on the USB flash drive.  After that, it remains only to click on the Unallocated file system and select the Create Partition function, which is necessary to create the ext3 system. </p><h2>  How to transfer cache to SD card? </h2><p>  Many smartphone owners are wondering if the data is transferred applications that have been moved from the internal drive to external.  Especially for such people, we answer: no, but you can do this with the help of third-party programs.  One of the best utilities for this purpose is FolderMount - it boasts a rather convenient interface, many additional functions, as well as a nice design. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hackingsaga.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Clear the cache on the phone." class="if uuid-3198360" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/139667/3198360.jpg"></div><p>  Why do I need to transfer cache data to a USB flash drive, if it only loads the operating system?  Well, some users want to keep their progress in games or leave application settings.  Yes, the cache consumes quite a lot of RAM, however, some people have been downloading characters to some MMORPGs for years, so that later they can show off to friends.  It will be very disappointing to lose all your progress after transferring the game to the SD card. </p><h2>  How to move applications to Samsung Galaxy? </h2><p>  Now you know everything about how to transfer files to a memory card on Android.  However, owners of expensive smartphones often wonder whether it is possible to move applications on their devices.  Yes you can.  But the developers of Samsung Galaxy have provided that their customers can use third-party utilities to transfer memory instead of buying a phone with 32 or 64 gigabytes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pocketmeta.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Applications on the Samsung Galaxy." class="if uuid-3198365" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/139667/3198365.jpg"></div><p>  Move in exactly the same way as described earlier, but in no case do not remove the SD card after the applications are placed on it.  Otherwise, the programs will simply become inactive, after which they will have to be reinstalled.  However, this applies only to applications.  Photos, movies, video clips, music and text files can be transferred to an external drive without fear of loss if you remove the SD card. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  I would like to recommend our readers to watch a short video, the author of which talks about the two mentioned methods of transferring applications to an external drive in more detail.  On a specific example, information is always perceived much more clearly. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="Vxs7cWIRGhk" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vxs7cWIRGhk&amp;t=4s" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/6/8/2/5/16825.jpg"></div><p>  We hope you now better understand how to transfer memory to a memory card on Android.  In fact, this is absolutely nothing complicated.  Of course, for such an event, you will need to properly prepare and install third-party applications, however, owners of smartphones with old firmware can easily transfer several gigabytes to the drive and back using the built-in functions.  We recommend that everyone else use the proven methods described in our article.  You can easily achieve the desired result. </p>
