But still, with a sufficiently large demand outside Russia, you can find good housing, having a fairly small budget.  Although it should be understood that the worse the economic situation in the country, the lower the cost of housing. </p><h2>  Zimbabwe </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.thepuffpuffpost.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Zimbabwe Real Estate" class="if uuid-2629179" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2629179.jpg"></div><p>  Indeed, this country is a leader in the list of states with the cheapest real estate in the world.  In Zimbabwe, from 8 to 10 US dollars are requested for 1 square meter, that is, you can buy a whole house of 450 square meters for only 4 thousand dollars. </p><p>  But do not be so happy.  Some 20 years ago, the country had economic stability, and in 2008 the inflation rate was a record for the whole world.  And since the end of last year, the unemployment rate has been at around 80%.  In light of this, the local population is still leaving the country, practically giving their housing for nothing.  Despite this, specialists in the field of medicine are welcome here, although their level of salary does not reach the European level. </p><p>  Naturally, it is in this country that there are cities with the cheapest real estate, but when you think about moving, you should understand that the country is quite aggressive towards people with white skin.  Whether it will be comfortable is a big question. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The country uses not only Zimbabwean dollars, but also American ones.  The average rate is: 1 USD = 362 ZWD. </p><h2>  Paraguay </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.nytimes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Country of paraguay" class="if uuid-2629191" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2629191.jpg"></div><p>  In which country is the cheapest property?  In Paraguay, where in the capital city of Asuncion, you can buy an apartment by giving no more than 300 US dollars for 1 square meter. </p><p>  However, it should be understood that there are certain security problems in Paraguay: there are many violent crimes and abductions.  In crowded places, petty theft is very common, and cars also steal a lot.  The country itself is recognized as one of the most corrupt in the world. </p><p>  The main economic sector is agricultural business.  Zimbabwe ranks sixth in the ranking of soybean producers.  But the people live very poorly, about 52% of the total population are below the poverty line. </p><p>  The country uses Paraguayan guarani, the rate of which against 1 USD is 5695.18 PYG. </p><h2>  Dominican Republic </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pacificworld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dominican Republic" class="if uuid-2629198" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2629198.jpg"></div><p>  Where is the cheapest property in the world?  In a country of beautiful beaches and total poverty of the local population - this is all about the Dominican Republic.  For 1 square meter in the capital they ask from 350 USD.  In the republic, about 42% of residents are below the poverty line, although the unemployment rate is not very high - about 15%. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Safety there is at a fairly high level, but it is not recommended to wear huge gold jewelry.  You should not walk along the unlit streets and wild beaches, there are many illegal Haitians in the country.  By the way, even the locals do not go to areas where Haitians live. </p><p>  The country has little work and fairly high prices for food.  For a loaf of bread you will have to pay 2 USD, and a bottle of rum costs 10 USD.  Medicine is paid and free, but there is compulsory health insurance (40 USD per month).  Without a hospital, not a single hospital accepts it, not even a paid one. </p><p>  The local currency is the Dominican peso, for 2 units they ask for 2 USD. </p><h2>  Egypt </h2><div class="photo" data-original="edition.cnn.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="State of egypt" class="if uuid-2629205" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2629205.jpg"></div><p>  This tourist country is also listed where the cheapest property in the world.  For 1 square meter, they are asking for 420 USD.  Although stability is not discussed in the country, and wages are at a fairly low level. </p><p>  Persons engaged in agriculture receive up to 100 USD, in the city a little more - up to 200 USD. </p><p>  In Egypt, there is a large Russian diaspora: only in Hurghada there are 3 schools where children can pass the EGE and enter a Russian university. </p><p>  The country uses the Egyptian pound, for 100 EGP you can buy 5.60 USD. </p><h2>  Georgia </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.onlinetours.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beauty of Georgia" class="if uuid-2629277" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85609/2629277.jpg"></div><p>  Another beautiful mountainous country, which has chosen the course towards European integration, is in a transitional state today.  It is included in the rating of states with the cheapest real estate in the world. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  To date, about 580 USD is being asked for 1 square meter.  At the same time, the standard of living cannot be called high, the average salary is 317 USD, although many post-Soviet countries can envy such a payment.  For basic utilities, you will have to pay only 35 USD, and for a loaf of bread - about 0.35 cents.  Traveling by public transport is also cheap - from 0.20 <span><strong>cents.</strong></span> </p><p>  Currency - Georgian lari.  100 GEL corresponds to 40 USD. </p><h2>  Tunisia </h2><div class="photo" data-original="steemkr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tunis Homes" class="if uuid-2629216" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2629216.jpg"></div><p>  Here, prices per square meter of residential real estate start from 550 USD, that is, this can also be included in the list of the cheapest real estate in the world.  The standard of living in the country is quite high when compared with other African countries.  The middle class makes up 60% of the total population. </p><p>  Women in Tunisia are not recommended to wear too open robes, as you can face not only persecution, but also violent actions, because the country is still Muslim. </p><p>  To get a job, you need to know the English language, although it is not the most popular - they communicate more in French and Arabic.  The unemployment rate is quite high - about 15.5%.  The average salary is from 150 to 200 euros. </p><p>  The country's currency is Tunisian dinar.  For 100 dinars you can earn 37 USD. </p><h2>  Bulgaria </h2><div class="photo" data-original="edukwest.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Streets of the Bulgarian city" class="if uuid-2629221" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2629221.jpg"></div><p>  Not so long ago, Bulgaria was a leader in the list of countries where the world's cheapest real estate.  But at the beginning of this year, the minimum cost of 1 square meter is 715 USD.  Despite a gradual decrease in inflation, the state still lives from summer to summer, since tourism is the main sector of the economy.  The rest of the year it is quite difficult to find a job. </p><p>  The price of food is slightly lower than in Russia: for a loaf of bread you will have to pay from 31 to 37 Bulgarian leva, and 100 USD can be bought for 169 leva. </p><h2>  Turkey </h2><p>  Today this country is attractive not only for tourists, but also for immigrants.  For 1 square meter ask from 740 USD.  Before the ruble depreciation, there was no particular difference in the price of products; now in Russia they are about 1.5 times more expensive.  The country has a rather high cost of fuel, so maintaining a car is expensive.  But utilities are cheap - no more than 5 thousand rubles will have to be paid for an apartment - this price includes lighting, gas and water. </p><p>  The average salary is 2,500 lire - this is about 545 US dollars, and the minimum wage is 500 lire. </p><h2>  Sri Lanka </h2><p>  This country is a paradise for freelancers, where it is always warm, although life is quite expensive.  Sri Lanka has the highest cost for electric energy in the whole world - more than 35 cents will have to be paid for 1 kilowatt.  Also expensive gasoline, and 1.5 liters of water cost $ 1. </p><p>  The cost of housing depends on the location: the closer to the coast or the business part of the village, the more expensive.  The minimum cost of housing is 740 USD per 1 square meter. </p><p>  The local currency is Sri Lankan rupee.  For 100 USD they give 15,831 thousand rupees. </p><h2>  Albania </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.yourmoney.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The beauty of Albania" class="if uuid-2629227" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2629227.jpg"></div><p>  Where is the cheapest property?  If we talk about the European continent, we can distinguish Albania, which for a long time was closed to tourists and emigrants.  But what is most interesting is that the country has the cheapest housing on the entire Adriatic coast.  You can find housing with sea views up to 1 thousand euros (about 1.17 thousand USD): the farther from the beaches, the lower the cost.  Although this year there has been significant growth in real estate, Albania has become quite attractive to investors. </p><p>  The economy in Albania is rather poorly developed, therefore, the best conditions are offered in the tourism sector, where knowledge of the Albanian language may not even be required.  But food prices in the country are lower than those in the Russian Federation by about 10%, and if we talk about fruits, then by 70%. </p><p>  The criminal environment allows you not to worry about your safety.  However, the security of law enforcement agencies is quite low, so they are often late for calls.  Protest actions are sometimes held in the country, but, as a rule, they all have a peaceful character. </p><p>  Currency - Albanian Lek.  The course is 1 thousand lek = 9.2 USD. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  If you do not plan to leave so far, then you can pay attention to Latvia, where you can find a one-room apartment for 25 thousand euros, and on the coast - for 33 thousand.  Almost the same situation in Montenegro and Spain. </p>
