    <h2>  The benefits of relaxing in Alanya </h2><p>  It is here, according to many travelers, that you can see Turkey, unusual for Russians - well-appointed swimming areas bordering wild beaches, numerous bays and grottoes and the longest season for sunbathing enthusiasts. </p><p>  The climate of Alanya makes it possible to come here both in early spring and late autumn.  Apparently, therefore, among Turkish resorts this is enjoying constant popularity among our compatriots.  Indeed, many factors that attract tourists here came together in this region. </p><p>  The hotel infrastructure of Alanya is very diverse.  Here in recent years many fashionable five- and four-star hotels have been built, but treshki, including the Rosella Apart Hotel 3 *, are more popular. </p><p>  Turkey, Alanya in particular, is rich in apart-hotels, which offer a rather wide range of services combined with low prices.  This is especially attractive for the average tourist who, coming here, has the opportunity to combine a beach holiday with a tour of local attractions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rosella Apart Hotel 3" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1475602.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is equally suitable both for relaxing with family and children, and for spending holidays with friends.  Perhaps the main drawback of Rosella Hotel 3 * is the territory of the hotel, which is very small.  However, according to many of our compatriots who have already been here, this is not particularly noticeable, since they spent the day either on the beach, swimming and sunbathing, or walking around the city and visiting the local sights, which are quite numerous in this Turkish region. </p><p>  Located Rosella Apart Hotel 3 (Turkey, Alanya), three kilometers from the Byzantine fortress.  Residents can enjoy their outlines visible on the horizon from the balconies of their rooms in the morning and evening.  Nearby is the famous Cleopatra Beach - the pearl of Alanya.  According to legend, <span>Mark Anthony</span> created it for his beloved <span>.</span>  This piece of the Turkish Mediterranean coast is considered a national treasure.  The special dust-free sand of this beach does not heat up in the sun.  A few minutes drive from the hotel there is a huge market where absolutely everything is sold, from foodstuffs to gold products, which are brought by many of our compatriots from Turkey. </p><p>  There is a bus stop at the hotel entrance.  Within walking distance of Rosella Apart Hotel 3 there are many shops, bars, restaurants and cafes. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rosella Hotel 3 hotel grounds" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1475607.jpg" width="500"></div>

And this, judging by the reviews, is another drawback of this hotel, since the transfer for tourists with young children is long. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Rosella Hotel is a 3-star, however, despite the category, it offers the whole list of services that are needed for a comfortable stay.  It has a fairly small area, which has a small outdoor pool.  The hotel buildings are surrounded by tall trees.  Despite the small area, the territory is completely landscaped and decorated with flowering shrubs.  In Rosella Hotel 3 * there is a small parking lot that does not need to be pre-booked.

There are eighty-nine of them in this hotel.

    <p>  The categories of rooms are as follows: standard, double and triple family, as well as apartments with one or two bedrooms, designed for three or four people, respectively.  They overlook the sea, the surrounding mountains or the courtyard, where the outdoor pool is located.  The rooms are newly renovated.  The design is thought out carefully enough.  Thick doors are provided on the doors to the balcony.  The color scheme of the rooms is in calm sand tones.  On the floor - ceramic non-slip tiles. </p><p>  The rooms are equipped with everything that guests may require while relaxing.  They have a TV (two Russian channels in the channel list), a split-air conditioner controlled by a remote control, a safe and a minibar, for which you have to pay separately.  The apartments have a kitchen and dining area, there is also everything for cooking. </p><p>  In addition to single or double beds, the furniture also includes a wardrobe, luggage rack, and a work desk.

The maids change bed linen twice a week. </p><p>  The Rosella Hotel 3 * (Alanya) has non-smoking rooms, as well as apartments for people with reduced mobility.  For them, ramps are arranged in all public areas. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Many hotels in the world work on the concept of "all inclusive."  Rosella Hotel 3 * is no exception.  Turkey, which annually receives a huge army of tourists from all countries, is famous for the fact that almost all of its hotels operate on this system.  And here it is somewhat different from the European one. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rosella Hotel 3 Turkey" class="if" height="403" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1475603.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the main restaurant, hotel guests eat buffet.  In addition, √† la carte dishes are also available.  Once a week, a paid show with live music is arranged at the pre-booked restaurant.  The menu includes dishes from international, including Mediterranean, cuisine.  There is also a snack bar and cafe on site. </p><p>  For breakfast, fruit, orange and cherry juice, eggs in various versions, honey, jams, varieties of cheeses and sausages, side dishes are always served.  At lunch, hotel guests can try soups, rice, pasta, an abundance of salads, stews, baked vegetables, several dishes of chicken and beef. </p><p>  At four o'clock in the afternoon you can taste oriental sweets in the bar.  According to the all-inclusive concept, tea, coffee, sprite, other drinks, including alcohol from local producers, can be obtained free of charge from ten in the morning until eleven in the evening. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The swimming area is across the street.  It should be borne in mind that this is an active highway, therefore, it should be crossed only in places provided for pedestrians.  The entrance to the water is calm, on the plates.  Umbrellas and sunbeds are available for a fee.  For beach towels, you need to leave a deposit at the registration desk. </p><p>  Many people go for a swim at Cleopatra Beach, located three kilometers from Rosella Hotel 3 *, to which there are regular buses. </p><h2>  Infrastructure for children </h2><p>  At Rosella Hotel 3, the pool of which has a shallow compartment, designed for the youngest guests, there is no children's playground with swings and other types of entertainment.  The reason is in a small area.  However, a club operates in the main building for children; there is also a ‚Äúbabysitting upon request‚Äù service.  The restaurant provides high chairs for easy feeding. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rosella Hotel 3 beach" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1475606.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Nevertheless, there are always many children at the hotel who are happy to bathe both in the sea and in the shallow pool provided for them. </p><h2>  Entertainment and sports </h2><p>  On the territory of the Rosella Hotel 3 *, guests can play darts, sunbathe by the pool on comfortable sunbeds, and also use the services of a tour desk working in the lobby of the main building.  Here you can buy tours to Cappadocia and Sapadera, to the canyon, accompanied by a Russian-speaking guide. </p><p>  Every evening, the hotel organizes transfers to Alanya's nightclubs - Summer Garden and Robin Hood.  There is an opportunity to visit the restaurant Demchay with floating tables on a mountain river, where, judging by the reviews, you can eat, swim in the crystal clear mountain river, and lie in hammocks installed directly above the water. </p><h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  The Rosella Hotel 3 * has many places where you can connect to the Internet for free, including in the pool bar. </p><p>  At the entrance there is a taxi and shuttle bus, which will cost one and a half lira, regardless of driving distance.  Shuttle timetables and routes can be viewed at the reception.  The staff speaks three languages, including Russian. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Most of our compatriots chose this hotel because of factors such as excellent location and low price.  And I must say that many of them were not disappointed.  ‚ÄúAn excellent ratio of quality and price‚Äù - this is exactly what the majority of Russians who have already visited Rosella Hotel 3 * think.  Reviews about the food provided in it are also mostly positive. </p><p>  As for the work of the staff, no one has any particular complaints.  Convenient location Rosella Apart Hotel 3 * also pleased our compatriots.  The presence of numerous shops and cafes nearby, the proximity to the city center became another plus. </p><p>  The hotel area, although very small, but quite comfortable.  In the air in June-August it always smells of roses. </p><p>  As for the rooms, some were confused by their small area.  However, most Russians write that they are quite satisfied with them, because they were convenient for spending the night.  Our tourists spent the rest of the time at sea or on excursions.  And another drawback of this hotel is that of the toiletries in it, only soap is provided. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rosella Hotel 3 pool" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1475601.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  There are no complaints about the sea.  Those who went swimming and sunbathing on the famous Cleopatra Beach were especially pleased with the rest.  As for the nearby wild site, the Russians do not recommend going there in their reviews, since there is a very dangerous entrance to the water. </p><p>  Several people were unsatisfied with the assortment of dishes, believing that the meat was in short supply.  But the vast majority separately notes the cleanliness of the dining room and the speed with which the waiters served. </p><p>  To summarize, we can say with confidence: our compatriots recommend this three-star apart-hotel to those Russians who do not get attached to their place of residence on vacation and go on excursions, as well as those who are not "fixated" on comfort.  In any case, those tourists who rest in the economy class may well choose it, being sure that they will not regret it. </p>
