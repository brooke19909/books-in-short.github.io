  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The trendsetter is a bead orchid.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The queen of a flower ball, enriching the spiritual world of a person with its unique beauty, is an orchid from beads.  Poets and artists at all times dedicated their works to this magical flower, and in our time it has become very popular in such a kind of needlework as beadwork.  Orchid is an amazing flower.  Its creation captivates and fascinates.  Weaving orchids from beads is a rather long and painstaking process, but it's worth it!  Indeed, in each flower and bud you can combine a <span>huge number of a wide</span> variety of colors and shades, thereby giving full play to your imagination.  Therefore, be patient and begin this exciting process of creating a lady of flowers. </p><p>  On the open spaces of the world network there is a fairly large number of different patterns in which weaving of an <span>orchid from beads</span> is described <span>,</span> but if you wish, you can create this flower based on your own imagination only.  In its creation uses the French technique of weaving with beads.  But for convenient work, you need to prepare all the necessary materials in advance and lay out in the free space, covered with a white cloth or paper.  Surely you need flexible and rigid wires of various diameters and colored beads.  Most often, the bead orchid is made from all shades of white and green, but you can make flowers in pink and in some other way.  You will also need large beads to create the middle of the flower, a green <span>floral ribbon</span> for wrapping the stems, alabaster and, of course, a beautiful pot.  Of the tools, you will need wire cutters to cut the wire of the right size and pliers for conveniently bending the ends of the wire. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  An orchid from beads will be made up of five flowers and several buds.  First, a curly center sheet is executed.  Work begins with stringing ten to twelve beads on a thin wire, around which turns are then made.  In each ring, beads are typed arbitrarily.  The main thing is that all rows are parallel and firmly bonded to each other.  Thus, three turns are performed, and in the middle of the fourth wire is fixed and returned in the opposite direction.  Exactly the same action is done on the other hand.  The sixth and seventh row are performed in the same way. </p><p>  The next step is to create three simple petals using the French method.  To give them more volume, light beads are inserted into the darker <span>green shades of the</span> beads.  Next, you need to collect the two largest and embossed in color petals.  The lower part of which is made of green beads, and the upper - with white beads.  They must be made asymmetric to each other.  For this, the turnover is not made complete, but is brought only to the upper part of the petal, and then it turns around and goes in the opposite direction.  Two of the same leaves, large and not symmetrical, are made of bright green beads, without any additions.  It remains to make a small petal covering the beads and begin to assemble the flower. </p><p>  The lowest will be two relief petals, then two large green and three smaller ones.  At the end, the smallest petal and beads in the middle are attached.  Each leaf bends beautifully, and the flower takes on a bizarre and magical form.  Very unblown buds are collected.  They are made of two green petals interconnected.  It remains to make the bottom long sheets of green beads or glass beads and collect the whole work. </p><p>  The whole bead orchid is mounted on a thick wire wrapped, like the other branches, with a floral ribbon.  Buds, flowers, one above the other and leaves, are attached to it.  It is in this process that pliers will be needed to help firmly fix all parts of the structure.  After everything is beautifully designed and fastened, all that remains is to ‚Äúplant‚Äù the orchid in a pot using divorced alabaster.  At the end of creating the composition and for the effect of reality, small pebbles can be poured into the pot in order to cover the alabaster.  And now, evaluating your own creation, you can safely say that one of the best activities in the world that creates real masterpieces is beadwork.  Orchid will be a chic decoration of a home interior or a stunning gift for loved ones and friends. </p>
