This is not just a major city, but the capital of Lombardy.  Without exception, Italians are sure that tourists will not be interested in this industrial center.  But you can argue with them.  Although the city is considered the center of the Italian metallurgical industry, it is replete with sights, many of which have preserved a very decent appearance since its inception. </p>

    <h2>  Little story of a big city </h2><p>  Once upon a time, the city of Brescia (Italy) was called Brixia, and tsenoman lived in it.  This is a people that was known for providing active support to the ancient Romans.  The Union contributed to the fact that in a short time Brescia turned into the main city of Transpadan Gaul.  This status the settlement had until the <span>fall of the Western Roman Empire.</span>  After that, the Huns in a fairly short time plundered Brescia. </p><p>  Brescia (Italy), despite its difficult situation, managed to revive again: the city was rebuilt and continued to grow rich and prosper.  In the XII century, the village turned into a city commune, ruled by small princes, Franks, Ostrogoths and Lombards.  In the fourteenth century, Brescia became subordinate to the Visconti dynasty.  And already in the 15th century, the <span>Venetian Republic</span> took over the city under its patronage <span>.</span>  In 1849, the village was subjected to brutal bombardment, which lasted ten days, but after that he was awarded the title of “Lioness of Italy”. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

Presented here are more ancient structures belonging to the era of antiquity.  But today, only individual fragments of these objects can be seen. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The central attraction of the village is Piazza del Forro.

During the Middle Ages, basements and the foundation of the building were used to build a powerful military fortification. </p><p>  The castle was subjected to repeated sieges.  It was repeatedly destroyed and erected as many times anew.  The oldest part of the object, which managed to survive to our era, is a huge tower of a cylindrical shape - Torre Mirabella.  Behind the castle is a beautiful park with spectacular views of Brescia.  In the halls there is the Museum of weapons - one of the best in Europe. </p>

    <p>  Forum Square in the Roman era was the heart of urban life.  It was through it that the main road passed, which connected the village with Verona and Bergamo.  On it were the Basilica and the Capitoline Temple.  For many years, archaeological excavations have been carried out on the square, and Roman monuments are being recreated from the ruins in parts. </p>
