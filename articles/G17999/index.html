Its length does not reach 90 km - only 89 (in a straight line from source to mouth, the distance is 62 km). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mzymta river" class="if" height="447" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/925819.jpg" width="581"></div>  Given the above data, we can assume that the name "mad" is quite justified.  The river is especially turbulent during snowmelt, when its level rises to 5 meters

    <h2>  The origins of the beautiful river </h2><p>  Mzymta is a river whose source is near Mount Loyub, the spur of the Main Caucasian Range, is a typical mountain stream with an average slope of 33.5 m / km.  Despite the relatively small extent, it is the longest waterway flowing into the Black Sea from the territory of the Kuban.  Mzymta - a river flowing from two high-altitude lakes Maly Kadryvach and Kadryvach (the most beautiful lake in the Krasnodar Territory), originates in the Caucasian State Nature Biosphere Reserve, 44 km from Krasnaya Polyana. </p><h2>  Beauty and sights of the channel </h2>

Further along its path there are gorges, about which the poet said "a crack, the dwelling of a snake."  The Greek river formed a canyon, breaking through the ridge Aibga - Achishkho.  Below, making its way through the ridge of Akhtsu-Katsirkh, Mzymta forms its deepest canyon Akhtsu.  Then follows the ridge Akhshtyr.  Having overcome it, the river forms the gorge of Akhshtyrsky gate.  This canyon is interesting because on its starboard side, 120 meters above the river‚Äôs level, there is the Akhtyrskaya cave with an ancient man‚Äôs site.  It was discovered back in 1903 by E. A. Martel, a scientist from France.  Russian researchers have proved that the very first inhabitants of the cave were Neanderthals and settled it 70,000 years ago.  On the remaining 19 kilometers to the mouth, the river gradually expands and acquires a more or less flat character.  We can add that the catchment area of ‚Äã‚ÄãMzdymty is 885 square kilometers, and this is the largest of the pools providing Sochi with drinking water.

    <p>  In addition, it is a universal seaport, which is designed as a single complex of wave protection and berthing facilities.  It was created primarily to ensure the uninterrupted construction of Sochi Olympic facilities.  After the Olympics, it was decided to redesign the port for a yacht marina for 600-700 yachts, and in 2014 the first stage of these grandiose plans was already implemented - a marina for 40 yachts was opened.  The port is designed for 800 meters of coastline and according to the plan should have 8 berths. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The new birth of the waterfront </h2><p>  The embankment of the Mzymta River after the reconstruction envisaged by the preparations for the Olympics, solemnly opened at the end of the last month of autumn 2013.

    <p>  You can imagine the joy of the inhabitants of the city and vacationers, given the fact that the last time it was renovated 40 years ago.  The length of your favorite vacation spot and the center of social and cultural life of the district is 3 kilometers.  It should be noted that the embankment was reconstructed taking into account all the requirements of the time - for people with disabilities, ramps and tactile guiding elements appeared in the right places, allowing blind people to navigate in the direction of travel.  The promenade is beautifully decorated, many cozy benches and stalls are scattered throughout the walking route.  If you wish, you can rent rollers and bicycles here. </p><h2>  Modern beaches of a modern resort town </h2><p>  Of course, in Adler there is a beach by the river Mzymta.  All <span>Adler beaches</span> have one distinctive feature - they are covered with small round pebbles.  It has all the necessary infrastructure, plus dozens of cafes and gift shops.  On the beaches, including the Mzymta River, you can do almost all kinds of sea sports - parasailing (parachuting, tied to a boat), diving and windsurfing, you can ride a jet ski, washer and banana.  Divers are actively using breakwaters.  On the remote coast of Mzymta there is a <span>nudist beach.</span>  You can get here from the central areas of Adler by crossing the river.  It is located at a distance of 500 meters from the pier. </p><h2>  Frantic beauty </h2><p>  There are legends about the beauty of the river.  After the grandiose construction and reconstruction to which all the districts of Sochi were subjected, many sections of the river flowing through the central regions were hidden. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spill of the river mzymta" class="if" height="431" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/925823.jpg" width="533"></div>  But immediately beyond the city, the Mzymta River (photo attached) is amazing and captivates with its unusual beauty, which is called ‚Äúfrantic‚Äù in poetry, and the unusual purity of water.  Often water is called a green emerald, set in silver cliffs.  The beauty of the river is sung by more than one poet.  Trout, including rainbow trout, is found in certain sections of the river, and Black Sea salmon spawns.

    <h2>  River strength </h2><p>  It remains to talk about how <span>the</span> Mzymta River <span>spills</span> .  The latter, which happened in March 2013, eroded and demolished the dam, 700 builders were evacuated.  The dam was quickly restored, but what strength the river that carried it must possess!  <span>On March 13, the</span> river overflowed the banks as a result of continuous long-term rainfall.  The storm and rain of 2009 washed away the port and brought down all the structures in the Mzymta River. </p><h2>  Healing and wellness component </h2><p>  There are a lot of mineral springs in the Mzymta river basin.  The most famous and largest of them is the Narzan spring of Chvizheps, which is located in the village of Medvezhy Ugol.  ‚ÄúWater-hero‚Äù - this is how the word ‚Äúnarzan‚Äù is translated. It tastes good and really invigorates.  Carbon dioxide gives it a taste. </p>

    <p>  The water in this source contains a sufficient amount of useful elements, such as iodine, manganese, bromine, zinc and many others.  But the content in it of an overestimated norm of arsenic made it not useful, but harmful.  Scientists have found a way to remove excess of this element.  The resulting table water is sold in Sochi stores.  And, of course, descents and rafts are arranged for visitors on this stormy beauty-river.  Fans of extreme sports will enjoy jipping and rafting, canyon descent and rafting on catamarans.  There are also the famous Caucasian dolmens (the oldest funerary structures), alpine meadows, relic groves - you can‚Äôt count all the beauties and sights, it‚Äôs better to see them. </p>
