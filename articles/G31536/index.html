The place was called "Studenets".  It originally belonged to the Gagarin.  However, the estate was glorified by its later owner - Arseny Zakrevsky.  As a hero of the war of 1812, he became governor-general of the capital during the reign of Nicholas I. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Park Krasnaya Presnya" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/453189.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  History </h2><p>  Created in 1932 on the site of the estate and the neighboring garden of the Studenetsk Horticultural School, Krasnaya Presnya Park has a very interesting history.  In the Studenets estate, special orders for that time always prevailed.  This landowner took special care of his serfs. </p><p>  Zakrevsky turned his estate, in which he settled, having left the service, into a unique memorial complex in Moscow, and in Russia, telling about the victory of Russia.  To do this, he invited the architect Gilardi to the estate. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Park Krasnaya Presnya how to get" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/453194.jpg" width="600"></div>

But this monument of architecture and history is one of the oldest.  Each resident of the capital or guest has the opportunity, by going to the Krasnaya Presnya park in Moscow and walking along its alleys, admiring its channels with bridges.

    <h2>  Park today </h2><p>  History is breathing here in every corner.  Park "Krasnaya Presnya" (every metropolitan knows how to get to it) has an area of ​​sixteen and a half hectares.  At the beginning of the eighteenth century, on the banks of the small river Studenets, according to legend, which has healing power, the magnificent palace of the princely family of the Gagarin was still located.  But today very little remains of this historic splendor.  Busts of war heroes were destroyed during the revolution.  And later, the socialist regime also destroyed the system of reservoirs for which the Gagarin Ponds were so famous, around which the Krasnaya Presnya Park was spread. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to get there - tourist information </h2><p>  This place for recreation and entertainment is located at: Mantulinskaya Street, 5. Indigenous people who often come to Krasnaya Presnya Park know how to get to it very well.  But tourists can take the subway and then go on foot.  The closest to the park is the Vystavochnaya station - just seven hundred meters away.  From the stations "Ulitsa 1905 goda" and "Mezhdunarodnaya" twenty minutes walk. </p>

    <p>  Krasnaya Presnya Park, whose photo is evidence that everyone will find entertainment to their liking, is open to everyone from nine in the morning until ten in the evening.  Each visitor will be able to discover something special and interesting. </p><p>  Those who come here to relax should definitely go to the Tuscan column, which was erected in honor of the victory in the Patriotic War of the twelfth year.  It came to us from the Studenets estate and is made of white stone.  The column is decorated with scabbard and wreaths, and once it was crowned with a winged figure holding a sword in his hand, but it disappeared over time. </p><p>  Other masterpieces of antiquity have survived to our days, for example, “Octagon” - an octagonal fountain - a water pump, created by Gilardi and survived the Soviet era. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In recent years, Krasnaya Presnya Park has acquired various fashionable innovations: workout sites, a skate park.  According to the memoirs of old-timers, before, although it was considered a picturesque place, in the Soviet years it was quite “wild”.  Today, it offers entertainment for every taste: from rental bikes to the open library.  Entrance to the park is free. </p><p>  On summer days, children come here with their parents and the elderly.  In the evenings, you can meet young people - companies and couples in love who have chosen for themselves the benches and nooks with which the Krasnaya Presnya Park abounds. </p>

    <h2><br>  activity </h2><p>  The former Studenets estate is replete with entertainment today, most of which are provided free of charge.  Events such as classes and competitions in qigong gymnastics and fitness are held here.  The park management pleases guests and residents of the capital with a variety of event posters.  Every weekend, dances and programs for children, chess tournaments, author's evenings, festivals and animation programs, and markets are organized here.  There are always celebrations <span>for Children's Day,</span> in honor of Victory Day, etc. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Former homestead" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10393/453543.jpg" width="540"></div></h2><h2>  For the smallest </h2><p>  For parents, this is a great children's park.  Krasnaya Presnya is equipped with such a popular skatepark among teenagers, made in a format that is not traditional for our country.  Bends or skate-plaz of this site completely repeat the natural landscape, and numerous obstacles are made as an imitation of the street. </p><p>  In the park you can rent bicycles, which have become especially popular among Muscovites this season.  Their rental point is located directly next to the skatepark.  In addition, here you can drive on cycle and electric cars, many ride on ATVs and roller skates.  The rental price ranges from fifty to four hundred rubles, depending on the vehicle and time. </p><h2>  Reading room <strong></strong></h2>

    <p>  Another innovation that replenished the Krasnaya Presnya park this year is the open-air reading room.  She works on a bookcrossing system, very common in the world today.  The principle is as follows: the reader of the book transfers it to another.  Such a system has already been introduced in the capital's parks - this is the "Books in the Parks" project.  Literature can be selected in a special stall.  And although you can enjoy literature in the fresh air only in clear cloudless weather, since on a rainy day it is hardly possible, nevertheless there are always a lot of people who want to. </p><p>  It is not easy to find this open reading room in the park, rugged by canals, intersecting with "humpbacked" bridges.  You just need to focus on the wooden houses located on the central alley, as well as on the sun loungers that are visible from afar and are set here especially for fans to read. </p><h2>  Summer cinema <strong></strong></h2><p>  In the best traditions, Krasnaya Presnya Park also has its own summer cinema.  For this purpose, a stage is equipped here.  And numerous spectators are located to view directly on the wooden floor or on ottomans and chairs.  An excellent view opens from the benches located on the sides.  Movie shows are free.  The schedule of the summer cinema can be found on the official website of the park, as well as at the entrance, where a huge stand hangs.  In his free time from a large movie screening, creative meetings or performances by musicians, actors and directors take place on the pop stage. </p><h2>  Lecture hall </h2>

    <p>  Krasnaya Presnya was also chosen by the International School of Design for its summer lectures and classes, located under a tent on a small island in the very center of the park.  Everyone who comes here on <span>weekdays,</span> from twelve o'clock can attend the seminars of teachers of the school on a variety of topics, including graphic and <span>landscape design.</span> </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Many visitors admit that this is not a very good situation in the park today.  The only restaurant at the main entrance was closed for reconstruction.  Therefore, you can have a bite to eat at the Vienna Sausages kiosk, where, after spending about two hundred rubles, you can eat well.  Nearby there is a vending machine with food and drinks - with chocolates, soda, juices and coffee.  And next to the stage there is a tent selling coffee with itself, various snacks and homemade lemonade. </p>
