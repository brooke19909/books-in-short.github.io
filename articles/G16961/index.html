    <h2>  From the history of Disneyland </h2><p>  Plans to build a unique amusement park in Europe appeared in 1975.  This happened nine years after the great Walt Disney left us.  Several countries claimed to create the complex - Spain, Britain, France, Italy.  The main rivals were Italy and France, but soon Britain and Italy got out of the fight because they could not offer a suitable territory for construction. </p><p>  The International Commission considered the Spanish option for construction in the Alicante region.  This place had a climate similar to Florida, but the main drawback of this place was taken into account - the cold Mistral wind blowing from the north-west.  As a result, a small French town won an unconditional victory in the struggle.  This place had decisive advantages over competitors: </p><ul><li>  location in the center of Western Europe; </li><li>  proximity to Paris. </li></ul>

According to their estimates, seventeen million visitors could get here in less than two hours by car, and three hundred million people could arrive at the amusement park using the services of airlines. </p><p>  The first unofficial opening of the park took place in 1992.  Invited were the project sponsors with members of their families.  Disneyland in Paris officially began its work on April 12, 1992.  On this <span>day, designers,</span> builders and, of course, the project sponsors expected to see half a million guests, but only in the evening they counted only about fifty thousand visitors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="france disneyland tours" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/457905.jpg" width="600"></div>
