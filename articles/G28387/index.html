    <h2>  Appearance in Russia </h2><p>  <span>Prince Oleg,</span> whose biography is only briefly known to us, is considered the founder of the Old Russian State.  He was a relative of the legendary Varangian Rurik, that is, he was the brother of Efanda - the wife of the commander.  It is believed that he was an ordinary governor, whom the Viking immensely trusted.  Otherwise, would he have instructed him to take away his infant son?  It is to be assumed that Oleg acted in agreement with Rurik, and perhaps he had a certain freedom.  One way or another, but quite quickly he took possession of Smolensk and Lyubech, and then Kiev.  By the way, the golden-domed city was captured by cunning: the Varangian lured from the walls of <span>Askold and Dir</span> (who were also probably Vikings) and killed them, declaring himself a prince. </p>

    <h2>  Achievements and Successes </h2><p>  Prince Oleg, whose biography is considered in this article, strengthened his power either by enlisting the support of the Slavic tribes neighboring Kiev, or by subjugating them.  He established a tribute for them, which did not weigh heavily on people.  But his military successes were really impressive.  Campaigns against the Khazars saved the Russian lands from the need to pay the Kaganate polyde.  The great Tsargrad fell, on the gates of which, according to the annals, the prince nailed his shield.  As a result, Russian merchants could trade with Byzantium without duties and receive all kinds of support from it.  Thus, Prince Oleg the Prophet, whose brief biography is considered above, has more merits to Russia than Rurik.  Moreover, almost nothing is known about the founder of the princely dynasty. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hike to Constantinople </h2><p>  Prince Oleg, whose brief biography is covered in the Tale of Bygone Years, is an outstanding person.  He organized the famous campaign to Constantinople, after which he received his nickname - Prophetic.  The chronicle says that he sent a huge army to the city on two thousand boats.  Each boat housed four dozen combatants.  The emperor ordered to close the gates of the capital, leaving the suburbs and villages to be torn to pieces by enemies.  But the Kiev prince ordered the wheels to be attached to the ships, on which the army reached the gates of Constantinople.  The Byzantines were at a loss, so they gave up, offering Oleg a generous tribute and peace. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="prince oleg prophetic brief biography" class="if" height="415" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/580129.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Was there a hike? </h2><p>  Prince Oleg, whose brief biography is found in almost every history textbook, is a controversial figure.  Researchers have more questions than answers about his life.  For example, the fact of a trip to Byzantium seems unreliable.  This is because the authors from Constantinople described in detail all the attacks on their country, but they do not mention Oleg‚Äôs campaign.  In addition, the return from Constantinople of Oleg and Vladimir the Great are very similar.  Perhaps this is a description of the same event.  At the same time, after Oleg, Igor also went to the southern city, who also won.  This is stated by European authors who chronicled those years. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kiev prince Oleg biography" class="if" height="457" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/580128.jpg" width="600"></div>

The Varangian was superstitious, so he sat on another animal, and entrusted the pet to the servants, ordering him to take care of him until his death.

    <p>  Prince Oleg, whose biography has long been studied, could die by another death.  And the legend of the horse and the serpent may have been borrowed from the saga of Orward Odd.  Although some scientists believe that the hero of the Scandinavian tales and Prophetic Oleg are one and the same person.  But there are several facts that allow us to think about whether there could be a plot about the death of the prince true.  Among them are the following: </p><p>  - Could a snake bite through a leather boot worn by <span>noble people</span> in Russia?  Most likely not, or did Oleg come up the mountain to the bones of a horse barefoot? </p><p>  - And what if the snake jumped and bit the prince above the bootleg?  But on the territory of Ukraine in <span>the Kiev region</span> there are no such vipers! </p><p>  - As a rule, a snake hisses and tries to crawl before stinging.  Could Oleg or his close associates not notice this? </p><p>  As an option, the prince died from poison, but a snake was slipped to him on purpose, or they poisoned Oleg in advance.  Establish where the truth, unfortunately, is impossible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="prince oleg biography" class="if" height="395" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/580127.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Some more interesting facts </h2><p>  Russian prince Oleg, whose biography is already known to the reader, is mentioned not only in the annals of Kiev and Novgorod.  Al-Masoudi (Arabian author) speaks of the unsuccessful campaign of the Rus (500 ships!) On the forehead with Olvang and Al-Dir to Persia.  They gave part of the booty to the Khazars, but the latter betrayed them and killed everyone.  About thirty thousand combatants died there, and those who retreated beyond the Caspian were killed by the Volga Bulgars.  Thus, the legendary prince died in the campaign, as befits a brave Varangian. </p><p>  Here he is, the clever and warlike prince Oleg.  His biography is full of white spots, because of which around this figure a halo of mystery and mystery remains.  Perhaps time will find answers to all questions. </p>
