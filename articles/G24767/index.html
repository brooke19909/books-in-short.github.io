In order to take a loan, you need to submit an application on the website or call the hotline.  When a client takes a loan from Tinkoff Bank, they explain in detail how to pay it.  But the time comes to fulfill debt obligations and all the information from the head disappears.  There are several ways to recharge a credit card.  You can use one, but you can use different ones - it doesn’t matter if the payment is received on time. </p><h2>  Payment Methods </h2><p>  There are many ways to pay Tinkoff.  You can pay by bank transfer, or in cash, inside the bank or with the help of third-party organizations.  The bank made sure that the client could fulfill debt obligations without any problems. </p><h2>  Tinkoff Bank Payment Points </h2><div class="photo" data-original="akket.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="coherent store" class="if uuid-2982528" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95252/2982528.jpg"></div><p>  The Bank offers its customers more than 300,000 card recharge points throughout Russia.  Even in the most remote corners of the country there are at least 2 points of payment.  In order not to look for where to pay for a long time, Tinkoff Bank posted information on recharge points on the official website. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Most of them are in any city: </p><ul><li>  Post of Russia. </li><li>  Salons of mobile communication "MTS", "Beeline", "Megaphone". </li><li>  Offices of payment systems "Golden Crown", "Unistream", "QIWI". </li><li>  Hardware and electronics stores Euroset, Svyaznoy. </li></ul><p>  You can do without outside help and replenish your credit card through numerous terminals: Come Pay, Hoy Xay, CyberPlat, Eleksnet, Platforma, Maximus, Amigo. </p><p>  When paying through a hardware-software complex, it is not out of place to adhere to simple recommendations: </p><ul><li>  Money should be trusted only to popular and serviceable terminals. </li><li>  Before you put the money, you must familiarize yourself with the terms of the commission fee. </li><li>  Clarify the timing of the transfer.  Not all companies credit funds immediately; they can go up to 3 days. </li><li>  After the operation, it is necessary to pick up and save the check until the money arrives on the card. </li></ul><h2>  How to pay a loan to Tinkoff Bank through the official website </h2><div class="photo" data-original="nvk1.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tinkoff bank" class="if uuid-2982539" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95252/2982539.jpg"></div><p>  After the loan is approved and issued, you need to go to the bank’s website and register (if no such actions have been performed before).  Through a personal account, you can carry out various operations, write to the bank if you have questions.  It is also possible to pay a loan under the Tinkoff website or send an application for its recalculation (postponement, early repayment). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You can repay the debt from any card, the main thing is that there should be a sufficient amount on it.  Payment of the loan is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Find the "Payments" section and select "Repayment of loans." </li><li>  Below you will see a list of all possible organizations of the region in which the client has permanent registration through which payment can be made.  The region can always be changed. </li><li>  Select the appropriate option and click on the icon. </li><li>  In the column “Contract number” and in all the others (they differ slightly in different organizations), the corresponding values ​​are entered. </li><li>  After filling in the SMS will come to the phone with a transaction confirmation code. </li></ol><p>  With this payment option, third-party organizations that take a commission are involved.

The application, in fact, is the same site, only compact, so the procedure is similar. </p><ol><li>  In the "Pay" section, select "Transfers". </li><li>  Click the “From card to card” icon. </li><li>  In the tab that opens, fill in the card number of the sender and recipient, as well as the amount. </li><li>  A confirmation message will be sent to the phone.  It is entered and click "Translate". </li></ol><p>  If the debt is repaid from a third-party bank card, a fee may be charged.  In the future, if the loan is paid for at the same details, you can simply add this payment to your favorites.  There is no need to enter card numbers each time, and the indicated amount is also saved.  It will only be necessary to confirm, enter the code and carry out the transfer. </p><h2>  Payment systems </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="gold Crown" class="if uuid-2982481" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95252/2982481.jpg"></div><p>  You can pay a loan at Tinkoff using the contract number through money transfer systems.  All organizations by region are presented on the bank's website.  There you can through them you can pay off the debt by bank transfer. </p><p>  If there are no funds on the card or current account, but only cash, you can pay the loan at service points.  The most popular (due to the fact that their points are available in each city) are the Golden Crown and Contact. </p><p>  To pay for a loan at points of any payment system, you will need a passport, contract number and cash.  When making money, it is necessary to inform the operator that the funds are intended to replenish the account at Tinkoff Credit Systems Bank.  Money comes during the day. </p><p>  Advantages of electronic payment systems: </p><ul><li>  no transfer fee is charged to Tinkoff, because the Golden Crown and several other organizations are partners of the bank; </li><li>  wide network of points of reception; </li><li>  most systems have proven to be reliable; </li><li>  one of relatives or friends can top up the account, the main thing is that he has a passport and an agreement number; </li><li>  the maximum term for crediting money is one day; </li><li>  if there is no Russian currency, there is no need to look for an exchanger.  Money can be converted at the point of payment acceptance at an acceptable rate and with a very small commission. </li></ul><h2>  Post of Russia </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="postal transfer form" class="if uuid-2982474" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95252/2982474.jpg"></div><p>  Tinkoff Bank has a large partner network.  One of the partners is the Russian Post.  Through its branches you can not only replenish, but also get a credit card.  You must take your passport and the amount in cash with you.  You can pay Tinkoff by the contract number in the following ways: </p><ul><li>  request a bank transfer receipt and print it after it arrives by e-mail.  All bank details on it will be indicated.  It is necessary to enter the payment amount and passport data in the appropriate columns; </li><li>  in the absence of a receipt, you must take the usual electronic transfer form by mail and fill it out yourself.  In the column "Message" enter a unique number that comes via SMS after a request to the bank.  You can get it in advance or by calling on a multi-channel phone, while in the post office. </li></ul><p>  A receipt or form must be given to the operator who will check the data, take cash and complete the operation. </p><p>  The maximum transfer amount by mail is 500 thousand rubles.  The duration of the transfer is from 1 hour to 2 days.  The latter must be taken into account if the loan is paid on time. </p><h2>  How to pay Tinkoff through third-party banks </h2><p>  The most familiar and reliable way to repay a loan is through a bank branch.  The operator will fill in all the papers on his own, you only need to sign them and make the required amount. </p><p>  But debt is payable in Tinkoff, as you know, only remotely.  It is also possible to repay the debt through the physical branch of the bank, only the bank should be different. </p><p>  For the transfer you will need all the details (including TIN, BIK), information about the loan agreement.  If the debt is repaid from the card, then its details will be needed.  After providing all the data, the operator forms an agreement in which the amount of payment is prescribed taking into account the commission.  In different banks, it makes up from 1 to 3% of the transfer amount.  Translation speed also varies from a few hours to 3 days. </p><h2>  How to pay arrears through the terminal </h2><div class="photo" data-original="spbit.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tinkoff terminals" class="if uuid-2982494" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95252/2982494.jpg"></div><p>  Tinkoff Bank does not have offices, but it has its own terminals.  Most often they are located in shopping centers. </p><p>  Tinkoff terminals, which can be paid through without commission, are equipped with convenient navigation.  The system itself prompts and directs in the course of action.  In the main menu, find “Loan repayment” and select “Tinkoff Bank”.  All the necessary data is entered into the corresponding lines.  Money after transaction confirmation is credited instantly. </p><h2>  Loan repayment rules </h2><div class="photo" data-original="kredit-ka.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="credit card" class="if uuid-2982508" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95252/2982508.jpg"></div><p>  Debts to the bank pretty much spoil life.  Untimely fulfillment of credit obligations strikes not only the wallet, but also destroys some plans.  There are few financial organizations that lend to citizens with bad credit history, and if they do, then at huge interest rates.  In order not to be on the list of debtors, you must adhere to the following rules: </p><ul><li>  you must immediately determine the methods of payment of the loan.  When choosing, you must consider the availability, speed of transfer and the size of the commission; </li><li>  when repaying a debt, first of all, it is necessary to find out the maximum term of transfer.  Delay in payment threatens with additional charges on the loan; </li><li>  it so happens that it is not possible to pay a loan at Tinkoff through its partners.  The amount for repayment must be calculated taking into account the interest that the organization takes for the transaction; </li><li>  If there is any doubt that the payment will be completed on time, you can scan the receipt and send it to the bank.  This will be a confirmation of good faith. </li></ul>
