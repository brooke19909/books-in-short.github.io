This is a fairly necessary and useful skill.  Sewing will help not only to darn socks, but also to tackle the remaking of old things, while creating something new, fashionable, unique.  This skill is especially useful if you want to stand out or have insufficient income.  As for remaking old things, using it you can give a new life not only to old clothes, but also to some other objects, the main thing is dexterity and fantasy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="roseboutiqueplus.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY alterations" class="if uuid-2344225" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47527/2344225.jpg"></div><h2>  New life of spoiled clothes </h2><p>  Each person has a favorite sweater or shirt.  It often happens that a spot was planted on your favorite blouse or an unplanned hole appeared, what should I do?  Fantasy and skillful hands will help to freshen clothes and restore their presentation, many of the shortcomings can be masked if not corrected.  And what a nuisance a hole in a son‚Äôs new jacket gives, many mothers know this. </p><p>  The seams look ugly, they must be hidden and masked.  For example, a damaged jacket, after the hole has been darned, is difficult to decorate with a patch or a special sticker on the fabric.  Spots at the chest level of your favorite sweater that are not amenable to the stain remover can be hidden under bead embroidery or lace applique.  Girls who are accustomed to attention and prefer aggressive subtypes of styles, choose decorative jewelry from rivets, sequins and chains.  Gentle and romantic women prefer floral ornament and lace.  In general, the second life of old things and the alteration of the basic wardrobe is an interesting occupation, and the final result will depend only on the craftsmanship of the needlewoman. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="wonderfuldiy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Denim Decor" class="if uuid-2344222" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47527/2344222.jpg"></div><p>  The frayed sleeves on the jacket can simply be replaced with new ones, such fabric elastic is inexpensive, and the jacket will look much better and neater.  Pair brooches and collar decoration with sequins and sequins diversify the wardrobe and make the image brighter, while perfectly concealing the traces of foundation left after machine washing. </p><h2>  Do it yourself </h2><p>  Fashion does not spare anyone, constantly reminding constant updates to those who simply don‚Äôt have enough money, that they can‚Äôt afford to buy anything they want.  Unfortunately, there are many such people in our country, and everyone wants to be beautiful and modern.  The fact is that people with imagination, zeal and hard work can even turn old things into a great fashionable wardrobe.  The best friend of such masters of remaking old things is second-hand, everything is cheap and affordable there, and in case of failure it will not be so offensive.  What can be done from old things? </p><h2>  Denim mini skirt </h2><p>  In the 90s and 2000s, denim skirts long to heels were very popular, many girls probably remember these with their mothers.  This wardrobe item can be an excellent source material, you can find it in the bins in the attic or simply purchased as clothing by weight. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Before shortening and suturing the skirt, it is necessary to measure it and put marks on which the product will be sutured and shortened.  In general, you can shorten and bring into proper form absolutely any skirt, the main thing is that the fabric is not damaged and not be mistaken with the length. </p><p>  You can use anything you like to decorate the skirt, but to ‚Äúfluff‚Äù the edges, you need to rub them with a pumice stone (works only with denim).  You can also use the bottom left over from the original product for a skirt, but it will be a little more complicated: </p><ul><li>  In order for the skirt to get the desired length, it is necessary to measure and cut the desired number of centimeters. </li><li>  Side seams are cut, taking into account the measurements from the hips and waist, the seams are stitched and stitched. </li><li>  Tucks are outlined and stitched. </li></ul><p>  The top of the skirt is worked out at the discretion of the craftswoman, someone will prefer to insert an elastic band, well, someone will create a full-fledged belt with a snake that will look aesthetically pleasing. </p><h2>  Delicate skirt made of stole </h2><p>  For such a product, you will need an old but not lost trade dress stole, a thin lace, preferably not from shoes.  The sides and top of the material are wrapped, the top is sewn, a lace or elastic is inserted into it, at the discretion of the author of the product.  The lighter the fabric - the more tender the skirt will be; knitwear should not be used.  For the lace you need to make 2 holes. </p><h2>  T-shirt dresses </h2><p>  This is a separate topic, modern craftswomen have come up with a large number of different ways to alter a large T-shirt in a cute dress.  It is remarkable and simply fashionable to make a dress with cuts on the sides.  To do this, you will need: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  Great T-shirt. </li><li>  Scissors. </li><li>  Needle and thread. </li></ul><p>  If there is dexterity and desire, you can perform cutting without marks and trying on, but for beginners, it is better to turn to marking. </p><p>  Sleeves must be cut off the t-shirt, because they look ugly on a dress of this style.  The t-shirt is cut horizontally under the chest, while the location of the underwear should be taken into account.  It is necessary to make a hole in the upper part, and a small incision in the lower part, exactly in the middle of the front part at the waist.  The ends of the cut must be threaded from different sides into the hole and stitched securely. </p><div class="photo" data-original="allforfashiondesign.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Remaking dresses long maxi" class="if uuid-2344219" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47527/2344219.jpg"></div><h2>  Things from old t-shirts </h2><p>  No wonder girls love men's t-shirts so much, besides convenience they give room for imagination.  You can do a lot of things from a simple big T-shirt, from a dress to a top, a skirt and other items of women's wardrobe.  T-shirt decor has a special place, it all depends on the fabric and available resources.  If there are rivets, then you can make a mesh on the back or sleeves by simply cutting the material into thin strips and connecting it into the mesh using threads or rivets. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Remaking t-shirts" class="if uuid-2344191" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47527/2344191.jpg"></div><p>  A short top can not even be sheathed.  And to make it simple enough, but first you need to decide how deep the neckline will be and what is the width of the straps.  You can also decorate a tight-fitting T-shirt with knots and weaves on the back. </p><h2>  From adult clothes to the nursery </h2><p>  The topic is interesting in itself by the fact that not many mothers can afford to replace and expand a children's wardrobe, and many simply don‚Äôt like what they sell for little mods in specialized stores.  The constant faces of the cartoon characters, an unnecessarily large number of frills and other "cute" little things, because of their congestion giving the dress the look of a cake or the creation of a crazy designer, but I want something simple, gentle and flying, convenient. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.diys.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gorgeous dress" class="if uuid-2344197" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47527/2344197.jpg"></div><p>  The simplest thing is to sew a dress for a girl of 2-4 years old, at this age there is no figure as such, and the trapezoid dress looks great on all girls without exception.  The master class of remaking old things in a children's dress implies the presence of the following components: </p><ul><li>  The old thing.  It can be a dad‚Äôs unloved shirt, an old mother‚Äôs sweater or a T-shirt, in general, all that is not a pity. </li><li>  Measure the child.  If the dress is cut out with a margin, then 1-2 cm to the parameters will be enough, anyway, if the child is not too neat, the new thing will not live for more than three months, especially if you like the product. </li><li>  Threads to match the product, or at least a little matching the color, otherwise the general appearance will not be very neat. </li><li>  Sewing machine.  With her, you can make a new dress faster, more accurately, and at the exit the seams will be much stronger, which is very important if the child is mobile and active. </li></ul><p>  The pattern of a simple dress-a-line consists of 5-6 details: sleeves 2 pcs., Back, front, small semicircular pieces of fabric for sheathing, the collar can be made in the form of decor - frills from lace, ribbon or other improvised material.  Sleeves can be a separate part, in which case they can be either long or short in a variant of a continuous pattern.  The number of parts depends largely on the model of the future product. </p><p>  Remaking old things in an acceptable dress starts with an iron, without this preliminary stage it will be quite difficult to carry out normal and accurate marking.  After ironing a shirt or other initial thing, it is necessary to unscrew it, markings will not be visible on the wrong side, this will look aesthetically pleasing, especially since the dress will be sewn on the wrong side.  The dress itself can be either with sleeves or without. </p><p>  Before work, measurements should be taken of the length of the dress, the size of the neck, the length of the shoulder, the circumference of the chest and calculated half-circumference, the length from the neck to the chest.  Next, a pattern is made. </p><p>  Before flashing the product with a machine, it is necessary to carefully sweep away all the seams, it is advisable to try on the child and fit the figure, if necessary. </p><h2>  Old leather jacket </h2><p>  The modern fashion industry not only dictates the rules, but also leaves room for maneuver and imagination.  If the old dermatine jacket has become unusable due to a small scuff or hole, then there is always the opportunity to put it in order.  Working with materials such as leather and dermatin leaves no room for error: excess punctures, traces of glue on the products are not just visible, they will attract attention.  It‚Äôs worth it to be careful, however, as with all the remodeling of things with your own hands from the old to the new. </p><p>  Shabby sleeves can be sheathed with lace, fur, fabric or embroidery, shoulders subject to damage will be decorated with impromptu epaulets.  Sometimes it‚Äôs not possible to bring the damaged jacket into proper form, then it can make excellent products like handbags, headphone covers, woven bracelets and everything else, which is more related to accessories.  Altering old things with their own hands in fashionable and new ones will help diversify the wardrobe.  And also make any zone in the house as functional as possible.  A drop of perseverance and ingenuity sometimes gives a very good effect in the form of unique things. </p><h2>  Alteration of old things with their own hands for obese women </h2><p>  This is a rather interesting section, because sometimes your favorite things get small not because of the accelerated growth of the body.  So, how can you change a thing and return it from the mezzanine to the wardrobe, if it is small?  Jeans are a convenient and practical thing, but it is extremely unpleasant to find that they do not fit, this happens for various reasons, for example, the product sat down under the influence of high temperatures.  You can correct this injustice by changing the size of the jeans themselves.  To do this, triangular pieces of dense, sometimes denim, fabric are inserted into the side seams.  This maneuver allows you to expand the product by several sizes.  Photos of remaking old things into fashionable and stylish can be found in our article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thegildedthimble.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Remaking a wedding dress" class="if uuid-2344189" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47527/2344189.jpg"></div><p>  Comfortably and without harm to appearance, you can change the size of clothes with allowances for seams.  Clothing manufacturers often leave from a few millimeters to a few centimeters for allowances, which is very convenient when you need to increase clothes, thanks to this, the conversion of old things into fashionable ones will be successful.  It is worth approaching this very carefully, after evaluating the condition and capabilities of the material.  For example, fabrics like chiffon or silk simply do not suffer damage, holes from the needle will be very visible on them, and remaking old clothes into fashionable ones requires accuracy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="styleclinic.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fashion Makeover Ideas" class="if uuid-2344229" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47527/2344229.jpg"></div><p>  Inserts are an ancient way to fit a thing to a figure, if it is small, you can use them now, most importantly, have at least a small, but still a sense of taste.  Not every thing can be changed, and a thorough remaking of old things into new ones may ultimately fail. </p><h2>  Do-it-yourself home improvement </h2><p>  Own housing is a woman‚Äôs temple, she is responsible for comfort, it is she who makes the house the place where you want to return to under any circumstances.  In the arrangement of the hearth, considerable importance is attached to products created by the mistress herself.  From old things you can make not only a rag, but also much more, would be fantasy. </p><h2>  Bath mat </h2><p>  Over time, every housewife accumulates a lot of old and unnecessary things, but many women have the so-called Plyushkina syndrome, save up various trifles, not even allowing the thought of disposing of their ‚Äútreasures‚Äù.  A lot of useful things can be made from such rubbish, one of them is a bath mat.  To create the product, you will need plastic bags, scissors and a hook, the head of which will be slightly thicker than the material for knitting.  Creating a product consists of the following steps: </p><ol><li>  Material preparation.  Handles and adhesions are cut from the bags, after which the source material is cut in a spiral into a tape, the width of which depends only on the manufacturer‚Äôs wishes, the dependence is simple - the wider the tape, the thicker the mat. </li><li>  The resulting tape is wound into a ball, solely for the convenience of further work, all subsequent tapes are connected in a single strip. </li><li>  Further, everything is crocheted according to the principle of circular knitting.  The size of the mat is regulated only by the amount of materials. </li></ol><p>  It is possible to produce such decorative elements not only from polyethylene, but also from long rags according to the same principles, the difference in products will only be in care.  New ideas for remaking old things regularly appear on home economics sites. </p><p>  You can get a soft and lush bath mat, bedside area and other needs using old towels, a flannelette blanket or a terry plaid.  The manufacturing steps will be as follows: </p><ul><li>  Training.  The source material must be cut into individual tapes about 5 cm wide. </li><li>  All the resulting material should be divided into 3 equal parts, sew each part together, the output should be 3 long ribbons. </li><li>  The next step will be braiding. </li><li>  Next, you need to curl the braid so that a circle is obtained, fastening together with threads on the wrong side of the product. </li></ul><p>  Such a rug can be cleaned in a washing machine, provided that the tapes were well bonded to each other.  Such products can be decorated with appliqu√©s, and dermatin, knitting threads and, in general, everything that can be woven can be present as the starting material. </p><h2>  Containers </h2><p>  Each thing should have its own place, and for this you need as many shelves as possible.  You can make a standard container with cells at home, using only improvised materials.  The easiest way is to use a simple cardboard box and paper.  Paper is required for decoration, but it needs to be fixed with glue, it is desirable to use glue stick, it will be more accurate to work with it. </p><ul><li>  It is necessary to cut off absolutely all the elements of the lid from the box, but they should not be thrown out, in the future they will be needed to create partitions. </li><li>  The inside of the box must be pasted over with white paper.  In general, the color can be absolutely any, the main thing is to like the needlewoman. </li><li>  The partitions are cut out of the lid, connected using notches at the top and bottom of the workpiece, before installing in place, it is required to glue out of paper for a more accurate appearance. </li><li>  The next step will be the exterior decor of the box, it can be done either using wrapping paper or using fabric. </li></ul><p>  Such a technique will help to create not only convenient and functional boxes, but also jewelry boxes for little fashionista‚Äôs jewelry, containers for underwear.  Creative alteration of old things will not leave indifferent guests in the house and make the interior more lively. </p><h2>  Pillows </h2><p>  Textile products have long been perceived by man as an integral part of a cozy interior.  Pillows make even the most austere room comfortable and convenient, to say nothing of a children's room or bedroom, these things are simply necessary there, and you can get unique in appearance by remaking old things with your own hands.  It is worth noting that at present, hand-made things have become more popular than ever, unlike the Soviet era, when they were a necessity due to shortages.  Alteration of old things can become fascinating and interesting, and the pillows themselves can be of any color, shape and with absolutely any decor. </p><p>  As a filler for the product, you can use not only specialized goods, but also the old packing, sintepon from the old jacket, the remains of old toys.  Depending on the filler and the density of the packing, the pillow will have a different degree of hardness.  It is better to use a dense opaque fabric as a breastplate, without the ability to stretch, so it will look neater. </p><p> Pillowcases - this is exactly the part of the pillow on which the fantasy can be fully played out.  They can be embroidered, made applique, use several types of fabric and various finishing materials - lace, beads, ribbons and more.  Recently, pillowcases from shirts have become very popular, in their manufacture remain a collar and buttons, thereby obtaining a stylish, cute and functional thing.  It‚Äôs comfortable to sleep on it and trimmings do not interfere, of course, if you turn the product over. </p><h2>  Useful little things for home </h2><p>  Remaking homework from old things is not the last thing in the minds of every housewife; it‚Äôs better to store things prepared for future creativity in one place and compactly packed.  Girls and women generally tend to keep little things like rhinestones, sequins, beads, plaques and other little things cut off from old things. </p><p>  What can be created when remaking old things for a child?  To begin with, you can sew with your own hands special pockets with ribbons, which will be very convenient to hang on the bed and store the little things the child needs like a bottle or toy.  This simple thing can be made not only from fabric, but also from dermatin, and you can decorate with anything the master wants. </p><p>  Remaking old things into fashionable new ones requires much more ingenuity and energy than just creating clothes from a new fabric, but the result is worth it.  Firstly - such a thing will be cheaper than the counterparts from the store.  Secondly, you can always update an already boring wardrobe without committing any particularly complicated actions.  The creation process itself is fascinating and interesting, it allows each fashionista to reveal herself and feel like a creator.  Not to mention the uniqueness of the created thing, which also significantly affects the mood of every girl, because anyone wants to be unique and unique. </p>
