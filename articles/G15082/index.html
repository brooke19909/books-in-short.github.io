    <h2>  General information about UniCredit Bank </h2><p>  Before exploring exactly where and in what quantity the UniCredit Bank ATMs in Moscow are represented, we will consider the basic information about the respective credit and financial organization. </p><p>  UniCredit is an international brand that operates in the markets of about 50 countries, including Russia.  About 9,300 offices of this bank are open in the world.  In Russia, the financial institution, which is now called UniCredit, was opened in 1989 - it is, therefore, one of the first domestic commercial banks.  Initially, this organization was called the International Moscow Bank.  Its shareholders were other major banking institutions - VEB, Sberbank, and a number of foreign credit organizations.  IMB is considered the first commercial bank to become a participant in trading operations on international markets. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Under the UniCredit brand, the bank has been operating in the Russian market since 2007.  The institution provides a wide range of financial services to citizens and organizations.  In particular, it provides servicing of bank cards issued by the organization.  UniCredit Bank ATMs in Moscow and other Russian cities are represented by a very large-scale network of service devices.  In addition, the financial institution under consideration is actively building partnerships with other well-known financial market brands in the field of plastic card service.  We will study this area of ‚Äã‚ÄãUniCredit in more detail. </p><h2>  Development of UniCredit card servicing infrastructure: agreement with Raiffeisenbank </h2><p>  Among the most noteworthy facts that testify to the active work of UniCredit regarding the development of the infrastructure for servicing plastic cards is the conclusion of a partnership agreement with Raiffeisenbank in 2013.  The essence of this contract is to unite the ATM networks of both major financial brands. </p>

    <p>  It is noteworthy that the infrastructure of Raiffeisenbank and the UniCredit Bank ATMs in Moscow and throughout Russia were combined in the regions where both credit and financial institutions operated.  The total number of devices for servicing cards at Raiffeisenbank at that time was about 2 thousand units, at UniCredit - about 1 thousand. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In accordance with an agreement signed by banks, cardholders issued by financial institutions can use an integrated network of devices in such a way as to withdraw cash from their accounts without commission.  For Raiffeisenbank, combining an ATM network with UniCredit infrastructure was not new: by that time, the financial institution had already entered into a similar agreement with Rosbank.  As a result, his clients got the opportunity to withdraw cash without commission in more than 6 thousand devices for servicing cards throughout Russia. </p><p>  The same can be said about UniCredit.  The fact is that at the time of the conclusion of the contract with Raiffeisenbank, the relevant financial institution had signed a similar agreement with the IBC.  As a result, customers got the opportunity to use not only UniCredit Bank ATMs in Moscow, but also devices for servicing cards from the ICD, which totaled about 3.7 thousand units. </p><h2>  Development of UniCredit card service infrastructure: agreement with Uralsib </h2><p>  Another well-known brand with which UniCredit has signed a partnership agreement in the framework of card services is Uralsib.  A contract between financial institutions was also concluded in 2013. </p>

    <p>  In accordance with it, UniCredit customers got the opportunity to withdraw cash at Uralsib ATMs with certain benefits, in fact, on the same conditions as in the case of using the infrastructure of the brand that issued plastic cards.  By that time, Uralsib had a network of ATMs, in which there were about 3 thousand devices.  UniCredit customers have the opportunity to use them not only for cash withdrawals, but also to check the balance on their bank account. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Taking into account the concluded contracts of the considered brand of the banking market of the Russian Federation with other major players in the segment, UniCredit card holders have the opportunity to cash out cash on the terms described below. </p><h2>  Cash withdrawal from UniCredit cards: conditions </h2><p>  If a person who has issued a card at a branch of a financial institution in the Russian capital withdraws cash using, for example, UniCredit Bank ATMs in Moscow and the Moscow Region, he will not have to pay any commission for this transaction.  Similar rules also exist for cash withdrawal through the infrastructure provided by: </p><p>  - ICD; </p><p>  - Raiffeisenbank; </p><p>  - Uralsib. </p><p>  If a person withdraws cash from the UniCredit card at ATMs of other credit and financial organizations, then the first 2 withdrawals can be made without commission, and then - subject to deduction of 1% of the amount of received funds, but not less than 300 rubles. </p><p>  It may be noted that certain preferences have been set for clients of UniCredit Bank salary projects.  The specific conditions for cash withdrawals in this case should be clarified in the offices of the relevant credit and financial organization. </p><h2>  Replenishment of funds: conditions </h2><p>  In turn, other conditions are defined for the operations of replenishment of the UniCredit plastic card.  What are they? </p><p>  If a person uses UniCredit Bank ATMs in Moscow and the Moscow Region to replenish a card issued by an appropriate credit and financial institution, he will not pay any commission.  In turn, it is not always possible for UniCredit cardholders to use the infrastructure of partner organizations - in particular, those with which cash-out agreements have been concluded.  This, firstly, requires even greater compatibility of the card service infrastructure, and secondly, the conclusion of additional agreements. </p><p>  Note that between UniCredit and Raiffeisen so far no such contracts have been signed.  Raiffeisenbank customers, in particular, can replenish their cards at ATMs of their credit and financial institution, as well as in payment devices from MKB, MDM and BINBANK.  The use of UniCredit infrastructure in this case is not provided.  Therefore, it is best to replenish the card to customers of the respective institution in ATMs belonging to the organization and included in its network. </p>

    <p>  Actually, for residents of the capital, this task should not involve much difficulty.  UniCredit Bank ATMs in Moscow are represented in a rather large number in Moscow, next to the metro in various parts of cities, in the areas of the largest shopping and entertainment centers visited. </p><p>  A significant part of the corresponding devices can both issue and accept cash.  If the UniCredit Bank ATMs in Moscow near the metro near the house or the card holder could not be found, you can contact the support service of a financial institution for advice.  Perhaps, UniCredit experts will tell you where you can use the card service infrastructure, which is closest. </p><p>  In addition to the ATMs belonging to the brand in question, branded terminals are also available for owners of plastic cards issued to them.  With their help, a person can pay one or another bill, make a payment for utilities, replenish the balance on a mobile phone - using a card. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the ATMs belonging to the UniCredit Bank brand in Moscow and the region, as well as many other regions of the Russian Federation, have a very remarkable set of functions.  We will study them. </p><h2>  Functions of UniCredit ATMs </h2><p>  As we noted above, devices for servicing plastic cards issued by the banking brand in question are capable of both issuing and accepting cash.  But this, of course, is not all of their possibilities. </p><p>  So, UniCredit ATMs are adapted to carry out a number of operations on the personal account of the card holder.  Another noteworthy feature of these devices is the ability to quickly transfer funds to the credit account of a bank client.  One of the specialties of UniCredit is the issuance of loans. </p><p>  It can be noted that a large number of ATMs of the financial institution in question can issue cash not only in rubles, but also in dollars and euros. </p><h2>  Using UniCredit cards abroad </h2><p>  As we noted above, UniCredit is a European brand.  This is due to the fact of the existence of special agreements between the Russian UniCredit Bank and foreign banks, which are part of the corresponding financial group with it. </p><p>  In particular, under one of the agreements, holders of cards issued in the Russian Federation get the opportunity in some cases to withdraw cash abroad at Unicredit ATMs without a commission.  Moreover, currency conversion - if it is different, is carried out in accordance with the internal rate of the financial institution.  This opportunity gives very tangible benefits to Russian travelers who travel to Europe. </p><p>  Of course, if a person pays for purchases in stores using a card, then a commission if payment is made using the international VISA or MasterCard system is not charged in any case. </p><h2>  Geography of UniCredit services in Moscow </h2><p>  Let us now examine where exactly it is possible to withdraw cash from the cards issued by UniCredit Bank in the Russian capital.  ATMs in Moscow (we will consider their addresses later), which belong to this financial institution, are located in various regions.  The criteria for choosing the optimal service point may be different. </p>

    <p>  Depending on what the resident of the capital most often drives around the city - by car or public transport, he will be interested in a specific guideline by which you can find the UniCredit Bank ATM in Moscow - metro, bus number or address of a specific street.  Therefore, a more universal, probably, criterion for the location of a device for servicing cards will be a specific area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe capital.  The territory of the Russian capital is traditionally divided into central, northern, southern, western and eastern.  Let us examine where in the relevant areas the infrastructure of the bank in question is located. </p><h2>  UniCredit ATMs in the center of the capital: addresses </h2><p>  If we talk about the center of Moscow, as well as the areas adjacent to it, UniCredit ATMs can be found at: </p><p>  - Krasnopresnenskaya embankment, 12; </p><p>  - Pyatnitskaya, 14; </p><p>  - 1st Tverskaya-Yamskaya, 28 p. 1; </p><p>  - Arbat, 54/2; </p><p>  - Dolgorukovskaya, 7. </p><p>  There are UniCredit Bank ATMs in Moscow near the Tsvetnoy Boulevard metro station.  The nearest of them is located at Tsvetnoy Boulevard, 13, bld 1. In walking distance from it there is an ATM at 12 Malaya <span>Sukharevskaya Square</span> . </p><h2>  UniCredit ATMs in Moscow: North </h2><p>  In the northern part of Moscow, devices for servicing cards issued by the credit and financial institution in question are located at: </p><p>  - Leningradsky prospect, 44; </p><p>  - <span>Altufevskoe highway,</span> 89; </p><p>  - Dvintsev, 12. </p><p>  There are UniCredit Bank ATMs in Moscow near the Otradnoye metro station.  More precisely, in the immediate vicinity of it - only 1, it is located at 31 Altufevskoe Shosse, bldg.  1. The nearest to it - which is located on 101 Dmitrovskoye Shosse, will have to be reached on foot for quite some time, so it is better to use public transport or a car. </p><h2>  UniCredit payment devices in the south of the capital </h2><p>  There are quite a few UniCredit ATMs in the south of Moscow.  In particular, they are located at: </p><p>  - <span>Derbenevskaya embankment,</span> 7, p. 22; </p><p>  - Prospect Vernadsky, 33; </p><p>  - Leninsky Prospekt 113/1. </p><p>  There are UniCredit Bank ATMs in Moscow near the Domodedovskaya metro station.  More precisely, the nearest is located rather closer to Krasnogvardeiskaya - at 45 Orekhovy Boulevard, Bldg.  1. At a decent enough distance, outside the MKAD, but easily overcome by car or by public transport, there is another ATM - at 24 Kashirskoye Shosse. </p><h2>  UniCredit ATMs in the east of Moscow </h2><p>  In the east of the capital, UniCredit devices are located at: </p><p>  - Volgogradsky Prospect, 78; </p><p>  - Green Avenue, 24; </p><p>  - Veshnyakovskaya, 22. </p><p>  There are UniCredit Bank ATMs in Moscow near the Zhulebino metro station - but it would be more fair to say that their proximity is expressed in the possibility of relatively quick access to them by car or by public transport.  The nearest of them is located at Zhulebinsky Boulevard, 10/6. </p><p>  There are UniCredit Bank ATMs in Moscow near the Transfiguration Square metro station.  The nearest of them is located at <span>Preobrazhenskaya Square,</span> 8. There are also UniCredit Bank ATMs in Moscow on Semenovskaya Square.  The nearest of them is located at ul.  Shcherbakovskaya, 3. </p><h2>  UniCredit card service devices in the west of the capital </h2><p>  In the western part of the Russian capital, UniCredit card service devices are located at: </p><p>  - Krylatskaya, 17, bldg.  3; </p><p>  - <span>Rublevskoe highway,</span> 62; </p><p>  - Red Dawns, 21. </p><h2>  ATM Search for UniCredit: Nuances </h2><p>  Of course, we listed the coordinates of only part of the devices for issuing cash on cards issued by UniCredit Bank.  ATMs in Moscow (their addresses, as we have seen, are both in the Center and in the outskirts of the capital) of this institution are present in a much wider spectrum. </p>

    <p>  In order to accurately make sure that a particular device is functioning before driving to one of the addresses we have reviewed or to a map found on it, it makes sense to call the support service first.  It is likely that convenient UniCredit Bank ATMs in Moscow near the metro (and this is typical for almost all banks) for some reason will not be available.  For example, due to being on maintenance or due to the fact that the room in which they are located is closed due to repairs. </p><p>  UniCredit Bank's ATMs in Moscow are distributed fairly evenly across the metro stations, which allows the cardholder issued by the relevant credit and financial institution to move as quickly as necessary from one part of the city to another in order to use a functioning servicing device.  But it is better to know in advance whether it really works - if for some reason the one that the client had planned to use initially is unavailable. </p><p>  It can be noted that UniCredit Bank ATMs are often located in Moscow near recognizable sights, popular entertainment centers, and catering establishments of famous brands.  Therefore, a convenient guide for finding them may be just the same name of the object, next to which there are appropriate devices for servicing plastic cards. </p><p>  Of course, do not forget that UniCredit has entered into partnership agreements with other credit institutions, the essence of which we have considered above.  Therefore, if the holder of the card issued by the bank in question has found an Raiffeisenbank or Uralsib ATM near his home or office, he can try to withdraw money when using it without a commission.               ,   -   Unicredit. </p><p> ,       ¬´¬ª               ,          - . </p><p>        : ,        ,    .    ,  ,        ,   ,    ,     .           ‚Äî   .    ¬´¬ª  ,         .   ,     ,   ,      . </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p> , ¬´¬ª -  ,                ,      .          ,     . </p><p>    ¬´¬ª      ,            ,  , , ¬´¬ª  ¬´¬ª.       -  ,           ,     Unicredit. </p><p> ,            -   ¬´¬ª,      . ,  ,     ,     ¬´ ¬ª  . ,  ,        .              . </p>
