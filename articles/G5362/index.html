After all, it may be that this opportunity is expensive and is absolutely useless.  Or maybe, on the contrary, we will deal with something important and interesting? </p><p>  Indeed, the ‚ÄúPromised Payment‚Äù is a service in which you take a small ‚Äúloan‚Äù to your balance.  With all this, in a week a small percentage will be written off from you.  As a rule, this is 50 rubles.  Plus the amount you borrowed. </p><p>  If you are thinking about how to take the "Promised Payment" on MTS, then you should understand that this feature will allow you to always stay in touch.

We will begin with the fact that we find out the conditions with which we will have to agree to access our current opportunity.  Otherwise, you can leave the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãobtaining a "loan" behind. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to take the promised payment on pay" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/864503.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The first point to consider is that you must have a positive balance.  As a rule, this can be 1 penny.  Or even <span>an absolute zero.</span>  But the main thing is that there is no ‚Äúminus".  In this case, you will have to try hard to get the "Promised Payment".  True, now you can try to successfully "subscribe" to this opportunity with a negative balance, </p><p>  The second point is the term for the provision of the service.  The thing is that a ‚Äúloan‚Äù is issued for a maximum of one week.  After this period, you will be charged a small percentage for providing the function, as well as the entire amount that you "ordered".  Or, you can pre-replenish the balance for these figures.  Then you no longer have to think about how to install the "Promised Payment" on MTS, and when to wait for it to finish.  You will be deducted money - you close the "debt" in this way.  And after that, with a calm soul, you can continue to use your phone number - make calls, write messages and communicate with relatives and friends. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Connect manager </h2><p>  So, now closer to the point.

    <p>  In truth, the use of a special number to figure out how to connect the promised payment to MTS is very pleasing to most customers.  True, there is another rather interesting approach that will help you realize the idea.  Which one?  Let's try to figure this out. </p><h2>  Internet assistant </h2><p>  Well, the last method that you can offer, so as not to think about how to connect the Promised Payment to MTS, is to use a special online assistant on your phone.  It is installed automatically after using a SIM card from MTS for the first time. </p><p>  Go to the online assistant, and then look at the menu that opens.  There you will have to find and click on "Payment", and then select "Promised payment" there.  Now enter the payment amount, and then confirm your own actions.  That's all the problems are solved. </p><p>  Only we forgot a little about the effect of special restrictions.  For example, the limit on the amount of "loan".  If you spend up to 300 rubles per month on calls, then you can pay up to 200 rubles.  For people spending up to 500 rubles a month, the limit increases to 400 "rubles."  The maximum you can take on a "loan" 800 rubles.  This opportunity is available to those who spend more than 500 rubles per month on calls. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to activate the promised payment service on mts" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/864500.jpg" width="600"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Now that we are already familiar with the limits, it‚Äôs worth discussing one more point.

That's all the problems are solved. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, today we learned with you how to install the "Promised Payment" on MTS.
