It was launched several years ago by <span>microfinance organizations.</span>  The number of such companies that began to work remotely included Platiza.ru (Platiza).  This is a microfinance organization you can trust.  It has existed in the remote lending market for more than 5 years, which means that it can be contacted without any concerns.  However, for starters, it is worth getting to know the company better, find out the conditions for issuing loans, and Platiza reviews from debtors and satisfied customers. </p><h2>  Microfinance Organization Information </h2><p>  The online service "Platiza.ru" was created in November 2012.  At first, it was impossible to say whether the project would be popular and whether it would fall apart like a house of cards.  However, every year the microfinance organization improved, strengthened its position, received more positive reviews.  Platiza.ru today is a popular online service with transparent conditions.  All necessary information related to loans is published on the official website.  For the convenience of customers, an online calculator has been created.  Using it, before applying for a loan, you can find out the amount to be repaid. </p><p>  The company has several advantages: </p><ol><li>  A microfinance organization has not only a standard site that can be viewed from computers.  A mobile version has been developed specifically for customers.  Now, any borrower, if necessary, can send an application for a loan from his smartphone or tablet. </li><li>  MFIs work with people with a bad credit history.  A special rehabilitation regimen has been developed for them.  It includes several steps.  The first steps are arranging loans for small amounts.  With timely returns, the limit increases, and the interest rate decreases. </li><li>  Loan applications are processed around the clock.  No holidays are an obstacle to getting money on credit. </li><li>  The company has established only 3 simple requirements for its borrowers.  To become a client of this microfinance organization, you must be a citizen of Russia, have registration in the country and be in the age group from 18 to 65 years old. </li><li>  There is a chat on the online service site.  If you have any questions, any client can send a message.  Employees of the company will quickly give an answer, help in solving the problem. </li><li>  The microfinance organization employs true professionals.  Thanks to their activities, the service can be assigned characteristics such as high quality of the services provided, fast speed of work, transparency and openness. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="sigmachat.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Benefits of Platiza MFIs" class="if uuid-3029551" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/3029551.jpg"></div><h2>  Loan Terms </h2><p>  As confirmed by reviews of Platiza.ru, on the official website of a microfinance organization, you can arrange loans for any purpose without guarantors and collateral.  Amounts from 100 rubles to 15 thousand rubles are offered to beginners.  For borrowers who repay the first loan without delay, the maximum possible amount is doubled, that is, it is 30 thousand rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The term for repayment of consumer loans is 5‚Äì45 days.  Each client of a microfinance organization chooses the most convenient period for himself.  It is worth considering that interest rates in a microfinance organization are rather big.  It is recommended to issue loans for a short period. </p><p>  Consider an example.  In MFIs, a new client submits an application in the amount of 5 thousand rubles.  If the loan in Platiza is issued for 5 days, the amount for repayment will amount to 5 thousand 543 rubles.  If the client chooses a period of 30 days, then the amount to be returned will be 8 thousand 255 rubles.  For regular customers, the interest rate is set lower.  When registering 5 thousand rubles for 30 days, the amount to be returned is 6 thousand 200 rubles.  The official documents of the company say that interest rates are set for each client from 0% per annum to 841.78% per annum. </p><h2>  Advantages of loans from Platiza.ru </h2><p>  The loans that can be issued on the site of the MFO Platiza.ru have the following advantages: </p><ol><li>  To apply, you need the Internet.  Visits do not need to be made anywhere.  The entire process of registration is carried out through a worldwide network. </li><li>  To take out a loan at Platiza, you need to prepare a passport, a pension insurance certificate and a mobile phone.  Inquiries from work are not required. </li><li>  Customer requests are processed very quickly.  The decision is made in a few minutes. </li><li>  Clients of Platiza.ru can choose the most convenient way for them to obtain loans.  Money can be sent to a plastic card (Visa, MasterCard, MIR), an electronic wallet (Yandex.Money, Qiwi), through the Contact system. </li><li>  Money transfer is carried out instantly. </li></ol><p>  One of the main advantages of loans from Platiza is that the client can influence his interest rate.  To reduce it, a profile confirmation in video format is provided.  This procedure is designed to identify a person.  To pass the confirmation you need to have a microphone and a webcam.  The result of this procedure - the client may be offered an interest rate of 1% per day.  Other ways to reduce the interest rate are to indicate the city phone number, information about the current job, the availability of a registered loan and / or credit card. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="globalgoodgroup.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Opportunities for Platiza customers" class="if uuid-3029561" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/3029561.jpg"></div><h2>  Registration on the site and registration of the first loan </h2><p>  People who have not previously used the service in question and decided to issue the first amount of money in debt should create a personal account for loans on the official Platiza.ru website (for processing, renewal and repayment).  Here is the instruction: </p><ol><li>  Click on the "Login" button in the upper right corner.  On the page that opens, select "Create an account." </li><li>  At the first stage of registration, fill out a questionnaire, indicating the last name, first name, middle name, citizenship, email and phone number. </li><li>  At the second stage, come up with a password to enter your personal account. </li><li>  At the third stage of registration, indicate passport data and SNILS. </li></ol><p>  After registration, the borrower‚Äôs credit rating is determined and individual loan conditions (interest rate and maximum possible amount) are selected.  Then it remains only to receive money by clicking on the appropriate button.  After clicking, the client indicates the term, loan amount within the available limit and the method of receiving funds. </p><p>  At the first registration of a loan, it is not necessary to register a bank card.  However, it may still be required, which is confirmed by customer reviews about Platiza.  The fact is that for some borrowers other ways to get money are not available (for security reasons). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  A card can be registered if it meets several conditions: </p><ul><li>  is registered; </li><li>  It is served by such payment systems as Visa, MasterCard, MIR; </li><li>  the balance is more than 3 rubles; </li><li>  3D Secure service is activated. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.verdict.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Loan terms at MFI Platiza" class="if uuid-3029570" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/3029570.jpg"></div><h2>  Credit Rating Details </h2><p>  The credit rating is built into the Platiza.ru service specifically so that clients understand several nuances and know the answers to their questions: </p><ul><li>  how responsibly they relate to their financial obligations; </li><li>  why banks and MFIs refuse to issue loans and borrowings; </li><li>  how failure to fulfill financial obligations is reflected in the credit history. </li></ul><p>  A credit rating is presented for each user of the online loan service Platiza in your personal account in graphical and digital form.  Rating is an assessment of solvency.  It is calculated automatically taking into account the personal information of the client, his credit history and can be: </p><ol><li>  From 0 to 300 points.  Many banks, microfinance organizations seek to avoid customers with such a low credit rating. </li><li>  From 300 to 600 points.  This is an average credit rating.  It can be with those people who have not previously used loans and borrowings or undergo a rehabilitation regime. </li><li>  From 600 to 900 points.  These are the maximum possible values.  Such a credit rating is considered high.  It is assigned to those people who are responsible borrowers and have a positive credit history.  A microfinance organization gladly cooperates with such persons and offers them loans on the most favorable terms. </li></ol><h2>  Repayment options </h2><p>  A microfinance organization advises its customers to repay loans at Platiza.ru in a timely manner.  Responsible approach to returning money positively affects credit history and credit rating. </p><p>  You can repay loans ahead of schedule, in part and in full, on the last day of the term for using funds.  Early repayment is a profitable option.  Customers pay interest only for the actual number of days they use cash.  With partial repayment, you can also save.  With this payment option, the amount of debt is reduced, and interest is recalculated. </p><p>  There are several ways to repay loans: </p><ol><li>  Bank card  If it is registered in the system, to repay you need to go to your personal account, in the ‚ÄúCurrent loan‚Äù section, select the repayment function and indicate the payment method (registered card).  If you wish, you can activate automatic debit.  This function is in your account. </li><li>  Electronic wallets Yandex.Money and Qiwi.  The client is required on the site "Platiza.ru" in your account to select a payment method such as "Electronic money", indicate the number of wallets. </li><li>  Qiwi-terminal or any Euroset communication salon.  This method is provided for those who can return the loan only in cash.  Payment is made according to the contract number, which is indicated on the personal account for each client of the company. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.cuinsight.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Loan extension service" class="if uuid-3029643" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/3029643.jpg"></div><h2>  Renewal service </h2><p>  Absolutely anyone can suddenly find themselves in a difficult financial situation.  The company is aware of this, therefore it does not require its customers to immediately repay the debt on the last day of the period of use of funds.  The MFI offers to use the loan extension service, which is specially created for such cases when it is not possible to repay the amount on time. </p><p>  The reviews about Platiza say that the extension is activated in your account.  The client is required to indicate the renewal period and pay only the accrued interest.  For example, a loan of 3 thousand rubles was issued.  The amount to be returned was 3 thousand 651 rubles.  When renewing, you only need to pay 651 rubles.  A refund of 3 thousand rubles (principal amount) will be carried forward to another day selected by the client.  This amount will add interest for the renewal period. </p><p>  This service helps out in difficult financial situations.  Thanks to it, the client maintains a credit rating, and the credit history does not deteriorate.  If delay occurs, then this information is sent by the company to the credit bureau.  This means that credit history is deteriorating.  A person's chances of getting loans and borrowings from banks and other microfinance organizations are significantly reduced.  Delays are still undesirable for the reason that the amount to return is very increased. </p><div class="photo" data-original="simplyrichlife.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Repayment methods" class="if uuid-3029547" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/3029547.jpg"></div><h2>  Shares </h2><p>  Periodically, Platiza.ru attracts customers with interesting and profitable promotions.  For example, in the fall of 2018, a microfinance organization invited people to participate in the ‚ÄúHappy Loan‚Äù.  Borrowers only needed to draw up an agreement and not allow late payments.  The prize of this promotion was a discount in the form of writing off (forgiveness) of the remaining debt. </p><p>  At the end of 2018 - the beginning of 2019, a promotion ‚ÄúGoToSochi‚Äù is planned.  Terms of participation in it - registration of a loan in Platiza (to a card, to an electronic wallet or in cash) and decent performance of financial obligations.  The prize fund includes several gifts - 1 certificate (for 2 people from Moscow) for a trip to the Rosa Khutor resort and hotel accommodation, 10 modern and high-quality smartphones (Xiaomi Redmi Note 5), 7 discounts in the form of cancellation (forgiveness) of the remaining debt. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.perthwebsitedesigner.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Promotions for borrowers" class="if uuid-3029585" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/3029585.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews of regular customers </h2><p>  Regular customers respond positively to the microfinance organization.  They attribute transparency and honesty to the advantages of an online service.  Without any tricks, the possibility of early repayment is offered to borrowers. </p><p>  In a microfinance organization, as clients note in reviews of Platiza, it is best to arrange small loans (from 100 rubles to 1 thousand rubles) for a short period.  Interest is scanty.  But for obtaining large amounts, it is best to contact banks, so as not to overpay significant amounts. </p><p>  Regular customers give an example in reviews of Platiza: when making 15 thousand rubles for 30 days, an amount of more than 18 thousand rubles is required to be returned.  This example clearly shows that the loan fee (more than 3 thousand rubles) is too large.  However, high interest rates apply in all MFIs.  This is a fee for those opportunities that are offered to customers (obtaining loans without additional documents, quick decision-making, different ways of receiving money, instant transfers, etc.). </p><h2>  Debtors reviews about Platiza </h2><p>  Debtors form a negative opinion about microfinance organizations.  If an overdue occurs, the online service employees immediately start calling.  Sometimes, as people say, workers allow themselves to communicate in rude tones with borrowers. </p><p>  Some people in negative reviews about Platiza write that they turned out to be debtors through the fault of the company.  For example, one man said that he registered a loan on the Platiza.ru website.  After the deadline, the refund did not work.  The man decided not to wait for the delay and activated the extension.  Later, he used the renewal service several times and eventually repaid the loan.  A little later, this client was faced with refusals in obtaining bank loans.  The man decided to check his credit history.  It turned out that the company sold debt to collectors 3 times.  These debts were recorded as unpaid.  To get an explanation, the client contacted customer support.  The company apologized and promised to update the information on loans. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.infoclutch.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews about Platiza" class="if uuid-3029564" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/3029564.jpg"></div><p>  ‚ÄúPlatiza.ru‚Äù, despite the negative reviews, is a quality and reliable service.  The company has partners with an impeccable reputation.  Among them are Yandex.Money, the United Credit Bureau, the National Bureau of Credit Histories, Equifax, Deiteriy, etc. Among the clients of MFIs there are many satisfied people who confirm the decency of the company and tell that Platiza gives loans with open arrears, etc. e. Does not pay attention to credit history.  It is also worth noting that the microfinance organization does not stand still.  She strives to improve, come up with new solutions to meet the needs of her customers. </p>
