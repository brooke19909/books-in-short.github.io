It is located in a suburban area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Northern capital, namely in the village of Murino, Vsevolozhsk district.  Here is everything that a modern person needs to live.  And of course, the most important thing is the favorable ecology, which is ensured by the proximity to the forested areas and the Okhta River.  We are talking about the LCD "Ninth Val."  This project is presented by two <span>monolithic brick residential</span> buildings with a height of 25 floors.  Each of them includes about 720 economy class objects. </p><h2>  Developer </h2><p>  The construction of the Ninth Val residential complex is being carried out by the Leader Group construction company, which has been on the market since 1992.  From the very beginning of its activity, it implemented commercial projects, but over time, the priorities of the developer shifted towards housing construction.  Currently, the Leader Group portfolio comprises about 25 commercial and residential real estate projects, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich exceeds 1 million square meters. </p>

    <p>  Initially, a studio apartment with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã27 squares cost about 2 million rubles. </p><p>  One bedroom apartment with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã36 square meters.  m were estimated by the developer at 2.5 million rubles.  Two-room mansions cost 3.6 million rubles. </p><p>  Currently, in the ‚ÄúNinth Val‚Äù residential complex, seventeen apartments remain in the first stage, and seventy-two in the second stage.  Moreover, their prices have increased slightly.  So, ‚Äúodnushka‚Äù costs from 3.2 to 3.9 million rubles, ‚Äúodnushka‚Äù - from 4.9 to 5.5 million rubles, and the cost of a studio apartment varies from 2.4 to 3 million rubles. </p><h2>  Customer Opinions </h2><p>  Undoubtedly, comfort, convenience, harmony with nature are the main advantages of the Ninth Shaft residential complex.  Reviews about this project are mostly quite positive.  A huge number of potential buyers like the fact that the object is within walking distance from the metro station. </p>

    <p>  But, on the other hand, some are seriously alarmed by the fact that it is adjacent to the railway.  Many are bribed by the relative cheapness of apartments in the Ninth Val residential complex.  Also, customers are lured by the loyal housing conditions offered by Leader Group.  Hire purchase is a very convenient payment method.  Today, few can pay for housing immediately.  However, not everyone is happy with the fact that the readiness of infrastructure facilities today is far from complete.  Schools, kindergartens and clinics will be finally completed in about two years.  Until then, residents will be forced to contact the institutions of St. Petersburg. </p><p>  And of course, another minus is the delay in putting the object into operation.  As a result, buyers could not get the treasured keys to the apartment on time. </p><p>  And the rest, LCD "Ninth Val" has undeniable advantages, so buying a house in the specified object can be a very profitable investment. </p>
