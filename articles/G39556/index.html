  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The human brain is the unique organ of our body</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The most complex organ of the human body is the brain.  The genius of his work surpasses the work of all computer systems combined. </p><p>  The human brain is a kind of command post for our entire body.  He constantly receives incoming signals from all <span>the senses,</span> such as eyes, ears, tongue, nose, skin.  And immediately sends response orders for all <span>parts of the body.</span>  But the most incomprehensible function of the brain is the ability to think and create, learn, dream and hope, sadness and joy.  The brain also controls the operation of all systems of the internal organs of a person.  Thanks to the brain we can speak, hear, read. </p><p>  This most important organ is protected by a strong skull consisting of thirty-eight bones connected to each other and resembling a mosaic in appearance.  For a long time, scientists were worried about <span>how much the human brain weighs.</span>  And after certain studies, it was concluded that this organ is a pinkish-gray substance weighing 1.4 kilograms, but this weight varies slightly under the influence of various factors, in particular, aging of the body. </p><p>  The human brain includes three main parts: the cerebrum, cerebellum, and the brain stem.  These parts perform certain functions, and they are interconnected in a close way, responsible for all the most complex processes of the body. </p><p>  The largest part is the large brain.  Its outer layer, forming the so-called cerebral cortex, carries out the most important process - the process of thinking.  The brain stem serves as a regulator of the internal systems of the body, such as cardiovascular, respiratory, digestive, excretory.  The cerebellum is responsible for posture, balance control, muscle movement. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The human brain has plasticity.  In the event of a defeat of any of its departments, others immediately compensate for its functions. </p><p>  It is believed that the brain rests at night.  <span>It's a delusion.</span>  The brain works full day, but only at night, the intensity of its work is somewhat reduced.  Therefore, its cells must constantly be enriched with oxygen and glucose.  If the supply of oxygen stops at least for a few minutes, then the cells will begin to necrotic (die). </p><p>  It is known that <span>the human brain</span> processes a huge number of impulses coming from the body every second.  Our body has the property of so-called filtering, the essence of which is that ninety-nine percent of unnecessary information is screened out, as a result of which the brain is freed from overloads.  It's no secret that there are two hemispheres - left and right.  The left is responsible for the semantic perception of words, and the right is responsible for color perception. </p><p>  Our brain is so designed that it is able to not only control the vital processes of the body, but it can also be trained.  Mental training has a very good effect on <span>memory development.</span>  And for the brain to quickly be able to solve any complex problems, it needs to constantly throw up new ideas, although it is already a very complex, multi-level and highly organized human body. </p><p>  As mentioned above, each area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe brain has its own, specific range of responsibilities.  There are so-called sensory areas that are responsible for our sensations, motor, which control the movements of the body, cognitive, responsible for thinking, emotional and so on. </p><p>  But our brain is designed in such a way that at the same time all areas cannot be included in the work at once, otherwise a person, as they say, would simply go crazy.  So it‚Äôs quite obvious that overly active mental activity can do much harm. </p><p>  Mankind has long been worried about the question of how much the human brain works.  It turns out that the brain of such great people as Pushkin and Einstein was used by eleven percent, and the brain of an average person - only by five to seven percent.  This suggests that brain reserves are unlimited, and our task is to learn how to manage these reserves to the maximum. </p>
