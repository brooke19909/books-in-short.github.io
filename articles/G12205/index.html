  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Balashikha-park" - a complex for a comfortable life in the Moscow region</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  East of the capital of Russia is the largest city in the region - Balashikha.  You can get into it along several highways: Shchelkovsky, Bypass, Enthusiasts.  Only 6 kilometers separate Balashikha from the Moscow Ring Road, which makes the city very attractive for developers and immigrants from other cities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="smotridom.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Balashikha Park" class="if uuid-2292873" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/2292873.jpg"></div><h2>  A bit about the city </h2><p>  The largest city in the <span>Moscow region,</span> whose population is approaching half a million inhabitants and is growing steadily.  For the period 2015-2016  it has almost doubled.  This is facilitated by the status of the city as the most economically developed.  Where there are jobs, residents will only stay.  Developers consider the development of Balashikha promising.  And one of the most striking examples is Balashikha Park. </p><h2>  Location and transport accessibility </h2><p>  In the north-east of the city of Balashikha is located microdistrict 22. This is the ‚ÄúBalashikha-park‚Äù.  It is separated from the city center by just over 4 kilometers.  From MKAD - 6 kilometers.  From the west, the complex borders on the Nikolsko-Trubetskoy microdistrict.  From the north and east, Balashikha Park is surrounded by forests.  Also nearby is a fairly large <span>river Pechorka.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="vk.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View of the Balashikha Park" class="if uuid-2292877" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/2292877.jpg"></div><p>  Getting to the residents of the complex is not difficult.  Many types of public transport run between Moscow and Balashikha.  There is a bus station "Balashikha-2" in the microdistrict itself.  Those who prefer not to stand in traffic jams are offered electric trains.  Owners of their own vehicles can choose one of the three above-mentioned highways, and in a few minutes be at home. </p><h2>  Description of the residential complex </h2><p>  RC "Balashikha-Park" is a whole microdistrict consisting of panel houses of different floors.  Several houses were built on an individual project.  Administrative buildings complement the landscape.  A central boiler house operates in the microdistrict, providing all residential buildings with water and heating.  The developer used both proven and the latest innovative technologies in construction. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nashdomtut.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Construction of houses" class="if uuid-2292876" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/2292876.jpg"></div><h2>  Apartments in the complex: cost </h2><p>  Apartments in Balashikha Park are presented for every taste and budget.  From modest one-room apartments to spacious four-room ones.  The smallest in area is 36 square meters.  The largest area reaches 141 m <sup>2</sup> .  All apartments are equipped with large balconies or balconies.  The windows are double glazed with wooden frames. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The cost of one square meter of housing in the complex "Balashikha-park" starts from 60 thousand rubles.  It is not difficult to calculate that a two-room apartment of 60 square meters can be purchased for about 3,600,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Internal and external infrastructure </h2><p>  22 microdistrict, ‚ÄúBalashikha-park‚Äù is an independent residential complex with all the infrastructure necessary for life.  Its residents do not have to travel outside the neighborhood in search of the necessary products, things or services.  Children can attend kindergarten, school and gymnasium located in the complex.  In addition, there are beauty salons, various shops, a medical center.  In the future, it is planned to build another school and kindergarten. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.realty.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Balashikha Park today" class="if uuid-2292878" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/2292878.jpg"></div><p>  For owners of personal vehicles, five-story and three-story garages are provided.  All residents of ‚ÄúBalashikha-park‚Äù can relax in the equipped squares, in the squares, walk along the footpaths, united in a single network. </p><p>  Those who need other services can take advantage of the infrastructure of the city of Balashikha, visit hypermarkets, sports complexes.  Or go to Moscow to shop or study. </p><h2>  Some disadvantages of the microdistrict </h2><p>  Unfortunately, it cannot be said that the Balashikha-Park residential complex and life in it have the same advantages.  Perfectly chosen place for building, convenient transport accessibility and developed infrastructure - all these are undoubted advantages.  But there are also downsides. </p><p>  The construction of the microdistrict was begun in the 2000s.  At that time, the land plot was an open space that crossed the current high-voltage power line.  Residential buildings, infrastructure facilities were built in the immediate vicinity of it, thereby violating the norms of the current legislation.  Currently, the line is a serious danger, exerting a strong electromagnetic effect and threatening the life and health of people in the event of wire breakage or their fall. </p>
