The main thing is to study the whole spectrum of possible actions.  After all, there are quite a few of them.  And at Kyivstar, the Mayochka can be connected and used through several very interesting methods. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kyivstar Lighthouse" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1139478.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  But first, what are we going to deal with today?  The whole problem is that not all subscribers understand how this offer works.  The service "Lighthouse" ("Kyivstar") is a kind of locator.  You can see the location of a subscriber on an interactive map, if he previously gives you consent to this.  Sometimes you can track a person without his knowledge, but more on that later. </p><p>  In general, our today's opportunity is nothing more than a means of tracking friends.  She is in great demand among her parents.  They will not need to constantly worry where the child is.  Just activate the "Beacon" and get all the information about the location. </p><h2>  We call the operator </h2><p>  If you are interested in this feature, you can start connecting.  It‚Äôs no secret that any option from a mobile operator is ‚Äúconnected‚Äù in several ways.  The first one is a call.  In our case, you need to dial 466 and wait for an answer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now let us know that you would like to connect a Beacon to yourself.  An application will be drawn up for you.  After that they will ask about who needs to be ‚Äútracked‚Äù.  This subscriber will also have to issue a connection request.  And if he gives his consent, you can see the location of a person on the map at any time.  Without the approval of the second party, it will not work to verify where the subscriber is.  The conversation with the operator is free.  Keep this in mind. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kyivstar service" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1139477.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Teams </h2><p>  But there is one more interesting and simple option with which the service ‚ÄúMayachok‚Äù (Kyivstar) can be activated.  The instruction states that each subscriber has the right to use the so-called USSD requests.  They help to disable and connect certain options, as well as change tariff plans. </p><p>  In our case, for the Kyivstar company to start working, you must dial * 147 * 1 * 4 * 380 subscriber number # on your mobile device.  After that, click on the "Call" button.  The subscriber number, please note, is written together with 380. Otherwise, the command will not be recognized. </p><p>  Now it remains only to wait.  You have made a connection request.  Next, your interlocutor (whose number you indicated) must confirm that you are in the contact list for surveillance.  He will receive an SMS notification with the activation code for the opportunity and all the instructions for turning on the Beacon.  As soon as consent is obtained, you will see an SMS with the relevant information.  There is nothing difficult about this.  Similar actions should be carried out with all numbers that you want to see on the map.  At Kyivstar, Mayachok can be connected without the consent of the client, but this is an unofficial way.  And we will find out about him now. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kyivstar beacon for internet" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1139476.jpg"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Services </h2><p>  It is about using a variety of third-party services that help view subscribers on an interactive map.  There are a lot of such offers on the Internet.  And, regardless of the operator used, you can activate the "Beacon" option. </p><p>  True, one should be skeptical of these proposals.  Often, all this is a scam.  And no result will be seen on the interactive map.  Therefore, you should not use third-party services for surveillance.  It is better to use only the official offers of a particular operator.  This will protect you from fraud and waste. </p><h2>  Using the Beacon </h2><p>  At Kyivstar Corporation, the Mayochka can be used in several ways.  For example, by telephone.  In this case, during surveillance, you will receive an SMS or MMS message in which there will be a link to the map with the location, as well as information about where the person is now.  It is very comfortable. </p><p>  To bring the idea to life, from the phone, dial the command * 147 * 1 * 1 * 380 number #.  After that, you will receive a message with all the information you are interested in and an interactive map.  It‚Äôs so easy and simple to activate and use the Lighthouse service.  But not everyone is not always comfortable to view the subscriber‚Äôs position on a mobile.  In this case, there is a small alternative.  For example, you can use Kyivstar (Lighthouse) for an Internet connection.  That is, use this service through a web interface.  Also a very popular and convenient tracking method. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kyivstar beacon without the consent of the client" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1139475.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  For internet </h2><p>  Well, we learned how to use the Lighthouse using a telephone.  But now it's time to activate the function from the computer.  No matter how amazing it may sound, Kyivstar allows subscribers to do so. </p><p>  To implement the method, you will have to visit the special Mayachka website from our current operator at login.kyivstar.ua.  Find the appropriate service there and send a request to display the subscriber on the map.  To do this, there are separate fields on the site.  There is nothing difficult about this.  The main thing is to pre-authorize on the site.  Otherwise, you can forget about the idea.  As you can see, at Kyivstar Mayachok can also be activated and used via the Internet.  Absolutely safe for customers.  And no third-party services are needed. </p><h2>  Service cancellation </h2><p>  Of course, if we learned to connect one or another option, we need to be able to refuse it.  In our case, Kyivstar Corporation Mayachok suggests disabling it either using the official website (in the Services section) or using USSD commands.  The second option is used more often. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kyivstar beacon over the Internet" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1139474.jpg"></div>

    <p>  To disable a peculiar locator on a mobile device, dial * 147 * 1 * 5 * 380 subscriber number #.  In this case, you can no longer track a friend‚Äôs position on the map without reconciling.  Easy and simple.  It is better to completely abandon the Beacon via the Internet or during a call to the operator. </p>
