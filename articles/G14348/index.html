The gadget will not protect against a collision, but it will record the details of the incident and simplify the identification and punishment of the culprit. </p><p>  According to reviews, Xiaomi DVRs are used as parking cameras and help identify traffic violators: the G-sensor records the time of increasing load on the vehicle and a sharp increase in speed (from the idle state in the parking lot). </p><p>  But not everything is so good: drivers prefer to play it safe and put the gadget in the glove compartment to prevent theft. </p><h2>  Xiaomi 70mai Dash Cam Midrive D01 </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.drive2.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dvr xiaomi 70 reviews" class="if uuid-3249319" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/3249319.jpg"></div><p>  According to reviews, the DVR Xiaomi 70mai Dash Cam Midrive D01 has one camera with a viewing angle of 130 ¬∞, recording in a resolution of 1920 √ó 1080 pixels at a frequency of 30 frames per second. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A subtitle line with date and time is superimposed on the image.

There is a built-in microphone and the connection of additional surveillance tools is provided: for example, a rear view camera. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Food - from the battery or cigarette lighter of the car.  The screen diagonal is 5 inches, the camera with a viewing angle of 160 ¬∞ and 6 glass lenses takes a resolution of 1920 √ó 1080 and saves the material in MP4 format. </p><p>  There is a possibility of synchronization via Wi-Fi. </p><p>  Cost - from 6000 to 13000r. </p><h2>  YI Smart Dash Camera </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.carousell.ph" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dvr xiaomi 70mai dash cam pro reviews" class="if uuid-3249341" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/3249341.jpg"></div><p>  In the reviews, the Xiaomi YI Dash Camera DVR is compared to 70mai Dash: the same resolution is 1920 √ó 1080, but the frequency is not 30 frames per second, but 60. The footage is saved to the memory card in MP4 format. </p><p>  A video camera stands out with an angle of 165 ¬∞ and a shooting mode in a resolution of 2048 √ó 1536 pixels. </p><p>  The design provides for a screen of 960 √ó 240 with a diagonal of 2.7 inches. </p><p>  Price policy: from 4000 to 5000 rubles. </p><h2>  YI Smart Dash Camera SE </h2><p>  According to reviews, the Xiaomi YI Smart Dash Camera SE dashcam is cheaper than the aforementioned analogue (from 3,000 to 3,300 r), has a built-in G-sensor, supports shooting in HD format, loop recording (clips of 3 minutes) with a resolution of 1920 √ó 1080 at 30 frames in give me a sec. </p><p>  Compared with the original, it is inferior in the characteristics of the camera: a viewing angle of 130 ¬∞, but there is a night mode, WDR technology and photography. </p><p>  The screen is similar: 960 √ó 240 pixels with a diagonal of 2.7 inches. </p><h2>  Positive feedback about the 70mai Dash Cam Midrive D01 </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.drive2.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi dash cam dvr reviews" class="if uuid-3249321" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/3249321.jpg"></div><p>  According to reviews of the Xiaomi 70 mai dash dashcam, consumers like the compact size, stealth from the street and build quality.  Conveniently attached to the windshield, does not fall when driving over bumps.  Buyers are talking about acceptable quality shooting in the daytime. </p><p>  Videos are sorted into ordinary and problematic: the latter get incidents with increased vibration. </p><p>  The price is pleasing: the model is relatively inexpensive, and for the money it is difficult to find a gadget with the same quality of shooting.  The layout without a screen is convenient: you can set up the application on your smartphone once so that through it you can view the captured materials in 1-2 clicks. </p><p>  The product is powered by a 240 mAh battery, which lasts for a long time.  For safety, work from the on-board network of the car is provided. </p><p>  According to reviews, the Xiaomi 70mai dash DVR is often chosen as a gift to friends and family, and thin wires are easy to hide under the dashboard. </p><h2>  What users do not like </h2><p>  Despite the abundance of advantages, it was not without drawbacks.  The mount is reliable, but because of this, the gadget is very difficult to remove: drivers who prefer to play it safe and remove the product, leaving the car at night in the parking lot, will have to tinker.  The problem is solved by buying specialized mounts from GoPro. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, the 70mai Dash Cam Midrive D01 dashcam only recognizes Chinese commands through the microphone.  Accordingly, you have to reflash the device. </p><p>  Consumers complain about recording problems: the light flashes, but when playing MP4 files there are no time periods from a few seconds to several minutes.  An illogical breakdown of space on a memory card: conventional videos last for 7-8 hours, the rest of the space is allocated for incidents with an accident.  All that remains is to buy a larger microSD. </p><p>  The lack of a screen played a cruel joke: according to reviews, the 70mai Dash Cam Midrive D01 dashcam suddenly stops writing.  On the screen, you could understand that the recording is not going on, but it is not there. </p><p>  Separately, consumers describe the interruption of the video for 8-10 seconds with the alarm sensor triggering.  A possible reason lies in the simultaneous distribution of Wi-Fi - it is better to disable the function. </p><h2>  70mai Dash Cam Pro Midrive D02 Reviews </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.advanced-tech.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dvr xiaomi 70mai dash reviews" class="if uuid-3249326" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/3249326.jpg"></div><p>  I like the gadget for its ease of use: it is conveniently attached to the glass, the recording quality is at its best, there are no malfunctions, it successfully interacts with the smartphone via Wi-Fi. </p><p>  According to reviews, the Xiaomi Dash Cam DVR notifies you when the car in front of you is moving (useful in traffic), voice notification of the intersection of the markings and approaching another car. </p><p>  The product is the best ratio of price and quality.  Night shooting is clear - the numbers of passing cars are visible;  The G-sensor is triggered on time, files are conveniently numbered in the recording order.  The recorder is small, hiding behind a mirror and is close to the windshield, which allows you to shoot without glare. </p><p>  Xiaomi Dash Cam did not do without negative reviews about the DVR: the settings initially set the average shooting quality, so you have to reconfigure it.  The product is not Russified - you have to download the firmware yourself and install.  It does not notify about cameras or exceeding the permissible speed. </p><p>  The clips are recorded in one minute, this is not subject to reconfiguration.  The low battery power is upsetting - it lasts for 3 hours.  Power cuts can cause the product to turn off. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews on the Xiaomi 70mai Dash Cam Pro DVR, there is no technical support for the product in Russia, because warranty service is a big problem.  If you are lucky, you will be able to exchange for a similar sample. </p><p>  There are difficulties in finding instructions in Russian: scanning a QR code leads to a page in Chinese. </p><h2>  Xiaomi MiJia Car Driving Recorder Camera reviews </h2><div class="photo" data-original="icover.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dvr xiaomi 70mai pro reviews" class="if uuid-3249336" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/3249336.jpg"></div><p>  A simple and beautiful camera with an intuitive interface, the optimal ratio of price and quality, synchronizes with your smartphone via Wi-Fi.  It works in parking mode, turns on and off automatically. </p><p>  According to reviews, the Xiaomi Mijia DVR makes videos of excellent quality: WDR technology brightens dark areas and darkens bright ones.  The sound is spelled clearly. </p><p>  The viewing angle does not lead to distortion of the picture and glare from the windshield.  The power cord is quite long, conveniently located in the cabin under the dashboard to connect to the on-board network. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews on the Xiaomi Mijia DVR, the bracket is attached to the glass on a double-sided adhesive tape.  The design has a ball to rotate the camera toward the driver's door (in case of a stop by traffic police). </p><h2>  What users are dissatisfied with </h2><p>  Some buyers comment that the quality of the shooting does not match what is stated, which contradicts the positive reviews about the distinguishability of license plate numbers of cars at night.  Perhaps these are isolated cases of incorrect settings or factory defects, because WDR technology was created specifically for shooting at night. </p><p>  Consumers are misled by the default Chinese language.  The product has to be brought to mind on its own: to search for firmware translated into Russian, install plugins and calibrate the G-sensor manually. </p><p>  Owners recommend putting the gadget in the glove compartment for the night so parking thieves do not get too busy again. </p><h2>  Pros of Xiaomi MiJia Smart Rearview Mirror </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.xiaomi.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi mijia dvr reviews" class="if uuid-3249340" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/3249340.jpg"></div><p>  Consumers are pleased with the elegant appearance, compactness and the ability to fix rubber bands on the mirror in the cabin. </p><p>  Pleased with the design, sound quality and shooting: at night, license plates of oncoming cars are visible. </p><p>  The gadget is worth the money spent: removes around the clock, does not fail, does not turn off.  The interface is intuitive. </p><h2>  Gadget Cons </h2><p>  Negative reviews about the model are similar to those throughout the lineup: instructions in Chinese, difficulties with flashing.  There are comments about the inoperability of the shock sensor and the inability to calibrate. </p><h2>  YI Smart Dash Camera Model Reviews </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.dhgate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi yi dash dvr reviews" class="if uuid-3249342" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/3249342.jpg"></div><p>  <em>Positive</em> </p><p>  The usual gadget purchased for its intended purpose is to shoot video.  At night, everything is visible within the headlights.  Compact, does not take up much space on the windshield. </p><p>  Customers are satisfied with the camera‚Äôs viewing angle, control through the application (you can transfer materials to the phone via Wi-Fi) and the Intelligent Driver Assistance System (ADAS). </p><p>  <em>Negative</em> </p><p>  According to reviews on the Xiaomi YI Smart Dash Camera dashcam, the quality of shooting at night is average: the numbers cannot always be distinguished.  It does not always synchronize via Wi-Fi with the phone, turns off in the cold, and videos hang. </p><p>  As with the entire Xiaomi lineup, the default language is Chinese.  There is an English-language firmware, without which you can navigate by the shortcuts. </p><h2>  What users leave reviews about the YI Smart Dash Camera SE </h2><p>  <em>Positive</em> </p><p>  The version marked with SE is a stripped-down version of Xiaomi YI Smart Dash Camera: it differs in viewing angle, frame rate and lack of intellectual support. </p><p>  The model is chosen by drivers who do not need the ADAC system and do not play the role of the above differences.  The advantages are the same as the original. </p><p>  <em>Negative</em> </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, the developers confirmed with an official response that the SE version works only with the Chinese interface.  Accordingly, the negative buyers due to the inability to adapt the product to their own needs. </p><p>  There are still problems with fasteners, which from time to time cannot be detached from the glass, shutdowns in the cold and glitches when connected via Wi-Fi. </p><h2>  A bit about ADAS </h2><p>  What does the ADAS system in Xiaomi gadgets notify (on the example of the 70mai Dash Cam Pro Midrive D02): </p><ul><li>  about the beginning of movement in front of a standing car (helps traffic jams for not very attentive drivers); </li><li>  violation of a safe distance approaching cars; </li><li>  about the approach of the marking line left or right. </li></ul><p>  All three are disabled due to uselessness: </p><ol><li>  In the first case, due to the frequency of operation.  In traffic, traffic moves in jerks.  Accordingly, as soon as the driver in front is moving forward by half a meter, an alert will follow, and so on throughout the traffic jam.  Values ‚Äã‚Äãare zero, therefore it is turned off. </li><li>  In the second - due to the rare observance of a safe distance. </li><li>  The third case is suitable for truckers or other drivers over long distances: it prevents falling asleep while driving due to the monotonous landscape before your eyes.  Notification of the approach of the marking line brings to the senses.  In the conditions of the city it turns off due to a lot of interference: trees, poles and traffic lights increase the frequency of false positives. </li></ol><p>  The following functions are popular: notification of an uncontrolled start of movement (for example, when a vehicle accidentally lifted from the hand brake and rolled downhill), a parking camera and an emergency services warning system about an accident. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ixbt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi 70mai dvr reviews" class="if uuid-3249317" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/3249317.jpg"></div><h2>  Verdict </h2><p>  According to reviews of Xiaomi DVRs, the line of models was conceived for the maximum convenience of motorists: Wi-Fi, a camera with a wide viewing angle, stealth from the street, an intelligent help system ADAS, G-sensor and many other features. </p><p>  Here are just purchased, focusing on: price, dimensions and ease of installation.  After the acquisition, the driver pays attention to the quality of the video.  The remaining "buns" remain unclaimed after the detection of incorrect operation. </p><p>  Calibration of the G-sensor is difficult due to the lack of a Russian-language interface: everything has to be mastered by the icons and firmware in English.  Low sensitivity of the shock sensor will lead to loss of video with the details of an accident, and high - to frequent false positives (sharp turns, braking, or bumps). </p><p>  If an electronic accelerometer is not needed (for example, the driver lives in sparsely populated areas) or the design does not provide for calibration, it is simply evaporated from the system board.  It turns out that the funds for the gadget were wasted. </p><p>  The above products from Xiaomi do not work on the determination of devices for fixing the high-speed mode.  For this purpose, motorists choose the Vizant 750st DVR-Radar: works with emissions of type K, Ultra K, Ka, X and Ultra X. </p><p>  Or Street Storm STR-9970 Twin, which detects Strelka-ST and Robot systems at a great distance, Vokord, Avtouragan, Avtodoriya radar modules, laser radiation from the new generation LISD and Amata systems as well as the complexes ‚ÄúChris-P‚Äù, ‚ÄúIskra‚Äù, ‚ÄúVizir‚Äù, ‚ÄúBinar‚Äù, ‚ÄúFalcon‚Äù, ‚ÄúRadis‚Äù and ‚ÄúArena‚Äù. </p><p>  There are gadgets in which GPS-navigators are integrated, interacting with GLONASS, broadcasting films on the screen and controlled by the application.  Naturally, additional functionality affects the price.  You should clearly determine what you want to see in the purchased product, so as not to pay extra money and not regret what you did.  Extra options will hang dead weight. </p><p>  The selection of the DVR should be treated with due attention: to study reviews, functions and (if possible) to ask friends.  In order not to become a victim of a marketing campaign for the sale of low-quality goods. </p><p>  Video is considered in court as evidence, but if there are signs of editing, criminal liability is provided.  Therefore, it is recommended that witnesses declare the presence of a registrar, remove the memory card, seal it in an envelope and hand it over to the police officer when analyzing the details of the accident. </p><p>  The operation of the DVR depends on the correct operation: do not allow sudden changes in temperature, do not drop, monitor the battery level and the correctness of the options set.  The latter have a habit of getting lost. </p><p>  Good luck on the road! </p>
