    <p>  MegaFon subscribers can afford to install the full version of the application.  But customers of other operators who want to use this service will be forced to purchase a SIM card.  But this acquisition will quickly pay for itself, because the service from MegaFon - MultiFon allows you to save significantly. </p><p>  By dialing * 137 # on the phone or activating the service in your account, subscribers get access to all the features.  From this moment, users can call numbers of other mobile networks, send MMS and SMS.  But at the same time, do not forget that for multimedia messages a fee is charged according to the tariffs set by the mobile operator.  But taking into account the fact that incoming calls are free, and preferential rates are applied to outgoing calls, many can afford these expenses. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In addition, users can view their call history, messages, edit mood, change status.  Everyone can also set up incoming calls ‚Äî they can go either separately to a mobile phone or to MultiFon, or they can go there and there at the same time. </p><h2>  Tariffs </h2>

On the contrary, with its help, subscribers not only get access to high-quality audio and video communications, but can significantly reduce the amount that is spent monthly on calls.  Tracking and controlling the money spent is quite simple.  Indeed, for calls both through the application and through a regular phone with a MegaFon SIM card, one account is used.

    <p>  Currently, the service is provided without a monthly fee.  When making voice and video calls within the MultiFon network, absolutely nothing is deducted from user accounts.  For a minute of conversation with MegaFon subscribers, users will pay 0.8 rubles, and for calls to phones of other operators - 1.5 rubles.  For international calls, their cost will depend on the country of the subscriber.  For example, every 60 seconds of communication with Canada will cost 0.6, with Israel, the United States - 0.9, Turkey - 2.9 rubles.  A complete list of countries and the cost of calls to each of them can be found on the MegaFon official website. </p><p>  Sending SMS will cost users of MultiFon 1.5 rubles, the cost of MMS will depend only on the tariff plan used. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúMultiFon-business‚Äù </h2>

For such subscribers, the company offers the opportunity to organize communications both within the office and beyond, using IP PBX, a regular smartphone or computer.

But the company continues to take care of its customers, paying particular attention to those who communicate a lot.  So, the operator offers the so-called ‚Äúpackages of minutes‚Äù for calls in various directions.  For example, people who talk a lot with MegaFon subscribers within their home region can buy 1000 minutes for calls for 500 rubles, for 800 - 2000, and for 3000 - 10 000.

    <p>  The same opportunity is provided to those who often make calls to fixed or mobile numbers.  The cost of 2000 minutes of conversations with subscribers anywhere in Russia is set at 2900, and with residents of Moscow and the Moscow Region - 2000 rubles.  Only those who use the application from the MegaFon MultiFon company can order and use the ‚Äúminute packages‚Äù.  To do this, send an SMS message to the short number 1117. In the text of the message, the connection code of the service you are interested in is indicated.  For example, to buy 1000 minutes of outgoing calls to all networks of the specified operator, it will be ‚ÄúMF1000‚Äù.  Each purchased package is valid for 30 days from the date of its connection. </p><h2>  Possible problems </h2><p>  Sometimes situations arise when the MultiFon service becomes unavailable.  MegaFon may block access to it in several cases: </p><ul><li>  a balance lock occurred, while the subscriber did not replenish his account within a month; </li><li>  The contract with the indicated telecommunication company was terminated. </li></ul><p>  In addition, if you independently disabled MultiFon and after this event more than a month has passed, then you won‚Äôt be able to enter the application using the old password.  Also, the service may not be available due to the fact that the Internet service provider is blocking it. </p><h2>  Connection and disconnection of "MultiPhone", application fee </h2>

But the proposed ‚ÄúMultiFon‚Äù service is provided without a monthly fee, money will be charged only for calls made and for messages sent.  Therefore, it is not worth considering that MegaFon makes the connected services paid.  Of course, in 2011, as soon as the service was put into operation, this operator said that "MultiFon" would be provided on a paid basis.  It was planned that the <span>monthly fee</span> will be 50 rubles / month.  But for now, MegaFon has abandoned this idea.

    <p>  If you decide to join the MultiFon, then you can do this for free.  Also, there will be no charge for disconnecting from the system, you can refuse to use the service at any time. </p><p>  The only drawback that users are talking about is a delayed charge.  As a result, if you check the balance immediately after the conversation, it can be unchanged, money can be withdrawn after a few minutes.  It is precisely because of this that many, unexpectedly for them, have a negative account balance.  Because of this situation, some subscribers start to think that they have connected paid services.  Others believe that they have introduced a monthly fee for using MultiFon and are trying to disconnect from the service. </p><h2>  Paid services </h2><p>  If it seems to you that your balance is too quickly reset, check if there is a charge for all the MegaFon services that you use.  To do this is quite simple, and each subscriber has several options.  So, clients of this operator can log into the Service Guide system via the Internet.  To obtain a password, you will need to send a message to 000105 by typing ‚Äú41‚Äù in the text box.  In response, the operator will send a password, which will need to be entered in a designated field.  After entering the system, subscribers will see all the services and subscriptions they use.  If funds are withdrawn for any of them, then they can be easily turned off. </p><p>  "Service Guide" is also available from a mobile.  To obtain information, it will be necessary to send the following USSD request * 105 # to MegaFon operator.  The connected services will then be displayed on the mobile screen, their cost will also be visible there. </p><p>  If you are afraid not to deal with the system or miss something, then you can go to the nearest communication salon, where the consultants will help you find out what the funds are being withdrawn for and turn off all the services you do not need. </p>
