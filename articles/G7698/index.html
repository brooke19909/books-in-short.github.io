    <p>  It is important to remember that the temperature of the water should not be room or cold - then it is more difficult to knead the slime.  In addition, do not put too much starch, because of this the slim can become hard. </p><h2>  Plasticine Lizun </h2><p>  How to make a slime without sodium and PVA glue?  There are tons of ways.  Now let's get acquainted with the next of them.  The advantage of plasticine slim is that it does not blur, keeping the look that you gave it.  Use such materials for its manufacture: </p><ul><li>  edible gelatin; </li><li>  plasticine. </li></ul><p>  How to make a slime without PVA?  First you need a metal bowl.  Type cold water into it.  There, dissolve the gelatin in the proportion indicated on its packaging.  Next, leave it to infuse for an hour.  After the specified time, put the bowl on the fire - the liquid should begin to boil.  As soon as this happens, it must be removed from the fire. </p><p>  Next, you need to warm up plasticine in your hands (about 100 grams).  Then you need to pour water (50 ml) into a plastic container.  Then use a spatula to mix it with plasticine.  Now pour gelatin into plasticine and knead until you get a homogeneous mass.  And the final stage of manufacturing - put the mixture in the refrigerator until it cools completely. </p><h2>  And some more manufacturing tips </h2><p>  We figured out how to make a slime without PVA glue and starch, but it does not always turn out right away right away.  Therefore, we will further consider the options and reasons for why and what should be done if the slim turned out to be wrong. </p><p>  Naturally, much depends on the quality of the materials used in the manufacture of the slime, their proportions are also important.  In the recipes they are indicated with approximately no accuracy, and therefore you have room here for experiments with the consistency of lizun. </p><p>  What to do if the uniformity of the slime is broken?  In this case, it is worth kneading it well for several minutes.  After which it will become viscous and uniform. </p><p>  If it is too sticky - it reaches for a spoon with threads, and sticks to the fingers so that it just does not lag behind - it means that the mixture needs to be a little liquefied.  A small amount of <span>liquid starch</span> or plain water will help you, depending on the method of making the slime that you have chosen. </p>

    <p>  Maybe vice versa, the mass stretches, but it does not stick to the fingers.  The reason in this case is an excess of fluid in the slime.  If this happens, then you should drain the excess powder solution, starch or water.  Or you can add some binding material, such as flour.  Then again knead the resulting mass. </p><h2>  Little conclusion </h2><p>  Now you know how to make a slime without PVA.  After you have made the toy, you should make sure that your beloved child does not throw a lizun into the wall, otherwise there will be greasy spots on the wallpaper.  And from playing slim on fleecy surfaces, hairs will stick to the toy. </p><p>  It is important to know that its shelf life is on average one and a half to two weeks.  And in between games, the lizun should be stored in the refrigerator, but not in the freezer.  At the same time, do not forget to place it in a container and close it with a lid or in a plastic bag.  This is done so that it does not dry out due to contact with open air. </p><p>  Also, to extend the service of the slim, you can wipe it with alcohol, removing the adhering debris.  Do not wash it in the sink - you risk washing the lizun down the drain.  But if he began to lose his properties, just add a little water to it. </p><p>  And most importantly, you need to remember: always after playing with a lizun you need to wash your hands and those parts of the body with which it came into contact with soap.  So that the child does not have an allergic reaction. </p>
