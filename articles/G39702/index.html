    <p>  So, the Cathedral of St. Michael's Cathedral was built in Izhevsk, which is one of the most beautiful and large architectural monuments of the Russian Orthodox Church.  For residents of the city - this is a symbol of the revival of Udmurtia. </p><p>  These lands were consecrated in 1765 during the construction of the Trinity Chapel.  Later, in 1784, the chapel was converted into a church, which was destroyed by fire in 1810.  In the middle of the XIX century.  a stone chapel appeared on the site of the temple.  The construction was built in honor of the patron saint of gunsmiths Archangel Michael. </p><p>  In 1876, donations began to be collected for the construction of the new cathedral, in which the workers of the arms factory took part.  With the outbreak of war and revolutionary unrest, the construction of the temple was suspended.  But in November 1915, the throne was illuminated in the name of the Holy Archangel Michael.  In 1920, the church was closed.  In the years 1932-1937.  there was a museum of local lore, destroyed in 1937. </p><p>  The decision to recreate the cathedral was made in 2000.  The solemn laying of the temple took place in 2004.  In 2007, Patriarch Alexy II, in the presence of the head of Udmurtia, consecrated the main throne of the cathedral.  The Cathedral, 67 meters high, is located on the highest point of the city. </p><p>  At the foot of the temple stands a seven-meter cross, the surrounding area is decorated with flower beds, there are benches and lanterns.

    <p>  The first shelters were opened in the <span>Vyatka province</span> in the Izhevsk-Nagorno volost of the Sarapul district and subsequently became orphanages in Izhevsk.  Children were taught literacy and craft.  The building of the former shelter was built in 1898.  Now here is the House of Children's Creativity. </p><h2>  Unusual Monuments </h2>

At the central square of the city there is a figurine of a boy cast from old keys collected by residents in honor of the 250th anniversary of Izhevsk and the Izhstal plant.  "Izhik" fulfills desires.  If you rub the sleeve of his caftan - you will find your home, touch your nose - the firstborn will be a boy, but for luck you just need to put coins on the hat "Izhika".

    <p>  Near the cafe "Canyon" are sculptures of Don Quixote and his squire Sancho Panza.  Another interesting composition, representing a giant scissors with a comb, is installed at the beauty salon on the street.  Petrova, 3. The four-meter statue is dedicated to the skill of Izhevsk barbers.  In the square on the street  Gorky placed a monument to the victims of radiation accidents.  And there are a lot of such different sculptures and figures around the city. </p><p>  At the entrance to the city for more than 50 years, elk sculpture has been welcoming guests.  For the past 20 years, local "craftsmen" and pranksters have tried to make their contribution to the look of a moose, turning it into a zebra, then into an "Easter" decoration.  It would have been broken, but a tradition appeared - to come here young on the wedding day. </p><p>  And finally, I would like to note that if it is worth visiting a city from the Russian hinterland, it is Izhevsk.  Attractions reviews receive the most diverse, but most often cause positive or even enthusiastic emotions.  If tourists complain about anything, it’s on rainy weather or lack of transport. </p>
