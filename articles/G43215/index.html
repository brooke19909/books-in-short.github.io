    <h2>  Dubai - a paradise on earth </h2><p>  The largest and most popular city in the UAE, the center of the Emirates, is considered Dubai.  It is located on the coast of the <span>Persian Gulf</span> and is a beautiful, dynamically developing settlement.  The canal, which even today serves as a haven for Arab transport ships, is divided into two parts.  The large eastern territory, located northeast of Dubai Creek Bay, is Deira.  This business district with numerous business centers and branches of various companies is called Jumeirah.  The hallmark of the area is the famous Parus Hotel. </p><p>  Another part of the city is Dubai Bar.  This area keeps the history of the entire village.  It is here that unique architectural structures and historical monuments are concentrated.  For connoisseurs of history, this particular part of the city is considered the most attractive.  A map of Dubai with attractions will help you plan an excursion for those who have visited the country for the first time.  Indeed, for a short period of time I want to see as much as possible. </p>

    <h2>  Dubai Attractions </h2><p>  The hallmark of Dubai is currently the Burj Khalifa skyscraper (Dubai Tower).  This is the tallest building in the world, the opening of which took place in 2010.  Its height is 828 meters.  No less attractive is one of the largest aquariums in the world, located in the largest <span>shopping and entertainment center in Dubai</span> Mall.  It is a giant glass panel, under which a tunnel for visitors has been laid.  A map of Dubai with landmarks will help you quickly get to this unique place.  Another unique building of the city is the singing fountain, located near the Burj Khalifa tower.  Its height is 150 meters.  Depending on the musical composition, the fountain jets rise to one or another height.  Another incredible Arab project is artificially sprinkled islands.  One of these is the Palm Jumeirah.  The diameter of this island reaches 5 kilometers.  For shoppers, Nasser Square is the perfect place.  Dubai receives thousands of guests every day who want to visit this particular area. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Deira's heart </h2><p>  In the heart of Deira is Nasser Square.  Dubai (reviews of people who have visited this corner of the UAE more than once, confirm these words) have long attracted tourists with their many shops, markets and shopping centers.  This quarter attracts shopaholics and ordinary travelers with hundreds of shop windows, counters, restaurants and cafes for every taste.  Now the square has been renamed Bunyas Square, but this does not reduce the number of guests seeking to visit the mentioned part of the city.  Baniyas Square is a huge square surrounded by many buildings and attractions.  The most frequent tourists here are residents of the countries of the former CIS.  Meet Russian-speakers in this area is not uncommon.  Plus, here you can hear advertisements of many stores, sounding in Russian. </p><h2>  Attractions in Nasser (Banias) Square </h2>

It is very cozy, with numerous fountains and benches for relaxation.  Life in the square does not stop for a moment.  The pride of architecture is the famous Deira Tower.  It is located in the center of Baniyas Square and is designed in such a way that almost all the time it covers the area from the scorching sun.  The construction is a 20-story building, crowned with a high dome of a closed spherical shape.  On the facade of the building are large bends.  They help to create a shadow throughout the street.  Nearby are picturesque fountains having a fairly large area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe water basin and several dozen high jets.  Palm trees are planted around the perimeter of the tanks, and in the dark, the original illumination is turned on.

The many shopping streets of Nasser Square form a kind of maze.  There are four markets here: Usal, Naif, Murshid and the most popular indoor market Deira, named after this area.  The oldest is the Murshid market.  It stretches a narrow strip along the bay.  Nearby, on Sikkat al-Hale, is the Gold Market, where you can buy silver and gold jewelry and accessories, many of which are decorated with precious stones.  For the convenience of visitors, the bazaar area is shaded by a convex roof, which saves from the scorching sun.  Products from the "eastern gold" are more expensive.  They are not difficult to distinguish, because they are more yellow than the gold jewelry that we used to see.  And still they are cheaper than ours in Russia.  Many side streets, which host small traditional coffee houses, depart from this street.  The spices market is no less attractive.  To get on it, you need to go along Al-Ras, then turn onto Abra Street.  On the left you will find an entrance leading to one of the few streets of the mentioned market.  Here you can buy any spices that you just heard about.  It is this corner of Nasser Square that most of all conveys all the eastern flavor.

Nasser Square, whose shops and retail stores stretch endlessly, will live up to all your hopes.  Here you can buy anything: shoes, clothes, haberdashery, various souvenirs, fabrics, electronics and household appliances.  Almost all local merchants know a little Russian.  When buying goods in stores and shops, it should be remembered that in the Arab countries it is accepted that the product has an initial value, but this does not mean that it is final.  Thus, you can always bargain and get a decent discount.  Products of famous brands in ordinary stores you will not find.  To this end, go reconnaissance in special boutiques of shopping centers.

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Before getting to Nasser Square, the photo of which is presented here, it is necessary to carry out an air flight from Moscow to Dubai, the duration of which is 5 hours.  Aircraft in the UAE fly from other cities of Russia.  Dubai International Airport is the largest airport in the Middle East.  Reception of international flights is carried out by terminal 1. To get to the city by metro, you need to go to terminal 3. And even better, find Nasser Square (Dubai) on the map.  So it will be easier to navigate during the trip.  In order to take the subway, you need to get to the green line, and then to the Baniyas Square station.  Knowing which hotels are in the area, you can also get on special buses.  But the easiest option is a taxi.  There is no need to speak Arabic, you just need to name the area, and the driver will get you home without any problems. </p><h2>  What about the weather, or when is it better to go? </h2><p>  Before you go to the UAE, you need to find out everything about the weather conditions in a given period of the year, and choose the most suitable one for yourself.  So, in the summer there is sultry heat.  The temperature even in the shade reaches 35-43 degrees above zero.  But in winter, breathing is much easier.  The thermometer column shows from 18 to 25 degrees of heat.  In addition, it must be borne in mind that the main period of rains falls on December and January.  A trip to this time period can be overshadowed by heavy rainfall and spoil all the pleasure of traveling and shopping.  When purchasing tickets or tours, it must be borne in mind that from the end of September, after the summer heat subsides a little, the tourist season begins, which lasts until the beginning of May.  Therefore, in this period their cost may be somewhat more expensive. </p>
