The state owns 100% of the shares of the financial organization, which is why its many customers highly value the reliability of the bank.  Based on the name of the company, it can be understood that it is primarily aimed at working with farmers and gardeners. </p><p>  For them, specialists are pleased to offer favorable lending conditions at the Agricultural Bank for legal entities without collateral or with security, with and without a guarantee.  Also, at any office of the Agricultural Bank, specialists will be happy to offer consumer loans and deposits to both individuals and legal entities.  Also, at any office of the Agricultural Bank, specialists will be happy to offer consumer loans and deposits to both individuals and legal entities. </p><h2>  Purpose and term of loans </h2><p>  There are a lot of credit conditions for consumer loans at the Agricultural Bank.  The allocated funds can be spent on the improvement of suburban real estate or on the purchase of land.  Loans for mortgages and repairs, for the purchase of a car or special equipment for business, are also actively issued.  For example, garden plot owners will surely like the terms of lending for urgent production needs during the planting season.  Also, borrowers can get the gardener to improve the territory on their own plot of land or for repair, or for the construction of a country house. </p><div class="photo" data-original="go32.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The management of one of the branches of RSHB" class="if uuid-2647703" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52497/2647703.jpg"></div><p>  The Bank is ready to offer its customers cash in order to connect a suburban private house to the central water supply, to the gas pipe laid near the site, or to the general sewage system.  Such a target program from a credit institution is referred to as ‚ÄúEngineering Communications‚Äù. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For people with loans at several banks, the Agricultural Bank opened a service to refinance existing loans issued by third parties. </p><p>  Among other things, the bank is ready to offer visitors two additional lending programs without collateral and <span>collateral for real estate.</span>  Money is provided provided that it is spent on the following purposes: </p><ul><li>  education; </li><li>  home repair; </li><li>  journey; </li><li>  car purchase; </li><li>  treatment or rehabilitation in medical centers. </li></ul><h2>  Loan terms </h2><p>  The loan term for individuals depends on the chosen program.  So, a loan to people of retirement age can be issued for a period of 6 months to 7 years.  Funds allocated by the bank against the security of an apartment must be returned no later than 120 months from the moment of signing the contract. </p><div class="photo" data-original="go32.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="receives guests at the office of the Agricultural Bank" class="if uuid-2647707" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52497/2647707.jpg"></div><p>  Other lending programs from Rosselkhozbank can be found in the table below: </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr style="text-align: center;"><td><p>  Bank loan programs </p></td><td><p>  The maximum period for which the client must repay the loan with interest </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  "Gardener" </p></td><td style="text-align: center;"><p>  5 years </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Unsecured Ordinary Consumer Credit </p></td><td style="text-align: center;"><p>  5 years </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Ordinary consumer secured loan </p></td><td style="text-align: center;"><p>  5 years </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  "Engineering Communication" </p></td><td style="text-align: center;"><p>  5 years </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Refinancing of previously issued loans in other banks </p></td><td style="text-align: center;"><p>  5 years </p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  Advantages of the Russian Agricultural Bank </h2><p>  According to representatives of the bank, they have a number of advantages over competitors, which are likely to appeal to customers.  First, credit department employees try to process applications submitted to them as quickly as possible and promptly give an answer to the question of whether a loan has been approved for a client of a financial institution.  In addition, to obtain borrowed funds, a visitor to the Rosselkhozbank JSC will need to collect a minimum number of documents.  Secondly, the bank is ready to issue loans to all segments of the population, regardless of their income level. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, the main direction of this organization is lending to individuals and legal entities involved in agriculture.  For this, the bank has several very attractive programs. </p><h2>  Secured loan </h2><p>  There are a lot of favorable credit conditions at the Agricultural Bank, depending on the program chosen by the borrower.  One of the most popular among them is called the "Gardener".  Borrowed money is issued by the bank against any real estate, and a vehicle can also be used as collateral.  To take a loan for a large amount of money (from 1 million rubles), the borrower will need to find one or more guarantors.  They must take responsibility for obligations to the credit institution in case of insolvency of their partner. </p><div class="photo" data-original="stavtoday.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Opening a new branch of the bank" class="if uuid-2647704" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52497/2647704.jpg"></div><p>  The interest rate on loans directly depends on the type of collateral, as well as the time for which the borrower is obliged to repay the debt.  Least of all overpayments will be for those people who have provided their property as collateral.  In the event that the client does not want to pledge real estate, he will have to find a guarantor.  In this case, the bank will approve the loan, but with an increased interest rate. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In a credit institution, there are premiums to the interest rate.  So, if the client does not want to participate in the voluntary life and health insurance program, the interest rate will increase immediately by 6%.  The interest rate will increase by the same amount if the borrower violates the terms of the insurance contract. </p><p>  In the event that the client violates the contract with the bank, failing to provide timely documents confirming the intended use of the funds granted on credit, the credit institution has the right to increase the interest rate by two points. </p><p>  <span>An improper loan</span> at the Rosselkhozbank is issued to private individuals only on condition that the client agrees to mortgage the dwelling as a guarantee of timely payments.  The guarantee may be an apartment, a house with the possibility of year-round use, a townhouse or a land plot.  For refusal of life and health insurance, as well as for violation of clauses of the insurance contract, the bank is entitled to increase the interest rate to 3% per annum. </p><p>  This credit organization appreciates its regular and reliable customers.  For this, various incentives have been invented in the form of a reduction in interest rates.  So, for individuals who have been working with the bank for several years and pay loans on time, the interest rate on a new loan can be reduced by two percentage points.  Salary customers of a credit institution, as well as state employees, the rate on consumer loans was reduced by 1.5% percent. </p><h2>  Basic loan conditions </h2><p>  Lending conditions at the Agricultural Bank for individuals are different and depend on the selected program.  The most common standard loan without guarantors and real estate collateral will be issued at the highest rate.  It can be reduced by 2% for bank customers and for public sector employees. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mkkaluga.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian Agricultural Bank issues a mortgage" class="if uuid-2647708" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52497/2647708.jpg"></div><p>  Many older people think about the question of what are the conditions for <span>lending to pensioners at the Agricultural Bank.</span>  For citizens who have reached retirement age, the bank has prepared a separate profitable lending program.  Overpayment will depend on the loan term and the bank where the pension is transferred.  Of course, the most favorable conditions will be if the client receives a pension at the Agricultural Bank and the full repayment period does not exceed 12 months.  The maximum loan program amount for pensioners is 500 thousand rubles, and the minimum rate does not exceed 12.9% per annum.  The maximum loan repayment period is 7 years. </p><p>  For individuals who choose the program "Gardener", a loan is provided with a minimum interest rate of 19%.  The maximum loan term is 5 years. </p><p>  This lending institution is always ready to meet its customers and help them repair the country house or bring gas, electricity or water supply to the house.  For the above goals, it is most beneficial to use a program called Engineering Communications.  For a period of up to 5 years, you can borrow money from the bank in the amount of 500 thousand rubles at 20.5% per year. </p><p>  If a citizen, applying to the Agricultural Bank for a loan, is ready to provide housing as collateral, then he can count on up to 10 million rubles at a minimum rate of 16%.  An agreement is concluded for a period of up to 10 years. </p><p>  An individual can also arrange a car as collateral or find one (or several) guarantors.  The loan rate in this case will be 21.5%, and the maximum loan amount - 1 million rubles for up to 5 years.  Without collateral, a bank client can count on a loan amount not exceeding 750 thousand rubles.  In this case, the interest rate will increase to 19% per annum. </p><h2>  Refinancing loans </h2><p>  Many people in our country are interested in what credit conditions exist at the Agricultural Bank for refinancing several loans.  Recently, the service of combining several loans into one has become popular among the Russian population.  Russian Agricultural Bank also provides services for combining loans into one.  In order to obtain a consumer loan to repay existing loans received from other banks, the client should know that the interest rate at the Agricultural Bank will be significantly reduced to 13.5%.  The bank is ready to issue no more than 750 thousand rubles for repayment of old debts for a period of up to 5 years. </p><h2>  Loan cost calculation </h2><p>  After the cash loan has been approved, the conditions of lending to the Agricultural Bank to the client are clear to the client, it is necessary to start calculating the full cost of the loan.  In order to find out what monthly payment the bank has to pay, you should contact the RSHB hotline or visit the nearest office of this credit organization. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sbankom.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Street ATM RSHB" class="if uuid-2647702" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52497/2647702.jpg"></div><p>  Specialists will gladly calculate the full cost of the loan and print out a table of annuity payments.  On the calculations you will see the date of the obligatory payment, as well as the amount that goes to pay off interest and principal. </p><h2>  Russian Agricultural Bank Offices </h2><p>  Before finding out what are the conditions for lending for the purchase of housing in the Agricultural Bank, it will probably be useful for citizens to know where the offices of this financial institution work.  The geography of the presence of this credit institution is quite extensive.  Numerous offices are opened not only in large cities of Russia, such as Moscow (the main office is opened at Larch lane, 2-D) and St. Petersburg (the main office is located at Paradnaya street, 5, building 1, lit. .A).  Bank lending points were opened daily in Novosibirsk (Fabrichnaya street, 13), Omsk (Frunze street, 52), Kazan (Dostoevsky street, 80), Rostov-on-Don (Mikhail Nagibin avenue, 14 -A), Yekaterinburg (February Revolution Street, 15), Chelyabinsk (Lenin Avenue, 26-A), Nizhny Novgorod (Kulibina Street, 3) and Samara (Akademika Platonova Street, 10). </p><h2>  Borrower Requirements </h2><p>  The main lending conditions at the Agricultural Bank are as follows: </p><ul><li>  a loan at the bank can be taken by persons aged 23 to 65 years; </li><li>  an individual who has not reached retirement age must work at one place of work for at least 6 months; </li><li>  for salary clients, their minimum work experience should exceed 3 months at one enterprise; </li><li>  total work experience should exceed 12 months. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="ksonline.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The main activity of RSHB" class="if uuid-2647705" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52497/2647705.jpg"></div><p>  The borrower needs to prepare a number of basic documents in advance, namely: </p><ul><li>  application in the form of a credit organization; </li><li>  passport; </li><li>  an additional document, such as a copy of an employment contract, a pension certificate or military ID. </li></ul><p>  An individual entrepreneur may need a certificate of registration of an individual entrepreneur in order to fulfill all credit conditions at the Agricultural Bank and receive a cash loan.  Notaries when going to the bank office must have a copy of the license to carry out their activities in the field of law, as well as a copy of the order of appointment.  Perhaps, a loan from a notarial chamber is required to approve a loan. </p><h2>  Collection of documents on solvency </h2><p>  An important condition for lending to individuals at the Agricultural Bank is the availability of basic documents from the borrower.

A cash loan to legal entities is issued if there is a certificate in the form of 3-NDFL from a bank client, which confirms the implementation of tax payments in favor of the state.  Also, the company needs to receive a statement of current accounts. </p><p>  For people holding the position of a notary, there are separate loan conditions at the Agricultural Bank.  To get a loan, they will need to obtain the following documents: </p><ul><li>  statement of current accounts; </li><li>  copy of the tax return in the form of 3-personal income tax. </li></ul><h2>  Loan application review period </h2><p>  After all the conditions of lending in the Agricultural Bank are studied, it is necessary to find out the term for consideration of the application for receiving money.  As a rule, employees of the credit organization Rosselkhozbank consider an application for a loan to a private person for up to three business days.  A positive decision of the bank remains valid for 45 days from the date of approval of the application. </p><div class="photo" data-original="news.yandex.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Collector car RSHB" class="if uuid-2647709" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52497/2647709.jpg"></div><p>  After signing the contract and execution (at the request of the client) of voluntary life and health insurance, money is paid at the cash desk in cash or transferred to the borrower's account by bank transfer. </p><h2>  Mortgage in RSHB </h2><p>  Every year there is an improvement in the conditions of mortgage lending in JSC "Agricultural Bank".  In 2018, he helps families buy housing for citizens through the following profitable programs: </p><ol><li>  Allocation of funds for primary housing (apartment or house, including under construction). </li><li>  The issuance of a loan for the purchase of housing in the secondary market. </li><li>  Mortgage on two documents. </li><li>  Special mortgage for military personnel. </li><li>  Purchase of housing under the state support program for young families. </li><li>  Refinancing a mortgage issued in other banks. </li><li>  Acquisition of commercial real estate on credit. </li></ol><p>  Young families often ask what are the conditions for mortgage lending at the Agricultural Bank.
