    <h2>  Early life </h2><p>  The future queen of the thieves' world was born in the family of Jewish refugees.  Married Kalina Nikiforova (biography, photos of her are given below) came out for the first time at a fairly early age.  Her husband was a very old jeweler, suitable for years not even as fathers, but as grandfathers.  Their family life was generally happy, but not for long, as the husband of our heroine died of old age, but at the same time left her a rather impressive condition.  Moreover, the inheritance consisted not only in a substantial amount of money on a savings book, but also in bank signs hidden at home in cash.  In addition, Kalina received from her deceased spouse during his lifetime significant knowledge in jewelry and various necessary connections in the elite world of jewelry masters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Start of work </h2><p>  Despite the fact that Kalina Nikiforova (her biography is very interesting to many today) could easily stay at home and live on the inheritance she received, she did not sit idle.  The young woman went to work in the field of trade, and not just to the store, but to the legendary "Birch". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="biography of viburnum nikiforova" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38782/2117450.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Personal qualities </h2><p>  In a new role for herself, the lady was well accustomed.  And all because Kalina was inherent in the ability to very quickly establish contacts with suitable and necessary people for her.  She was distinguished by attractiveness and vigilance, an open and <span>sincere smile</span> almost never left her face <span>.</span>  Literally for some six months, the then ordinary woman Kalina Nikiforova, whose biography was not yet tainted by criminal crimes, became what is called her own in a bohemian environment, as well as for currency traders, speculators and public servants.  All this ultimately led to the fact that she falls under the personal guardianship of several thieves in law, including the well-known Vyacheslav Ivankov (aka Jap). </p><h2>  The first criminal misconduct </h2><p>  Biography of Kalina Nikiforova says that her first crimes were the usual and then familiar to many speculation with food and checks.  But even at the training stage, for her, this seemed like a small achievement, and she begins to carry out more ambitious things.  Apparently, the woman was able to sell stolen property, carry out money fraud and give a tip to the lads on people who obviously lived on more than one salary, that is, beyond their means.  All this quite naturally led to the fact that after a while Kalina received a very real time, which turned out to be the first and, as it turned out later, the only one in her turbulent life. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kalina Nikiforova biography photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38782/2117451.jpg"></div>

Her biography tells us that she spent relatively little time in the zone, and left there with a firm decision not to engage in trifles anymore, but to act exclusively as a ‚Äúthink tank‚Äù.  And therefore, all further gangster activity was reduced to the so-called flirting with the law: a woman actively consults in the field of criminal law, organizes regular sales of various relics and jewelry abroad, and directly directs raids on the homes of ‚Äúshuttles‚Äù and very wealthy citizens.  And most importantly, Kalina was always aware of all the main criminal cases and events of the thieves' world.  You could even say that she made money literally from the air ... </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  As one of the operative officers of MUR recalls, it was practically impossible to catch Nikiforova ‚Äúon the hot‚Äù, because she clearly avoided the traps set on her.  Moreover, she could not even be attracted as an accomplice. </p><p>  For example, many Jews who found themselves in Israel after the collapse of the USSR asked Kalina to help them return their <span>family jewels</span> from Russia, bypassing customs and police.  It goes without saying that the woman could not give them a negative answer.  She stored all the paintings, various figurines, money, antiques at her place, regularly promising petitioning foreigners to send their property with her man.  Needless to say, the woman in law Kalina Nikiforova, whose biography is very often studied by students of law schools today, has returned nothing to anyone.  Well, reasonable Jews didn‚Äôt turn to law enforcement agencies, it‚Äôs easy to guess why ... </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thief in law Kalina Nikiforova biography" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29489/2118172.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  And what is the situation like when Kalina called one of her closest friends and complained that her fur coats, VCRs, money were stolen from her.  The upset merchant wanted to call the police, but Nikiforova discouraged her from doing this, because law enforcement officers would immediately be interested in the origin of such a large amount of expensive property.  It goes without saying that the victim did not contact the detectives and thanked the experienced thief for advice.  And at that time, investigators listening to Kalina‚Äôs phone were very nervous, because she again slipped off the hook. </p><h2>  Terrible secret </h2><p>  As it turned out in reality, the thief in law Kalina Nikiforova, whose biography is full of many bright events, outplayed not only individual investigators, but also the entire police and the underworld.  And all because for many years she regularly and without any twinges of conscience handed over her accomplices to the staff of the OBKhSS.  Of course, the capital's behi simply could not get enough of their secret employee Julia (operational nickname Nikiforova).  At the same time, currency swindlers, professional speculators and other representatives of the criminal world regularly and sincerely thanked Kalina, saying that they would certainly find a ‚Äúsnitch‚Äù who often turned them in to the police.  All these people did not even suspect: a real informant was always with them and gave ‚Äúsensible‚Äù advice. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kalina Nikiforova biography article" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38782/2117480.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Family status </h2><p>  Kalina Nikiforova (biography, her family is covered in numerous secrets) had an intimate relationship with Jap.  It should be noted that thieves laws forbade the right thief to have a wife and children.  However, the tandem of Kalina and Yaponchik was always considered a real thieves pair. </p><p>  What kept them together?  It is definitely difficult to answer this question.  Perhaps their relationship was built on real feelings, because they met daily near the pedestal to Pushkin, where the Japanese always gave Kalina flowers, and then led them to a restaurant.  Although it is likely that they were connected and some business that they jointly pondered and discussed. </p><p>  Reliable fact: at a certain moment, Yaponichka was threatened with a real prison term for car theft.  And Nikiforova was the first to confirm his alibi, despite the fact that she herself was in the Mozhaisk correctional institution.  It is believed that the woman prompted the bandit with the necessary addresses at which rich people lived. </p><p>  In addition, it is well known that Yaponchik had a son from Kalina named Victor, whom the felon named before the entire brotherly personal governor, to whom he left all his property.  Of course, this is hardly allowed in the gangster world, so that an outsider, and even more so a woman, becomes the personal heir to the thief in law. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kalina Nikiforova biography family" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38782/2117488.jpg"></div>

    <p>  As a result, the thieves' family was destroyed under very tragic circumstances.  In 1998, Victor, nicknamed Kalina in honor of his respected mother in the thieves, was shot dead in his own entrance, and Jap died in 2009. </p><h2>  The death of a female thief </h2><p>  At the age of forty, Kalina Nikiforova, whose biography was carefully documented by the operatives, managed to buy an underground shoe-making factory.  This enterprise was under the roof of a state industrial facility.  The shoe business brought fabulous income to our heroine, and she, as a competent leader, planned to significantly modernize her factory and even placed an order for the supply of the most modern equipment from Italy.  Despite the fact that Kalina Nikiforova (biography, articles about this unique lady are studied to this day) was a real millionaire, yet she could not use her fortune in any way.  This was explained by the fully functioning socialist system at that time, which then functioned 100%. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="woman viburnum nikiforova biography" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38782/2117496.jpg"></div>

      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  All this led to the fact that at some point the thief made an extremely risky decision, which not every man would undertake to implement - to overtake the plane to the American continent.  Having approached this with all its inherent pedantry, she prepared both the runway and the plane, in which she put all her expensive property. </p><p>  Even the security forces themselves said that it would be difficult for her to stop going abroad.  However, there are forces to which we all submit without exception ... </p><p>  On February 26, 1988, Kalina suddenly died in Yerevan.  As the autopsy later established, the cause of her death was acute heart failure. </p>
