Almost a hundred years ago, a large-scale improvement campaign was launched here.  Landscaping affected not only the parks, but the streets and boulevards of the city.  Today, the authorities, residents of Podolsk itself and the okrug continue this wonderful tradition, decorating not only the center, but also small streets, as well as <span>adjoining territories</span> with greenery <span>.</span> </p><p>  One of the most beautiful <span>green areas of the</span> city ‚Äã‚Äãis Talalikhina Park.  Podolsk has many parks and squares, but this is perhaps the most beloved among its inhabitants.  Various entertainments for children are arranged here, and on holidays solemn events and festivities are held. </p><h2>  History of creation </h2><p>  Talalikhin Park (Podolsk) was created in the second half of the XIX century.  The inspirer of its construction and the immediate founder was Count Arseny Zakrevsky, Governor General of Moscow.  Already then some alleys were laid and various entertainments were organized for the residents of the city. </p>

Beautiful arbors were built in it, and behind dense green trees cottages of white stone hid secretly.  The park hosted fun festivities and entertainments, which were attended not only by residents, but also by Muscovites.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The development of the park as a central resting place </h2><p>  The park was especially active in the past century.  In the twenties, a summer theater was built here, on the stage of which first representatives of the city amateur performances performed, and after the reconstruction, professional creative groups of Podolsk and even invited Moscow artists. </p><p>  After the war, the Talalikhin Park in Podolsk underwent significant reconstruction and improvement.  At this time, new paths were laid out here, rides and playgrounds were erected, sculptures and numerous pavilions were erected.  In 1959, a monument to Victor Talalikhin, the pilot and Hero of the Soviet Union, was solemnly erected.  Today it adorns the memorial part of the green zone.  By the way, in our time, competitions are held near the monument among young people dedicated to the memory of the famous pilot. </p><h2>  Talalikhin park today </h2><p>  About ten years ago, the Podolsk authorities decided to improve the Talalikhin park in order to preserve it as a monument of <span>landscape architecture</span> and adapt it to modern requirements.  The reconstruction was carried out in two stages, the first of which was completed in 2011.  The implementation of the second began in 2012.  This large-scale project made the city of Podolsk even more beautiful.  Park of Culture and Rest  Talalikhina today covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 28 hectares.  Almost a third is a landscaped area. </p>

    <p>  There are many alleys, lawns and flowering flower beds.  All tracks are covered with special fine-grained asphalt, which ensures the safety of riding bicycles and rollers.
