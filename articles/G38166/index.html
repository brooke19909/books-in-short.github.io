This is really very modest - 30 thousand rubles.  per person, considering the all-inclusive service. </p><p>  But if in advance, a few months before the trip, "fix" a room in mid-spring, for example, then you have to pay three times more.  Therefore, the best option is to monitor the dynamics of prices and wait for the moment when they will be minimal. </p><p>  By the way, if guests have a child and they want to take it with them on vacation, then you need to know - you will have to pay extra for $ 67 per night additionally.  And he will have to sleep on that bed, which is in the room, since they do not provide extra ones.  Here, a child under the age of 12 is considered a child.  Anyone older is registered as an adult. </p>
