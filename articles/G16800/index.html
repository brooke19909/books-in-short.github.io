    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  Hotel Xenios Theoxenia 4 * consists of four buildings and a well-groomed green area.  The complex successfully fits into the surrounding landscape.  Perhaps due to the fact that in this area a lot of vegetation and greenery. </p><p>  The hotel is located, by the way, in the ancient city of Uranopolis, which was founded back in 315 BC.  It is part of Halkidiki and occupies the territory that used to belong to the Athos <span>monastery Vatoped.</span> </p><p>  It's very beautiful here.  Vacationers are not very many, especially out of season, since the resort itself is small, and is far from Greek metropolitan areas where you can do entertainment.  The airport, located in Thessaloniki, also go about 130 kilometers.  But then it is quiet and peaceful.  And even to the sea - a stone's throw.  What is convenient: an underground passage leads to a sandy, clean beach with umbrellas and sun loungers.  So you don‚Äôt even have to cross the road - which is safer and shortens the path to the sea to one minute. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Service </h2><p>  The hotel complex Xenios Theoxenia 4 * fully corresponds to its slogan, which sounds like this: We work to make our guests happy!  It is translated as follows: "We work to make our guests happy!".  And having arrived here, you can make sure that the slogan is justified. </p><p>  The hotel has absolutely everything.  The reception is open 24 hours a day, free Wi-Fi is available throughout the property, and there is a luggage room in the lobby and a tour desk.  There is also parking, a mini market and a transfer port.  If guests need to be met at the airport, you need to contact the administration in advance of arrival and clarify all the nuances. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that the hotel has a dry cleaning service with laundry, motorcycle and car rental, a shared lounge, an internet corner with computers and postal services.

This is the price for two guests with half board included in the price.  If you need "all inclusive", then you will need to pay 10 thousand rubles.  more.  A variant with a sea view costs 5-7 tons.  more expensive.  If the view from the window is fundamental, then this nuance is better to negotiate with the administration separately, or indicate your wishes when booking. </p><p>  There are also 2-seater "Standards".  They almost do not differ from eco-rooms.  Unless, they have more area.  And, accordingly, spaciousness.  These apartments are designed for a maximum of 3 adults and 1 child.

But it‚Äôs economical. </p><p>  Guests say that it‚Äôs worth paying if not all-inclusive, then at least half board.  The food is excellent - there are both European and Greek.  A lot of delicious vegetables, ice cream in unlimited quantities, juicy ripe fruits, hot drinks and undiluted alcohol.  In addition, no one controls the number of visits to the restaurant, as is the case in other hotels.  And from the institution you can easily grab a dessert, tea or coffee with you - they won‚Äôt say a word. </p><p>  Well, the hotel makes a really nice impression.  And if the description meets the desires, then it is definitely worth going here.  No need to regret. </p>
