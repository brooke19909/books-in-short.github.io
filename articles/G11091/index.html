    <h2>  History </h2><p>  The Vologda province was located in the north of the European part of Russia.  The Finno-Ugric tribes lived on its territory.  In the 12th century, Novgorodians invaded here and founded well-known cities such as Vologda and Ustyug.  Christianity appears. </p><p>  Until the time that St. Petersburg was built, the Vologda province was of great importance in foreign trade, due to its connection with Arkhangelsk, and was economically developed. </p><p>  Ivan the Terrible for military security ordered the construction of a stone fortress in Vologda.  In 1780, governorship was established.  And in 1796, the Vologda province became an independent administrative unit.  It existed along with other areas.  The history of the Vologda province ends in 1929, when all its counties were abolished.  But buildings and cities have not disappeared.  From this moment to this day, the territory is called the Vologda Oblast. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
