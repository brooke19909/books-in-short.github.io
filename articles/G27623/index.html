The reason is simple - subscribers are interested in the ability to use social networks, receive news, entertainment content on their smartphones and tablets.  The launch of the ‚Äúfourth generation‚Äù (4G) format network only increased the number of users interested in such services, because they had the opportunity to connect high-speed Internet at minimal prices.  Not least of all, this is promoted by the Russian operator MTS.  Tariffs (Internet, unlimited 4G) at this company are available to everyone.  We will talk about them in this article. </p><h2>  General information </h2>

    <p>  Before we describe the plans presented by the operator, a few comments should be made regarding the general pricing policy of the company.  Firstly, MTS has 4G tariffs, in which unlimited Internet is the main feature, are not so numerous.  You can find them only a couple of pieces, and even those are defined as ‚Äúnightly‚Äù.  This means that the actual unlimited user is available only at night - from 1:00 to 7:00, after which the spending of a limited package begins.  This is explained by the fact that tariffs without restrictions can potentially create increased network loads.  This, in turn, is fraught with a deterioration in the quality of services provided to other subscribers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Secondly, a review of MTS unlimited Internet tariffs shows that all of them (as well as limited packages) are divided into two categories depending on the purpose for which they are used.  There are tariff plans designed to work with a tablet and with a smartphone.  The difference in them is obvious - the former suggest the presence of a larger amount of traffic (if you do not take into account those MTS tariffs in which 4G unlimited Internet is available by default at night). </p>

    <h2>  For smartphone </h2><p>  So, the line for mobile phones includes 4 tariff plans.  By their names you can understand their final destination - these are Smart, Smart Mini, Smart + and Smart Non-Stop.  The logic is that it all starts with the Mini tariff, which offers the minimum number of megabytes and minutes allocated for calls, but which is cheaper than the rest.  Accordingly, Smart Non-Stop - the MTS tariff, 3G (unlimited, the month of which costs 650 rubles) - this is the most voluminous plan.  Read more about tariffs (what they include and how much they cost) - more. </p>

    <h2>  Details of ‚Äúmobile‚Äù plans </h2><p>  So, Smart Mini is clearly not categorized as ‚ÄúMTS 4G-tariffs‚Äù, in which unlimited internet is available by default.  This is obvious, because the cost of the package is minimal from the entire line.  It is only 200 rubles per month.  For them, the subscriber will receive 500 megabytes of traffic, the ability to communicate without restrictions with numbers within the network of his region;  1000 minutes for network calls throughout the country, 50 SMS messages. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Another plan - Smart - will cost the user all 450 rubles.  This plan provides for 3 GB of traffic, unlimited communication on the network, 500 minutes for calls to any operator, 500 SMS. </p><p>  In Smart +, the service package is slightly larger, but its price is higher.  So, for 900 rubles a subscriber receives 5 GB of Internet, 1100 minutes for calls to any network in the region, 1100 SMS messages. </p><p>  This ends the limited MTS tariffs for a smartphone.  Internet (unlimited 4G) is next available at night.  In the daytime, the subscriber is allocated 10 GB of Internet.  In addition, there are 500 minutes for calls to other people's networks in the region, 500 SMS, unlimited inside the network at the ‚Äúhome‚Äù tariff.  Its cost is lower - only 650 rubles per month. </p>

    <h2>  For tablet </h2><p>  Those that are best used on a tablet computer are tariffs called ‚ÄúInternet.‚Äù  Here, again, the lineup consists of 4 plans - ‚ÄúInternet for the day‚Äù, Mini, Maxi and VIP.

The difference is only in the amount of traffic that will be available to the user, and also in that they do not provide for the availability of minutes for calls. </p><h2>  Details of ‚Äútablet‚Äù plans </h2>

    <p>  An interesting tariff for tablet computers is Internet for a day.  With it, for only 50 rubles per day, a subscriber is allocated 500 megabytes, which should be enough to carry out some basic tasks.  The option is suitable, obviously, for those who do not use the network on a regular basis. </p><p>  Another package - ‚ÄúInternet-Mini‚Äù includes 3 GB of traffic for 350 rubles.  The next one - ‚ÄúInternet Maxi‚Äù is more expensive (700 rubles per month), but also includes 12 GB of traffic at night, and 12 - during the day.  Due to this, it turns out that the subscriber is given 24 GB per month, provided that it is used evenly, including at night. </p><p>  Finally, the category ‚ÄúMTS-tariffs‚Äù replenishes, the Internet (unlimited 4G) in which allows you to perform more tasks, the plan ‚ÄúInternet-VIP‚Äù.  It costs 1200 rubles a month.  The subscriber is provided with 30 GB of traffic in the daytime and unlimited - at night.  This feature is just what was mentioned above.  Such a move ensures normal user activity during the day and stimulates increased activity at night.  Due to this, the operator company can provide a higher level of service, saving the network from congestion due to those who download bulky files on the mobile network during the day. </p><h2>  Other options </h2><p>  In addition to those described above, MTS has several more options.  For example, these are ‚ÄúBit‚Äù and ‚ÄúSuperBit‚Äù (plans for 250 and 350 rubles per month, offering 75 mb per day and 3 Gb / month, respectively).  There is still a tablet-oriented service called ‚ÄúMTS Tablet‚Äù and ‚ÄúMTS Tablet Mini‚Äù, the cost of which is determined by the amount of consumed traffic (in the first case) and in the second - 400 rubles per month.  Traffic here offer up to 13 GB per day and 4 GB per month, respectively. </p><p>  There is still the opportunity to increase the traffic packet ("Turbo Button"), connect an antivirus and much more. </p><h2>  How to choose? </h2>

    <p>  That's all corporate and unlimited tariffs of MTS (applies only to some).  You should choose them based on an understanding of how much traffic you will need for a month.  This can be established if you analyze your costs.  For example, what interests you first of all - communication, watching videos, online games?  Do you often use network access or is this a one-time phenomenon?  Etc.  Such questions will help you understand how much Internet you need and on which device - smartphone or tablet. </p><h2>  How to connect? </h2><p>  Regarding how to activate the services, the following should be noted.  Firstly, of course, to connect a particular tariff offering Internet access, you need to have that amount of funds on your account that is equivalent to the cost of the plan.  Secondly, to activate the service, you must submit an application.  There are several ways to do this.  For example, you can use the services of an online account, having logged in which, the subscriber will be able to control all the options by his number.  The second option is to work with short combinations (USSD requests).  They look like this: *  *  #;  Their task is to directly send a command to the operator.  You can find out what combinations apply to the tariffs you are interested in, directly on the plan‚Äôs page on the Internet.  In addition, you have the right to contact the call center of the MTS operator or directly to the office, where company representatives will help you personally. </p><p>  Again, it is worth mentioning: before connecting to a particular option, you should thoroughly study its features - what requirements are set for the subscriber, what is included in the operator‚Äôs services, what will you, as a user, get after connecting.  This will allow you to protect yourself from unnecessary expenses and at the same time choose the best option for yourself. </p>
