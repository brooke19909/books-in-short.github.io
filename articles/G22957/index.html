People borrow money in order to buy new household appliances, go on a vacation, buy real estate or a car, open their own business.  At the same time, you need to choose a bank very well so as not to overpay too much on interest.  A huge number of Russians get a loan at Tinkoff Bank.  Reviews in this case are very different from each other.  Someone in this banking system really likes lending.  Others call the terms predatory.  Let's try to understand this issue together. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tinkoff bank loan reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2110860.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Lending terms </h2><p>  The consumer has a choice, therefore, if you are not in a hurry to get cash, then it is better to collect complete information and based on this make the final choice.  Who can get a loan at Tinkoff Bank?  Reviews suggest that this system has minimal requirements for the consumer.  Almost everyone can get cash on hand.  To do this, you must be an adult citizen of the Russian Federation not older than 70 years. </p><h2>  The main differences </h2><p>  In each city of Russia, you can see dozens of branches of bank offices.  But among them there is not a single Tinkoff bank.  How does it exist and carries out work with clients?  This is a unique financial structure that does not have offices, branches and ATMs.  This significantly reduces the costs that somehow fall on the shoulders of the credited. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How can I get a loan at Tinkoff Bank?  Reviews say this is a fairly simple operation.  In fact, it is a virtual bank that accepts applications from customers remotely.  The application is submitted through a special service service.  You can send it anywhere in Russia by entering your passport details.  The decision is communicated by telephone.  A ready-made card will be delivered to you by a bank employee along with all documents.  That is, anyone can quickly and easily get a loan at Tinkoff Bank.  Reviews, however, warn that employees will definitely check your solvency.  If you have low income and already have loans, then you should not rely too much on a loan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tinkoff bank loan customer reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2110857.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Check </h2><p>  After submitting an application, passport data is received in the bank, as well as information about where the borrower works.  All this will be checked through special services.  As a result, employees will decide not only to approve or refuse, but will also determine the maximum amount that you can use.  Usually it will be small on first use.  If the credit history is good, then next time it will be possible to count on a more serious amount.  The main criterion will be the level of wages, as well as the presence of dependents and debt on loans.  The bank will carry out all checks on its own, without requesting additional information from you. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Plastic cards only </h2><p>  The credit vector is aimed exclusively at the design of cards.  Moreover, the website colorfully describes how convenient such a solution is.  Customer reviews of Tinkoff Bank loans indicate that if you take loans carefully, it‚Äôs really quite convenient.  Conditions are more favorable than when applying for a cash loan.  You can withdraw money when it is really needed, and only in the right amount.  Ordering a card, approval and receipt does not oblige you to anything.  If the borrower has found another solution to his financial difficulties, then he may not activate the card, or not withdraw cash from it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tinkoff bank consumer credit reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2110856.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Interest, customer reviews on loans </h2><p>  Tinkoff Bank has a flexible system for calculating the interest rate for each individual person.  Employees do not report what criteria they are guided by.  Let's look at the main suggestions: </p><ul><li>  OneTwoTrip.  The amount of interest from 23.9 to 39.9%.  The grace period is valid for up to 55 days.  At this time, you can pay off the debt without interest.  Similar interest rates are ALL Airlines, Kanobu, AFIMALL City, eBay </li><li>  Tinkoff Platinum.  The interest on the loan is higher, from 24.9 to 45.9%. </li></ul><p>  For each borrower, the interest rate is set personally, depending on the conditions of the tariff plan.  Reviews emphasize that the conditions are comfortable, but the stakes are quite high.  Therefore, before you take the money, you need to think carefully. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Consumer loan at Tinkoff Bank </h2><p>  Reviews indicate that most often the choice is a plastic card.  But there are other loan options that you need to familiarize yourself with.  The client can contact the head office of the company and apply for a loan with a passport. </p><ul><li>  The fastest option is a ‚Äúloan in 5 minutes‚Äù.  To obtain it, no certificates or guarantors are required.  Registration is also online, insurance is required.  The interest rate is from 19.9 to 54.9%. The amount is from 50,000 to 500,000 rubles. </li><li>  If you want to get money at a lower percentage, then for this there is a loan secured by real estate.  In this case, the annual rate is from 15 to 27.5%, the amount is up to 15 million, and the term is up to 15 years.  The minimum rate is possible if property and life insurance is issued. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tinkoff bank loan interest reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2110836.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  What will have to face? </h2><p>  Most often, the user is dealing with plastic cards.  This is a convenient way to always have the right amount at hand and use it on occasion.  But in this case, you will have to pay not only the interest on the loan.  Tinkoff Bank reviews are sometimes accused of the fact that the payment system is opaque, but most often they themselves do not even read the contract they sign. </p><p>  Credit card service charges an annual fee.  The most profitable is the Tinkoff Platinum card, you will have to pay 590 rubles for it. </p><ul><li>  ALL Airlines - 1890 rub. </li><li>  Kanobu - 990 rub. </li></ul><p>  That's not all.  In addition, in the contract you will have to indicate that you refuse insurance.  If this is not done, then it is automatically considered that you agree.  Further, cash withdrawals at an ATM will cost 2.9% of the amount.  Plus 290 rubles.  In addition, Tinkoff does not have branches and ATMs, which entails the payment of commissions to an intermediary bank. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tinkoff bank mortgage loan reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2110827.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Real estate loan </h2><p>  This organization deals with consumer loans.  That is, Tinkoff Bank itself does not issue a mortgage loan.  Reviews call him a convenient intermediary who represents them in other companies.  That is, you drop the application, and Tinkoff promotes it in 3-5 banking systems.  Accordingly, where approval will be obtained, you will be able to get a loan for real estate.  This is very convenient for customers, as evidenced by reviews.  Once you have uploaded documents to the bank and you choose which bank you want to cooperate with.  In this case, you do not need to hire a realtor, managers will check all the documents themselves. </p><h2>  Maximum and minimum amounts </h2><p>  The remote method of lending does not allow the bank to thoroughly verify the identity of the borrower.  This increases the risks of the company.  Therefore, a cash loan at Tinkoff Bank cannot be too large.  Reviews say that to solve most problems this limit is enough.  On the Tinkoff Platinum card, the credit limit is 300,000 rubles, and on the rest up to 700,000 rubles.  These are the maximum amounts for each line, but this does not mean that everyone who applies can get them.  For each borrower, the amount is calculated individually. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tinkoff loan repayment at another bank reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2110824.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What is the reason for negative reviews? </h2><p>  You can find a lot of them on the network, which is not too surprising.  Everyone likes to take money, but then to give back with interest is a pretty heavy burden.  Moreover, it does not really matter what kind of loan you had.  The Tinkoff Bank card, reviews of which are sometimes full of negativity, is just a tool.  If you use it uncontrollably, or not having read the contract, you can put yourself in disadvantageous conditions.  So, what is the cause of consumer dissatisfaction: </p><ul><li>  The client pays carefully, but the debt does not decrease.  This most often happens because a person does not understand the term ‚Äúminimum payment‚Äù.  This is only repayment of interest, while maintaining the main debt.  To reduce the amount, you need to pay off much more, preferably the entire amount at the time of discharge. </li><li>  The amount of the credit limit also sometimes causes discontent.  The amount of 300,000 rubles appears in advertising, but in reality the limit can be up to 10 thousand rubles. </li><li>  High cash withdrawal fees.  Judging by the reviews, it‚Äôs much more profitable to use shopping cards.  Then there is an interest-free period, and there is no commission for withdrawals from ATMs. </li><li>  If a client has forgotten about a small debt, and does not make a payment, this does not mean that the bank has forgotten about him.  The bank also imposes a fine and the amount grows.  If the holder does not take any action, then collectors will take up the matter.  It also happens that a person activated a card and did not use it.  A year passed, and money was deducted from her for the service. </li><li>  High interest.  It's hard to argue with that.  In most cases, they exceed 35%.  If we take into account the annual payment, sms-informing, insurance, then this can be 100% per annum.  But there are 55 days of preferential use of money, for which the bank does not need to pay. </li><li>  Loan insurance.  Some customers consider this a bank-imposed service.  However, you can refuse it upon signing the contract. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="if you do not pay tinkoff bank loan reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2110861.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Bank help </h2><p>  In a difficult life situation, everyone can be.  If you lost your job, ended up in a hospital, then you should not hide from the bank managers.  On the contrary, the faster you get in touch with employees and explain the situation, the easier it will be to find a way out.  Most often, you will be offered a loan restructuring at Tinkoff Bank.  Reviews say that this system has its pitfalls, but is a good solution to the problem. </p><p>  The main thing is to try to prevent delays.  Contact a financial institution and try to convince the lender that you have good reasons and you do not shy away from paying.  Fill in the official paper, in which you need to indicate the number of the debt agreement, the size of the debt limit, the amount paid and the rest of the debt, the time of the last payment, the reasons why the payments stopped. </p><h2>  Special programs </h2><p>  If the bank makes a positive decision, then you will be offered new credit decisions with a more convenient repayment schedule.  There are two restructuring programs: </p><ul><li>  Tunnel - for a certain period of time, the minimum monthly payment is reduced to 200-500 rubles per month.  The credit card is blocked for this time.  When your financial condition stabilizes, you continue to pay as before. </li><li>  Installment - credit card payments are completely stopped.  The debt is fixed and a new loan is issued for this amount, the repayment schedule is determined. </li></ul><p>  This service has its drawbacks, because when it is issued, the bank will calculate the commission, distributing it for future payments.  But the situation in this case will be better than if you do not pay Tinkoff Bank a loan.  Reviews say that in this case, round-the-clock calls from collectors are provided, with all the ensuing consequences. </p><h2>  If you block the debt through a loan in another bank </h2><p>  The lack of a loan in this organization lies on the surface - this is a high percentage.  This circumstance should be taken into account immediately and calculate your strength.  If the loan has already been taken and you understand that the overpayment is very large, you can try to arrange loan repayment at another bank.  Reviews "Tinkoff" is not in vain called a lifesaver in case of emergency.  If there is a possibility (a stable, white income has appeared), then it is better to try to take a loan in another organization at a lower percentage and block the debt. </p><h2>  What will happen if you don‚Äôt pay? </h2><p>  This bank is famous for its loyalty in issuing loans.  But because of this, the risks of defaulting a loan increase many times.  Even on the forums you can find various narrations on the topic ‚ÄúI do not pay a loan to Tinkoff Bank‚Äù.  Reviews at the same time assure that it will not work for a long time to hide.  The bad debt recovery scheme has been worked out for a long time.  They will call constantly, around the clock, harassing the borrower, threatening to transfer the case to collectors or sue him.  All this time, the interest for using the loan continues to drop, and a penalty is being wound on them. </p><p>  This usually does not end there.  Employees will come to your home, call relatives and friends, to work, and almost to the gym that you visit.  The credit history will be damaged, but the money will still have to be returned.  In this case, the nerves thoroughly exhaust.  Whether the game is worth the candle is up to you.  But it‚Äôs best not to allow such a situation. </p><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  Tinkoff Bank can be scolded or praised, but the point here is no longer the lender, but the inability to manage the money.  There are so many temptations in the world today that you can spend any amount, but before that you need to evaluate the ratio of your income to expenses.  Even if you have a stable job, you need to think carefully.  It may be easier to accumulate the right amount and not risk in vain.  So you will surely be saved from interest and overpayment, as well as from problems in case of loss of work. </p><p>  In general, most customers respond positively to the work of Tinkoff Bank.  If you need money urgently and for a short time, then it will be an excellent help.  Another thing is if you have a small income and the payment will have to stretch for a long time.  Overpayment in this case will be very tangible.  It is very convenient to use a Tinkoff Bank credit card to pay for purchases so as not to overpay for cash withdrawals from ATMs. </p>
