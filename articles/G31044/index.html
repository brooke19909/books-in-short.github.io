In this regard, there was a problem of the deficit of free non-residential premises.  At that time, the market for commercial facilities was in its infancy.  Subsequently, its development took place in two directions.  In particular, the purchase of private residential premises, which were located on the ground floors of the structures, was carried out.  Along with this, new buildings were erected.  The first option was considered quite simple, cheap and fast.  New buildings required large investments.  The time factor was also important.  Nevertheless, practice has shown that it was the new buildings that began to bring significant profit to the owners.  Today, there is an intensive development of the <span>commercial real estate</span> market, despite the fact that apartment buildings are being built more often.  A rather large <span>segment of the market</span> today is occupied by non-residential premises for free use.  Next, find out what these objects are. </p><h2>  What does ‚Äúfree space‚Äù mean? </h2><p>  This term is used in professional speech by realtors.  What does ‚Äúfree space‚Äù mean?  This characteristic indicates the versatility of the object.  The purpose of the building, as a rule, becomes known already at <span>the design stage.</span>  However, for the owner, the option of building a universal structure will be more advantageous and expedient in the economic sense.  In the future, it can be redesigned in accordance with the requirements of tenants.  So, a free appointment premises can become an office or a shopping center.  Often such areas are occupied by enterprises in the household or social industries. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="free appointment in Moscow" class="if" height="281" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/701218.jpg" width="500"></div>
