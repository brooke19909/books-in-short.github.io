    <h2>  Reviews of Russian travelers on the Palm Beach hotel (Greece, Crete) </h2><p>  If you are part of a group of people who, when planning a trip to a country, choose a hotel not only on the basis of its official description, but also taking into account the impressions of other tourists who have already stayed here, then this part of the article will help you get acquainted with some comments from our compatriots about their vacation at Palm Beach.  It should be noted that the reviews left by travelers in 2014 differ strikingly from those dating from an earlier period.  This is due to the fact that the hotel has recently undergone major repairs, and now guests are waiting here for comfortable, modern, comfortable rooms.  In general, most of the guests with their choice of hotel were more than satisfied.  According to them, Palm Beach is well worth the money spent on living.  In addition, many guests are sure that the hotel not only corresponds to the three-star category, but is also quite "drawn" to four stars.  But we will understand everything in detail. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Impressions of territory and location </h2><p>  According to many tourists, Palm Beach (Crete) has a very good location.  So, the hotel is only a hundred meters away from the beach.  At the same time, the old town of Rethymno can be reached in just a quarter of an hour by leisurely step, and the Venetian port in 30 minutes.  You can also always take a pleasant walk around the hotel, admiring the sea and looking at the many shops and shops, taverns and bars. </p><p>  As for the territory of Palm Beach, it is very small.  So, there is not even a pool, so for lovers to relax near it, this may seem like a minus.  In general, we can say that Palm Beach <span>4 * (Crete,</span> Greece) is a typical city hotel, located near the center of a large resort city. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews of tourists about the hotel and housing stock </h2><p>  According to our compatriots, this hotel is far from new, but well-renovated and comfortable.  It is small, so the atmosphere here is almost home.  This is especially conducive to an excellent family vacation.  The rooms at the hotel are spacious.  Many guests also note their stylish design (for example, in a marine style - with appropriate furniture and interior items).  Some guests noted very comfortable beds and pillows.  Bathrooms are equipped with modern fixtures.  Air conditioning is available at an additional cost.  However, few resorted to this service, since, according to the guests, even in summer the rooms are rarely too hot.  The TV accepts Russian channels.  Also in the rooms perfectly catches Wi-Fi. </p><p>  According to travelers, the cleaning of rooms at Palm Beach Hotel 3 * (Crete) is done every day.  Linen and towels are also changed regularly.  Also, as necessary, maids replenish supplies of toiletries (soap, shower gels and shampoos). </p>

    <h2>  Food Opinion </h2><p>  It should be noted that almost all Palm Beach guests greatly praise the cuisine at the hotel.  According to them, the cooking here is very tasty.  There are always excellent meat and seafood dishes on the menu.  Therefore, you can safely stay for lunch and dinner in the hotel restaurant.  Also, as a rule, after a meal, the waiters bring a compliment from the hotel in the form of a dessert.  In addition, you can eat in numerous taverns in the area. </p><p>  In addition, a number of Palm Beach (Crete) rooms are equipped with a kitchenette with all necessary utensils (dishes, an electric kettle, etc.).  So you can buy groceries at a nearby supermarket and make your own lunch or dinner. </p><p>  As for breakfast, which is included in the price of the hotel, it is continental.  According to tourists, it is impossible to call it particularly diverse, but it is simply impossible to stay hungry.  So, you will always be offered variously prepared eggs, sausages, cheeses, pastries, granola, etc. In addition, you can enjoy freshly squeezed juice and delicious Greek coffee at breakfast. </p><h2>  Staff Reviews </h2><p>  As for the hotel staff, there are few employees.  All of them, according to travelers, are smiling, welcoming and always happy to help.  However, our compatriots recommend paying attention that no one here speaks Russian.  Therefore, it is advisable to recall a little the school curriculum of the English language and stock up on a Greek phrasebook. </p>

    <h2>  Guest comments on beach vacations and activities </h2><p>  According to tourists, the nearest beach is literally one minute walk from Club Palm Beach Hotel (Crete).  It is sandy, very clean, with a gentle entry into the sea.  The beach here is municipal, so you can use sun loungers and umbrellas for an additional fee.  However, you can always stay completely free on a mat or towel brought with you.  You can also buy a beach umbrella at one of the local supermarkets. </p><p>  As for entertainment, since ‚ÄúPalm Beach‚Äù is an urban-style hotel, it does not offer any special entertainment to its guests.  So, guests spend time on the beach, walking around the surroundings, as well as visiting attractions both in the surroundings and in other parts of Crete.  By the way, almost all travelers recommend not to forget their rights and to rent a car for at least a couple of days when traveling here.  This will help you significantly save money on sightseeing trips.  In addition, you can plan and change your route yourself in accordance with your desires.  You can rent a car both in the hotel itself and in one of the many car rental points located in the vicinity of Palm Beach (Crete). </p><p>  Among the attractions that must be visited by those who stayed in Rethymnon, our compatriots identified the following: </p><ul><li>  Lagoon Prevelis.  In order to get to it, you should keep the path to the monastery of the same name.  Here you will find a magnificent sandy beach with palm trees.  This place is famous for the tropical paradise of the Mediterranean. </li><li>  Nida Plateau.  Located 79 kilometers from Rethymnon.  Great nature awaits you here.  In addition, thanks to the developed infrastructure, you can go skiing in the winter on the plateau. </li><li>  Argyroupolis.  This is a very picturesque mountain village located in a wooded area.  It was built on the ruins of the ancient city of Lapp.  This place is famous for its mineral springs, small waterfalls, centuries-old trees, picturesque caves. </li><li>  Canyons  There are several of them in the district: Kurtaliot Gorge, Kostifos Gorges, Patsos, Arkadios, Prasianos Canyon and many others. </li><li>  Caves.  In the mountains surrounding Rethymno, there are quite a lot of them.  The most impressive of them, according to tourists, are Simonelli, Geranios, Agios Antonios and others. </li><li>  Archaeological sites.  There are a lot of them in the vicinity of Rethymnon.  So, it will be interesting to visit the ancient Eleufernus, burial places in Armenus, <span>medieval monasteries,</span> as well as ancient villages. </li></ul>
