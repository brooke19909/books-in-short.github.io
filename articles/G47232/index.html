    <p>  Whatever one asks - a historian or an ordinary passerby - about the most powerful Turkish Sultan, they all will answer as one that it is none other than Sultan Suleiman.  It was the reign of the Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent that led the state to the greatest success, since he successfully increased the territory of his subordination.  During his rule, he developed bills, thanks to which he received the title of Kanuni, which means "legislator". </p><p>  <strong>Suleiman family</strong> </p><p>  The father of Suleiman was Sultan Selim the Terrible, famous for his cruelty and fratricide.  During his reign, there was a law on the killing of all brothers to those who received the throne.  This was a prerequisite in order to avoid <span>civil wars</span> in the country <span>.</span>  Sultan Selim at that time rebelled not only against his brothers, but also his father and uncles, uprooting everyone who could pose for his throne.  The mother of Suleiman was Aisha Sultan Hafsa, who was not one of Selim's concubines, but the daughter of the Crimean Khan.  He had no brothers, but there were four sisters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>The history of the reign of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent</strong> </p><p>  After the death of his father, he received the throne in 1520, being governor in Manisa.  At that time he was twenty-five years old, he was a young, tall and strong man.  Having a good education, he knew history, geography, astronomy, theology, literature, studied foreign languages, military tactics and <span>jewelry.</span>  After the death of Selim I, a reliable large army passed into the hands of his son.  Partly thanks to her, the rule of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent reached the highest peak of his development. </p>

    <p>  His first decree was the release of Egyptian captives, who were imprisoned by his father.  With this noble decision, he instantly received universal appreciation not only in Turkey, but also in Europe.  No one expected that he would so successfully begin to conquer foreign lands: the island of Rhodes, part of Hungary and Tripoli, some territory of Transcaucasia and Algeria, Mesopotamia and Arabia.  The governor spent most of his life on military campaigns, where he died. </p><p>  As you know, the rule of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent became known not only for his military achievements, but also for his love for the Slavic girl Anastasia (according to some sources her name is Alexander).  In his harem there were hundreds of concubines, four of them bore him sons, but only one became a legal wife, which at that time was unthinkable. </p><p>  Sons from the first two wives died in childhood.  The son of the third wife, Mahidevran Mustafa, walked in the footsteps of his father for a long time, but, turning the wrong path, was executed by order of his father. </p>

    <p>  The fourth wife Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska became the only woman in life Suleiman.  They say that it was thanks to her that the reign of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent reached such heights.  She bore him one daughter and five sons.  Abdullah died in infancy, Mehmet died of smallpox at the age of 22, the youngest Jihangir died of longing for his brother Mustafa after his execution.  Bayazid was executed for treason, and Selim, the fourth child of Suleiman and Alexandra Anastasia Lisowska, took the throne.  The daughter of Mihrimah became the pride of the dynasty.  Being an intelligent woman, she helped rule her father after the death of her mother and brother Selim throughout his reign. </p><p>  The years of the reign of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent entered history as the Magnificent Age.  It was during this period that the <span>Ottoman Empire</span> reached its greatest heights, and all this thanks to the wise and fair ruler. </p>
