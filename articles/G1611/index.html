Its history began in 1661 with the foundation of the prison, set to collect yasak - a tax from the indigenous peoples of the North.  Over the three and a half centuries of its existence, many interesting events took place in the city, and the natives of these places glorified not only their small homeland, but also our entire country.  You can learn more about them by visiting the Irkutsk Regional Museum of Local Lore (IOKM). </p>

    <h2>  Base </h2><p>  The Irkutsk Regional Museum of Local Lore was founded in 1782 at the initiative of Governor F. Klitschka.  Although Franz Nikolaevich was born in the Czech Republic, which at that time was under the rule of the Habsburgs, he was devoted to Russia with all his heart.  Having fallen in love with Irkutsk, Klitschka did a lot for his prosperity.  In particular, he gathered local merchants and respected citizens and called for donations to open one of the first local history museums in Siberia and a ‚Äúbook guardian‚Äù (library). </p><p>  To make local moneybags more generous, Klitschka himself contributed several hundred rubles in gold.  Soon the required amount was collected, and a committee of founders was created.  It included the corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences A. Karamyshev and E. Laksman.  The last many years traveled to the most protected corners of Russia and gathered a huge collection of minerals, as well as thematic herbaria.  The scientist handed over most of them to the Museum of the Mining Institute, and brought the rest to Irkutsk. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  History of the IOKM until 1879 </h2><p>  In 1851, a branch of the Russian Geographical Society was opened in Irkutsk, under whose management the museum was transferred.  This circumstance contributed to its development and transformation into one of the leading scientific institutions in Siberia.  In addition, scientists B. Dybovsky and V. Godlevsky, who were actively involved in the study of Lake Baikal and its inhabitants, as well as N. Vitkovsky, I. Chersky and A. Chelanovsky, were exiled from Poland for participating in the <span>Warsaw Uprising</span> . </p><p>  The 19th century for the Irkutsk Regional Museum of Local Lore was also marked by the organization of various expeditions.  Their goal was to study the eastern and central Asian regions of the Russian Empire.  Their participants brought from trips many ancient artifacts, minerals, national costumes and household items of the indigenous peoples of Siberia and the Urals. </p>

    <h2>  Fire </h2><p>  In 1879, the Irkutsk Regional Museum of Local Lore was badly damaged by the fire, which destroyed a significant part of the city.  He lost his first building, located on Tikhvin Square, and also lost 22,000 unique copies and 10,000 valuable books from the book depository, which was the largest in the Urals. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, the residents of Irkutsk could not imagine their city without a museum, so they quickly collected the amount necessary for the construction of a new stone building.  In addition, they quickly restored the library and donated valuable exhibits that were supposed to replace artifacts lost in the fire. </p><h2>  Rebirth </h2><p>  In 1883, the grand opening of the new museum building took place, and throughout the next decade, its team, as well as the progressive public of Irkutsk, sought to replenish the collection of the Museum of Local Lore.  For this purpose, numerous expeditions were organized.  This activity was so successful that very soon for those who came to <span>Irkutsk, the Irkutsk</span> Regional Museum of Local Lore became a must-see object.  Moreover, in the last years of the 20th century, his collections have been repeatedly shown at the most prestigious exhibitions, including in Paris and Novgorod. </p><h2>  Museum History in the 20th Century </h2><p>  After the establishment of Soviet power in Siberia, the Irkutsk Regional Museum of Local Lore (the history of the foundation is presented above) was nationalized, and it began a new stage of development.  In 1936, the Irkutsk Regional Art Museum was founded on its basis. </p><p>  In the 50-70s of the 20th century, the USSR took a policy on the development of the eastern regions of the country.  During this period, the IOKM became the place where the annals of the great Soviet construction projects were written, and documents, photographs and other exhibits relating to the builders of BAM, <span>Irkutsk Hydroelectric Power Station</span> , etc. were collected. Today they allow us to get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe heroic work of older Russians who did not spare the energy for mastering Siberia and the Far East, as well as to ensure the economic and military power of the USSR. </p>
