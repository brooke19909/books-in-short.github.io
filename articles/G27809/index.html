The beach has everything for a comfortable stay, including showers and a toilet. </p><p>  Sunbeds, umbrellas and trestle beds living in the Eftalia Resort Hotel 4 * get free.  True, judging by the reviews of some of our compatriots, there are not always enough of them in the high season, when the hotel is completely full, so you need to borrow in the early morning. </p><p>  The entrance to the water is gentle, in some places there is small pebble, so it is recommended that children wear special shoes.  It can be purchased both in a store on site and in a shopping center in the village of Konakly. </p><h2>  For children </h2><p>  Since the main contingent coming to rest in this hotel complex is family-friendly, all the conditions are created here for a comfortable rest for the kids.

    <p>  In the lobby of the main building, a stroller is available for rent for an extra charge.  The hotel area is fully protected, so parents can not worry about the safety of their children.  At the pool and water slides, specially trained personnel are always present. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Alanya is famous for a large number of natural and man-made monuments.  In the lobby of the main building, you can buy tours with a guide to <span>Damlatas caves,</span> Lovers and Phosphoric, Byzantine fortress Ich-Kale, Red Tower, the Archaeological Museum and the mausoleum of Aksebe Turbesi, Sapadera canyon, etc. I must say that the prices for excursions are not too expensive, although higher than in the offices near the hotel.  For example, they have a jeep safari in the <span>Green Canyon</span> will cost ninety dollars, while in the Eftalia Resort Hotel at thirty.  e. more.  Many of our compatriots, judging by the reviews, preferred to explore the historic area of ‚Äã‚ÄãAlanya themselves.  To do this, they rent a car in the hotel and decide for themselves the route and the time of the trip. </p><p>  There is another option: to get to the city center yourself and wander through its sunlit small cobbled streets.  There, in the port, you can buy a small excursion by boat on the sea for five dollars per person.  The meal lasts one and a half to two hours and leaves an indelible feeling. </p><h2>  Entertainment and sports </h2><p>  On the territory of the Eftalia Resort Hotel 4 * there are two outdoor pools and one winter heated.

Residents can spend time and an Internet cafe, a visit to which is a paid service. </p><p>  For those who do not think themselves on vacation without an active lifestyle, the Eftalia Resort Hotel offers to visit the training room, play beach volleyball.  Aqua aerobics classes are held in the pool in the mornings.  You can sign up right on the spot, before training. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Eftalia Resort Hotel 4 Turkey" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1987363.jpg" width="600"></div>

The cost of one visit is twenty dollars. </p><h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  The main contingent of vacationers in the Eftalia Resort Hotel 4 * (Turkey), in addition to Russians, is Poles, Dutch and Germans.  Judging by the reviews, few of our compatriots come there.  On the beach on the right side there is a pier from which you can dive with a mask and enjoy the beautiful fish.  Slides are open until five in the evening.  You can connect to wireless Internet from anywhere in the Eftalia Resort Hotel. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Many Russians, returning home from this hotel, were not too lazy and shared their impressions.  I must say that this helps a lot to those who are just going to go there.  The reviews of our compatriots are overwhelmingly good.  Mostly Russians rate their stay at this hotel quite high, while noting that they do not regret their choice at all. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Eftalia Resort Hotel" class="if" height="391" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1987369.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Based on the rather reasonable cost of living at the Eftalia Resort Hotel, in comparison with other hotel complexes, including three-star ones, many chose it.  And although the transfer was long, the bus, judging by the reviews, drove comfortably.  Many note that, even having arrived at night, they were able to immediately receive the keys.  The receptionists are attentive to all the wishes of the customers, especially if those were indicated at the time of booking. </p><p>  The hotel staff is attentive and friendly.  The service suited many. </p><p>  The hotel area, judging by the reviews, although small, but quite comfortable.  There are many places where you can take beautiful photos as a keepsake. </p><p>  As for the number of rooms, this is, as many write, the standard furnishings, however, in some rooms the furniture is not new.  Among the minuses of living, Russians note poor sound insulation and poor location of the air conditioner. </p><p>  The food, according to the vast majority, is simply excellent.  It is quite diverse, however, sometimes queues are formed that quickly advance. </p><p>  You can connect to the Internet without problems both in the territory and in the rooms. <br>  Everyone also liked the animation.  The guys work "on conscience" so that vacationers have fun.  Some of our compatriots really liked the daytime entertainment programs, since everyone can choose something for themselves and play.  Evening shows also left a lot of impressions.  Many enthusiastic memories of Turkish nights organized on Tuesdays. </p><p>  Of the shortcomings, many note a small number of sunbeds and umbrellas, since often many had to get up in the early morning in order to have time to occupy them. </p><p>  Those who forgot to bring something with themselves are advised by our fellow countrymen not to be upset, because in the nearest shops of the village you can buy almost everything, including souvenirs. </p><p>  To summarize, it must be said that this hotel is fully consistent with the declared stardom.  Excellent value for money service, delicious food, wonderful sea - what else is needed for relaxation.  Many write in their reviews that they would like to come here again, since they did not have ten days to completely relax. </p>
