    <h2>  Butovo East: Morton </h2><p>  A large-scale project and comprehensive extensive development, as well as other numerous projects of the Morton Group of Companies, was MortonGrad Bobrovo, a microdistrict renamed the more attractive East Butovo.  A photo of the construction site today can tell about the scope of the project.  The residential part of the comfort class complex will consist of buildings of different heights.  Houses of panel, monolithic-brick types with layouts for individual projects will be adjacent to exclusive modular buildings belonging to the Grad-1M series.  Each structure is planned to be equipped with parking lots, passenger and freight elevators.  The center of the district will be decorated with a zone of a picturesque park with objects for leisure and recreation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  East Butovo: Morton is a multi-type project with a very impressive selection of floor plans of various shapes: linear, two-sided.  There is a small and large footage.  It is possible to purchase a living room with a bay window or half-bay window, a kitchen balcony and a niche for a wardrobe. </p><p>  Since construction of more than 1 million m2 is carried out on an uninhabited territory, the first wave of new settlers will feel the lack of social and domestic institutions.  The problem will be resolved over time, in a few years.  7 km from East Butovo is one of the most comfortable towns near Moscow - Vidnoe, which can be reached by shuttle bus.  Future residents of the microdistrict will be able to use the infrastructure of the village of Bobrovo. </p><h2>  LCD Description </h2><p>  The new quarter, provided with its own engineering systems, will include 800 thousand m <sup>2 of</sup> living space.  The East Butovo complex will consist of 37 panel houses and monolithic brick buildings.  Such popular series of houses as KOPE-M-Parus, 111-M, P-44T are already being built here.  New buildings will rise at variable levels from 9 to 17 floors.  The project has one-, two-, three- and four-room apartments ranging in size from 37 to 103 m <sup>2</sup> .  In residential premises, which are fully ready for sale, impeccable fine finishing (in separate buildings) has been performed.  A feature of the houses of the above panel series is the presence of spacious loggias, bay windows and semicircular balconies. </p>

The work of this group includes the construction of East Tushino. </p><p>  In fact, the construction of houses is not a direct function of this group of companies.  Morton acts as a customer, general contractor, organizer, and construction is carried out by other enterprises.  For example, residential buildings of the first wave in the "East Butovo" microdistrict were erected by the developer of the PIK Group of Companies. </p><h2>  East Butovo: "PIC" </h2><p>  "PIK" - a group of enterprises offering future residents comfortable turnkey apartments in modern-day building buildings.

Also, you can‚Äôt get on the highway, leaving straight from East Butovo.  How, then, to get to the microdistrict by private car? </p><p>  To get to East Butovo by car, you need to move along the Warsaw highway, and after 3 km from Koltsevaya turn onto <span>Berezovaya Alley,</span> crossing the Simferopol highway under the bridge.

It is planned to open a clinic for 500 people, multifunctional complexes and cultural and business centers.  Two schools will be able to accept one thousand students, and two kindergartens - 340 kids each.

The registration of an agreement on shared participation in the sale of housing is carried out only by Morton Group of Companies.

The Atlant-invest company that invested in this project organizes the sale of apartments along with other participants. </p><p>  It is possible to purchase housing in the area as part of various mortgage programs, including military.  A maternity capital certificate and subsidized payments may be used.  The option of exchanging a "secondary" for a new building is also possible.

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Statements by consumers for the most part indicate that Morton and PIK are considered very reliable developers specializing in the construction of large residential neighborhoods such as the Economy.  Usually they rent houses at time.  Such objects include the "Eastern Butovo".  Reviews about the new complex are generally positive.  Not everyone liked the advertising move with the transformation of Bobrovo into Butovo, many sympathize with the indigenous geographical name. </p><p>  Unfortunately, potential customers do not take seriously the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbuilding a transport system that allows connecting the capital and East Butovo.  The reviews reflect the skepticism of most consumers about this. </p><p>  The opportunity to purchase housing in this microdistrict is provided by several project participants.  Consumers are controversial about such competition.  The company "Morton" prices per square meter higher than those requested by the branch "East Butovo.  PEAK".  Customer reviews, of course, contain a lot of opinions that Morton‚Äôs low risks are preferable, and the DDU form is more reliable than participation in the HBC with other organizations. </p>
