However, unfortunately, not every developer can boast an excellent reputation.  Often, equity holders are dissatisfied with the delay in building construction, the quality of work performed and materials used, communication with company managers and non-fulfillment of other promises made by the developer.  Therefore, finding a suitable developer is extremely difficult. </p><p>  But what if you want to get a job in a similar company?  You should familiarize yourself with a lot of information in advance.  For example, for many it matters what reputation the company in which he plans to get a job has earned among customers, as well as counterparties in the market.  Among other things, it would be nice to know from a reliable source whether the organization is properly fulfilling its obligations to workers.  For example, does it pay wages on time and in full?  And does its level correspond to the duties that you have to fulfill?  Is it easy to let employees go on legal annual leave?  Will you be officially employed?  What skills and personal qualities will you need in order to successfully continue to work in the organization in question?  How does the leadership punish its wards for mistakes, inaccuracies in work, violation of labor discipline?  All this is of great importance. </p><p>  In this article, the Absolute Real Estate Agency (Belgorod) will be examined in detail.  Employee reviews are of particular interest.  However, it is important to study other issues.  What do customer reviews say about Absolute Real Estate?  What are the features of work in the organization in question?  You can get answers by carefully reading this article. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="absolute real estate reviews" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42841/1879225.jpg" width="300"></div></h2><h2>  About company </h2><p>  "Absolute Real Estate" (Belgorod) is referred to by specialists only as a structural unit of a large investment group that successfully implements amazing real estate projects of various nature (both residential and commercial). </p><p>  So, what are the main activities of this group of companies? </p><ul><li>  Development: <ul><li>  ‚ÄúAbsolute Real Estate‚Äù - the division is engaged in direct sales of residential real estate, commercial properties, cottage villages and land plots. </li><li>  "National Development Company" (NDK) - development of residential, commercial and suburban real estate. </li></ul></li><li>  Management and operation: <ul><li>  Management of the operation of Comfort City <span>residential complexes</span> . </li><li>  Management of commercial and commercial real estate. </li></ul></li><li>  Telecommunications: <ul><li>  Telecom Center. </li></ul></li><li>  Insurance: <ul><li>  "Absolute Insurance". </li></ul></li><li>  Finance: <ul><li>  Asset Management (Everest Asset Management). </li></ul></li><li>  Social responsibility of business: <ul><li>  Charity Fund "Absolute Help". </li></ul></li><li>  Production and trade: <ul><li>  Megapack. </li><li>  "Absolute" is a trading house. </li><li>  "Northeast company." </li></ul></li></ul><p>  However, development is still a priority for the company. </p><p>  The most famous projects of the developer in question are the following: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Commercial real estate. <ul><li>  BC "Omega-2". </li><li>  <span>Shopping center "Orange</span> Park". </li><li>  BC "Simonov Plaza". </li><li>  Furniture center "Rumer". </li><li>  Design and Interior Center "Ecopostroy on Nakhimovsky". </li><li>  BC "Omega Plaza". </li><li>  Logistic quarter "Gorki". </li><li>  BC "Slobodskoy". </li></ul></li><li>  Large-scale quarterly development. <ul><li>  LCD "Moscow City". </li><li>  Novograd "Pavlino". </li><li>  LCD "Lyubertsy 2016". </li><li>  The city-park "First Moscow". </li><li>  Residential complex Skolkovo.

    <h2>  Positive customer feedback </h2><p>  As practice shows, there are always fewer positive reviews.  This is due to the opinion of experts that people simply need to express negative emotions, share their indignation and warn others.  But less is written about successful deals, because they think about something completely different.  So it happened in the case of Absolute Real Estate.  There are positive reviews, but not many.  Clients write that they received the keys to their apartments on time, that the layout is as specified, and that the quality of construction and repair is quite suitable for them.  Perhaps it all depends on the specific circumstances, and you cannot vouch for each individual project, but the very existence of good reviews indicates that the organization is functioning and doing its job. </p><h2>  Negative customer feedback </h2><p>  What else do you leave about Absolute Real Estate?  Among the negative aspects, customers distinguish the following: </p><ul><li>  Managers accompany the transaction exactly until the first payment is made.  After that, the client is forced to regularly call the company on his own, find out how things are going, whether the deadlines are respected, and so on.  Of course, all this is fully the responsibility of the manager. </li><li>  Short reservation periods - only two weeks.  If you do not manage to get a mortgage during this time, then your reservation fee will burn, as practice shows (despite the guarantee of returning 75% of the amount). </li><li>  Some complain about the mismatch of the footage of the apartment, as well as the insufficiently high quality of the building.  So, individual buyers are seriously worried about their safety in such a house. </li><li>  Delayed construction time. </li><li>  Incompetence of individual managers. </li></ul><p>  So describe the work of the company "Absolute Real Estate" reviews of some customers.  Trust them or not, you need to decide for yourself. </p>

    <h2>  Jobs </h2><p>  So, what are the proposals regarding employment put forward by Absolute Real Estate?  Reviews say that all relevant vacancies can be found on the official website of the company.  For example, property managers are usually required.  They must work directly in areas where construction is underway.  We are talking about local offices, for example, Absolute Real Estate - Peredelkino.  Reviews strongly recommend that you carefully read in advance what requirements the company has for its candidates.  So, among them are the following: </p><ul><li>  Mandatory higher education. </li><li>  Experience in conducting successful presentations of any services or products. </li><li>  Excellent knowledge of modern sales technologies, the skill of their practical use. </li><li>  Experience attending specialized trainings. </li><li>  The following personal qualities are welcomed: sociability, presence of an active life position, presentable appearance and manner of behavior, openness, well-established oral speech, focus on results, written literacy, knowledge of the basic rules of business etiquette. </li><li>  Experience in concluding and subsequent transaction support. </li><li>  Experience advising clients on their specialization. </li><li>  The skill of conducting direct active sales of any services or products (at least three years). </li></ul><p>  What are the main responsibilities of the candidate for the position in question? </p><ul><li>  Formation of a database of buyers, as well as reporting, reflecting the results of the work. </li><li>  Providing advice to their clients on any emerging issues, regularly conducting presentations of new projects. </li><li>  Negotiating with potential buyers. </li><li>  Further transaction support after the fact of real estate acquisition. </li></ul><p>  What are the working conditions? </p><ul><li>  Official employment in accordance with the Labor Code of the Russian Federation. </li><li>  The work schedule is interchangeable ("two in two"). </li><li>  Opening hours - from 9:30 to 21:00. </li><li>  Corporate mobile communication is paid by the company. </li></ul><p>  CVs should be sent to candidates by e-mail.  This conveniently and significantly saves both the time of the applicant and the time of the employer. </p><h2>  Contacts </h2><p>  If you have any questions, then qualified employees will help you find the answer.  To do this, you just need to contact them either using the contact phone number indicated on the official website of the organization, or by writing to the email address that can be found in the same source.  However, it is important to take into account the fact that all issues related to the acquisition of real estate must be resolved directly in stationary sales offices (for example, the Absolute Real Estate - Lyubertsy office).  Reviews recommend going there.  After all, the managers working there have all the information that potential buyers need. </p>
