    <h2>  The best resort of Vietnam </h2><p>  Nha Trang is the most popular of the sea cities of the country.  It is also called the beach <span>capital of Vietnam.</span>  The best hotel complexes are concentrated here, as well as quite comfortable budget hotels such as Dong Phuong 2 Hotel.  Nha Trang is a noisy and fun resort of an almost European type (after all, Vietnam is a former French colony) with a superbly developed infrastructure.  Those who prefer to spend their holidays in this city will surely like amazing landscapes: water of a gentle azure shade, snow-white sandy beaches, hilly emerald islands, like a necklace lined up along the bay. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Others are attracted by the vibrant nightlife full of entertainment, as well as restaurants with original cuisine.  For lovers of sybaritic pleasures, there are upscale spa centers with many treatments.  By the way, fans of excursions will also not be bored.  Almost in the very center of the city are the ancient <span>Cham towers,</span> as well as the ruins of other historical buildings.  Many of the city‚Äôs hotels, including even three-star ones, for example, Dong Phuong 2 Hotel 3 *, offer tourists interesting tourist routes for a fee. </p><h2>  Climatic conditions </h2><p>  In Nha Trang, the weather is comfortable all year round.  Throughout the year, it is almost always warm and sunny, even in the rainy season, when powerful torrential rainfalls hit the city for only a couple of hours.  Since during this period the sea begins to rage constantly, then most of the vacationers are windsurfers.  Others are attracted by low prices, as well as the opportunity to watch the competitions of brave athletes - conquerors of waves, which are full of all the <span>beaches of Nha Trang.</span>  Sometimes there is a typhoon on the coast.  However, this is a rather rare occurrence. </p><h2>  How to get there? </h2><p>  If you want a budget holiday in Vietnam, then buy tours at the Dong Phuong 2 Hotel.  In most cases, the package includes the cost of air travel.  You will have to fly from Moscow or from one of the Russian cities, from where flights are made to major Vietnamese cities, for example, Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi, Hoi An, etc. Then you need to go to the resort by train or bus. </p><p>  It is divided into twenty-eight communal areas, each of which, in turn, forms three sections: northern, southern and central.  A favorite place for those who like to hang out is the last option.  The southern part is more suitable for fans of a quiet holiday.  Quality budget hotels such as Dong Phuong 2 Hotel are also located here.  In the northern section are the sights of the city.  There are almost no hotels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nha trang beaches" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1360667.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Dong Phuong 2 Hotel: guest reviews and ratings </h2><p>  So you got acquainted with the location and internal structure of this three-star hotel.  It is located in the best of the Vietnamese resorts - Nha Trang, on the first beach line.  By the way, this is what, according to reviews of hotel guests, is its main advantage.  The location is just perfect.  And those tourists who are not indifferent to sea landscapes can almost admire either the daytime or the night sea almost around the clock. </p><p>  As for the reviews regarding the service, unfortunately, they are not always positive.  Guests complain about the kitchen.  Perhaps, due to lack of habit, many dishes seem too spicy to them, and the smell of some Vietnamese delicacies, to put it mildly, discourages the appetite.  There are also complaints about cleaning, which, although carried out regularly, but superficially.  Nevertheless, this hotel has many advantages, including the availability of prices, thanks to which it is almost never empty. </p>
