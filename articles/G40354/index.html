    <h2>  History </h2><p>  Alexander's settlement is inextricably linked with the name of Ivan the Terrible, one of the most controversial rulers in Russia.  But even his father, Prince Vasily III, decided to create the Russian Versailles, and, fascinated by the beauty of nature and the richness of the hunting grounds of these places, he chose Sloboda.  The best Russian and Italian masters came here, they erected the Kremlin, a suburban palace and the Intercession Church.  After the death of his parents, <span>Ivan the Terrible</span> ascended the throne <span>,</span> who treated these places in a special way, and in the middle of the 16th century he unexpectedly moved here from Moscow along with selected boyars and for a long time ruled the country from here. </p><p>  Not only luxurious buildings owe their fame to the Aleksandrovskaya Sloboda.  The museum-reserve carefully preserves the way of royal life; moreover, theatrical performances about the life of the past era are specially recreated for guests.  You do not just look at the beautiful exhibition, but try on yourself the features of the palace life of the times of Ivan the Terrible.  For history buffs, these walls will become a real storehouse of information. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Alexander Kremlin </h2><p>  It is also here, it is a fact, because the Alexander Sloboda for 18 years was the capital of a great state.  She recently celebrated her anniversary, exactly 500 years have passed since the founding of the city, for five centuries the mysterious white stone Kremlin has been looking down from the hill above the river.  In 1921, a museum was opened here, and in 1994 transformed into a reserve.  He offers you to plunge into the past, to get in touch with an amazing history and a rich cultural heritage. </p>

    <h2>  The architectural and temple ensemble </h2><p>  Aleksandrovskaya Sloboda offers to see the wonderful creation of architects and icon painters who lived and worked here for many years.  The magnificent Kremlin, made in the style of Moscow court architecture of the 15th century, has become a complex combining the traditions of Suzdal and Italian architecture of the Renaissance. </p><p>  The architectural complex includes unique architectural monuments of the 16th century.  Again, ancient temples, you grimace.  But you will be wrong.  It is truly fascinating and bewitching. </p><ul><li>  The central place is reserved for the palace church of the royal residence, today it is called the Trinity Cathedral.  This is the most magnificent building, which is always of interest to tourists.  A powerful, solid, almost cubic shape, but at the same time an incredibly elegant white stone work of art, completely covered with fresco painting, telling about the life of the Virgin. </li><li>  Pokrovskaya Church is another tent-shaped monument of the 16th century.  It was used for long and solitary prayers of the sovereign.  Until 1990, we did not know all the splendor that these walls hide.  Only when it was noticed that they were covered by later layers, a unique carved decoration was revealed under them.  This is the only plot-painted tent in Russia. </li><li>  The crucifixion church bell tower is the crown of the ensemble.  A style that is completely atypical for Russian architecture, a mighty and sky-high building is a fifty-meter pillar crowned with a tent. </li><li>  Another building of the 16th century is the <span>Assumption Church.</span>  A small building, sophisticated and refined.  As in all other buildings, there are spacious white stone cellars with carved arches. </li></ul>

Unity is also emphasized by high walls with four corner towers, built here in the 17th century.  The loopholes here act as decorative elements, because they did not carry the defensive function of the wall, but only protected the monastery from worldly fuss. </p><h2>  Aleksandrovskaya Sloboda - Museum-Reserve </h2><p>  It welcomes a variety of guests.  Excursions are divided into entertaining and educational, for adults and children.  Groups of schoolchildren are often brought here to conduct an unusual history lesson.

The narrative will not be boring, because visitors can view rare exhibits in interesting exhibits: ‚ÄúSovereign's Court in the Alexander Sloboda‚Äù, ‚ÄúRegal Persons‚Äù, ‚ÄúCzar‚Äôs Dining Room‚Äù, ‚ÄúTsar Ivan the Terrible in Painting‚Äù, ‚ÄúTreasures of Three Centuries‚Äù , "Morals of our antiquity," "In a peasant's hut." </p><p>  Here you can see a lot of interesting things - this is the decoration of past eras, dishes and household items, clothes and jewelry.  Before you appear old books, amazing works of icon painting, precious fabrics and Russian chintz.  The royal throne and the tower clock crown the collection.  The days on them were divided into daytime and night hours, and their duration varied depending on the time of year. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Museum "Aleksandrovskaya Sloboda" is one of the largest and most interesting in Russia.  Time flies by unnoticed.  What is worth visiting the ‚Äúdining room‚Äù, who did not dream of being at the king‚Äôs feast in childhood?  Particular attention was then paid to the interior decoration of the room.  Floors, walls, windows and tables were covered by all kinds of bedspreads, drapes and cloaks.  The room looked like a lace casket.  This splendor was complemented by sets of gold and silver utensils. </p><p>  A large number of precious metal products were collected, each of which is a work of art.  These are bowls in the form of fruits of apples, pears or pineapples with intricate legs, unique goblets depicting animals and birds.  For example, the presented vessel ‚Äúowl‚Äù is made of coconut shell, thin carving depicts silver feathers, legs, tail and head.  The guide will tell you the rules of court etiquette of bygone times.  This can be seen today by visiting the museum "Alexandrovskaya Sloboda".  Excursions are so saturated that pages of history come to life before your eyes.  Do not miss the opportunity to stay in the past. </p><p>  But the king was famous not only for his brilliant mind, love for magnificent feasts and exceptional god-fearing.  Going down into the gloomy cellars, you will understand why the name "bloodthirsty Alexandrovskaya Sloboda" existed.  Ivan the Terrible was quick to reprisal, and the most insignificant misconduct could lead a man into the hands of executioners.  Wax figures make the torture cellar terribly realistic. </p>

This is similar to a theatrical production in which each participant of the excursion will play one of the roles. </p>

    <h2>  Visiting the maid </h2><p>  We are so used to using modern household appliances (automatic washing and dishwasher, microwave, iron, vacuum cleaner) that we can hardly imagine our life without them.

    <h2>  How to get to Alexandrovskaya Sloboda </h2><p>  If your path lies through Moscow, you will need to drive about 100 km along the highway towards Vladimir, and you will open the Alexander's settlement.  Nizhny Novgorod and Ivanovo are also connected to the museum-city by a good track, which is easily accessible by car or sightseeing bus.  Another option is any intercity transport.  At any time of the year you will find Alexandrovskaya Sloboda.  How to get there - you decide, based on the starting point and the remoteness of your village. </p>
