  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Peptides in food</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Since ancient times, people have been worried about why aging occurs in the body.  Closely related to this is the question of what peptides are and what role they play in this process. </p><p>  Aging begins with a decrease in the rate of biochemical reactions, slowing down the work of the heart, brain, liver and other organs.  Our whole life exists thanks to two molecules: peptide proteins and DNA.  DNA itself is not active; it is only a matrix, a basis.  Only when its certain parts are combined with peptides does the synthesis of specific proteins begin and life arises. </p><p>  Peptides carry information from one cell to another, ensuring the timely implementation of their inherent functions.  If the cell regularly performs its functions, then the whole organ works well and stays healthy for a long time.  That is why it is necessary to create all conditions to maintain a constant reserve of these substances in the body. </p><p>  Peptides in products can extend the life expectancy of up to 30%.  Peptides are very effective even in old age. </p><p>  It is reasonable to think about the prevention of age-related changes from the age of 35.  For this, it is necessary to properly organize the regime of the day, to select a program for restoring the body based on peptide bioregulators (these are drugs that inhibit the aging process). </p><p>  Peptides are contained in products, primarily dairy.  There are also many of them in cereals, legumes, chicken, fish, soy, rice, eggs, buckwheat, corn, barley, some seafood, shellfish, and radish.  Experts say that there are no contraindications to the use of products with peptides.  Of course, it is necessary to select them taking into account the individual characteristics of the body, but not a single doctor will recommend refusing their use. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Peptides used in writing in foods when digested are digested and hydrolyzed.  The importance of food to replenish the natural reserves of peptides in the body is undeniable. </p><p>  According to statistics, a person eats about 60 tons of food on average in his life.  However, not all of them are beneficial.  Doctors say that nutrition must be functional, that is, consist of natural products that can improve the functioning of organs. </p><p>  For the first time that it is necessary to eat the contained peptides in foods, they seriously thought, after it was found that the phosphorylated peptides in milk casein improve the effect of vitamin D. </p><p>  In the last decade, many such products have been discovered in which peptides are present.  During their natural processing in the digestive tract, they are released from the structure of the proteins in which they are contained and begin to act as regulatory units with their own activity.  They have different mechanisms of action. </p><p>  Such peptides that are in the products are "short", that is, consisting of only 2-9 amino acid residues.  The longest peptides are found in barley grains and soybeans.  Peptides are transported from the intestine to those organs for which they are designed to regulate the work. </p><p>  Peptides secreted after the digestion of milk and yogurt can even enter the bloodstream.  In this case, two whole long peptides enter the plasma.  Substances contained in milk play an important role in human growth and development, protection against pathogenic bacteria, viruses. </p><p>  Peptides are widely used in cosmetology, especially anti-aging.  Manufacturers include elastin, collagen, wheat germ and soybean proteins in many cosmetic products.  Recently, synthetic peptides have begun to be used, which have a higher ability to penetrate into the deeper layers of the epidermis. </p>
