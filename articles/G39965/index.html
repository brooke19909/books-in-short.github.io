Nearby are the Lenin Library and the Lubyanka Station.  Included in the Tver region.  From here you can easily get to Red Square. </p><h2>  How did the name appear </h2><p>  Okhotny Ryad is a metro station that appeared in the May time of 1935.  It was part of the first launch site, which belonged to the capital's transport complex.  Organized a branch from this place to Smolenskaya.  Fork-type traffic operated here until 1938. </p>

Lenin ‚Äùand‚Äú Comintern ‚Äù, which was later renamed the‚Äú Alexander Garden ‚Äù.  Moving away from the Arbat, there is the opportunity to get into a separate line with the tunnel, which is used in official affairs.  The ability to quickly move in such a big city is precisely thanks to the Moscow metro.  Okhotny Ryad underwent a number of changes when <span>Manezhnaya Square</span> was built in the mid-90s of the last century.  The tunnel was bombarded with ¬Ω.  One path was dismantled, and the second was left intact.  Prior to this, in 1944, the passage to the Teatralnaya station was opened.  Previously had to use a large lobby.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  During 1959, under the Okhotny Ryad metro, they laid the underground passage, the first in the capital's transport network.  In 1974, a second similar structure appeared, leading to the Teatralnaya station.  Work is ongoing in each transition in a one-way direction. </p><h2>  Old times </h2><p>  Okhotny Ryad is a metro station that got its name from the street of the same name.  Previously, there was also an area with the same name.  For 18-19 centuries, there were shops where hunters could share their catch.  It was possible to get bird meat and excellent game. </p><p>  During the nineteenth century they were engaged only in trade, they left goods in warehouses.  There was an opportunity to live in a hotel or visit a tavern.  When the year 1956 arrived, the square that was here was re-planned into the street, which from 1961 to 1990 was a segment of Marx Ave. </p><p>  Okhotny Ryad is an area where in 1955 the station point was named after Kaganovich.  This is due to the fact that the <span>Moscow metro</span> had a name associated with the name of this Soviet politician.  He led the process of building a transport complex.  Then they paid tribute to Lenin, naming him the whole network, and leaving Kaganovich only one station. </p><p>  In 1957, he was removed from a leading public post, and now he enjoyed not such honor and respect.  Another change occurred - the station became ‚ÄúProspect them.  Marx ".  Here three large streets were connected, which were important.  When perestroika took place in 1990, the station acquired its initial name - Okhotny Ryad metro.  The point had to go through a name change four times, which in itself is unique to Moscow. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Interior decoration </h2><p>  Here you can transfer to the "Theater".  You need to go to the escalator, which is located in the center.  You can go through the east lobby, which also has an exit.  There is a node for a transplant, from which you can get to the "Revolution Square".  However, you will find a direct transition.  Stations are very far away. </p><p>  The underground part in the west is part of the Manege Square.  There is a transition to it.  You can go through the mall.  Chechulin created a project of this building, the house on the surface was reconstructed.  He was ripped out during the contest and renamed.  The project was designed in such a way that there were <span>sculptures made of gypsum</span> outside <span>,</span> but over time they were lost.  They were created by M. Manizer, and a teacher from the circus school A. Shirai was used as a model for one statue. </p>

    <h2>  Curious details </h2><p>  When they shot the film ‚ÄúMoscow Does Not Believe in Tears,‚Äù the authors decided to focus on the time of filming in 1958.  During the episode, trips in the car shot a track wall with the name of the station.  When the film was released in 1979, the item itself changed its name to Marx Prospect.  So the effect of transferring the viewer to the past for 20 years was created.  The most interesting thing is that the shooting itself took place at Novoslobodskaya. </p>

    <h2>  Technical features </h2><p>  The station has a pylon structure and three arches, deeply laid.  In an individual mode, a project was created based on the mining method.  Monolithic concrete was taken under the cover.  To begin with, walls were erected, and then vaults, based on the German version of the design.  When the point was built, it was the largest station so deeply laid.  In accordance with the initial plan, they did not want to build the hall in the center, but then radical changes occurred. </p><h2>  The style in which the place is decorated </h2><p>  Here you can see the designs that look like columns with many faces, the lining consists of gray and white marble.  Before that, they changed it by removing the yellow ceramic tiles.  The name of the item was written in metal color symbols.  The background is completely black.  The floor was made of gray granite.  In the hall and near the landing platforms there are lighting fixtures.  Previously, there were floor lamps similar to those on Novokuznetskaya. </p><p>  The convenience of the item lies in the feature that Red Square is easily accessible from here.  The Okhotny Ryad metro is decorated in the east with a mosaic image of Marx, which was created by E. Reichtsaum. </p><p>  If we take the statistics for March 2002, the passenger flow at the entrance amounted to 97,000 people, and at the exit - 95,000 people.  The transport center receives the first people at 5:30 a.m., the last - at 1:00 a.m. </p>
