Crochet very quickly.  Novice craftswomen should pay attention to solid models, and professionals create animals with the smallest details.  Consider several options for cats, designed for different functional purposes. </p><h2>  "Sofa" knitted cat </h2><p>  A sofa cat can be used as a decorative element in the interior or as a pillow.  To do this, choose yarn according to the color scheme of the interior or furniture.  If you take <span>bright colors,</span> then make two cats (for symmetry) or one long one. </p><p>  The sofa cat is a long body that smoothly passes into the head.  Separately sewn paws, ears, tail.  The muzzle is embroidered with threads.  All parts are attached so that they do not interfere during rest.  Fill the product with padding polyester at your discretion.  It turns out funny and at the same time practical knitted toys (cats). </p><p>  You hook a chain, close it in a circle.  Knit with ordinary single crochet with increments in each row.  As soon as you have reached the desired diameter (the cat will be of such thickness), continue knitting without increases.  For the head, do not decrease, as the muzzle is simply embroidered. </p><p>  If you want to get a bright cat, then take <span>melange yarn</span> or several colors.  Fill the product with padding polyester.  Finish knitting a head with diminution.  Separately, knit the ears, tail, paws and sew to the body.  The result is a knitted cat, and if it is filled not with sintepon, but with herbs, then you get a flavor. </p><h2>  Funny cat pillows </h2><p>  Another option for knitting simple cats in the form of pillows.  To start, knit one long rectangle or two squares that are sewn together.  If the pillow will be immediately stuffed with a synthetic winterizer, then knit with dense single crochet columns.  If you sew fabric to the knitted fabric from the wrong side, then you can choose any pattern. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  To make the knitted cat look brighter, the top and bottom of the fabric can be knitted from yarn of a different color.  Ears, paws, tail are best tied after stuffing the pillows to determine the exact size.  Sew all the details, stuff with synthetic winterizer.  At the same time, put a little filler in the upper part, immediately flashing triangles (ears) along the edges of the square. </p><p>  If you want the sintepon to be cleaned during washing, sew the lock from the back.  There should be three parts for the pillow in this case: a square and two rectangles.  Now knit paws.  The front ones are sewn on the sides of the ears.  Knit crochet in a circle so that the hand reaches to the edges of the pillow.  And then go on to enlarge the columns to tie your palms together. </p><p>  Fill with padding polyester, sew to the pillow.  Pull the resulting oval with threads, forming fingers.  The lower paws are knitted immediately from the oval, forming thick fingers.  Sew the tail on the back.  Fasten your eyes, nose in front, embroider eyebrows, mustache, mouth.  For decorative purposes, you can sew a heart pocket below, and sew a knitted mouse into it. </p><h2>  Rattle cat </h2><p>  Educational toys can be made small.  To do this, you need a plastic egg (from foam plasticine, Kinder Surprise).  You need to tie the egg with SC.  Start at the bottom by adding an even number of loops in each row.  Periodically apply a circle to the egg to proceed to knitting without increases. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet knitted cats with description" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/795025.jpg" width="392"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When you get to the middle, insert the egg with the filler (beads, beans, peas, buckwheat, pebbles).  Then the knitted cat (crochet) will make different sounds.  Knitting will be a little uncomfortable, but it is clearly visible where you need to reduce the loops.  Knit ears separately.  The easiest option is to make a square, fold it diagonally, bait at the base, sew to the head without a synthetic winterizer.  The second ear is also done. </p><p>  Knit an oval on the principle of a sole for booties.  Fill with a padding polyester, round off the loops, and tie the middle with a black thread, forming two cheeks.  Sew them to the muzzle, knit out the nose, eyes.  Also knit the tail, sew to the cat.  The antennae can be made of wire, which is wrapped in black yarn.  And you can make a cat with paws, then the muzzle will be from one end of the egg. </p><h2>  Educational cats </h2><p>  Tying different objects, you get interesting toys.  Here is another example of how developing crochet cats are obtained (crochet).  There will be no problems with the description of the circuit.  Take the baby ball.  Start knitting with crown without crochet.  For the child to separate the <span>parts of the body,</span> take cotton yarn 3-5 colors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crocheted cat" class="if" height="214" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/795021.jpg" width="320"></div>

    <p>  In each row, evenly add two columns.  Attach a knitted fabric to the ball to see where you want to add loops and where to knit without changes.  Once tied a third of the ball, switch to a different color.  This will be the cat‚Äôs tummy.  Here you can knit several colorful stripes.  Next, take another thread for the torso, put the ball in, knit with it already, since the loops are on the decrease.  Tighten the thread, hide the tail. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Now glue the eyes (you can tie or take purchased).  Make ears, tail from fabric without synthetic winterizer and sew to the cat.  It is better to embroider paws so that the ball jumps.  According to this plan, you can make "tactile" cats.  Just fill the torso with different cereals.  In this embodiment, the tail and paws are filled with any filler and sewn to the toy. </p><h2>  Crochet miniature cats with description </h2><p>  Many adults are fond of miniature toys.  They are called amiguri.  Toys knit quickly because of their size, but require laboriousness and patience, since the details are small, the thread is thin, and the hook is taken with the lowest number.  Consider how to tie kittens. </p><ul><li>  For the head, dial a chain of 11 loops.  Knit nine single crochet stitches and in the last make three stitches at once.  Turn the work over, knit eight columns, in the last do two columns, and connect the circle with a connecting loop.  You should get 22 loops.  The second row is knitted without changes.  Crocheted cat is obtained by adding and decreasing columns.  In the next two rows, add single crochet, getting 24, 30 loops.  Then knit five rows without changes, 30 single crochet.  Next, reduce the three rows, getting 24, 18, 12 loops. </li><li>  Glue the eyes between the seventh and eighth near the gap of 6 loops. </li><li>  Go on to shaping your neck.  Knit two rows with increments of single crochet, getting 16 and 20 loops. </li></ul>

In the next row, knit five columns, add, then repeat twice with six columns with an increase and end with five columns with an addition, forming 30 loops.  Knit three rows without changes.  The next three rows go with decreases, forming 24, 18 and 12 loops.  Fill with padding polyester, end with six decreases. </li><li>  Now thread the ears of the cat, embroider the nose. </li><li>  Tie the tail separately from a chain of thirteen loops.  Knit the ‚Äústrip‚Äù with single crochet, sew between the 17th and 18th row. </li><li>  Tie a bow around the neck, the toy is ready! </li></ul><h2>  Craftswoman Tips: Sleeping Cat </h2><p>  The hook allows you to achieve any shape.  To get a knitted cat of the desired shape, draw its image.  It can be a sleeping cat curled up in a lump, a cartoon hero (Matroskin, Kitty, Puss in Boots, kitten Gav).  The hook allows you to portray a toy in any action.  And with the help of sewing thread, adjust the position of the cat. </p>

    <p>  For example, for a sleeping cat, you need to tie a head in the shape of a heart, two ears, an oval body, a tail.  Start your head from the bottom (5 loops), add in two rows of two columns.  The resulting triangle shows the border of the nose. </p><p>  Then knit seven rows without increments and proceed to decrease.  After four rows, fill the product with synthetic winterizer, sew the parts.  Embroider on the head the eyes (arch), the nose and the outline of the mouth.  Knit the ears from the top in a circle, gradually adding columns, forming a "fist".  Then, with your fingers, form a bend, fasten with threads, sew to the head. </p><p>  Now you knit the body of an oval shape, while making the ends narrow, that is, you get a kind of egg.  To make the cat color, alternate 5 beige with three white rows.  It turns out eight bands. </p><p>  Lastly, knit the tail, alternating between beige and white thread (a total of 14 stripes).  Stuff with padding polyester, sew to the body.  Now, with your tail, grasp the body, put your head on, fix the position with threads. </p>

    <h2>  Souvenir with a cat </h2><p>  A wonderful souvenir will be a plot knitted cat.  The scheme here is not particularly important, the main thing is to represent the final image.  It can be a cat-football player, a doctor, a baker, a taxi driver or kittens with a mouse, a flower, a bowl of milk.  For souvenirs, it is better to use purchased eyes and spouts, then the toys look tiny. </p><p>  Tie the body in the shape of a drop.  Start with the widest part.  Knit from a chain of three loops in a circle with increments.  Determine the size of the body.  Then proceed to knitting without increases.  The lower body should be wide, and the upper - narrow.  For example, you knit five rows without increases, and then in each row reduce loops.  A total of seven rows fall on the upper torso. </p><p>  Next, go to the head.  Start knitting with a chain of three loops, add loops in each row so that the product turns out in the form of a cup.  Around the thirteenth row, you form ears on both sides using four double crochet posts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet knitted toys" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/795030.jpg" width="424"></div>

    <h2>  Creating a souvenir composition </h2><p>  Stitch your head on both sides.  Fill the product with synthetic winterizer, fasten the head from the ear with connecting loops and go on to the formation of the second ear. </p><p>  Stitch the head with the torso.  Knit the tail so long that it covers half of the body.  Sew it on the back.  Then tail wrap the body, fasten it in front.  Next, attach a <span>satin ribbon</span> bow to the neck <span>.</span>  Sew on your eyes and nose. </p><p>  Then move on to creating a flower, mouse, or cup with milk.  They can be made from another material.  Arrange the composition on cardboard, determine the diameter of the circle and outline the desired size.  Now tie the cardboard with green yarn (this will be grass).  Glue the cat and related objects onto the finished circle.  This is how <span>unusual knitted</span> cats are created. </p><p>  There will be no difficulties with the schemes.  All toys are knitted with simple crochet.  Draw a full-length cat on a piece of paper.  The cells will show where the narrowing is.  Stick when knitting this pattern - and get an exact copy of the cat. </p>
