  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The village of Kosa in the Perm region</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Kosa in the Perm region is a village, the administrative center of the Kosinsky district.  It is located on the Kos River, and 258 kilometers from here is the Mendeleevo railway station.  In addition, the village of Kosa, Perm Territory, is the administrative center of the Kosinsky rural settlement. </p><h2>  Village history </h2><p>  The first mention of this settlement dates back to 1579.  In documents of those times, the future village of Kosa, Perm Territory, was called Nyrov Pogost.  Until the October Revolution, it was the center of the Kosin region.  When a census was conducted in 1926, Kosa in the Perm Territory was the place of residence of 1,213 people.  Of these, there were 633 women and 580 men. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="In the village of Kosa" class="if uuid-3009444" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/3009444.jpg"></div><p>  For the most part, the inhabitants of Kosa Perm Territory were Permian Komi.  There was opened a school, a hospital with a veterinary station, telephone, mail.  In addition, the church and zemstvo hospital have survived to this day. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="59.9494059" data-lng="55.01624889999994" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/2/8/9/9/12899.png"></div><p>  Answering the question of how to get to Kosa in the Perm Territory, it is necessary to take into account what kind of transport a person plans to go there.  You can get to the settlement from the Mendeleevo railway station, or by car.  Currently, the road continues here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  District History </h2><p>  It is important to consider that the history of the Kosinsky region remains poorly understood.  There are many legends about the miracle, the golden woman, the heroes.  The local heroes were called Yuksi, Puksi, Chaz and Bach.  Probably, many settlements here are named after them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Speech in the village of Kosa" class="if uuid-3009441" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/3009441.jpg"></div><p>  In 1579, in the Nyrov Pogost, as the village of Kosa was called before, there were 14 courtyards.  There was already a parish here.  There is evidence that the village burned down from a lightning strike in 1623.  Therefore, the houses in it were cut down again and installed on a huge ashes. </p><p>  In 1840, there was already its own stone church.  And as of 1910, there was a four-year school.  There were trading shops, breech wine. </p><p>  From old documents, information has been preserved that for centuries rye, oats, barley and only occasionally wheat have been grown here.  Tribal boars were widespread here - they constantly tried to improve their breed.  Locals hunted for squirrels and martens.  Popular among the local population was fishing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Church in Kos" class="if uuid-3009443" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/3009443.jpg"></div><p>  For a long time there was a difficult connection with the village councils.  Big industry was never conducted here, it was small - a forge, a mill.  There were fourteen enterprises in total.  In the 1930s, a wave of dispossession swept through the village. </p><p>  Long ago, roads were laid here.  And in 1930, a pedagogical college was opened in Kos. </p><p>  Due to the peculiarities of the location of this region, it was necessary to highlight the Gain region.  This was committed in 1925.  Before the Soviet Constitution was adopted, the Council of Deputies was the main authority here.  Their sessions later occurred four times in a year.  The last of them was elected in 1990.  After that, as in the whole country, reforms began here. </p><p>  In total, three collective farms were opened in this territory.  State trade in the village did not develop in any way.  It is noteworthy that dispossessed immigrants were sent to this village.  Due to this, the population of this territory tripled in just one 1932. </p>
