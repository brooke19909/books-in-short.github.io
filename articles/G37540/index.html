Nha Trang Resort: reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Nha Trang is a resort city located in the southern part of Vietnam.  Despite its small size, it is very interesting.  Tourists spend time here in different ways: they simply sunbathe on the beach, go to various small islands, making sea excursions, and study the local sights, which are located in a fifty-kilometer radius. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  If you are going on a trip to a country located in the subtropics, many, of course, are primarily interested in the weather at the place of their future stay.  If you are going to a country with a subtropical climate, everyone, of course, is interested in the issue of weather at the place of future stay.  I must say that the climate in Nha Trang can not be characterized in one word.  This is quite a diverse, and sometimes unpredictable phenomenon. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nha Trang Resort" class="if" height="426" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/711025.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Meteorological conditions depend on the season.  For example, from October to the end of December, here, especially in the evenings, there are strongest winds.  Many Russians who were ‚Äúlucky‚Äù to visit Nha Trang at that time say that they were literally demolished in the open.  The temperature here is set within twenty-eight degrees of heat with low humidity. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This period is considered to be ‚Äúout of season‚Äù, because it is rainy time.  There are days when rainfall does not stop for several hours.  In January, the temperature drops to twenty-four degrees Celsius.  At this time, the sea is still turbulent, but by the end of the month this phenomenon is coming to naught.  From February to October, the beach season begins. </p><p>  The weather in Nha Trang in April is completely suitable for a good rest.  Daytime temperature rises to thirty-one, in the evenings it goes down to twenty-four degrees of heat. </p><p>  If you are lucky, then precipitation may not occur for whole weeks.  And if the rains begin, they are short-lived.  It is believed that the weather in Nha Trang in April is almost always sunny, even hot.  Water in the sea during this period is comfortable - +27. </p><h2>  Relaxation </h2><p>  This resort town is located in Khanh Hoa, a province in southeast Vietnam.  It is famous for its snow-white beaches, as if descended from the Bounty advertisement, tropical vegetation on the islands and an amazing underwater world. </p>

    <p>  Coral reefs hidden in the sea in Nha Trang are ideal for diving enthusiasts.  A lot of them are flying here.  And this is not surprising: numerous places for diving, where visibility is beautiful even at a depth of thirty meters, can be found in just fifteen minutes by speedboat. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Not numerous and Russians in Nha Trang.  They are attracted here by diving, and developed tourist infrastructure, and the opportunity to escape from the snow-covered city and find themselves in a tropical paradise. </p><p>  Here, many joke that the resort seemed to fit in with the Russians.  Indeed, many of them most often buy the tour here.  <span>Vietnam, Nha Trang</span> in particular, is very attractive to our compatriots.  They fly here on New Year's Eve or on March holidays to see rare fish underwater, taste lobsters and grilled octopuses, have fun in bars and discos. </p><h2>  Flight </h2><p>  For some time, charters began to fly to the Nha Trang resort.  And if an air flight from Moscow with Aeroflot companies, as well as Vietnam Airlines or Cathay Pacific, will cost a little more than thirty thousand rubles, then the presence of private carriers has greatly changed the situation.  A ticket in this case will save up to five thousand: it costs around five hundred euros. </p><p>  True, the price of charter flights varies depending on the season, aircraft occupancy, etc., however, in March 2015, tourists could buy Nha Trang - Moscow round-trip tickets for a thousand and one hundred dollars. </p><p>  The distance from the Russian capital to this resort town is 7736 km.  The duration of the flight in the case of a direct flight is eleven hours and five minutes.  The price of a flight Nha Trang - Moscow can be significantly lower if you choose not a direct flight, but with a change, for example, in Hanoi or Seoul. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sea in Nha Trang" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/711030.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Visa regime </h2><p>  Vietnam is quite loyal to tourists from Russia, however, to stay in this country for more than fifteen days, our fellow citizens will have to issue an invitation to enter.  Upon arrival, to pass <span>customs control,</span> you must submit a passport with two photos.  At the same time, <span>cash</span> must be on <span>hand</span> to pay the fee.  If tourists need a single-entry visa for a period of thirty days, then they will have to pay twenty-five to the treasury, and those who plan to visit the country again will have to pay thirty dollars.  But not only upon arrival, you can get permission to enter.  <span>A visa to Vietnam</span> can be issued in Russia, in the embassy of this country.  But then the cost of a visa increases slightly: it is fifty-five dollars with a deadline of up to seven business days. </p><h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  Nha Trang resort is primarily chosen by locals.  Apparently, this explains the fact that along the entire coast of the city there are numerous mini-hotels, most of which are quite simple and work mainly only in summer.  They provide a fairly decent service for a fairly low price. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Olympic Hotel Nha Trang 3" class="if" height="235" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/711032.jpg" width="312"></div>  In addition, the resort can be very inexpensive to live in motels and boarding houses, the cost per night in which sometimes is even less than twenty dollars.  But at the same time they all have a private bathroom in the rooms, air conditioning, TV and even a refrigerator.  Most even have Wi-Fi: if not in rooms, then in public areas.
