  <section class="page js-page"><h1>'Crocodiles, hippos and green parrot': Holidays in Australia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A mysterious and distant island country can become real for you tomorrow, if last-minute tours to Australia make you take a vacation, pack your suitcase, and travel to the world of your old dream for a couple of weeks. </p><p>  Of course, when planning to visit this country, you should theoretically prepare for a visit so that your vacation in Australia does not become for you just a contemplation of the beautiful ocean coast.  After all, Australia is not only golden beaches, turquoise waves, sultry sun, it is a lot of historical monuments, architecture, botanical and zoological gardens, nature reserves, national parks with their unique flora and fauna. </p><p>  So, when planning a vacation in Australia, keep in mind that every self-respecting tourist must try to solve the secret of Auers Rock, or Uluru, on their own.  This is the largest stone monolith in the world, located in Central Australia.  Its dimensions are amazing: length - 3.6 km, width - 2 km, and height - 348 meters.  This Australian miracle can change its color at sunrise or sunset, and looks different in different lighting conditions.  Uluru is mentioned in the legends of local Aboriginal tribes as a mountain that was built by the ancestors of modern people. </p><p>  Known around the world as a treasure of ecology and culture, <span>Kakadu National Park is</span> located east of Darwin and is a unique <span>complex of natural</span> and cultural values.  This park covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã19 thousand kW.  km, and a complete rest in Australia is impossible without visiting this conservation area, which contains more than 50 species of mammals, 123 species of reptiles, more than 10 thousand species of insects, 280 species of different birds, 77 species of fish.  There is not a single national park in the world that is equal in size to Kakadu Park. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Kangaroo Island is another place that you can get to know better if last minute trips to Australia are helpfully offered to you by a travel agent to your vague question about where to fly to rest.  This amazing island is stunning with its wildlife, riot of plants, unique wildlife.  After all, some of the plants and animals living on this island are not found anywhere else in the world!  Here, tourists can go horseback riding, diving or fishing. </p><p>  Holidays in Australia will provide you with an introduction to the 12 cliffs of the Apostles, which can be seen from the coast of Victoria.  The coast of the <span>Twelve Apostles</span> is about 10-20 million years old: it was then, according to scientists, that limestone deposits began to form on the ocean floor.  Time, waves and wind did their job, and the limestone acquired its amazing shape. </p><p>  Australia is associated with the Great Barrier Reef for many, because its size (Great Britain and Ireland combined) inspire respect and amaze with its scale.  The Barrier Reef is an association of thousands of islands that are home to the inhabitants of the ocean.  No wonder the Great <span>Coral Reef</span> is on the World Heritage List. </p><p>  A trip to the <span>island of Tasmania</span> will be remembered by lovers of untouched fauna and flora, because here in the abode of tropical forests and alpine nature there are many rare <span>animals,</span> birds, and insects listed in the <span>Red Book</span> .  The splendor of the lakes, the purity of the rivers, Cradle Mountain Park, icy transparent waterfalls - all this is Tasmania. </p><p>  A man-made miracle - the Sydney Opera House - is perhaps the most famous architectural monument and a symbol of Australia.  Guided tours of the Opera House will give an opportunity to appreciate the scale of this building from the thousands of rooms in which the Australian <span>Opera, the Sydney</span> Symphony Orchestra, the Australian Ballet, the Sydney Dance Troupe and the Sydney Theater Troupe are located. </p><p>  Tourists are happy to travel along the famous Sydney bridge, visit the golden coast, and also become guests of hospitable areas of winemaking in Australia. </p>
