    <p>  Each room has a table and comfortable armchairs that can be easily taken out to the balcony, safe, satellite TV with several channels broadcasting in Russian.  The air conditioning is individual, and everyone can easily customize it for their own needs, a minibar and internet in the rooms are paid, the phone has a direct long-distance line. </p><h2>  How to choose food? </h2><p>  Resorts, as you know, are different.  In some hotels you should limit yourself to breakfast, and spend the day and evening getting to know the local traditions and cuisine, while others come to one place, which is called, without departing from the cash register, to get everything at once.  The latter are just the ones that are loved by domestic tourists, Turkey and Egypt.  Coral Beach Resort Tiran 4 * is ready to offer its guests two types of food: breakfast and all-inclusive.  As shown by numerous experience and practice, the second option in this case is better and more profitable.  Most tourists go outside the hotel for a whole number of times during their holidays, and most of them go on excursions.  It does not make sense to look for new restaurants or cafes daily, as the hotel has quite good infrastructure.  Having paid everything in advance, in reality you will only have to relax and enjoy everything that happens. </p><h2>  Restaurants on site </h2>

    <p>  You can also watch entertainment programs conducted by the hotel‚Äôs animators, purchase excursion packages, play darts or billiards, volleyball on the beach, tennis on the equipped court. </p><h2>  For beauty and health </h2><p>  Rest will be inferior if you do not include procedures for relaxing and restoring the body.  Without exception, the hotel provides an opportunity to visit saunas and steam rooms, wellness and fitness centers, a jacuzzi and massage treatments.  Some of the listed services are provided for a fee, the cost and price list must be clarified at the hotel during registration or at the staff during the holidays. </p><h2>  Service for children </h2><p>  Coral Beach Resort Tiran 4 * hotel positions itself as a family, for a calm and measured rest, where everyone will find something to do and have fun to their taste.  In fact, children are not bored here.  To start at least with a special club, it works every day for two hours before lunch and after.  Adults can fully devote this time to themselves.  Various entertainments and a leisure room will surely please the baby, and experienced animators will deal with them.  There is also a playground on the territory, a special disco is held every evening, popular and favorite cartoons are broadcast on the big screen, and in the pools there are special departments where it is not deep. </p><p>  If necessary, the hotel is always ready to provide a cot and chairs in restaurants for free, as well as babysitting services for an additional hourly fee. </p><h2>  Coral Beach Resort Tiran 4 *: location and service reviews </h2><p>  Given the love of our compatriots for the <span>resorts of Egypt,</span> we can say that many of them already have a professional look at the quality of the services provided.  Opinions about the location of the hotel are the same.  It is very good, near the sea, it is quiet and calm.  However, the beach itself fell, as it turned out, not everyone liked it.  The sea is deep enough, from the shore you just can‚Äôt get close to it, you risk not only injuring your legs.  But everyone notes the beauty of the coral reef and its inhabitants, which can be seen without even diving inland. </p>

    <p>  Of the negative moments, hotel guests note unscrupulous service.  The staff cleaning the rooms, rude and impolite, the quality of service is poor, according to most.  But the <span>work of the animators</span> at the Coral Beach Resort Tiran 4 * hotel is appreciated.  A wide variety of events, competitions, parties and discos left only warm and vivid memories in the memory of vacationers. </p><p>  According to the reviews of tourists from all over the world, appliances and furniture in the rooms are not new, and this can be seen, however, it all works properly. </p><h2>  About restaurants and food </h2><p>  Opinions on this issue are not unanimous, but the vast majority note a mismatch between the level declared by the hotel and the actual service in restaurants and bars.  The staff is not too polite, the menu is monotonous, the food is not very tasty.  Many note the presence of a queue for second courses, which, in principle, is unacceptable in a hotel of this level. </p><p>  This place is not for those who go for delights and delicacies, gastronomic masterpieces.  Everything is simple and affordable here, people who are unpretentious in food, the service is quite satisfied, as well as the menu.  In general, the price and quality level are quite comparable, which attracts a large number of tourists to the hotel, including from Arab countries. </p><p>  Former guests and residents recommend visiting other restaurants nearby, especially those specializing in seafood.  You can see the location of Coral Beach Resort Tiran 4 * on the map and roughly outline the routes that you would like to go along with, as well as take into account the restaurants nearby.  Our compatriots also recommend abandoning purchases in souvenir shops and shops on the hotel premises, as prices are often very high. </p>
