  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Interpersonal relations are the basis of the existence and development of society</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  We are all people and we are all individuals, as we possess qualities and psychological characteristics that allow us to lead an active life in society and to be full members of society.  Interaction with the environment close and not very has a serious impact on our behavior and <span>personal development.</span>  And at the heart of this interaction are interpersonal relationships, very different in nature and structure, which can be described as follows.  Interpersonal relations are subjectively and emotionally experienced relationships between people in the process of joint activity, based on various <span>types of communication</span> (visual, psychological and linguistic).  Thanks to these relations, a society of <span>people successfully</span> exists and develops. </p><p>  Interpersonal relationships in a <span>small group are</span> classified in different ways.  They can be official, for example, between a boss and a subordinate, a teacher and a student, and be built on the basis of approved rules, laws, charters, etc.  In the process of doing joint work, business relationships are formed that are limited only by the scope of labor activity. </p><p>  <span>Informal relations are</span> formed solely due to personal sympathy or antipathy, emotions and feelings and are not limited to any official documents and rules.  Such relationships between people arise only due to the personal, subjective perception of another, impressions of character, behavior, speech and appearance. </p><p>  Interpersonal relations are also the ability to correctly evaluate and perceive people around us in order to successfully interact in a group.  Psychologists who observe communication between group members have identified several common causes that interfere with normal understanding and communication.  These include, firstly, the presence of predetermined attitudes, certain assessments and beliefs, long before the meeting that people have (they are sure that new friends are of no interest to them).  Secondly, a considerable number of stereotypes that each person is burdened with and which very often influence the evaluation of a new acquaintance and the impression of him.  Thirdly, often when they meet people make judgments about each other long before they get to know each other better.  Fourth, in <span>interpersonal communication,</span> many people are not able to listen and evaluate the opinions of others, always relying only on their own.  Finally, many of us cannot understand and define the goals and intentions of other people during our acquaintance and communication. </p><p>  In addition, the features of interpersonal relations are characterized by certain frameworks given by social patterns, stereotypes, i.e.  how it is accepted in a given group, society or even culture.  But even with a limited scope, there is always an opportunity for freedom of choice.  Interpersonal relationships are relationships built on the feelings and emotions of at least two interacting partners.  Accordingly, one who is ahead of his partner in the manifestation of an emotional attitude sets the tone for all subsequent interaction.  So, unemotional and indifferent people will always have those relationships that determine more active and emotional.  Programmable interpersonal relationships are a positive moment in building a life plan, in achieving success in both personal life and career. </p><p>  <span>Relations of people are</span> most seriously affected by the values ‚Äã‚Äãthat determine their lifestyle.  The coincidence of the main values ‚Äã‚Äãin life, cognitive constructs strengthens the relations of people among themselves, and a divergence of views inevitably leads to conflicts and misunderstanding. </p>
