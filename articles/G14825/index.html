Which 8-core smartphones to buy</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The era of such ‚Äúcool" phones began in January 2013.  At that time, Samsung introduced the first, eight-core smartphones with an ARM processor at CES.  Immediately we want to note that these are not completely full-fledged, constantly working kernels.  In the Galaxy S4, S5, Note 3, the processor, depending on the complexity of the task it performs, activates either four Cortex-A7, economical, or four ARM Cortex-A15, very powerful.  These ‚Äúclusters‚Äù cannot work in parallel. </p><h2>  Top flagships Samsung Galaxy S5 and another Korean - LG G3 </h2><p>  At the moment, 8-core smartphones represent many devices.  Samsung Galaxy S5 - one of the top.  It has a new Exynos chipset, which has eight cores, and, finally, they all work simultaneously.  A dream come true lovers of sophisticated devices.  Screen - 5.25 inches, resolution - 2560x1440 (2K), display - HD Amoled. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="8 nuclear smartphones" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/604810.jpg" width="500"></div>  For this device, RAM has a record size of 3 GB.  The battery is quite powerful - 4000 mAh, the camera is also not weak - 16 MP.  So if you need a powerful high-quality smartphone, the beautiful Samsung Galaxy S5 is what you need.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Approximately the same characteristics are another top South Korean model - LG G3.  It has a similar processor on eight cores, except that the chip with a different, 64-bit architecture.  Camera - 16 megapixels, display - Ultra-HD (2K) with a resolution of 2560x1440.  The presence of a fingerprint sensor is an innovative solution. </p><h2>  Chinese Zopo ZP998 and Huawei Honor 3X </h2><p>  Competitors producing 8-core Chinese smartphones are not far behind companies from South Korea.  Let's consider some of them.  Let's start with the Zopo ZP998, which was the first to work simultaneously with all eight cores.  This happened in November 2013.  It has a Full-HDZopo display, a resolution of 2560x1440 pixels, a five and a half inches screen, RAM - 2 GB, 32 GB of memory built into the device, two SIM cards and a 14 MP camera. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="8 nuclear Chinese smartphones" class="if" height="272" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/604805.jpg" width="251"></div>  The device works on Android 4.2.  There is also a fingerprint sensor.  A smartphone from the Celestial Huawei Honor 3X may also deserve your attention.  The RAM is the same, 2 GB, the camera is a little weaker - 13 megapixels.  Differences: the battery is more powerful - at 3000 mAh, both SIM cards can work in 3G networks, a very strong front camera, 5 megapixels, a good assistant for video communication.  Unfortunately, there is also a drawback: the resolution is only 1280x720 pixels with a five and a half inches display and IPS screen.

But, which is very remarkable, the kit includes a BOOMband, a fitness bracelet that will delight those who lead a very active lifestyle.  Also, the owner of this gadget will get real pleasure from listening to music - thanks to two stereo speakers.  The Chinese company Meizu released the MX4 smartphone in two versions: a 5.5-inch, with a good resolution of 2560x1440 pixels and an Ultra-HD display, as well as a five-inch one, with a lower resolution of 1920x1080 pixels, and a high-quality Full-HD display. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="8 nuclear smartphones" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/604806.jpg" width="500"></div>  Both versions support fourth-generation 4G LTE networks.  The T100s Iron Man smartphone has the same specifications, only its camera is Sony.  Considering the 8-core smartphones, we can recall the Indian flagship Gionee, which released a miniature model Elife E7 mini, which nevertheless has a 13 megapixel camera, 2GB of RAM and a 4.7 HD screen.

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Buyers often think about whether or not it makes sense to buy an 8-core smartphone.  How will applications, games work on it, how long will the battery last?  This problem was already in the transition to two and four cores.  Manufacturers have long found solutions to all emerging issues.  First, operating systems are optimized to run on more cores.  Secondly, in order not to decrease battery life, Huawei and Samsung are adopting special technologies to prevent this, for example, ARM big.LITTLE.  Thirdly, the performance of phones will increase markedly, especially when all eight cores are made to work simultaneously.  So it's up to you to buy or not. </p>
