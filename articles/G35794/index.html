What are they just talking about in their many forums!  And their slang is quite peculiar.  And very often you can hear a question from them: “Guys, tell me how to put money on Steam?”  You won’t immediately understand what is at stake.  And the answer to this question is very important for many, because “Steam” today for many fans of computer games is almost the same as a social network for the avid “sitters”.  But first things first. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to put money on steam" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/344108.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2></h2><h2>  <span>What is Steam?</span> </h2><p>  And this is an amazing game platform on the Internet in its size and capabilities, without which fans of online games, and not only them, simply can not do.  Every self-respecting true gamer is simply required to have their own Steam account.  After all, here you can buy games (licensed!) At a very reasonable price, and sometimes with a huge, incredible discount, and then play them on any platform.  And also communicate with friends, receive bonuses, buy chips, cards and give gifts to your comrades in the game.  Therefore, without answering the question of how to put money into Steam, no gamer will enjoy virtual life.  Well, with pleasure we will help! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2></h2><h2>  How <span>to transfer money</span> to Steam </h2><p>  I want to say right away that there is nothing complicated in this, and the options are more than enough.  You can top up your balance directly on Steam.  To do this, just log into your account, then in the top menu find the “Communities” tab, go to the submenu called “Marketplace”.  There, on the tab to the right, you can find the button “Top up balance”.  You need to specify the amount that you want to transfer, and then choose the preferred method from the proposed options.  This can be <span>a Webmoney wallet,</span> QIWI, or Yandex.Money.  The latter, by the way, appeared recently, which caused great enthusiasm among the owners of Steam accounts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to transfer money to steam" class="if" height="346" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/344109.jpg?1393465477647" width="347"></div>

    <p>  In the newly opened window, you will be prompted to enter the phone number specified during registration, after which SMS will come with a code that you need to confirm your request. </p><p>  How to put money on "Steam"?  There is another way.  Here everything must be done exactly the opposite: first go to your virtual wallet that you use, select “Steam” in the “Payments” section, enter your Steam nickname, then the required amount (but in this case, taking into account the commission, which is everywhere naturally different).  Further actions are the same as usually when using your payment system.  The same phone number, code, confirmation.  Everything, money on Steam.  You can plunge headlong into the catalog and buy, buy, buy ... </p><p>  True, that’s where it’s too early to conclude the conversation about how to put money into Steam.  After all, these are far from all <span>methods of payment for the</span> coveted “licenses”.  You can transfer money both by credit card, and from a mobile phone, and through Euroset.  There are a lot of ways.  There would be money, and you can buy any game on Steam. </p><p>  Finally, I would like to touch upon another topic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to transfer money in incentive" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/344112.jpg?1393465525377" width="600"></div>

    <h2></h2><h2>  How to transfer money in "Steam" </h2><p>  Many, especially beginners, are interested in whether it is possible to transfer money directly from Steam from one account to another.  The answer is clear: no!  The only thing you can do is buy games and then give them to your friends in the community.  But is it really confusing for a real, truly self-respecting gamer?  Especially when you consider that the discounts on Steam are sometimes just awesome! </p>
