With a certain amount of perseverance and certain skills, you can get an original individual craft, the equal of which can no longer be found.  This is not only about bracelets, earrings, hairpins, but also about more complex work, for example, a necklace made from beads with your own hands. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Home-made jewelry is firmly in fashion, but to say how it all began is quite problematic.  Some jewelers liked the idea so much that they began to produce collections of products with a simple design.  And if such a masterpiece is quite difficult to repeat due to the high cost of materials, then you can always opt for a more budget-friendly craft.  Moreover, it will not be inferior in beauty to the jewelry created by the jewelry master. </p><div class="photo" data-original="beadpet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself beaded necklace for beginners" class="if uuid-2422861" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45860/2422861.jpg"></div><h2>  What you need for work </h2><p>  Most needlewomen prefer simple materials that can be purchased at a specialty store.  A wide selection of components allows anyone to make necklaces from beads with their own hands.  Before you begin, you must have the following: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  thread mouline thread - 2 skeins of suitable color; </li><li>  beads; </li><li>  beads of the chosen color, it is better to take large; </li><li>  small round rhinestones; </li><li>  wire under the beads; </li><li>  thread matching color to selected materials; </li><li>  special needle; </li><li>  scissors. </li></ul><h2>  How to make a necklace </h2><p>  Do-it-yourself beaded necklace for beginners is quite simple.  Do as follows.  All skeins of mouline thread are divided into 3 equal bundles, each about 80 cm long. The bundles are tied together so that the ends of the threads remain behind the bundle.  The rest is braided.  This is what will serve as the basis for decoration.  The length is calculated based on what size is needed. </p><p>  The base must be put aside for a while and proceed with the manufacture of the next part.  You will need a thread and beads of the same color.  Cut the thread and pass into the first bead in such a way that the ends go towards each other.  The ends are tightened, further work is carried out in a similar way.  It is necessary to create a bead thread having 1/3 of the length from the warp.  At the end, you need to form a nodule.  Another part of the necklace is made of beads with your own hands. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemaster.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.livemaster.com/item/25157165-mixed-technique-necklace-from-beads-of-kalinka-malinka-natura"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself light beaded necklace" class="if uuid-2421623" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2421623.jpg"></div><p>  To make the next part of the necklace, you need to take the wire and beads with rhinestones.  Rhinestones are strung on a wire, which must be bent, passing through the last pebble, do the same with the other end.  Both ends are held in the upper hole of the rhinestone located in the middle, and the wire is tightened.  To secure the element, metal is twisted from the wrong side. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The next step will be to string unused little beads.  It remains to connect all parts of the necklace with the base - and the original jewelry can be safely tried on.  As you can see, making a necklace of beads for beginners is not difficult. </p><h2>  What other decorations </h2><p>  In this part of the article, we will talk about making an air necklace.  For work, you need a crochet hook.  As a result, an airy necklace made of beads with your own hands will have a volume and is perfect for an evening dress, it is not a shame to demonstrate it at an official event.  As for the manufacturing process, the needlewoman will need handy crochet skills to make complex loops that will give the right amount of decoration. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.naija.ng" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself beaded air necklace" class="if uuid-2421605" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2421605.jpg"></div><h2>  What will be needed in the work </h2><p>  In this case, additional tools will be needed: </p><ul><li>  fishing line; </li><li>  medium thickness hook (No. 2.5‚Äì3); </li><li>  fittings; </li><li>  pins with rings; </li><li>  caps; </li><li>  clasps, snap hooks or ‚Äúscrews‚Äù. </li></ul><p>  The thickness of the hook should be just that.  This size is suitable for working with fishing line.  It is important!  Otherwise, difficulties arise with a set of loops and pulling the fishing line. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemaster.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself beaded necklace photo" class="if uuid-2421631" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2421631.jpg"></div><h2>  Procedure for making jewelry </h2><p>  Consider how to make a necklace of beads with your own hands.  Initially, beads should be strung.  The needlewoman should remember that it is better to immediately measure and cut off the necessary length of fishing line.  It will take about 4.5 meters.  While there is stringing, you need to monitor the uniformity of the arrangement of the beads, so that you do not have to stop the work to pull the pebbles. </p><p>  5 cm recede from the lower edge and tie a knot with a loop into which a hook will be inserted to form air loops.  Then the beads are pushed (the amount is at the discretion of the needlewoman).  In the process of knitting, you need to increase and decrease the elements to give the necklace a lace.  Part of the loops can be made with beads, part without it, in the latter case, the loops are made larger.  For convenience, you can use the following scheme: for example, 4 - 3 - 4 - empty - 4 - 3 - 4, etc. </p><p>  A light necklace made of beads with your own hands implies the presence of air loops that do not need to be pulled together.  The hook is threaded into the loop, then the fishing line is captured and pulled through the selected loop.  This method allows you to perform the simplest air loop, which serves as the basis for the selected technique. </p><h2>  Features of the formation of the first layer </h2><p>  The first layer should consist of a bead chain having a length of 0.4 meters.  When performing work, everything is based not only on the future beauty of the product, but also on the simplicity of further assembly.  Behind the first chain, 5 loops are looped empty, which play the role of a conductor that divides the necklace.  Such an approach will facilitate the further division of the knitted chain into rows and the assembly of volumetric jewelry. </p><p>  With a length of the first row of 40 cm, the next one will need to be increased by 2-3 cm. The third segment with air loops and beads also increases.  It is important not to forget to leave free loops between them. </p><p>  The work continues until the beads end, by this time more than 10 blanks of the future necklace should be ready.  The number of rows depends on how dense the knitting was made.  The last chain ends with five air loops, the fishing line is fixed in a knot so that the decoration does not crumble. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.guidepatterns.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself beaded necklace" class="if uuid-2421636" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2421636.jpg"></div><h2>  Shutdown </h2><p>  We proceed to the last stage of the formation of a necklace of beads with your own hands <span>(photo</span> - later in the article).  First you need to put on a soft surface all the layers of the workpiece.  You can use a pillow for these purposes.  A sufficient number of pins will also be needed. </p><p>  The chain is stretched in layers, and the pins act as clamps and are fixed where the air loops were formed (5 pieces).  The result should be a voluminous, long, zigzag chain of beads. </p><div class="photo" data-original="culturesinternational.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a bead necklace with your own hands" class="if uuid-2421609" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2421609.jpg"></div><h2>  How to make a zipper </h2><p>  At the end of weaving, it remains to collect the decoration.  You need to use the pins with rings and pliers to extend the ring.  It is necessary to put on loops on it, starting from either end of the necklace, gradually removing the pins.  When all the parts are on the clasp, you need to bend it, also do the loops on the other end of the jewelry and put on the ends.  The pins can be decorated with beads to hide the wire. </p>
