If you can sew simple models of curtains and curtains on windows, you can do something more complicated with a lambrequin.  For the kitchen, it is important to choose the right material so that the curtains and curtains serve for a long time.  If sewing is your hobby, it is not only a great way to spend your free time, but also to decorate your kitchen. </p><h2>  Where to begin? </h2><p>  Do you want the kitchen to be interesting, non-trivial?  Then it is worthwhile to show your imagination and decorate its interior with original curtains and curtains that will create additional comfort.  One of the interesting ideas is the use of lambrequins as a complement to <span>window decoration.</span>  It is suitable for traditional direct curtains that give the interior a classic style and prestige. </p><p>  Sewing curtains and curtains with a lambrequin into the kitchen with your own hands is not difficult.  This requires basic skills in creating patterns and owning a sewing machine.  Sewing on a typewriter girls taught at school or mom and grandmother at home.  Now is the time to remember and refresh these skills and abilities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sprzedajemy.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="An example of a combined lambrequin" class="if uuid-2423856" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2423856.jpg"></div><p>  If you have never sewed a lambrequin or other complex curtain elements, start with simple cottage or kitchen models for a small window and ready-made pattern.  Placing beautiful folds of swag (half rings in the form of a shell) in a pelmet is quite difficult without experience.  But everything is comprehended in the process of its acquisition. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To sew a curtain with a lambrequin to the kitchen (photo above), you need: </p><ul><li>  Correctly determine the size of the window frame, if there is a door, then the entire kitchen unit. </li><li>  Make a high-quality pattern on paper, if necessary, then on the old fabric, in order to understand whether the cut is correctly made or not. </li><li>  Choose the right fabric for curtains, curtains and lambrequins. </li><li>  Decide what will be the ledge to which the kitchen curtain is attached. </li></ul><h2>  How to change the perception of the size of the kitchen? </h2><p>  When planning sewing kitchen curtains and curtains, you should understand what effect you want to get with their help.  The choice of style of decorating a window frame in the form of a curtain with a lambrequin in the kitchen depends on the size of the room.  Thanks to this design, depending on the length of the curtain and the lambrequin hanging over it, you can optically shorten or expand the window. </p><p>  In a small kitchen, the window is not decorated with magnificent heavy curtains - they obscure the room and visually reduce it.  For such a room, fabrics of thin translucent materials with light shades are preferred.  At the same time, the curtains should not be too bright and catchy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hogyan-kell.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Curtain with a lambrequin in the kitchen" class="if uuid-2421508" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2421508.jpg"></div><p>  With the help of curtains, you can correct the perception of the kitchen.  If the room has a narrow elongated shape, you should choose a fabric with a horizontally located pattern.  If the room is low, the curtains should have vertical stripes or the curtain fabric is chosen using the degradation technique (gradient technique or ombre) with the magic effect of a smooth transition of color from the darkest to the lightest.  A similar effect is created by vertical folds on the lambrequin itself. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For the kitchen, it is important to consider the degree of natural light and the size of the kitchen window unit when choosing a model and material for sewing.  In the absence of natural light, the window block is decorated with pastel shades and short tulle curtains.  This design will create an expanding effect of the kitchen. </p><h2>  The choice of material for curtains and curtains </h2><p>  For large kitchens with studio interiors, you can sew curtains from different materials, such as velvet, silk, brocade, taffeta.  Their colors are selected individually for the color scheme of kitchen furniture, wallpaper, tile.  Typically, a pelmet is made of the same material as the curtains.  Curtain tulle is chosen depending on the selected curtains and the overall design of the kitchen. </p><blockquote><p>  When choosing curtains for any type of room, you should always keep in mind the unspoken rule: the more expensive the fabric, the simpler the design, the simpler the fabric, the more complex and original design. </p></blockquote><div class="photo" data-original="prospective.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Curtains with pelmet in the kitchen" class="if uuid-2421497" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2421497.jpg"></div><h2>  Design options </h2><p>  Currently, a lambrequin is a fashionable decoration element that can be made for any window.  When choosing a design option for a kitchen window, you should decide on the length of the curtains.  They can be shortened (to the windowsill), medium length (10-15 cm below the windowsill) and long (to the floor or almost touching).  When the kitchen is well lit, windows can be decorated with curtains in blue and green.  They will look good against the background of light walls.  Curtains should correspond to the size of the window and not interfere with its opening.  It is recommended to decorate a small window with shortened curtains or medium lengths. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Medium and large windows can be framed by a multilayer tulle floor composition with a lambrequin.  The kitchen may have a balcony door, since not all apartments have a standard layout.  In this case, the window in the kitchen is combined with access to the balcony.  However, the presence of an additional exit to the street is not such a drawback, and with the correct design of the curtains, the second door in the kitchen can be decorated in an original way. </p><div class="photo" data-original="primezona.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Curtain with lambriken for the kitchen unit" class="if uuid-2422099" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2422099.jpg"></div><p>  Modern designers offer us many interesting models of curtains in the kitchen with a lambrequin.  The photo above is just such an option, where the window in the kitchen with a balcony door.  In this case, the tulle and curtain will look better in the form of a separate panel.  A two-piece kitchen curtain looks beautiful: short (for a window) and long (for a door).  In combination with lambrequins and other decor, this composition looks impressive. </p><h2>  Types of lambrequins for the kitchen </h2><p>  Among all the existing lambrequins, three options can be distinguished. </p><ul><li>  Hard effectively decorates the upper part of the window, lies in a straight line and has no waves.  Sometimes it is pulled directly onto the cornice.  It can be of various shapes: straight under the ceiling, and above the window is oval or complex.  It is relevant for kitchens of large and medium size, as you need space for its proper perception. </li><li>  Soft consists of many luxurious elements, such as frills and sewn details (fringe, lace, contrasting trim).  Usually wavy or creased with a lambrequin.  Together with curtains, which can be the same color as the lambrequin, it looks harmonious. </li><li>  Combined is a combination of the two main options for a lambrequin - soft and hard.  It is used in the Art Nouveau style to create an original decorative element for a window that combines the rigidity of the base and the softness of the drapery. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="kakieshtory.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Curtain in the kitchen with hard lambriken" class="if uuid-2423012" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2423012.jpg"></div><h2>  Pelmet size and tissue consumption </h2><p>  To calculate the size of a lambrequin, you need to consider the following aspects: </p><ul><li>  The width of the lambrequin should exceed the length of the bar by 25 cm. In this case, the product will have a finished look. </li><li>  If the lambrequin will be folded, the lambrequin width is optimally equal to two rod lengths. </li><li>  Lambrequin has a height greater than the wall above the window (for aesthetic reasons), but depends on personal preferences. </li></ul><p>  How to determine the consumption of tissue in a practical way?  We are considering a variant of a non-rectangular pelmet for the kitchen.  The most difficult part of it is the swag - a semicircle hanging down by the laid folds.  It consists of two parts: a smooth middle and pleated parts called shoulders.  To determine the amount of material, you need to lay out all the patterns, for example, on a sheet or a piece of fabric that you have.  Be sure to stock up on allowances for seams.  Based on the fact that usually the material for the curtains has a width of 2.8 or 3 meters, it will be easy to calculate which footage should be purchased for sewing. </p><h2>  <span>DIY hard pelmet</span> </h2><p>  To create a hard lambrequin you need a frame.  Alternatively, you can use ordinary plywood.  The frame should be covered with doubler, on which there is an adhesive layer.  Doublerin is sold in fabric stores. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kakieshtory.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hard pelmet" class="if uuid-2423033" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2423033.jpg"></div><p>  Before you start creating a hard lambrequin in the kitchen (photo above), you need to draw it on a dense drawing paper in full size, creating a picture across the entire width of the window.  For convenience, you can use graph paper - paper with a printed dimensional grid.  The upper part of the lambrequin always has the appearance of a rectangle, since it is mounted under the ceiling.  The lower one can be formed, as the imagination dictates.  Hard lambrequin can be made of several parts, which are prepared separately. </p><p>  How to make a hard pelmet for the kitchen with your own hands, shown in the video tutorial.  This is something to learn, as designers are predicting an increase in the popularity of hard lambrequins. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="m_q876IukLs" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=60&amp;v=m_q876IukLs" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/2/6/0/7/2607.jpg"></div><h2>  How to sew a pelmet in the kitchen? </h2><p>  Sewing each curtain model in the kitchen is individual.  Of course, the most common and discreet for a kitchen window is a soft pelmet.  It is easy to do it yourself.  To properly sew a curtain with a pelmet for the kitchen, you must first take the size of the window and, based on them and your personal preferences, determine the style of the future curtain.  There are various types of curtains with lambrequins that can be easily made with your own hands. </p><p>  <span>Lambrequin curtains</span> are ideal for classic kitchens.  This is mainly horizontal drapery.  As for the <span>pattern of lambrequins</span> in the kitchen, the simplest one, which the beginning needlewoman will cope with, is rectangular.  It usually consists of one or two assembled rectangles (depending on the size of the window).  Its height is small - about 30-40 cm in finished form.  Sometimes the lambrequin in the upper part of the window is made in the form of a fluffy frill.  This lambrequin looks good with medium-length curtains.  It is carried out quickly and in a modern design. </p><h2>  Lambrequin with folds and folds </h2><p>  The shape of the pelmet for the kitchen can be in the form of a swag with soft folds in combination with a cascade with the same embedded folds.  If you are a beginner needlewoman and are not yet very confident in your abilities, use the prepared lambrequin designs, which are pictured below.  But do not forget that you must transfer them to the fabric according to their size. </p><p>  If you are sure that you will be able to independently develop a sketch of the lambrequin and then implement it - you can wish good luck.  The scheme should be very accurate, it is advisable to use a scale of 1:10.  For example, a 5-meter lambrequin on paper will be 50 cm, which will greatly facilitate the process of creating pattern patterns.  Owners of a graphical editor can execute templates directly on the computer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Soft lambriken cut for the kitchen" class="if uuid-2423292" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2423292.jpg"></div><p>  Having cut out all the details of the lambrequin from the fabric, they should be processed and sewn together.  If there are several swag, you need to start from the middle.  Pin the swag pins to the corsage tape, on which the entire lambrequin is formed, with an overlap step (shoulder) of 15-20 cm. </p><h2>  Fixing a lambrequin to a cornice </h2><p>  To correctly calculate the size of the lambrequin according to the width of the window, you need to decide how it will be attached to the cornice.  A soft lambrequin is attached to the cornice.  Mounting methods can be different: </p><ul><li>  With the help of rings that sew to the top of the curtains and lambrequin. </li><li>  Using hooks on the front strip of the cornice, distributing the lambrequin fabric along the entire length of the cornice. </li></ul><p>  The hard lambrequin acts as the front of the cornice, and on the cornice itself, tulle and curtain are distributed on the hooks. </p><h2>  Some tips </h2><p>  To sew a pelmet to the kitchen with your own hands, designers offer several relevant tips: </p><ul><li>  When choosing material for sewing curtains and lambrequins, do not use photographs instead of real fabrics.  The color of the fabric may be distorted during shooting. </li><li>  In order for the swag to fit beautifully into half rings, they should be cut obliquely to the shared thread.  The angle should be 45 ¬∞. </li><li>  In order for swagi to look beautiful on a lambrequin, their maximum overlap should not exceed the shoulder width. </li></ul><p>  If this article helped to figure out a little how to make a beautiful pelmet for the kitchen with your own hands, then you can safely get to work.  It remains to wish good luck in this interesting matter. </p>
