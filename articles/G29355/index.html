    <h2>  CPU and its characteristics </h2><p>  At the heart of Fly Era Style 3 <strong> </strong>  The MTK6582M single-chip system from the Chinese developer MediaTEC lies.  It consists of four revision cores "A7", which in peak load mode operate at a clock frequency of 1.3 GHz.  Of course, you can not expect unrivaled performance from him.  But to solve most real problems, this is quite enough.  If there is no load on the CPU, the <span>clock frequency</span> is reduced, idle cores are turned off.  In principle, for a mid-range device, such a processor is more than enough.  From this we can conclude that this smartphone model is focused on this particular niche.  Based on this, we will consider the remaining parameters of Fly Era Style 3. </p>

    <h2>  Graphics subsystem </h2><p>  The graphics subsystem is implemented using the Mali 400MP2 graphics adapter.  This is another plus of Fly Era Style 3. Reviews of the new owners of this smartphone only confirm this statement.  The most productive MTK solutions are equipped with such a graphics card (for example, MTK 6592 with 8 cores on board).  Its performance is enough to solve a wide range of tasks.  The screen size of this smartphone is four and a half inches and can handle up to five touches at the same time.  At the same time, its resolution is 854 pixels in length and 480 in width.  <span>Its optical density</span> is 228 PPI.  Of course, I would like more resolution, but this will be enough for normal and comfortable work.  The type of matrix used in this smart phone is IPS, which is capable of displaying more than 16 million colors.  All this allows you to get a bright and rich picture on the screen of the gadget.  In addition, this smartphone supports a special technology - OZHS.  Its essence is that there is no air gap between the screen itself and the sensor.  This allows you to significantly improve the quality of the picture.  This technology so far only works in more expensive smartphones, and in budget devices it can be found only in this model. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Memory </h2><p>  But with memory, not everything is so good with Fly Era Style 3. The feedback from the owners of this device only confirms this saying.  But this can be understood by looking at the technical characteristics of this gadget.  First of all, you need to allocate RAM, which is installed here only 512 megabytes.  To date, this is clearly not enough for the full functioning of the Android operating system of the latest version with the number 4.4.2 and codenamed ‚ÄúKit-Kat‚Äù.  It is impossible to increase its volume, therefore, we take into account a similar nuance at the stage of choosing a smart phone.  Internal memory in Fly Era Style 3 <strong> </strong>  just 4 gigabytes.  This is the minimum amount that provides a comfortable user experience.  It is divided as follows: </p><ul><li>  800 MB - built-in memory allocated for the needs of the user; </li><li>  1200 Mb - occupied by the operating system; </li><li>  2000 Mb - is designated as ‚ÄúSDCard1‚Äù, it is also used to store user information and to install applications. </li></ul><p>  If desired, this volume can be significantly increased by installing an external microSD card with a maximum size of up to 32 gigabytes.  In this case, the system will automatically assign the name "SDCard2".  If the amount of RAM were 2 times larger, then there would be a well-balanced device.  And so it turns out one serious drawback. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Phone Fly Era Style 3 is equipped with two cameras.  One of them - in 5 megapixels - is located on the back cover of the device.  It also has an LED flash for night shooting.  For higher quality, you can use the autofocus technology supported by this unit.  This is enough to get high-quality images.  It also supports high-resolution video recording - 1920 pixels by 1080 pixels.  The second camera - 0.3 megapixels - is designed to make video calls in networks of the third or fourth generation.  Another possible way to use it is to communicate using special programs (say, skype). </p>

    <h2>  Connection </h2><p>  A rich set of communications from Fly Era Style 3. Reviews only confirm this.  First of all, it is worth highlighting Wi-Fi, which allows you to very quickly receive data from the global web.  To connect other mobile devices of this class in this smartphone is integrated bluetooth.  To charge the battery, as well as to connect to a PC, a standard USB connector is used for most of these devices.  There is also a 3.5 mm jack for connecting mobile speakers or headphones.  In addition to this, a GPS navigation system is supported - its transmitter is installed.  If necessary, you can use the A-GPS system, which is also supported by this device, to more accurately determine the location.  Another plus of this smartphone is support for third-generation networks.  With the appropriate coverage, the data exchange rate grows significantly.  A definite disadvantage is the lack of an infrared transmitter.  But they are so rarely used in practice that this can not be called a serious problem. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Another weak link is the battery of the Fly Era Style 3. Overview <strong> </strong>  without the characteristics of this component will not be complete.  The battery capacity in this device is only 1650 milliamps / hours.  With a minimum load on the phone, this is enough for 2 days of work.  But in case of intensive use it can be stretched for 6 hours.  It is unlikely that the owners of this gadget will load it so much.  Therefore, this cannot be considered a significant drawback. </p>

    <h2>  Housing </h2><p>  Something noteworthy is the case of this smartphone.  Yes, and you can‚Äôt expect this from the device in the middle price range.  This is a regular candy bar in a plastic case with a touch screen.  In the lower part there are three key buttons: the menu, the main screen and the previous window.  At the top are the headphone jacks and the charging socket (you can also connect to a PC with it).  On the right is the on and off button, and on the left is the volume increase and decrease.  On the back side below is an external speaker.  The second, for conversation, is located above the touch screen.  At the bottom is a small microphone hole.  Three body colors are available: white, black and blue. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  From the position of the operating system, it compares favorably with competitors of Fly Era Style 3. The instruction on the manufacturer‚Äôs official website states that the latest version of the Android OS is supported with serial number 4.4.2.  In the middle segment of smartphones, only a few devices can boast of such.  Often, potential users do not pay significant attention at this point.  But in vain.  After all, this avoids many problems related to software compatibility.  Utilities of social services (for example, Facebook) are also preinstalled.  That is, after purchase, the device is immediately ready for use.  You can connect to the Internet and start chatting.  And there is no need to look for applications in the "Play Market". </p>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  In addition to the small amount of RAM, there are no more serious flaws in Fly Era Style 3. Price <strong> </strong>  while it is today a little less than five thousand rubles.  If the above disadvantage is not critical for you, then you can safely purchase a perfectly balanced device at a very affordable price.  Moreover, in terms of performance, it is not inferior to competitors. </p>
