One of them is Kostroma, with a population of just over 300 thousand people.  Many residents change their usual city apartments for country houses.  The cottage village "First" for permanent residence offers just such an option. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Village &quot;First&quot; (Kostroma) customer reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/1727331.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The location of the village </h2><p>  The village is successfully located within the city of Kostroma, which automatically gives its residents the opportunity to obtain state registration.  In addition, this zone is called promising for further development. </p><p>  You can get to the village both by personal and by public transport.  From the city center you need to go along Rabochy Prospekt, which goes into River.  The latter, in turn, will lead directly to the village.  About 2 years ago, from the village of "First" to the village of "Volzhsky" with a 15-minute interval, a bus began to run. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cottage Village &quot;First&quot;" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/1727330.jpg" width="600"></div>

Also, the developer provides for many land plots sold for individual residential development.  Why is it recommended to use the First Village (Kostroma) for the purchase of country houses?  Customer reviews - those who have already become the proud owner of an apartment or a plot - are mostly positive.  In total 1300 apartments are planned for sale: from one-room to three-room. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Village &quot;First&quot; prices" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/1727326.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In addition to residential buildings and land, the village provides for the availability of necessary social infrastructure.  This is a gym, a pharmacy, a bank and a post office, a store.  It is planned to build a kindergarten and a school.  To control the safety of the inhabitants of the village, access control, round-the-clock security, video surveillance are installed. </p><h2>  Ecological situation </h2><p>  As for the environmental situation, we can only say that of all the new buildings in Kostroma, the village of "First" is located in the most favorable place.  It is located at a sufficient distance from the city center and all industrial enterprises.  On the way to the cottage village, the road leads through the forest, which allows residents and guests to enjoy clean, fresh air. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The village of &quot;First&quot; (Kostroma) reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/1727328.jpg" width="600"></div>

The developer provided for the construction of low-rise buildings for several families;  their exact number is 55. For those who do not plan to immediately begin construction or do not want to build a house at all, land plots with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãsix hundred square meters or more are for sale. </p><p>  In addition, the construction of a gym, a police security post, bank and communication departments, a pharmacy, a cafe, a shop, a kindergarten and a school are planned on the territory of the village.  For them, a special triangular-shaped section is allocated.  Some facilities will be located in the center of the village. </p><p>  The settlement ‚ÄúPervyi‚Äù (Kostroma) has also collected positive customer reviews regarding the layout of the entire land plot.  The developer competently placed residential buildings, social infrastructure and land for sale on the territory.  Everything is in a general access area with good transport interchange. </p><h2>  Construction Features </h2><p>  The village of "First" offers prices for apartments built very affordable.  The low cost of the developer can explain the use of modern construction technology.  The houses are built on a strip foundation, which allows it to be used immediately after installation, without waiting several weeks before ‚Äúshrinkage‚Äù.  This method leads to a significant reduction in operating costs.  There are no marshy soils at the construction site. </p><p>  Then, load-bearing walls are made of concrete panels with insulation, which again saves more time and labor.  Interior partitions in apartments are made of drywall.  Ceiling height is 3 meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The village of &quot;First&quot; (Kostroma) without intermediaries" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/1727329.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The developer offers buyers - future owners of apartments, to independently determine the required number of window openings. </p><h2>  Interior decoration </h2><p>  The village of "First" (Kostroma) also earned positive reviews in connection with the decoration produced by the developer.  Two-chamber double-glazed windows with a rotary-folding mechanism, sashes with micro-ventilation, window sills and slopes are installed.  In addition, in most apartments mounted acrylic bathtubs, faucets, toilets with drain tanks.  Kitchens are equipped with stainless steel sinks.  That is, all the minimum necessary for living by the developer is provided. </p><p>  All houses are connected to centralized water supply;  the apartments are equipped with aluminum batteries capable of regulating the heat supply.  Polypropylene and PVC pipes are also laid.  The developer did not forget about the supply of electricity to residential premises, providing them with hidden wiring, switches and sockets.  Electricity and water supply meters are installed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Village &quot;First&quot; (Kostroma) layout" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/1727754.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  The cost of apartments and land </h2><p>  The developer offers to purchase apartments and land, which the village "First" has, without intermediaries.  This means significant savings for future owners, since there is no need to overpay for intermediaries, real estate agencies.  For example, a two-level apartment of 110 square meters in a 4-apartment building with a land plot of 2.5 acres can be purchased for just 1.5 million rubles. </p><p>  Thus, the village of ‚ÄúPervyi‚Äù (Kostroma) (customer reviews speak of this directly) offers housing on average 15-17 thousand rubles per square meter.  This is possible when purchasing real estate without the participation of intermediary companies.  Mortgage lending at several banks is also available. </p><h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  The village of "First" (Kostroma) customer reviews has both positive and negative.  The latter are mainly associated with the cessation of shares on the value of apartments.  Approximately every six months there was a rise in price per square meter by 10%.  This was due to the implementation of the construction.  Indeed, the price for construction projects is always lower than for ready-made, completed ones. </p><p>  There are many positive reviews of those who already have the happiness of living in the village permanently or coming to rest for the weekend.  This is a convenient location of the village, and the ability to breathe fresh air without leaving the city limits. </p>
