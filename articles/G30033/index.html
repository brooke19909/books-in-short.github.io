  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The main issue of philosophy</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  With the development of man and society, philosophy changed and developed, which acquired new knowledge; therefore, the main issue of philosophy for each philosopher was interpreted in his own way, on the basis of his life experience and views. </p><p>  Thus, F. Bacon interpreted the main question of philosophy as the expansion of human influence on nature on the basis of the emergence of new knowledge and their practical applications. </p><p>  Spinoza and R. Descartes believed that the main issue of philosophy is the improvement of human nature and the conquest of external nature. </p><p>  Helvetius K. A. saw the main issue of philosophy as the essence of human happiness. </p><p>  Jean-Jacques Rousseau argued that this issue should be investigated from the point of view of inequality and find ways to overcome it. </p><p>  The representative of German classical <span>philosophy, Kant,</span> said that the main question of philosophy is the search for knowledge before experience is gained.  I. Fichte, on the other hand, talked about the basic question as the basic propositions of knowledge in all areas. </p><p>  Frank S. L., a well-known Russian philosopher considered from the point of view: what is man and his true destiny.  Camus, the famous existentialist of France, reflected on the value of <span>human existence, is</span> it worth living a life, is it worth it. </p><p>  In Russian philosophy, the fundamental issue of philosophy is recognized as the question of the relation of matter to consciousness, thinking to being. </p><p>  From the foregoing, we can conclude that philosophy differs from other sciences in that it is present in addition to an objective description of the world, there is a subjective view of the philosopher, which gives this knowledge the value of cultural value.  On the basis of this, knowledge in philosophy is not so much abstract theories, but most of all imperative, very personal knowledge. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Philosophers, comprehending being, transmit it through the prism of experienced experience and knowledge. </p><p>  In this regard, there is a problem of philosophical knowledge, which is the question of philosophy - is it science?  to answer this question you need to compare science and philosophy. </p><p>  1. Philosophy, like science, strives for truth through the search for an objective picture of the world. </p><p>  2. A philosophical subject is as objective as scientific subjects, because a person‚Äôs attitude to nature and the outside world is quite objective.  This subject of philosophy, like scientific subjects of research, also needs new knowledge and methods. </p><p>  3. Philosophical truths are verified by all mankind throughout its social development. </p><p>  However, philosophy did not always go side by side with science - in the Middle Ages, philosophy moved away from science and became the ‚Äúservant of theology‚Äù. </p><p>  The peculiarities of medieval philosophy are that in moving away from ancient values, where the truth was sought, in the Middle Ages philosophy relied on Scripture as absolute truth.  So at this time, not a person is engaged in the search for truth, but the truth is trying to master the person.  <span>Medieval philosophy was</span> based on the postulate that a person needs to know the truth not for himself, but for its own sake, since it is God.  And Christ, the unity of the divine and human, is the only representative of this absolute truth.  And the <span>task of philosophy</span> was to find the right paths for the communion of reason with truth.  Based on this, the philosophy of the Middle Ages was called the ‚Äúservant of theology‚Äù. </p><p>  The fight against heresy and intransigence to it can be explained by the fact that tradition is impossible without reliance on authorities.  And the medieval world was completely dominated by theocentrism, which led to stagnation in science, architecture, philosophy and all other areas of human life.  This is primarily due upside down.  Instead of searching for the meaning of his being by man, he was imposed on a being that is divorced from the scientific approach. </p>
