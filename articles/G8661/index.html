It is the main factor in the <span>social adaptation of a</span> person, and it is from her that one should begin to consider how the institutions of socialization influence its development. </p><p>  The following parameters of each individual family influence the quality of living of all family members, the relationship between them, and child development: <br>  1. The demographic parameter - the presence of both father and mother, as well as the presence of children and relatives, their number. <br>  2. The socio-cultural parameter is the level of education of all family members, their active or passive life position. <br>  3. The socio-economic parameter - the material condition of the family, the employment of family members in the workplace. <br>  4. The technical-hygienic parameter is the arrangement of family life, living conditions. </p><p>  The position of the family in society, the psychological atmosphere, the norms and values ‚Äã‚Äãprevailing in it - all these factors govern the relations between its members, <br>  at a subconscious level, they form the perception of traditions, patterns of behavior in children, promote self-realization, or, conversely, impose their priorities. </p><p>  The consequences of the influence of such family functions as ensuring the development of the child (intellectual, emotional, physical,);  formation of values;  the formation of the concept of gender and behavior corresponding to gender;  influence on couple choice and behavior in family life;  development of a level of self-esteem is so significant that it manifests throughout life. </p><p>  The institutions of socialization, which are in second place after the family in terms of influence on the socialization of a person, are educational institutions.  <span>Social upbringing,</span> which takes place in educational institutions, creates conditions that help develop <span>a person‚Äôs abilities,</span> his abilities, forming values, providing knowledge, examples of behavior, relationships, which is very important for the society in which a person lives. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Educational institutions of socialization carry out social experience through: <br>  - the organization of living conditions in the team, living conditions; <br>  - training in teamwork; <br>  - Promoting amateur performance in the team. </p><p>  The education process includes: <br>  - systematic training; <br>  - cultural agitation (this applies to non-formal education); <br>  - motivation for self-education. </p><p>  The organization of education and social experience, their intensity, content, systematicity and forms depend on students belonging to a particular <br>  ethnic group and <span>social group.</span>  The necessary spiritual, emotional and <span>social values ‚Äã‚Äãare</span> brought up in the process of interaction with the teacher. </p><p>  Also, favorable conditions created in educational institutions contribute to the adaptation of students to society, which is accompanied by positive <br>  changes in their personality. </p><p>  The following institutions of socialization, affecting the adaptation of a person in society, are neighbors, neighborly relations.  Neighbors - a group of people living in a very close territory.  The influence of the neighborhood on the socialization of a person depends on the level of his education, age, profession, position in society, and even on the size of the settlement in which he lives.  Children communicate more with neighbors, from preschool to teenage.  By the example of such communication, they gain social experience, master <span>social roles,</span> and generally learn to adapt to society.  In addition, children like a sponge absorb certain stereotypes, norms of behavior, vocabulary, permissions and prohibitions that exist in this environment.  The nature of the socializing role of the neighborhood can be both positive and negative.  Neighboring relations between adults are closer in villages than in cities and no longer bear such a social burden, do not have the same influence as in childhood. </p><p>  Institutions of personality socialization are often represented by peer associations.  A group of peers may include people several years younger or older than each other, but they are necessarily connected by common ideas, values, interests.  The socialization of peer groups consists in familiarizing them with the norms of a given society, its culture, teaching behavior appropriate to the nature of the group, and creating conditions for self-realization of a person. </p><p>  All institutions of socialization of the individual in the complex affect the construction of the social side of the world in human consciousness. </p><p>  In interaction with various agents and factors, the mechanisms and institutions of socialization contribute to the social adaptation of the individual in society. </p>
