The material itself arose along with glass making in Venice.  In the 19th century, almost everything began to bead with beads: ordinary inkwells, handbags, and beadwork became popular.

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="history of beadwork briefly" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39187/991680.jpg"></div>  The history of beadwork, summarized, includes a story about the emergence of the bead itself, as well as the methodology by which it began to produce paintings, dresses, pillows and other household items.  According to a hypothesis, the name itself came from the Arabic ‚Äúbusra‚Äù or ‚Äúbead‚Äù, which meant ‚Äúfake pearls‚Äù.  Over time, it has changed a little, and the name bead-bead appeared.  However, in different countries the name of this material comes from the usual glass beads, which were used for beadwork.  The story tells that the beads of the old sample were significantly different from modern ones in size.  The ‚Äúpearls" of that time were significantly inferior in scale and larger.  Working with a material that had a diameter of 0.2 millimeters was very difficult, for this special delicate games were made.  Sometimes even the thinnest material did not enter, and needlewomen for stitches had to remove the microneedle and put it on again for another puncture of the fabric.

Over the course of a century, it was possible to easily reproduce any drawings, perform paintings, decorate dresses, shoes and bags.  Beads seriously imitated rubies and emeralds, as well as pearls.  In the same century, a wide variety of jewelry, wallets, and dresses that were decorated with beadwork were created.  The history of the creation of paintings gained high popularity, but soon this popularity seriously suffered and completely disappeared.  The beginning of the second revival is the first half of the 20th century, when baubles and hand-embroidered bugles appeared.

The history of the development and appearance of the beads and technology themselves does not affect this at all, just women like to do something with their own hands for themselves and others. </p><p>  Earnings on such products can be quite decent, but only if you really perform something interesting and worthwhile that is not on the modern market, bead embroidery is so unique.
