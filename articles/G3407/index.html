It's time to find out the truth about the true origin of this mysterious find. </p><h2>  Detection </h2><p>  The world learned about the existence of the Kyshtym dwarf Aleshenka thanks to investigator Yevgeny Mokichev.  Investigating the theft of copper wire, he went to the suspect and summoned Vladimir Nurtdinov for interrogation.  After a long conversation, a local resident told the investigator that the body of a real alien was stored in his garage.  Mokichev could not believe in such a wild story, but nevertheless turned to the authorities with a request to verify this fact.  Having received permission, he headed to the indicated place and saw with his own eyes this mysterious alien. </p><p>  Nurtdinov said that for the safety of the creature he had to extract all the insides from the body and dry it to the state of a mummy.  The man did not hide the fact that he simply stole Aysha from Kyshtym from the house of his neighbor, an elderly woman with a mental disorder.  The investigator took an incredible find with him to show to professional experts.  At that moment, he no longer doubted that the dwarf was of extraterrestrial origin.  It looked too unusual and had a specific smell.  An experienced policeman knew how a person‚Äôs mummified body smells. </p>

    <h2>  Appearance of Kyshtym Alyosha </h2><p>  The mummy of the dwarf was a semblance of a small mutilated body with a disproportionately large head.  It is worth noting that the skull itself had only 4 plates, and not 6, like a normal person.  Outwardly, he looked like a premature baby, but Samoshkin immediately rejected this version of the pathologist.  First, the creature had strong bones, not cartilage, like embryos.  Secondly, he had a complete set of teeth.  There was no navel on the body, which indicated that he was not born by a woman.  The expert did not find any hint of the genitals or organs of secretions.  It seems that all the waste products of the Kyshtym Alyosha released through the skin.  The dwarf's head resembled an onion and was crushed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Who and when found the Kyshtym dwarf? </h2><p>  Pensioner Tamara Prosvirina began to feel anxiety and desire to go out on a late May evening.  An unknown call pulled her by the gate into the forest.  There she saw a creature that lay on the ground and made mournful sounds.  A woman picked it up and took it home.  She gave him a name in honor of the recently died grandson - Aleshenka. </p><p>  Caring Tamara went with the find to the hospital to find out why this baby looks so strange.  In the clinic, they pointed to the door and lamented that there was nothing for doctors to treat people, and she brought them an alien for examination.  It sounds a little wild, but do not forget that it was 1996.  The restless woman went to the police, but there she was given a turn from the gate.  No one was interested in a strange-looking baby in diapers. </p>

    <h2>  New house </h2><p>  The pensioner returned home and began to care for the creature, like a child.  She fed him food from her table and later claimed that the alien was very fond of chewing toffee.  He did not know how to speak, but he let out a whistle with which he expressed his emotions or needs.  The mucus that Aleshenka secreted through the pores of the skin, she wiped with a wet cloth.  The new tenant lived in the house a little more than two weeks. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A woman more than once went for a walk with him and showed her neighbors this strange humanoid.  People were horrified, but with interest examined the funny alien.  In one of the conversations with the neighbors, she mentioned that she wants to register Alyosha in the apartment.  This rumor quickly reached the ears of direct heirs, and they rushed to eliminate this problem.  The orderlies took the woman to a psychiatric hospital, and after some time the alien died at the hands of local alcoholics.  His head was crushed.  After Tamara was taken to the hospital, unreliable people filled her house.  They did not like the strange neighbor, and they simply killed him.  Then Nurtdinov found him. </p>

    <h2>  Further developments </h2><p>  After it was found that the creature does not belong to the human race, the criminal case of his murder was closed.  The most Kyshtym dwarf Aleshenka was taken home by an investigator and placed in a freezer.  However, the wife began to resent the fact that a corpse was lying in her refrigerator, and the man had to give the body to murky personalities, who introduced themselves as researchers of paranormal creatures. </p><p>  A few years later, the woman found out how many thousands of dollars foreigners offer for a dwarf, and very regretted her behavior.  The further fate of the alien is covered in darkness.  It was not possible to find those people, and it remains only to guess where the Kyshtym dwarf Alyosha is now located.  The mystery of its origin is still of interest to millions of people. </p>

    <h2>  Research </h2><p>  Thanks to the video shooting conducted by the investigator, the story received great publicity on the Internet.  People began to wonder where the Kyshtym dwarf disappeared and who he really was.  The pieces of fabric on which Alyoshenka lay were subjected to multiple examinations, and all the researchers came to mixed conclusions.  According to some, it turned out that the creature was a premature baby with numerous developmental disabilities, female.  Others claimed that this was a real stranger and no resemblance to human DNA was found.  Perhaps in the future there will be technologies that are likely to establish the origin of the dwarf.  At the moment, this is one of the most mysterious mysteries in history, and interest in it will not fade for many years. </p>
