    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The hotel fully met the expectations of most tourists.  In almost all reviews, people say that their vacation was a success.  I liked everything: clean tidy rooms, staff work, and location.  There are, of course, several opinions that the menu in the bar is scarce, but this problem is solvable, since there are many similar establishments within walking distance.  Although the prices are not low, the food is fresh and of high quality. </p><p>  Girls working at the reception, smiling beauties who are always ready to help.  Most of the guests rated the hotel rooms at a solid "five", and even with a plus.  There were no problems with wireless Internet either. </p><p>  Sochi residents can easily and quickly get to the center of Sochi.  Within walking distance is the free Albatros Beach, which, although municipal, is quite well-maintained.  In fifteen minutes you can reach it, however, some did not like the expensive way back uphill. </p><p>  By funicular you can get to the beach of the neighboring sanatorium Zapolyarye.  In addition, guests of Olympus can use its infrastructure - playgrounds, a gym. </p><p>  In general, tourists from the hotel had only good impressions.  They recommend it, and they themselves, as they say, will be happy to come here again. </p>
