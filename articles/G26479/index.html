Moreover, we’ll start thinking about all the nuances and it is advisable to start collecting information long before the expected date of departure.  This approach will allow you to find the most economical flight option, get acquainted with the features of the culture and history of the country that you plan to visit, as well as choose the best option for your stay.  Many tourists consider the last point to be one of the most important, because your impressions of the whole vacation will depend on how satisfied you are with the hotel.

    <h2>  Location, Territory </h2><p>  Most tourists who have chosen the "Citin Garden Resort" (Pattaya), from the very beginning knew about the features of its location.  Therefore, those guests who, in their reviews showed dissatisfaction with the remoteness of the hotel from the sea and the city center, simply inattentively familiarized themselves with the information about it.  So, according to our compatriots, the nearest beach can be reached in 10 minutes by tuk-tuk.  You can also take advantage of the free shuttle service provided by the hotel.  So, a minibus leaves the Citin Garden building every hour, bringing everyone to the Pattaya pier.  But here you have to go back already under its own power. </p><p>  To the city center, guests can also take a tuk-tuk ride.  In addition, many tourists vacationing in Thailand prefer to rent a motorbike.  It costs quite a bit, but gives travelers the freedom of movement. </p><p>  In the vicinity of the Citin Garden Resort there are several cafes, restaurants, massage parlors, tour agencies, souvenir shops.  Also nearby is a large shopping center and a night market. </p><p>  As for the own territory of the Citin Garden Resort 3 * hotel, reviews of which we are considering, then it, according to tourists, is, although small, but very well-groomed, green and beautiful.  It has a small pool with jacuzzi and a sun terrace.  So guests can always have a good time, sitting on a comfortable sunbed in the shade of sprawling trees and palm trees. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="citin garden resort 3 south pattaya" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1083430.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The cost of living in the Citin Garden Resort includes breakfast only.  According to the hotel guests, they are quite acceptable.  So, breakfasts are held in the hotel restaurant in buffet style.  Vacationers in the morning can eat two types of soup, meat dishes, toasts with jam, several types of rice, stewed and fresh vegetables, fruits, pastries, juice, milk, coffee and tea.  Especially tourists praise pineapples.  According to them, these fruits here are always very tasty. </p><p>  During the day, hotel guests can have lunch and dinner both in the "City Garden" restaurant, and in one of the cafes in the vicinity or in the center of Pattaya.  Here you can find establishments not only with traditional Thai, but also with European and even Russian cuisine. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  As already noted, the Citin Garden Resort 3 * hotel is located at some distance from the sea.  As for the <span>beaches of Pattaya,</span> in general, according to tourists, you can relax on them, but for many they seem too dirty.  Therefore, most travelers prefer to go to the nearby islands.  The most popular in this regard is Koh Lan.  You can get to it from the pier, which can be reached by minibus from the hotel.  From here every half hour ferry leaves to Koh Lana.  There are several beaches on the island.  According to vacationers, they are all very clean, with a fine white sand.  The sea here has a beautiful turquoise color.  There are cafes and bars on the island, so if you wish, you can either have a bite to eat or refresh yourself with your favorite drink. </p>
