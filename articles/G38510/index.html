Its official name is M4 Don.  It is also possible to get to this city by rail and by plane. </p>

    <p>  Novorossiysk is a large city.  It is located in the Krasnodar Territory, on the Black Sea coast.

However, this is not all that he can boast of.  The city has a rich history and many attractions.  His story began in 1838.  Until that moment, the territory where Novorossiysk subsequently appeared often passed from hand to hand.  Initially, it originated as the Greek city of Bata.  It happened in the V century BC.  e.  Then, in the II century, it was destroyed and conquered by nomads.  At the end of the 15th century, it passed to the Turks, and until the 18th century was in their possession.  In 1829, these territories were transferred to Russia, and, after some time, this wonderful city appeared here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now Novorossiysk is known for its nature.  Many people come here every year, despite the fact that the city itself is not a recognized resort.
