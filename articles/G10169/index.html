Paper Butterfly Patterns</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  At a certain moment, every person, both an adult and a child, thinks about changing the place in which he lives.  However, the means to fulfill such a desire are not always there, and sometimes I don‚Äôt want to completely change the interior.  After all, it is long and rather painstaking. </p><p>  An optimal and relatively inexpensive solution to this problem may be decorating the space of a separate room or the whole house with various applications.  For example, if you want to bring lightness, airiness and pleasant memories of summer into the atmosphere of a room, you can decorate it with butterflies.  How to cut these marvelous creatures from improvised materials is described in detail in the article. </p><h2>  How to prepare a template </h2><p>  Decor elements, which are based on butterflies, have long been used by designers to create beautiful interiors.  In the current paragraph, we invite readers to explore an option that is noteworthy in that it is very easy to bring it to life at home.  Moreover, all family members, even the smallest, can be connected to work.  They will also not only be interested and fun to cut butterflies, but also useful.  Indeed, in the process of creating original masterpieces fine motor skills will develop, which, in turn, contributes to the development of the brain.  Although, by analogy, you can prepare any of the butterflies proposed in the article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sielamaistinga.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to cut a butterfly stencil" class="if uuid-2615018" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2615018.jpg"></div><p>  So, if the reader decided to try out the option presented above, he should first prepare a butterfly template for cutting out of paper.  It is very easy to do.  It is only necessary to print the proposed image on a printer or: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  open a picture on the entire computer screen; </li><li>  attach an album sheet to it; </li><li>  redraw the contour with a pencil; </li><li>  then cut the silhouette of the butterfly using scissors. </li></ul><p>  Moreover, it is important to consider that it is most convenient to carry out a craft if each member of the family has his own template.  Then the work will go faster and more fun. </p><h2>  Colored paper butterfly </h2><p>  The materials from which you can make various silhouettes to decorate the interior can not be counted.  There are quite exotic ones among them, we will definitely tell about them later, but for now we will tell the reader how to cut butterflies from colored paper.  After all, this option is considered the simplest. </p><p>  The previous template can be taken as a basis, however, in this case it is better to arrange a large composition of many silhouettes.  Under this, designers are advised to highlight the whole wall.  For example, in this way you can decorate the area above the bed or another part of the house.  It all depends on the wishes of the owners.  Some craftsmen create a large silhouette from small butterflies.  And, I must admit, such a craft looks very impressive. </p><p>  There can be no strict color guidelines.  After all, this question also determines your own taste.  However, designers are still advised to cut the silhouette of butterflies from plain material for colorful walls and, conversely, for monochrome ones - from color. </p><div class="photo" data-original="medadvicees.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to cut an openwork butterfly" class="if uuid-2615130" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2615130.jpg"></div><p>  If the reader wants to make one butterfly, but very original, he should take as a basis an openwork template. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to make a carved butterfly </h2><p>  Many beginner needlewomen find it difficult to figure out how to make an openwork silhouette.  After all, any awkward movement can mash or tear a butterfly.  However, in reality there is nothing to fear.  After all, you just need to use the right tool in the creative process.  Of course, it‚Äôs much easier to purchase a favorite silhouette of a carved butterfly in a store.  But only in this case, you can encounter another problem - the lack of the desired template.  Because even a very extensive assortment, presented on the shelves of a supermarket, does not allow you to find the most necessary and suitable thing. </p><p>  So, if the reader is interested in how to cut an openwork butterfly, then this process is further illustrated in detail.  To make it clearer, just look at the next picture and carefully consider both the tool and the technology. </p><div class="photo" data-original="medadvicees.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to cut a lace butterfly" class="if uuid-2615132" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2615132.jpg"></div><h2>  Corrugated Paper Butterfly </h2><p>  The studied creatures, which are made of a cellulose-based canvas that are folded, look very airy and light.  At the same time, the needlewomen have the opportunity to perform amazing openwork butterflies, using only scissors.  The only nuance is that corrugated paper is very thin, and manicure scissors are more suitable for working with it.  After all, others can damage or completely ruin a fragile structure. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  So, how to cut a beautiful butterfly from corrugated paper: </p><ol><li>  Material should be prepared.  This is not only folded paper, but also plain color.  You will also need stationery and manicure scissors, a pencil and PVA glue. </li><li>  Then prepare the stencil.  However, it is important to draw the reader's attention to the fact that the butterfly will consist of two parts: openwork and ordinary.  And templates should be done on both options. </li><li>  Finally, we transfer the carved silhouette to the corrugated paper of the selected color, and simple to color. </li><li>  We cut both parts and connect them together, lubricating with glue on the body. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="hogyan-kell.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to cut a butterfly pattern" class="if uuid-2615373" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2615373.jpg"></div><h2>  Newspaper butterfly </h2><p>  To realize the next original idea, one of the most accessible materials will be required: an unnecessary press.  In the interior, such butterflies look, as they say, simply, but with taste.  Therefore, they are usually placed in the living room to give the room sophistication.  How to cut out a butterfly from a newspaper is described in detail below.  In the meantime, consider a few design ideas. </p><p>  So, the designers note that with the help of paper silhouettes you can select or beat a certain area.  Therefore, you should carefully inspect your home.  Is one of the walls lost against the others or does it look empty?  That is what needs to be filled.  But you shouldn‚Äôt be too zealous.  The best option are compositions that do not exceed a meter in diameter.  However, if there is a staircase in the room, then you can decorate it completely.  It is best to make butterflies plain and certainly from the color of the contrasting shade of the structure. </p><p>  Well, now let's move on to the instructions on how to cut out a butterfly from a newspaper.  In fact, she is quite simple.  It should be clarified that silhouettes of different sizes look the most spectacular.  They can be made according to the stencil presented at the end of the current paragraph.  Then we prepare the material, tools and template.  We cut out the butterflies and collect them into a wonderful composition. </p><div class="photo" data-original="co-nnect.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what and how to cut a butterfly" class="if uuid-2615384" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2615384.jpg"></div><h2>  Magazine clipping butterfly </h2><p>  This method allows you to make brighter and more colorful creatures.  Any glossy magazine is suitable for him.  However, you can even take your own photos.  And then it will be possible to arrange a whole gallery of pleasant memories on one of the walls of his room.  However, to implement this idea, it is more reasonable to choose simple butterfly patterns for cutting out of paper or other material.  Because openwork patterns may not be correctly transferred to the photo or divert attention from the image. </p><h2>  Cardboard butterfly </h2><p>  Another material that designers most often use.  And all because he has a number of advantages.  The main ones are as follows: </p><ul><li>  clarity of the pattern; </li><li>  lack of deformation; </li><li>  the ability to carve more complex ornaments. </li></ul><p>  On the Internet you can find an abundance of photographs of the interior, decorated with dense black butterflies.  Moreover, single copies and whole compositions look spectacularly.  Especially if they are interestingly beaten and fit perfectly into the rest of the ensemble of the room. </p><p>  Designers consider a great idea the one according to which openwork butterflies are illuminated with lanterns.  To do this, you can use the usual New Year's garland, and cut butterflies from cardboard.  How to do this has already been described above.  Remember that it is best to give preference to a stencil of an openwork butterfly.  This will allow the composition to unusually shimmer.  For example, you can pay attention to the following pattern. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to cut a butterfly step by step" class="if uuid-2615165" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2615165.jpg"></div><h2>  Butterfly from unnecessary wallpapers </h2><p>  Another original and fairly simple option is to make the creatures being studied from old wallpapers.  Moreover, you can even attach them to a wall already framed by them.  This will add to her volume, liveliness, unusualness.  Stencils are easy to choose to your taste.  After all, the wallpaper is pretty tough to keep the desired shape and demonstrate the beauty of the openwork. </p><h2>  Butterflies for a nursery </h2><p>  It was already noted earlier that the composition of the marvelous creations studied in the article should be selected for the ensemble of a particular room.  Accordingly, for a hall or a bedroom, monophonic butterflies of dark color can be cut.  But for the room where the child lives, this option will be completely unacceptable.  Because for the baby‚Äôs interior, ‚Äúlive‚Äù paints and textures are more suitable.  This should be remembered when choosing material. </p><p>  In addition, according to many parents, who also at some point in their life were wondering about what and how to cut butterflies from, it is much better to use appropriate stencils for decorating a children's room.  For example, you can take the one proposed below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="galleryforkids.us" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to cut a butterfly for children" class="if uuid-2615138" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2615138.jpg"></div><h2>  Vinyl record butterflies </h2><p>  If you want to create something original and non-banal, you need to use an unusual material, an excellent solution is old vinyl records.  However, you need to prepare yourself in advance for the fact that you will have to tinker with creating a single butterfly for quite some time.  After all, this process is very painstaking.  But the product will turn out very extraordinary. </p><p>  So, how to cut a butterfly from a vinyl record: </p><ol><li>  The first step is to prepare a plate, plain foil, scissors, chalk or a contrast marker.  You‚Äôll have to work with the oven, so it‚Äôs wiser not to bring the kids to work. </li><li>  Spread the foil over the surface of the pan. </li><li>  Put a plate on top on which first outline the silhouette of the desired butterfly. </li><li>  Place the pan in the oven and lightly heat it. </li><li>  Take out and immediately cut out the butterfly using ordinary scissors. </li><li>  Repeat the procedure until the marvelous creation is ready. </li><li>  Finally, reinsert the plate fragment into the oven.  This is necessary so that it softens, then you can give the butterfly the desired shape. </li></ol><h2>  Butterfly made of plastic bottles </h2><p>  From which only craftsmen do not cut butterflies!  For example, you can use transparent or colored plastic bottles.  In this case, it will be possible to get slightly curved butterflies, which from the side will look like alive.  By the way, on plastic you can draw with markers.  And this is the second reason convincing designers to use this particular material to create original decor.  After all, a finished butterfly can be painted as your heart desires. </p><p>  There are no strict recommendations on how to cut a butterfly out of a plastic bottle.  However, it is important to consider the density of the material.  And, accordingly, choose not lace and lace stencils, but ordinary ones.  Cutting them out will be much more convenient. </p><p>  If the butterflies painted with markers seem too simple, boring and mundane, you can ‚Äúarm‚Äù with nail polish of different colors.  For example, take the one with sparkles.  And already they arrange butterflies according to their desire and taste. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vecteezy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to cut butterfly ideas" class="if uuid-2615869" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2615869.jpg"></div><h2>  Tin Can Butterflies </h2><p>  Surely everyone in the house will find several unnecessary iron vessels from carbonated drinks.  Our reader may be surprised, but they can also be used to create original butterflies.  However, when working, it is also necessary to consider that the material is hard and small patterns on it will be practically impossible to cut.  Therefore, it is more reasonable, as in the previous version, to consider a simple butterfly pattern. </p><h2>  Fabric Butterflies </h2><p>  This version of the material is noteworthy in that it has virtually no restrictions on creativity.  Indeed, from the fabric it is quite easy to make a butterfly silhouette or a real applique.  Color, texture, density - all this will allow the fantasy to really go wild. </p><p>  It should be noted that cutting a pattern from fabric is as simple as cutting a butterfly out of paper with your own hands.  The only caveat is that the material can shift when moving the silhouette and when cutting it.  Therefore, it is better to prepare more studs with which you can fix the fabric. </p><p>  Thus, it is very simple to make butterflies and decorate your room, clothes, stationery and many other things with them.  You just need to have a desire, and this article will tell you how to beautifully cut a butterfly out of paper or other material.  Although you can show imagination and come up with your own unique butterfly. </p>
