Characteristics and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Apple is constantly using new and incredible solutions in its products.  No exception - and the recently released iPad, which has become the largest representative of the line.  What is special about the device besides the huge display? </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  As you can see, the company does not like to often change the design of its devices.  Accordingly, the iPad Pro fully imitates its predecessor, with the exception of size. </p><p>  Actually, the dimensions of the device are both an advantage and a disadvantage of the iPad Pro.  Size specifications are almost two times their predecessor.  Large dimensions allow you to work with the device with only two hands.  Having a specialized stylus will definitely make it easier to use your tablet. </p>

    <p>  The front panel has got an incredibly large display, a control sensor and a front-end.  The right side was equipped with a keyboard connector, and the left - with a volume control.  The top end placed on itself a headphone input and a power button, and the bottom - Lightning port.  In the device - as many as four speakers located on the sides. </p><p>  The device turned out not only large, but also quite weighty - as much as 700 grams.  Such a heavy device is difficult to hold in one hand for a long time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Display </h2><p>  Incredible by all standards, the screen received an iPad Pro tablet.  The diagonal of 12.9 inches is consistent even with some laptops.  The size of the display cannot but be admired, but its quality is even more shocking. </p><p>  The device received the highest resolution among the company's products, namely 2732 x 2048 pixels.  To enhance the image, Retina technology familiar from iMac is used.  The essence of the novelty is the uniform transfer of charge to each pixel, and as a result, the screen is illuminated evenly. </p><p>  An interesting novelty was the dynamic frequency display iPad Pro.  Image characteristics are independently tuned, if necessary, from 60 to 30. When playing less demanding content, this feature can significantly save battery power. </p>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Some parameters of the predecessor went unchanged to the iPad Pro.  Camera features are 8 megapixels, as in the Air model.  The pictures are pretty high quality, despite the absence of changes.  Of course, you don‚Äôt have to expect much from the tablet‚Äôs camera, but this iPad is enough. </p><p>  The device also has a front camera.  The resolution of the front camera is 1.3 megapixels.  The front camera, in addition to video calling, allows you to take good pictures. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  The user and four speakers of the device will delight the user.  The sound is clear and will surprise even a sophisticated music lover.  An interesting solution was to give the speakers their roles, they are pairwise responsible for the low and fundamental frequencies.  The sound also affects the orientation of the tablet.  In different positions of the <span>device, the speakers</span> change roles. </p><h2>  Filling </h2><p>  The dual-core Apple A9x processor delivers excellent iPad Pro performance.  Frequency specifications are 2.6 GHz and further enhance the impression of a good "filling".  They also support a high bar and four gigabytes of device RAM. </p><p>  The company released several devices that differ only in internal memory.  On the shelves you can find devices with 32 and 128 GB.  The price requested for the iPad Pro depends on these parameters. </p>

    <h2>  System </h2><p>  The tablet operates under the guidance of somewhat crude iOS9.  Deficiencies in terms of the system are very noticeable on the big screen. </p><p>  Shortcomings begin with the design of the interface.  But if the appearance of the design can be neglected, then the other problem is not.  The built-in programs are quite tolerably adapted to the screen, but third-party applications are not familiar with the big screen of the novelty and can not adapt. </p><p>  In anticipation of system updates, the owner will have to put up with a somewhat blurry and stretched picture. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  Equipped the device with a battery of 10 307 mAh.  The large battery capacity allows you to use the iPad Pro for 11 hours.  As the load increases, time will decrease slightly. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  The price requested for the iPad Pro ranges from 65 to 87 thousand rubles.  The cost depends on the amount of memory and some additional features. </p><h2>  Release date </h2><p>  At first, the release date of the device was set for September, but was postponed.  As a result, Apple introduced the iPad Pro at the end of November 2015.  A small delay absolutely did not reduce the popularity of the device, and even a little cheered on fans. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  Reviews claim that the new iPad is a masterpiece.  The huge screen of excellent quality is ideal not only for work, but also for entertainment. </p>

    <p>  The performance of the device is also up to par.  Naturally, the device is not capable of replacing a laptop, but it will cope with a large number of tasks. </p><p>  Pleases users and a powerful battery that allows you to not depend on the outlet.  Typically, the battery is the weak point of the tablet. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Upset users unfinished system.  With all its merits, the new products of the program do not allow it to open as much as possible. </p><p>  The lack of changes in the camera also looks strange.  Of course, the quality of the photo is on top, but this was also the predecessor. </p><p>  The most unpleasant place for a device is called its price.  Incredibly high cost can scare a lot of fans. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  Once again, the company has surpassed itself.  Not only the power of the device, but also the application of new technologies is pleasing.  Without a doubt, Apple products strive for excellence. </p>
