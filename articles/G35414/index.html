In addition, there is a spacious and convenient parking lot near the stadium, where you can park your car for free and go explore the city center. </p><div class="photo" data-original="stadiumdb.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stadium general view" class="if uuid-2601287" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51659/2601287.jpg"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The address of the Olympic Stadium: Helsinki, Teele district, Paavo Nurmen street, building number 1. You can get here by public <span>transport: tram</span> or bus, or you can walk without haste in half an hour or an hour on foot.  The stadium is located just two kilometers from the central station, two and a half kilometers from Senate Square, and three from the South Port. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="60.18790199999999" data-lng="24.926745900000014" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/5/2/4/7/5247.png"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The stadium was designed in the style of functionalism by two Finnish architects Toivo Jantti and Yurye Lindegren in the early thirties of the twentieth century.  They endowed their offspring with simple, flowing architectural lines and an elegant tower, which became the highlight of the building.  The height of the tower was specially chosen; it repeats up to a centimeter the record (72.71 meters) set at the 1932 Olympics by the Finnish lance thrower Matti Järvinen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The width of the bowl of the Olympic Stadium (Helsinki) is 159 meters, a length of 243 meters.  The maximum attendance (70,435 fans) was recorded during the 1952 Olympics, when the stands were equipped with benches.  Subsequently, the stadium was reconstructed several times, the lighting system was updated, canopies appeared over the central stands, protecting people from rain, benches were replaced with individual seats, which reduced the total capacity to 41 thousand. </p><div class="photo" data-original="stadiony.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Helsinki Stadium from above" class="if uuid-2601284" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51659/2601284.jpg"></div><h2>  History of the Olympic Stadium (Helsinki) </h2><p>  The idea of ​​building a large stadium in Helsinki was formed in the first quarter of the twentieth century, when Finnish athletes announced their bright victories in various competitions.  Finnish sports functionaries raised the issue of hosting the largest international championships and even the Olympics, announcing their readiness to create infrastructure and stadiums for the competition. </p><p>  As a result, Finland received the right to host the 1940 Summer Olympics, and in 1938 the Olympic Stadium in Helsinki was also built.  However, a world war broke out on the planet, the states did not have time for sports, all competitions were postponed indefinitely.  Nevertheless, justice triumphed, the efforts of the Finns were not in vain. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  1952 Olympics </h2><p>  The summer games were held in Helsinki in the summer of 1952.  The opening of the Olympics, the main competitions and the closing ceremony took place at the Olympic Stadium, followed by up to 70,000 people.  The Olympic torch brought to the stadium and lit the fire during the Games. Runner Paavo Nurmi - the greatest Finnish athlete who is still the world champion in the number of Olympic awards among athletes, he has 9 gold and 3 silver awards.  Therefore, it is no coincidence that the stadium is located on Nurmi Street, and in a nearby park there is a monument to this outstanding athlete. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yattane.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Paavo Nurmi" class="if uuid-2601288" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51659/2601288.jpg"></div><p>  The Helsinki Olympics became the debut for the USSR team.

The fact is that the Swede Siegfried Edström, who was the president of the IOC at that time, forgot to say the words obligatory in the closing speech: “I declare the Games of the Fifteenth Summer Olympics closed.” </p><div class="photo" data-original="gbtimes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="1952 Olympic Games" class="if uuid-2601290" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51659/2601290.jpg"></div><h2>  Other sporting events </h2><p>  After the Olympics, the stadium did not stand idle; major competitions continued to be held on it.
