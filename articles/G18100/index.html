    <h2>  Ruza city - general information </h2><p>  To begin with, it is better to get acquainted with the village itself.  As already mentioned, the city has a rich history.  And this is not surprising, because it was founded in 1328.  Over the entire period of its existence, a lot of events took place here.  Ruza received the status of a city in 1781. </p><p>  This settlement is located in the west of Moscow, the distance between them is about 110 kilometers. </p><p>  It is worth saying a few words about the population.  According to data from 2016, the number of city residents was 13,393.  In general, in recent years there has been a tendency toward a decrease in the population.  Such a process began back in 2013 and continues to this day.  For example, in 2014, 13,554 people lived in the city, in 2015 - 13,419 people.  Thus, we see how the population has declined over the past few years.  The urban settlement has a fairly large territory.  Its area is just over 17 square meters.  kilometers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Be sure to pay attention to local attractions.

    <h2>  Where did the name of the city come from? </h2><p>  Of course, many will be interested in the unusual name of this settlement.  Indeed, one cannot immediately guess what it means.  As in many other cases, several hypotheses were formed about where this name comes from.  Many local historians and historians worked on this topic; as a result, the following main versions appeared.  According to one of them, it is believed that the city of Ruza got its name from the river of the same name on which it is located.  The river, in turn, was originally called the Baltic word ‚Äúrudza‚Äù, which means ‚Äúquiet‚Äù, ‚Äúcalm‚Äù or ‚Äúsafe‚Äù, and then the name gradually came to its modern sound. </p><p>  There is a second version, according to which this word comes from the root ‚Äúrub‚Äù or the word ‚Äúfrontier‚Äù.  This hypothesis has also long been considered as the probable origin of the name of the settlement and river. </p><p>  It is interesting that not far from the city itself there is another settlement with a consonant name - Old Ruza.  This is a very small village.  The population is a little more than 200 people.  The name, which received the Old Ruza, has a similar origin. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Thus, we learned why the city has such a name and where it comes from. </p><h2>  Culture and Attractions </h2><p>  Of course, it is worth considering in detail such an important component of the city as objects of cultural heritage.  Undoubtedly, there are a great many of them.  This is mainly due to the rich history of the village.  It is worth separately discussing many local attractions.  Ruza boasts various cultural monuments.  There are several famous churches here, for example, the Resurrection Cathedral, the Intercession Church, as well as some others.  We will consider them in detail a little later. </p><p>  There is also a museum of local lore, where many rare exhibits are exhibited.  Interestingly, this institution is one of the oldest museums in the entire Moscow region.  It was opened at the beginning of the 20th century, in 1906.  Another interesting object is the Museum of the History of the City Police.  Here you can see a large number of unique exhibits.  Now we have learned what Ruza can boast of.  <span>The Moscow region</span> includes many cities, each of them is unique in its own way.  You should definitely visit these places to get to know their history and get acquainted with the culture of your country. </p><h2>  Resurrection Cathedral </h2><p>  Going to Ruza, be sure to visit this wonderful place.  The Resurrection Cathedral has a difficult history.  The exact date of its construction is unknown.  It is believed that it was founded before the beginning of the XVI century.  During the Time of Troubles, it was almost completely destroyed. </p><p>  The new church was moved to another place.  It began to be erected during the reign of Peter I, on his orders.  Construction went on for quite some time.  It lasted from 1713 to 1721.  During its existence, the cathedral was rebuilt and changed its appearance several times.  For example, in 1859 a large-scale reconstruction was carried out here, and the church began to possess many features of the <span>pseudo-Russian style.</span> </p><p>  However, after the revolution, in 1925, the building was closed, some of its elements were dismantled.  Almost until the beginning of the XXI century there was a sports school for children.  Not so long ago, in 2009, the church was restored, and it again became a real decoration of the city.  Now you can see a lot of people visiting the Resurrection Cathedral.  Ruza boasts many beautiful churches, but this place has its own special charm. </p>

    <h2>  Church of the Intercession </h2><p>  Another famous object in the city is the Intercession Church.  Its history has many similarities with the history of the Resurrection Cathedral.  Accurate data on the date of its construction also does not exist, but it is known that in 1624 it was badly damaged.  However, in 1644, its reconstruction began. </p><p>  The church building, which can be seen now, dates back to 1781.  Then it was made in a style that combined the features of both Baroque and Classicism.  We can say that this is a kind of transition from one style to another. </p><p>  In 1933, the authorities decided to close the temple.  Its premises began to be used for other purposes.  In the 80s of the XX century there was a museum of local lore.  In 2000, its status was restored to the temple; large-scale reconstruction began.  On its lower floor is now a museum. </p>

    <h2>  Church of Demetrius of Solunsky </h2><p>  Probably, many have heard of such a wonderful architectural monument as the Baroque Dmitrievskaya Church.  This is a wonderful temple, which, like other churches in these places, was destroyed during the siege of the city by Polish troops.  It happened in 1618. </p><p>  After such events, many parishioners tried to help in this process, by 1678 funds were collected for the restoration, and it took place.  More than 100 years later, in 1792, the church building was erected, which can be seen now.  The building is baroque. </p>

    <h2>  Church of Boris and Gleb </h2><p>  It is impossible to ignore this wonderful monument of architecture.  As it became clear, the city is rich in various attractions.  Ruza amazes many who come here with their beauty.  Of course, it is worth a little talk about the church of Boris and Gleb.  It has existed since ancient times, the exact date of its foundation is unknown.  During the Time of Troubles, it was destroyed; in 1666, its restoration began.  At the end of the 18th century, the construction of the temple that we see today began.  The building was built using the main features of the Baroque style. </p><p>  In the 30s of the 20th century, the church, like the others, was closed.  A cinema was organized here.  Now the temple has returned its status, but it is still used for other purposes. </p>
