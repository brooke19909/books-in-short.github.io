    <p>  Meanwhile, the history of this attribute is interesting.  According to legend, a pumpkin is a symbol of a restless soul, wandering in the dark and lighting its way with embers smoldering inside. </p><p>  So how to make a pumpkin out of paper so that it is the embodiment of this attribute of Halloween?  Now we will tell. </p><p>  If there is no real at hand, then its role can be perfectly performed by a pumpkin made of paper with your own hands.  There are several ways to make such crafts.  In any case, with a creative approach to creating things, she will decorate the house and create the mood of the holiday. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Interesting product </h2><p>  The first such craft is a Halloween paper pumpkin with a surprise.  You can make it in the case when it is designed to perform two functions: decorations for the home and boxes with refreshments for children.  In this case, for its manufacture you will need two sheets of paper of orange and green color, a pencil, adhesive tape, scissors. </p><p>  The orange sheet must be cut into strips of two and a half centimeters, mark the middle by bending, fold two strips on top of each other at an angle of 90 degrees, and fix with adhesive tape.  Then do the same with two more strips and already impose on the previous ones at an angle of 45 degrees, fixing everything with the same tape until the strips end.  After that, put a sweet surprise and connect all the ends of the strips at the top, also connecting with adhesive tape.  From green paper, make a decoration in the form of a cheerful ponytail and leaflets, attaching them also with adhesive tape.  That's it, the Halloween paper pumpkin is ready. </p><h2>  With a button </h2><p>  Such a voluminous pumpkin, similar to a real one, can be made using another technology.  To do this, prepared strips must be sewn together, using an ordinary button as a fixative.  When the strips are tightly fastened together, it remains only to gently push them in a circle, while hiding inside it the same sweet gift.  Then you should decorate the craft with eyes and mouth and add a tail made of green paper. </p><h2>  From rolls </h2><p>  How to make a pumpkin out of paper?  There is another manufacturing method.  For this craft cardboard rolls from toilet paper or from paper towels are suitable.  The roll must be cut into four identical strips (if it is a roll of towels, then there will be eight), after folding it in half.  Then they should be painted in the desired color and glued together.  Then, in a circle, one long strip should be launched, connecting all four ovals together.  Decorate the craft with a green paper tail, eyes and mouth.  Having completed several of these crafts, combining them into one garland, you can, for example, decorate the front door. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Volumetric </h2><p>  Not only a room, but also a festive table for Halloween can transform paper crafts.  A pumpkin made on the principle of voluminous notebooks in the form of fruits can also become an original decoration in this case.  It is necessary to cut six identical circles out of paper of the desired color, fold them diagonally and glue the inside with each other in a circle.  In the resulting sphere, you need to trim the bottom so that a pumpkin shape forms.  Then you need to glue the tail to it.  That‚Äôs it, the Halloween paper pumpkin is ready.  As you can see, everything is done simply. </p>
