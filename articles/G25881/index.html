And the island of Crete is recognized as such.  This piece of sushi (the fifth largest in the Mediterranean and the first in Greece) is the birthplace of the Cretan Pelasgians (Minoans).  The creators of island civilization have performed many architectural and sculptural wonders, almost completely absorbed by the flood caused by the eruption of a volcano on Santorini.  However, today modern Greeks have built many other beauties here.  First of all, we are talking about hotels.  One of them is called Anemi Apart Hotel 3 *. </p>

    <h2>  Crete in ancient Greek and tourist myths </h2><p>  As you know (from the folklore of the ancient Hellenes) Crete is the ‚Äúisland of Zeus‚Äù and the birthplace of the labyrinth palaces (fused into a single block of houses where the Minotaur allegedly ate its victims).  This island is the "forge" of Theseus' exploits (who freed the Greeks from the symbol of Crete - the "bull-man").  Therefore, the ‚Äúbusiness card" of the modern island is the remains of one of the described structures (it is located in Knossos and attracts tourists from all local resorts). </p><p>  By the way, about the tourists.  They also born a kind of mythology.  The same Crete occupies an important place in it.  For example, it is mistakenly believed that there are most hotels in Europe and the cheapest car rental in the world.  This is not true.  However, there are reasons for the appearance of this error: Crete is the most developed infrastructure object of modern Hellas.  This is the only location in the country where the expression "Greece has everything" fully proves its worth.  This expression also applies to Chania County. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Stalida: elderly or mummies with children have a rest here </h2><p>  Once the center of the Minoan civilization was bought by the rich <span>Venetian republic</span> from the crusaders <span>.</span>  Crete became her vassal, receiving the title of kingdom.  The prosperous inhabitants of eastern Italy established a provincial administration center here.  It became Kania - a large port near Heraklion (the northern coast of the island).  Nowadays, modern Chania is known as a unique place with traces of a unique Greek-Venetian culture. </p><p>  Wikipedia says nothing about the resort of Stalos (Stalis).  On the Internet, only holidaymakers remember him.  Many of them made up a certain opinion about this patch: it is recognized as a "rest zone".  There are no night clubs.  The number of beach bars is limited, and souvenir shops, on the contrary, are exceeded.  It is important that in the season, authorities block one of the two roads crossing this settlement.  The main advantage of Stalida is its proximity to the natural tract "Platia Rumeliotaki", as well as the masterpieces of Greek-Italian architecture (it takes 10-15 minutes to get to Chania). </p><p>  And then there is the "Breeze". </p><h2>  The legend called "Apartments" Veterok "" </h2><p>  This name was given to a small network of <span>family hotels that</span> appeared in several areas of Crete and Cyprus.  One of them - Anemi Apart Hotel - is located in the tourist area of ‚Äã‚ÄãStalos.  A Greek family from Heraklion, joining forces and capital, opened it in 1998, offering visitors excellent views from the windows and geographical convenience.  After 10 years, the apartment complex was reconstructed and significantly rebranded. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  The family center of hospitable Greeks is located very favorably </h2><p>  Anemi Apart Hotel 3 * hotel (Stalida) is located on the second line, however, it is only a minute's walk from the sea (the resort village is so crowded).  The institution is immediately discovered from the Kato Stalos highway.  In just 30 minutes you can get to the international airport in Heraklion - the capital of Crete (distance - 29 kilometers).  Another (small-town) road leads to the aforementioned reserve.  The estate is surrounded by idyllic cafes and touching family mini-markets.  The outskirts of the noisy (therefore popular among Russians) resort of Mallia is 1 kilometer away.  There are many bus stops on the highway (routes number 29 and number 30 pass here). </p><h2>  Anemi Apart Hotel - a 3-star lighthouse in the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãbeach tourism </h2><p>  According to the reviews of many guests, ‚ÄúVeterok‚Äù in Stalos received its 3 stars not in vain.  His housing stock offers several classes of accommodation.  The plan of the guest villa resembles a rectangle - different chambers of different levels surround the courtyard - with a columbarium and summer furniture (necessary for receiving a continental breakfast and morning coffee).  Near the tables there is a small stage (sometimes animators and musicians come to the hotel).  Everywhere pots with flower arrangements.  The architecture of the hotel is simple, but very bright and ergonomic, and communications since 2008 meet all the requirements of a modern hotel infrastructure.  The facade of the building (as well as the tables) is protected by awnings from the sun, therefore it is impossible to sunbathe here even in the midst of a summer day.  The hotel buildings have three to four floors.  Around the pool there are sun loungers and hammocks hanging, immersing guests in complete relaxation ... </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Numbers one are better than another </h2><p>  Anemi Apart Hotel 3 * receives positive reviews for its affordable and comfortable rooms.  There are three types of rooms in the buildings - Studio, 1-Badroom and 2-Badroom.  The first is a two-story space with a sleeping and dining area, not separated by walls.  This is 35 square meters, filled with inexpensive cozy furniture (including additional), as well as a spiral staircase.  Two other types - 10 "squares" smaller (the latter is divided into 2 sleeping areas and is designed for 4 people).  Each room has a kitchen.  In the end, we can say that a guest of any class can count on: </p><ul><li>  separate bathroom with shower; </li><li>  bed; </li><li>  stand; </li><li>  exit to the balcony (from Studio - to the terrace); </li><li>  air conditioning; </li><li>  refrigerator; </li><li>  electric kettle; </li><li>  a microwave; </li><li>  electric stove; </li><li>  kitchen sink; </li><li>  tableware for several people; </li><li>  paid wireless Internet (the network is caught even on the beach); </li><li>  <span>coffee table,</span> chairs and cupboard (in Studio); </li><li>  safe (paid service). </li></ul><p>  No TVs.

Cleaning is done in good faith; no comments on this matter are necessary. </p><p>  Smoking is strictly prohibited in overnight stays.  The transfer is carried out by representatives of a Russian tour operator company that has been cooperating with the hotel since 2014. </p><p>  Tourists also note that in the territory there are: </p><ul><li>  an elongated outdoor pool measuring 50 square meters (fresh water, a bridge was built in the middle, the swimming pool is surrounded by lights); </li><li>  car parking for 1-2 cars; </li><li>  gym; </li><li>  relaxation area with a pool table. </li></ul>

    <h2>  A memorable but non-distracting interior </h2><p>  The interior design of all rooms corresponds to the style of strict Mediterranean classics.  This is an exquisite combination of black, white and pastel brown tones, a clear cage as a pattern on the bedding.  Some chambers are decorated with unpretentious masterpieces of arts and crafts and small paintings, which gives them a special charm. <strong></strong></p><h2>  European food with a Greek accent </h2><p>  Anemi Apart Hotel reviews for the food gets varied.  Someone likes everything, someone would like more variety.  But if in general, then the home restaurant (with transparent arches as a roof) by default can offer only light breakfasts.  They are popular with visitors from the countries of the British Commonwealth.  And yet, for a fee, you are available three meals a day "a la carte" (in the manufacture of which the silent hostess-grandmother also takes part).  It is worth noting that eating here is more profitable for ourselves - each room is equipped with a kitchenette.  With its equipment you can prepare breakfast, lunch and dinner with products purchased in the market and in the shop.  There are children's chairs for eating, which, of course, all tourists who come with small children, are attributed to the advantages of the hotel. </p><p>  Some may appreciate the local cuisine in the coastal taverns (they clogged all the roadside curbs from Stalos to Chania).  The food of local restaurants is designed for Europeans, but many dishes have a completely southern Balkan taste.  This, of course, is Greek salad and seafood dishes.  Almost everywhere you can order deep-fried fish and squid in batter.  Resorts, often frightened of such frills, can find on the menu kleftiko - a purely Cretan dish (though the Cypriots claim that it was born from them).  At the heart of this yummy is lamb cooked in an old (in the correct version - clay) oven. </p>

    <h2>  Chania's beaches can be explored half day </h2><p>  The nearest swimming pool to Anemi Apart Hotel 3 * (Greece) is Ariadna Beach (the edge of the coast here really resembles a constantly curving guiding thread - leading from Kato Galatos to Agia Marina).  The beach is safe for children and the elderly.  It is wide, coarse-sandy, has a mid-depth entry into the water (and closer to Agia Marina even shallow water begins).  It is clean (to Malia itself, in which morning archaeological excavations and night discos are held).  The place is equipped with sun loungers and sun protection umbrellas along its entire length.  Recreation provides a lot of entertainment for young and adult fans of active water recreation. </p><h2>  In the homeland of the evil Minotaur, the kindest ... car rental </h2><p>  Customers of the Stalos Anemi can be convinced of one thing (characteristic of Crete).  Nearby (along the highway) there is a car rental with fairly affordable prices.  Cars here produce small cars, customer requirements - like everywhere else in the European Union. </p>

    <h2>  So different reviews </h2><p>  Anemi Apart Hotel 3 * (Crete) reviews receive both positive and negative.  Unfortunately, citizens accustomed to increased comfort consider the hotel a cramped ‚Äúplace for the picky,‚Äù a hostel, or even a ‚Äúpioneer camp‚Äù.  For some reason, many of them focused on the ceiling web and the lack of shelves above the double bed ... They recognize the courteous silence of the staff for stiffness and indifference to the guests.  However, even stingy people indicate a number of advantages of the hotel related to its strategically advantageous position.  Another recognized plus is the administrator Galina.  This is an attentive Russian woman.  The hosts hired her for a reason (in summer, Russians are the most numerous hotel guests). </p><p>  Anemi Apart Hotel (Crete) receives warm and friendly reviews for its affordable prices, the strictest cleanliness and pleasant service features.  They talk about free room service services and a fully equipped kitchenette.  The employees of the guest shelter look favorably against the guides from the Russian tour operator sending fellow countrymen here.  Nobody praises them ... </p><p>  People who want to know the heart of the Greek tourism infrastructure - Crete (while spending an acceptable amount of money), Veterok apartments will come in handy. </p>
