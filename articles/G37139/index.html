Tourists reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Vietnam is a country striking, first of all, with amazing natural beauty.  Numerous reviews from tourists who visited this exotic place are full of admiration.  Everyone has a lasting impression of viewing unique architectural complexes, the picturesque <span>bay of Ha Long, its</span> two thousand islands, beaches with warm sand and the azure surface of the sea.  All this makes a truly unforgettable vacation in Vietnam, the prices of which depend on the season. </p><p>  Diving enthusiasts will love the rich underwater vibrant world.  Developed infrastructure, designed to provide maximum comfort for divers, and low equipment prices make the South China Sea very attractive for diving. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest in Vietnam prices" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/714113.jpg" width="400"></div></h2><h2>  Vacation in Vietnam </h2><p>  This original country with an ancient culture and history, picturesque landscapes, a favorable climate and wonderful beaches is open for holidays at any time of the year.  For those who like a fascinating but unusual vacation, it provides many options for hanging out. </p><p>  Mountain resorts, for example, Dalat, which was built by the French colonialists as a sanatorium for the elite, rich and picturesque vegetation, gentle sea, dense jungle, an abundance of rare flowers, lush gardens, temples drowning in greenery, and much more can surprise Europeans inexpressibly, coming to Vietnam.  Hotels of 4- and 5-star categories, many of which are located on the coast, have massage rooms and SPA-complexes, which are based on unique healing clay. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Many people choose holidays in this exotic country, as it is famous for its alternative medicine. </p><h2>  Cost of tours </h2><p>  Holidays in Vietnam, prices for which in May and June are much lower than for the New Year, are quite popular among Russians.  The cost of tours in December is one and a half to two times more expensive.  More recently, this destination was considered exotic, but today you can meet tourists from all over the world.  Everyone wants to touch the amazing culture of this Asian country, taste its amazing cuisine, and just have fun. </p><p>  For example, in Nha Trang, departing from Moscow at the end of April, a room in a three-star hotel for ten days, with breakfast, will cost about 30 thousand rubles per person, while in Fantien for two you will need to pay about 39 for six nights with the same type of food thousand </p>

    <p>  And although tours to Vietnam are sold all year round, nevertheless, you need to choose a season for a holiday based on the preferences of travelers.  Throughout the country there are two distinct periods: rainy and dry. </p><p>  In the south and north, rainfall begins in May and lasts until October; in the central regions, the rainy season falls on from August to January.  In autumn and spring, the weather in Vietnam is unstable, and from October to the end of the year, the coast is often hit by typhoons.  Therefore, the best time to come to Vietnam (numerous tourist reviews confirm this) is the time period from January to early August. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Vacation in Fantete </h2><p>  This is one of the most suitable places in Vietnam, designed for a measured and relaxing holiday.  The city, which recently turned into one of the main resorts in the south of the country, is located two hundred kilometers from Ho Chi Minh City and a three-hour drive from Saigon.  This was made possible not only thanks to the long white beaches and the unique microclimate, which, in fact, is known throughout Vietnam.  Phan Thiet, whose hotels offer excellent service, is good for relaxing all year round.  Here you can combine a beach holiday with a tour of local attractions - numerous pagodas, <span>Cham towers</span> - the heritage of ancient civilization, as well as the Center, on whose territory is the largest statue of the reclining Buddha. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tourists reviews" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/714119.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Ecotourism is also well developed in Phan Thiet: tourists can visit the mineral healing springs, amazing lakes and, of course, travel along the white and red dunes.  This beach town is ideal for families.  Apparently, therefore, the flow of tourists so increased precisely in South Vietnam. </p><h2>  Phan Thiet: hotels </h2><p>  Most of them are built in close proximity to the sea.  A series of hotels, which are mainly three- and four-star, stretches along the entire coast from Phan Thiet right up to Cape Mui Ne.  Almost all of them have their own beach with free sunbeds and umbrellas.  Many upscale hotels offer their customers accommodation in bungalows and villas.  There are much fewer hotels in the city center than on the coast.  One of the best hotels in Phan Thiet - Blue Shell Resort 4 * is not an exception, which will be discussed later. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  The hotel is located right on the beach, ten meters from the beach.  Nearby are the picturesque sand dunes of Mui Ne, Linglong Pagoda.  The nearest airport of Nyachanga is a hundred and ninety kilometers distant. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vietnam Phan Thiet Hotels" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/714115.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel, built in 2012, has its own beach and a fairly vast territory, completely green.  Palm trees are seated between the bungalows so densely that they create a continuous natural shade and a fence between neighboring buildings. </p><p>  Blue Shell Resort has its own free parking, which does not need to be booked in advance.  It has a small business center, a left-luggage office, concierge services, and laundry facilities.  In addition, a doctor‚Äôs office and safe deposit boxes are available. </p><p>  At the 24-hour reception you can send or receive a fax, order a taxi, rent a car or motobike.  Upon check-in, guests receive a map of the hotel area, a list of services and a restaurant schedule. </p><h2>  Housing stock </h2><p>  Blue Shell Resort 4 * - a small hotel.  It has a total of 22 rooms in the following categories: nine Bungalow Garden View, six Bungalow Pool View with sea views, three Superior Garden View, two Family Villa Garden View and one Beach Front. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, this new hotel is ideally renovated and equipped both in the housing stock and in public areas, as well as in the territory.  The rooms have excellent expensive furniture and original interiors. </p>

    <p>  Judging by the reviews, the vast majority of our compatriots are delighted with the rest. </p><p>  A lot of positive words about the rooms: they are well equipped, there is absolutely everything for a comfortable pastime.  The pool from the bungalow is only 20 meters away, but when such a gorgeous sea and a convenient beach are nearby, not many people want to swim in an artificial pond.  The hotel does not offer entertainment for children, it does not have spa centers and other similar services, but, according to many travelers, this is rather not a minus, but a plus that promotes relaxation and peace. </p><p>  Many admiring memories of the restaurants located next to the hotel, in particular about Madame Dean, located 50 meters away.  The staff of Blue Shell Resort 4 * works very smoothly, instantly solving any problems.  On the tour, many recommend going with a Russian-speaking guide. </p><p>  In general, our compatriots were very surprised by the low prices in restaurants.  Excursions carried out on comfortable buses are also inexpensive.  In a word, impeccable quality, excellent prices - many people will remember such a vacation forever. </p>
