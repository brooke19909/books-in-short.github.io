From the first minutes, the sights of this place fascinate literally everyone.  Why?  Experienced travelers claim that there are actually a lot of prerequisites for this, because in the modern world it is quite difficult to find settlements in which history and modernity, fishing and numerous recreation areas are so successfully intertwined. </p><h2>  The city of <span>Kotka (Finland).</span>  general description </h2>

    <p>  Historians claim that its foundation dates back to 1878. It was in that year that the decision was made on the need to create a reliable and superbly equipped seaport for the entire state. </p><p>  Linguists, in turn, will help to deal with such a name that is quite unusual for a Russian person to hear.  In Russian, Kotka means "the city of Orel."  A very symbolic and, one might say, even a majestic name, in which the founders love and pride for their small homeland can be traced. </p><p>  Today, 55 thousand people permanently live in Kotka.  A town was built near Russia - only 279 km to the border. </p><h2>  <strong>Prerequisites for the construction of the city</strong> <strong><br></strong> </h2>

Its construction was due to the need to build a port, which would play an important role in organizing the supply of timber from Finland.  In order to provide access to <span>sailing ships</span> carrying timber, as well as sawmills, it was decided to lay the port city of Kotka. </p><p>  From the central regions, logs along the Kumiyoki River were rafted to the Kotka area, where there were many sawmills.  After sawing, wood material was exported. </p><h2>  What is modern Kotka </h2><p>  Today, Kotka is of great importance in creating the conditions necessary for the export of wood materials abroad.  But that is not all. </p><p>  Now it is also one of the largest Finnish cargo ports, occupying a leading position in the country in the field of transit traffic.  It is also known far beyond the borders of Finland, because ships are dispatched all over the world, and the quality of local wood is valued even across the ocean. </p><h2>  <strong>Towards Solitude and Peace</strong> </h2>

    <p>  It should be noted that if Finland still has a place that can strike the imagination of even the most sophisticated traveler, it‚Äôs Kotka.  The sights of this city are mainly aimed at getting acquainted with the history, culture and traditions of the population living in it.  For example, here you can look at a real fisherman‚Äôs house, which today is a museum with unique exhibits. </p><p>  The history of its construction is known for certain.  The amazing nature of these places fascinated the Russian emperor Alexander III, who decided to build a house here where the royal family could be accommodated. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The interior of this house is carefully preserved for a long time.  Study, kitchen, living room, wardrobe - all rooms look the same as a hundred years ago!  Near the house is a magnificent park. </p><p>  The river, which flows near the city, is rich in salmon.  A log house is maintained in good condition, and <span>fisheries</span> are being maintained <span>.</span>  Everything, like many, many years ago. </p><p>  A visit to this fisherman's house allows you to get a vivid sensation from touching the beautiful nature of Finland. </p><h2>  Real Maritime Museum </h2><p>  In Kotka there is a huge maretarium.  This building is the pride of the inhabitants of the city.  Many <span>marine inhabitants</span> live here in their natural environment.  It is difficult to imagine that today in the Maretarium there are already more than 50 species of fish.  And this, of course, is not the limit. </p><p>  Indoors, two aquariums are placed at once.  The large depth is 7 m. However, there are no coral fish familiar to such establishments, and it is not worthwhile to look closely.  But the individuals that are found in the Baltic Sea are represented. </p><p>  Zander, whitefish, pike, roach, tench - this is not a complete list of the inhabitants of these wonderful aquariums.  Water for their filling is taken in the Gulf of Finland. </p><p>  By the way, you can feed large carps and perches directly from your hands, plunging into the depths with special equipment.  Not only fish live in the Maretarium.  You can also observe here frogs, newts and water snakes, which fall asleep in winter.  There is a sea shop, you can buy souvenirs if you wish. </p><h2>  Contemporary Exhibition Center Vellamo </h2>

    <p>  The Vellamo maritime center, which opened in 2008, hosts many exhibitions.  You can buy souvenirs from the kiosk located here, and relax in the restaurant and cafe. </p><p>  The center has its own pier, which has a museum-icebreaker Tarmo, built back in 1907.  This is one of the oldest icebreakers on our planet.  By the way, to the delight of both young and adult visitors, you can climb it and stand on the captain‚Äôs bridge.  It is also recommended to go down to the internal rooms in order to fully get acquainted with the arrangement of the engine room. </p><p>  In a nearby hangar, visitors are happy to see a patrol boat, a rescue boat and a collection of boat engines. </p><h2>  Kotka.

    <p>  The wonderful nature of Finland attracts many travelers.  At any time of the year it is amazingly beautiful in the Sapokka water park.  This environmentally friendly object is recognized worldwide as a wonderful creation of stone. </p><p>  Many are interested in why the park has such a name, and what attracts a huge number of tourists here.  The fact is that Sapokka Park is surrounded by bays.  In shape, they resemble a boot, in fact, therefore the place got its name - Sapokka, which in Russian means ‚Äúboot‚Äù. </p><p>  And they come here in order to enjoy the unique nature.  For example, there is a waterfall with a height of 12 m. The water of the spring collapses with a roar, and then it flows in streams and falls into picturesque ponds. </p><p>  Not everyone knows that the park has an exhibition where a variety of natural stones are presented.  Finns are very fond of Sapokka and believe that this place is beautiful at any time of the year.  In summer, the park has amazingly fragrant air.  In autumn, visitors seem to be in a fairy tale - plants are so beautiful, acquiring a typically bright color for this time of year.  <span>In winter, tourists</span> admire the silence of nature. </p><p>  Going for a walk in the park, do not forget to take a camera with you.  ‚ÄúThe sapokka.  Kotka.  Finland ‚Äù- a photo that must decorate your family archive. </p><h2>  Section 9. Center for Wooden Architecture </h2>

    <p>  Finland also has a unique center where you can get acquainted with wooden boats in detail.  The goal of the creation of this center is to popularize the culture of manufacturing wooden floating equipment. </p><p>  In this center, they not only restore, but also make boats.  Training of future masters is also held here.  It should be noted that everyone is allowed to watch their work. </p><p>  Kotka on the map of Finland is fast enough, which, however, is not surprising, the country is small.  The city is positioned and promoted at various tourist exhibitions, because maintaining traditions is very important for Finns who are extraordinarily proud of their crafts. </p>
