Programs for breaking CCTV cameras</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Own security of CCTV systems is one of the discussed, but solved problems.  Experts in this field, trying to circumvent programs for hacking CCTV cameras, miss the simplest methods of circumventing them, being carried away by effective methods of fighting.  Of course, the anti-vandal domes calmly tolerate any damage, but no one bothers to ban them with stickers. </p><p>  On the Internet you can find many instructions on how to quietly disable a CCTV camera and effectively resist shooting without resorting to high costs.  What methods can be resorted to and what to use - we will share below. </p><h2>  Who and why might need a camera out of order? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.cnet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mini cctv camera" class="if uuid-3182309" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3182309.jpg"></div><p>  Target audience, as a rule, are potential violators of the law, which can be prevented by video surveillance.  Vandals and hooligans destroying cells - entertainment and psychological relaxation, for the organizers of terrorist attacks and other criminal acts - the opportunity to evade responsibility. </p><p>  You should not discount ideological fighters with video surveillance - their motivation, as a rule, lies in the ideology based on the postulates that the use of cameras not only does not lower the level of crime, but also interferes in the private lives of citizens without good reason.  An additional argument often cited by fighters is the creation of social injustice and hostility between different sections of society. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Camera sealing </h2><p>  A simple but effective way to disable a video surveillance camera is to glue or cover its lens.  For this purpose, any paint, adhesive tape, stickers, plasticine or a substance similar in consistency is suitable.  The effectiveness of this method is small.  In addition, the availability of the camera is a gross error of the installer. </p><p>  However, you can close the lens with a banal putty ball released from a school slingshot.  For the same purpose, an ordinary stone may be suitable, however, this will lead to damage to property, which can only aggravate the situation of the offender if he is caught. </p><p>  The most original option is to pour liquid glue into a plastic bag and, having unwound it on your finger, run it into a video surveillance camera for the street.  However, it requires high accuracy and considerable experience;  if he still succeeds, then the sticky bag will not be removed from the lens soon, and this time is enough to crank up the dark tricks. </p><h2>  Paint coating </h2><div class="photo" data-original="h11dfs.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="programs for hacking surveillance cameras" class="if uuid-3182312" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3182312.jpg"></div><p>  This method has a large radius of action, but requires the use of certain equipment.  The most effective option is a water gun fueled with paint or a paintball gun.  Experts who talk about how to disable a CCTV camera recommend using water-based emulsion paint and pistols with a removable high-capacity tank.  It is advisable to dilute the dye before pouring, otherwise high viscosity may adversely affect the range of the gun and jam its mechanism. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Cut wiring </h2><p>  The most obvious way to not shine on the video is to interrupt the transfer of data to the monitor.  This can be done quickly, simply and efficiently by cutting the cable. </p><p>  Any sharp object, preferably with insulated handles, is suitable for this purpose in case a voltage cable of more than 36 volts goes to the camera. </p><h2>  Laser beam exposure </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.nhpr.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to inconspicuously disable a surveillance camera" class="if uuid-3182314" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3182314.jpg"></div><p>  One of the high-tech options for how to disable a CCTV camera.  An intense beam of light directed into the lens leads to the exposure of the sensitive element, which partially or completely covers the image with a spot.  Not all cameras can cope with this effect - even those that have a wide dynamic range.  The laser pointer will be perfectly visible on the record, but the figure of the person directing it will not. </p><h2>  Jammers </h2><p>  In addition to the banal ways to disable cameras, there are technological ones.  One of them is special devices that can block the action of tracking devices.  Such jammers interrupt the transmission of the image, jamming the broadcast signal. </p><p>  The action of the devices is mainly aimed at the Wi-Fi of a surveillance camera, however, some technicians are able to assemble devices that interfere with the operation of wireless channels. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The principle of operation of such devices is simple - the channel of the camera signal becomes clogged with a lot of interference, which leads to its failure.  Interrupted recording will be restored after a reboot, but the image is not saved. </p><h2>  Hacking Surveillance Cameras </h2><div class="photo" data-original="learncctv.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable the cctv camera" class="if uuid-3182315" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3182315.jpg"></div><p>  It is not so easy to disable a mini-video surveillance camera using special software.  Hacking IP cameras, as a rule, is not aimed at breaking them, but at intercepting and viewing the video stream. </p><p>  You can only support remote access to a specific camera through a specific browser.  The video stream is also carried out in different formats, respectively, to view it, you will need to install plugins. </p><p>  From a theoretical point of view, IP cameras are protected by two means: IP address and account password.  In practice, an IP address is not considered an effective method of protection: it is easily tracked by a standard address, and all cameras respond identically to requests from search robots. </p><h2>  Hacking webcams </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.networkworld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="surveillance cameras for the street" class="if uuid-3182320" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3182320.jpg"></div><p>  Webcams operating through a universal driver are often referred to as UVC-compatible.  How to disable this type of surveillance camera?  It is easier to do, since it uses a documented standard protocol.  However, access to the webcam requires control over the computer with which it is synchronized. </p><p>  Technically, you can access UVC cameras on Windows computers through DirectDraw filters, camera drivers, and VFW codecs.  How to disconnect a surveillance camera?  It is enough for beginners to use the so-called "rat" by modifying it.  Such programs are remote administration tools and are presented on the Internet in a wide range.  There are not only backdoors, but also legitimate utilities, which optionally change in which you need to automatically receive a request for remote connection and minimize the main window to crack the camera.  The rest of the process falls entirely on the shoulders of social engineering. </p><h2>  Infrared and laser radiation </h2><div class="photo" data-original="camera-source.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable the camera" class="if uuid-3182323" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3182323.jpg"></div><p>  <span>Laser radiation,</span> as mentioned above, not only illuminates the camera matrix, but also allows you to act on it.  To disable mini-surveillance cameras, different methods can be used: </p><ul><li>  The combination of powerful sources. </li><li>  Radiation of visible long waves. </li><li>  The use of infrared diodes. </li></ul><p>  Infrared diodes can burn optical sensors and camera arrays. </p><p>  Unfortunately (or fortunately), modern models of surveillance cameras are equipped with infrared filters, which not only increase the quality of shooting, but also protect them from direct exposure to identical rays.  The technique independently eliminates the harmful effect, which does not allow an attacker to achieve the desired result. </p><p>  An equally effective way to stop image transmission with the creation of a light spot is to direct the burning diode toward the lens.  In theory, everything is easy, but in practice it is practically impossible to implement. </p><p>  The last method is the emission of a long visible wave.  For this, a powerful laser is sent to the lens for 20 minutes, placed at a certain distance from it. </p><p>  This method brings a natural result, provided that the light source has a power sufficient to overcome the protection of the camera.  The most effective in such a situation is a green laser. </p><h2>  Magnetic radiation </h2><div class="photo" data-original="learncctv.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wifi cctv camera" class="if uuid-3182317" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3182317.jpg"></div><p>  A magnet is another way to disable a CCTV camera.  But it does require access to the open part of the cable;  the method is implementable, but requires compliance with several conditions. </p><p>  The main thing is that the strength of the magnetic field must be either very large or unstable, sufficient to interfere with the operation of the camera. </p><p>  The camera turns off as follows: </p><ul><li>  An open wiring section is detected through which data is transmitted. </li><li>  A powerful magnet remains on it for a certain time period. </li><li>  The first effect of magnetic radiation will be noticeable after thirty minutes - interference will appear, after which the image will disappear, and data transfer will stop. </li></ul><p>  When hacking, it should be borne in mind that there is a variety of IP cameras equipped with special protocols aimed at protecting data transmission.  Their job is to eliminate errors and broadcast images even in the presence of strong interference.  Now you know what are the ways to disable cameras.  During installation, they must be taken into account so that attackers cannot bring harm to your property. </p>
