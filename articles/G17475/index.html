    <h2>  Terminology </h2><p>  Essentially, the word method has two meaningful meanings. </p><p>  First, a method is a method of theoretical research or practical implementation.  In this sense, it is perceived by scientists.  For example, the empirical (i.e. based on experience) or the <span>deductive method</span> (from general to particular).  It is worth noting that these examples are methods of cognition, which is only one of the areas of methodology. </p><p>  Secondly, a method is a way to act in a certain way, a variant of an action chosen by one or another person / organization, etc. For example, management, control, manipulative methods. </p><p>  It is also important to note the fact that both meanings correlate with each other: thus, definitions begin with the word ‚Äúmethod‚Äù, which is a very general synonym for ‚Äúmethod‚Äù.  Then comes the clarification: the method of what exactly?  These are two important elements that make up a method. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kinds of methods" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32075/1046967.jpg" width="600"></div>

In this definition lies the key to one general definition of the method. </p><p>  That is, a method is what helps to organize activities.  But it is nevertheless customary to take as a basis two different definitions that are delimited, presented a little higher in the previous paragraph. </p><h2>  Tasks and Features </h2><p>  The method should be correlated with reality, with those properties and laws that reality carries. </p><p>  The need for methods arises from the task of accumulating and transmitting social experience.  The early stages of cultural development already contained the beginnings of methodology.  But only when the need for formalizing the rules and norms of activity was clarified, they began to develop it in a conscious and purposeful way. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="social methods" class="if" height="460" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/36882/1046913.jpg" width="528"></div>

    <h2>  The historical development of methodology as a science </h2><p>  Methodology has long been included in the context of natural philosophical and logical representations.  Moreover, it represented the philosophical <span>foundations of scientific and cognitive</span> activity.  Therefore, first of all, the definition of the method as a way of cognition arose. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  From this point of view, various philosophers at different times classified methods in their own way.  For example, before the spread of German classical philosophy, only two types of methods were distinguished: rationalistic and empirical.  But the limitations of these areas were subsequently criticized.  The nature of the methodology itself also remained unclear: from mechanical to dialectical.  After analyzing the structure of Kant's teachings, constitutive and regulatory principles were identified.  Some categories have been studied and presented by Hegel. </p><p>  However, under the gunpoint of philosophy, methodology could not achieve specificity, remaining a set of points of view. </p><h2>  Twentieth Century: Reforming Ideas on Methodology </h2><p>  In the twentieth century, methodology began to encompass a specialized field of knowledge.  In addition, she was given a specific direction: the internal movement, that is, the mechanisms and logic of knowledge. </p><p>  Differentiation began to correspond to the methodology. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="application of methods" class="if" height="292" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32075/1046964.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Classification </h2><p>  The following types of methods are distinguished: </p><ul><li>  Universal, which have their own classification.  Dialectic and metaphysical methods are known. </li><li>  General science, the classification of which is based on levels of knowledge - empirical and theoretical. </li><li>  Particular scientific, or specific, tied to specific areas of science in which they are used or from which they originate.  In other words, the basis for this type is the application of methods in various fields or the development of methods in these areas.  This species has the widest range of examples.  So social methods are directly related to sociology and society, while psychological methods are directly based on the laws of psychology. </li></ul><h2>  Methods and Techniques </h2><p>  A method differs from a technique in the first place by less specificity.  The second is, so to speak, a ready-made algorithm, an instruction for actions.  The same method may be applicable in different cases, while the methods for the most part are narrowly specialized and developed for specific circumstances. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="modern methods" class="if" height="311" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32075/1046966.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Method Evolution </h2><p>  <span>The evolution of methods</span> can be easily traced by the example of the institute of medicine, or rather, diagnostic studies. </p><p>  Modern diagnostics are improved thanks to progress and deepening of scientific knowledge.  At present, such devices and devices are provided that were not available at least fifty years ago. </p><p>  It can be said that modern methods were extremely influenced by such an invention of mankind as a computer.  Moreover, not only as an implementation of some developments, but also for analyzing data that helps to identify logical relationships that have not been noticed before, to reform methods, and adjust them to the current realities of life. </p><p>  A method is a universal tool, method, an essential element of any of the areas.  Methods progress along with scientific knowledge.  The structuring of methodology in the twentieth century contributed to the development of an extensive nature. </p>
