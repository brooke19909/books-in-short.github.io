And on their border appeared the capital of ancient Egypt - the legendary Memphis.  After hundreds of years, the union of these two states did not.  Egypt is again divided.  The capital of Upper Egypt was Thebes, on the site of which is modern Luxor. </p><p>  <strong>Alexandria - the capital of Egypt</strong> </p><p>  Due to its territorial location, Egypt very attracted conquerors, because of which changes took place in the country and new capitals appeared, disappearing with time.  After the Assyrians, the country was conquered by the Greeks and Thracians, led by Alexander the Great. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="capital of ancient egypt" class="if" height="222" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10680/19881.jpg" width="320"></div>  The rule of Egypt was entrusted by Macedonian to his friend Ptolemy.  In gratitude, Ptolemy decided to perpetuate the name of a friend and founded a new city.  Alexandria - the capital of Egypt - became the center of world culture of that time.  Ptolemy's successors succeeded each other.  Here the great Cleopatra ruled, enchanting Caesar with her beauty and mind.  After the conquest of the Greeks, Egypt became a province of Rome, and then for a long time was part of Byzantium.

    <p>  Cairo is not just a big city, but a huge and densely populated metropolis.  More than 14 million people live in this city.  In the architecture of Cairo, there is a mixture of various styles, from ancient to the most modern.  The capital of Egypt, Cairo, whose name means ‚Äúthe city of a thousand minarets‚Äù - is a very beautiful and contrasting city.  Its distinctive feature is the neighborhood of poverty and luxury.  In addition to numerous minarets and architectural monuments, the city has a large number of bazaars with souvenir shops offering goods symbolizing Egypt and its history.  The hallmark of the city and its main architectural attraction is the citadel, which is a <span>defensive structure.</span>  It was built for more than thirty years, and it was ready only by the beginning of the XIII century.  An attraction of the capital of Egypt are its mosques.  Each of them has its own story.
