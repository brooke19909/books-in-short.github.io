Especially if this gift with meaning and promises a good life or good luck in the future.  And even more valuable is embroidery.  Because it is made with your own hands and always with a certain meaning.  A plus is the fact that the master puts his whole soul into the work.  Such a gift can not leave anyone indifferent.  Especially if the picture shows cross-stitch with a cat and a cat. </p><h2>  Is someone embroidering now? </h2><p>  Despite the fact that embroidery is now necessarily included in the comprehensive school curriculum, not everyone knows it well.  A rare schoolgirl will be able to make even a small picture with a flower with a needle and thread, not to mention the cross-stitch of cats.  Masterfully executed works are now very popular and in great demand.  Fashion for embroidered things is back.  But in the modern world it is difficult to imagine a young girl who refuses to meet friends, discos and various entertainments in favor of a monotonous home hanging out with a hoop, canvas and thread. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wisebadger.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cat tea party embroidery" class="if uuid-2869458" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107989/2869458.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, only a few will prefer to sit at home when the rest are having fun.  However, there are lovers of needlework.  And given the fashion for embroidery, modern ladies again took out the hoop from the past, wiped them from dirt and put to use. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Embroidery History </h2><p>  The oldest embroidered items date back to the 5th century BC.  Such ancient canvases were found in China, which is considered the ancestor of all embroidery.  But they invented embroidery even earlier.  Embroidery was still among ancient people.  Sewing themselves clothes from skins, ancient people noticed the unevenness of stitches and decided to decorate clothes with such stitches.  In China, embroidered on thin silk fabrics, depicting natural motifs. </p><p>  Ancient embroideries were found on other continents in various countries.  Of course, each nation has its own way of mastering this, its own favorite colors, amulets, ornaments and motifs, from embroideries of nature landscapes to embroidery of representatives of the animal world.  For example, cats were often embroidered with a cross.  These animals were considered sacred, they were often depicted on fabric canvases.  We can say that embroidery is one of the most ancient types of needlework. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="four cats embroidery" class="if uuid-2869460" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107989/2869460.jpg"></div><h2>  Where to begin? </h2><p>  Embroidery is not a very simple art, but everyone can learn it.

Embroidery of a black cat with a cross is considered very popular. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.stitchkitsgalore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cat embroidery" class="if uuid-2869459" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107989/2869459.jpg"></div><h2>  Cross stitch cats </h2><p>  Cats are a hot topic for the modern world.  Cross stitch cats and cats.  Increasingly, they find many stories and meanings for them.  It is believed that a cat embroidered with a cross brings luck and comfort to the house. </p><p>  These animals in ancient times were sacred, they were even worshiped and protected.

This is a one-color way of doing work, most often using black.  This kind of embroidery is also distinguished by its minimalist plots.  Typically, such paintings depict several objects or only their outlines.  Monochrome is also considered one of the simplest types of embroidery.  It can not be mixed up shades.  And counting crosses is easier when they are the same color.  This embroidery is easy for beginners or students.  There are a lot of motives for such embroidery: figures and shadows of various objects and plants, silhouettes of people or animals. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.es" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Two cats monochrome embroidery" class="if uuid-2869476" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107989/2869476.jpg"></div><p>  Among the various types of embroidery, people often choose a cross, not because its sign protects against evil, but because each person can do such creative work.
