  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Balda": the rules and subtleties of a board game</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In search of a way to pass the time and have fun, many turn to smartphones and computers, preferring to lazily flip through social media feeds or play popular applications.  More recently, in the absence of the Internet and mobile devices, children and adults had fun fighting table and paper games.  A great way for many to remember the past is the game ‚ÄúBalda‚Äù, the rules of which are very simple. </p><h2>  Game preparation </h2><p>  To play the bulldozer you will need: </p><ul><li>  A sheet of paper in a box. </li><li>  A pen. </li><li>  Good vocabulary. </li><li>  At least two people. </li></ul><p>  Draw a square on paper with a side of five cells - this is the playing field.  In the center line of the field, write any five-letter word.  For example, as shown in the picture: </p><div class="photo" data-original="appapka.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="board game rule rules" class="if uuid-3095065" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/115467/3095065.jpg"></div><h2>  The essence of the game </h2><p>  ‚ÄúBalda‚Äù is a linguistic simple game for the whole family, in which you need to make words from the letters on the playing field.  The longer the word, the more points are given for it.  The goal of the game is to score the maximum possible number of points until the playing field is over.  So what are the rules of "Bulda"? </p><h2>  Rules of the game </h2><p>  After the field for the game is prepared, the order of the players ‚Äôturn is determined.  The first player must substitute one letter in the word in the middle of the field so that a new word is obtained.  One letter in a word is equal to one point, therefore, the longer the word, the more points the player receives during his turn.  For example, a player‚Äôs first move might look like this: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="the beginning of the game" class="if uuid-3095075" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/115467/3095075.jpg"></div><p>  The letter ‚Äúk‚Äù, which formed the word ‚Äúblock‚Äù, is substituted for the starting word.  For this word the player receives four points.  The next player must substitute the letter in any place on the playing field to get a new word.  Thus, the game continues until the place ends on the playing field.  The winner is the one who scored the most points.  The rules of the game in the "Balda" prohibit: </p><ul><li>  Use pronouns, proper nouns, prepositions and foreign words. </li><li>  Fictional words.  All words used in the game must exist in dictionaries, and the player who invented the word should be able to explain its meaning to the opponent if he does not know such a word. </li><li>  Compose words diagonally (in the classic version of ‚ÄúBuldy‚Äù).  The word should be read left to right horizontally or vertically, as well as at right angles to adjacent cells. </li><li>  Intersection of words. </li><li>  Use a word that is already on the field, even if there is an opportunity for this. </li></ul><p>  Only one letter can be entered in one cell. </p><h2>  Variations of the game "Balda" </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.dailymail.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="paper rules of the game on paper" class="if uuid-3095116" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/115467/3095116.jpg"></div><p>  The classic rules of the game ‚ÄúBalda‚Äù on paper can be changed by agreement between the players.  For example, players may agree that the letters ‚Äúand‚Äù and ‚Äúth‚Äù, ‚Äúe‚Äù and ‚Äúe‚Äù will be different, they cannot be used twice in different words.  A variant of the game is also possible, where words are allowed to be composed diagonally.  Another version of the modified Balda rules is the ability to go through the cells twice.  For example, the word "count" can be turned into a "bell" if you count the cells first from left to right, and then vice versa.  The size of the field can also be changed depending on the desire of the players.  The larger the side of the field, the longer it will be necessary to come up with a start word. </p><p>  There is a variant of the game ‚ÄúBalda‚Äù, the rules of which are borrowed from the equally popular linguistic game ‚ÄúScrabble‚Äù.  The bottom line is that some cells in the field are tinted with a certain color, and the letter substituted in the colored cell is rated ‚Äúmore expensive‚Äù, making it possible to score more points. </p><h2>  Penalties and Points System </h2><p>  Also, by prior arrangement, changes can be made to the points system.  If one of the players refuses to move due to the fact that he can‚Äôt come up with a word, he gets a penalty point.  Some limit the running time by playing a timer.  After the allotted time for the passage of time, the player is also fined. </p>
