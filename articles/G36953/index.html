The first item is a cape called Tuzla.  But the second location - this is the <span>island of Tuzla,</span> which will be discussed in this article.  The full name of the island is Kosa Tuzla.  The word ‚Äúscythe‚Äù is not accidental in the name, because in the last century this island was really scythe.  An example of such an object today can be a braid called Chushka Spit.  It is she who adjoins the <span>Taman Peninsula.</span>  In 1972, the Tuzlinskaya Spit in the Kerch Strait became the landing site for the Cossacks of the Black Sea army, after which a rapid population growth began, and several dozen farms were formed in a short time. </p><h2>  Tuzla Spit History </h2>

At the beginning of the 20th century, Cossacks farms with pleasure lived here on these lands.  In the early 30s, it was decided to dig a canal, which was necessary for the convenience of passage of fishing vessels.  But after just a month, a very strong storm occurred in these places, as a result of which the small canal turned into a fairly wide strait.  Thanks to this, the Tuzlinskaya Spit has become an independent island.  In the late 40s, the island authorities decided to restore the structure of the former spit.  Thus, a special design was created, with the help of which it was supposed to restore land in a natural way.  Special metal piles with a mesh stretched between them were delivered.  This idea seemed very good, but, unfortunately, the design did not justify itself and collapsed in the first winter.  Thus, the island was given the name Middle Spit.  After its formation, the island became subordinate to the Temryuk district of the Krasnodar Territory.  But soon the dissatisfied inhabitants of the island decided to write a paper on reassignment, and the island became subordinate to the Kerch City Council.  Thus, he was supposed to be part of the Crimean ASSR.

And only after 20 years the borders were completely restored.  But this did not end there, the borders were revised in subsequent years. </p><h2>  The difficult fate of the Tuzla spit </h2>

This time the approach was more thorough.  A whole dam was erected.  The construction initiative came from the authorities of the Krasnodar Territory.  Thus, between the two states, namely Ukraine and the Russian Federation, there was a conflict over the borders of the states.  The bone of contention was the island.  After a meeting of the authorities, the construction of the dam was frozen. <br><br>  In 2005, Ukrainian experts conducted research, during which it turned out that the waves really destroy the island, and soon it may disappear.  After these studies, it was decided to strengthen the island's perimeter with special blocks that will protect it from the effects of waves. <br><br>  In 2014, for certain reasons, the entire Crimean peninsula became part of the Russian Federation, so the problem of the Kerch Strait was no longer relevant for negotiations between the authorities of the two states.  Today, bridges are being built between the spit and the island, which is necessary to preserve a beautiful natural reserve called the Tuzla Spit.  According to preliminary estimates, the bridge connecting the mainland of Russia with Crimea will be completed by 2018.

    <h2>  Description of an amazing place called Taman </h2><p>  Tuzla spit is covered with stones and limestones, has a fairly fertile soil and is sometimes covered with grassy vegetation.  Nature has created an incredible miracle for itself.  The uncut edges of the dam turned into a smooth and wonderful <span>seashore.</span>  They are famous for the Tuzlinskaya Spit.  Rest in these places will not leave anyone indifferent.  The coast is covered with sand from the sea, it is very comfortable to relax here.  There are also small islands on the bay side, where you can also relax, the atmosphere here is wonderful.  Limestone stones, which have brown and yellow colors, are immersed in water; thanks to sea water, they have also acquired green and blue hues.  In the sun, these stones play very beautifully with their color palette. </p><p>  There is a strait between the scythe and the island.  Its course is so fast that the islands that are located at the end change their shape or location during the season.  Such a natural phenomenon is very interesting and exciting. <br>  On the seashore, you can always find a souvenir for yourself, the thing is that often sinks of bizarre shapes and sizes are washed to the shore.  Two similar ones are difficult to find, so vacationers very often take such gifts of nature home.  In particular, such shells delight children.  For a holiday with kids, the ideal place is Taman.  Spit Tuzla, in particular its coast, is strewn with useful minerals, so swimming in these places is very useful. </p><h2>  Rest on the spit of Tuzla </h2>

Its soil is gradually covered with green grass, and every year it becomes more and more.  The rough edges of the dam have long turned into a picturesque beach and have become a great place for a quiet and relaxing holiday.  The small islands on the bay side have become a kind of quiet haven for wild birds.  Stones immersed in water play with a variety of colors in the sun.  Many vacationers take photos here.  This miracle of nature has even become a peculiar visiting card of the area.  In addition to stones and the sea, this area is rich in other wonderful sights.
