  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to get to Aviapark: options and opportunities</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Shopping center Aviapark in Moscow is one of the largest aggregators of stores of absolutely all categories.  Most visitors have a logical question about how to get to Aviapark without unnecessary labor and in a minimum amount of time.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe shopping center is more than 400 thousand square meters, which puts the Moscow shopping center on a par with European ones. </p><p>  Aviapark is located in the Northern Administrative District of Moscow, surrounded by a large number of transport networks.  In 2018, a <span>new</span> Moscow metro <span>station</span> opened near the shopping center, giving a new round to the development of the transport infrastructure of the shopping complex. </p><h2>  How to get on the subway </h2><p>  Visitors to the shopping center should not have questions about how to get to Aviapark by public transport, since there are several options at once.  Among the possible ones are taxis, buses, subways, and trolleybuses. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hockey-palace.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get to the fleet by metro" class="if uuid-2666867" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64080/2666867.jpg"></div><p>  Metro is the most optimal.  In 2018, a new metro line was opened for passengers.  One of the stations was CSKA, which is located within walking distance to the Aviapark shopping center in the middle of the forested area. </p><h2>  How to get to the Aviapark shopping center by car </h2><p>  The shopping center has its own bunk parking.  The cost of parking on it is 50 rubles per hour, on weekdays the first two hours of parking are free. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, how do I get to Aviapark by personal vehicle?  It‚Äôs quite simple, since the shopping center is located in close proximity to the Leningradskoye Shosse, it‚Äôs enough to leave it on Novopeschanaya Street, or Marshal Shaposhnikov Street, without missing it and moving out onto Mikoyan Aircraft Designer Street. </p><p>  From the Third Transport Ring, the question of how to get to the Aviapark also disappears - just turn onto Begovaya Street or Khoroshevskoye Shosse, from where you can make a turn onto Sukhoi Aircraft Designer Street. </p><h2>  Bus as a public transport option </h2><p>  To the question of how to get to Aviapark by bus before the metro station was opened, the answer was unanimous - this is a free shuttle from Begovoy and Dynamo metro stations.  However, subsequently, the traffic was changed and free routes were closed for guests of the shopping center.  Nevertheless, the decision remains how to get to Aviapark by public buses and fixed-route taxis. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fotobus.msk.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get to the fleet by bus" class="if uuid-2666878" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64080/2666878.jpg"></div><p>  Directly in front of the entrance is the stop of the municipal minibus at number 318, next to the Dynamo metro station. </p><p>  In the immediate walking distance from the shopping center there are several more stops where buses under the numbers 175 and 818 make an intermediate stop, which is another option for getting to Aviapark. </p>
