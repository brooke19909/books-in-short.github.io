Compact drones have come to the fore in this niche, but for the most part they are used for practical tasks - for example, aerial surveys.  In turn, the Syma S107 helicopter shows an example of how realistic an imitation of real aircraft models can be.  At the same time, the device offers wide functional capabilities for control. </p>

    <h2>  Model Overview </h2><p>  This modification represents an entry-level segment in the class of GYRO helicopters.  These are devices with gyroscopes that provide the ability to control in three directions.  Using an infrared remote control, the owner can direct the device up, down and around its axis.  The rear propeller is responsible for the coordination of flight, in particular, the displacing center of gravity, which allows movements to be performed in different directions.  However, for complex figures, the Syma GYRO radio-controlled micro helicopter is still not suitable.  It is affected by its small mass and weak power, which is not enough to maintain stability during the supply of sharp rolls.  For the same reason, it is recommended to use the model only in a room where air flows will not affect it.  However, the manufacturer himself notes that the device can be used in open spaces - but, again, in optimal climate conditions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2>

    <p>  When you buy, it may surprise you with a cheap-looking package - an ordinary thin-layer box with a foam backing without any special design effects.  But the content, as a rule, evens out the first impression.  The equipment is very rich for this level of GYRO devices.  In addition to the Syma S107 helicopter itself, the delivery kit includes: </p><ul><li>  IR remote control with three-channel range of flight control. </li><li>  3.7V lithium polymer battery </li><li>  Spare tail screw. </li><li>  USB cable </li><li>  Instruction manual. </li></ul><p>  From this kit, it is important to highlight the benefits of a lithium polymer battery.  This is a relatively new type of battery that compares favorably with the widely used Li-Ion cells in terms of reliability and durability.  As practice shows, the time of complete replenishment of energy in the battery pack takes only 30-40 minutes.  Now we can proceed to a more detailed consideration of the technical and operational parameters of the device. </p><h2>  Main characteristics </h2>

And the developers of the Syma S107 radio-controlled helicopter, of course, gave up some indicators, but against the background of direct competitors, the characteristics of this version look quite worthy: </p><ul><li>  Dimensions of the device are 98 mm in height, 220 mm in length and 38 mm in width. </li><li>  The diameter of the main rotor is 190 mm. </li><li>  The diameter of the tail rotor is 30 mm. </li><li>  Power plant - two electric motors of the N7 format. </li><li>  The range of the remote control is 10 m. </li><li>  Flight time - up to 8 minutes. </li></ul><p>  With regard to energy supply, the equipment with a lithium-polymer element for the helicopter itself was already noted, and the remote control is provided with energy from 6 AA batteries.  The main unit can be charged via a USB cable or directly from the manipulator cable. </p><h2>  Construction and design </h2><p>  The basis of the compact apparatus is formed by supporting aluminum frames.  Also, the frame is made of metal, which creates a feeling of strength and solid structure.  Although the helicopter is assembled from many elements, among which are plastic parts.  By the way, the blades can surprise with their flexibility - it seems that if they fall, they will easily be damaged.  But this is a false impression and all working parts withstand both their own loads and random physical influences.  Of course, if we are not talking about strong blows.  As for the design, the Syma S107 helicopter is distinguished by its bright color performance and high detail for its class.  A choice of versions in red, yellow and green designs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Helicopter modifications </h2><p>  The closest version to the main model is the S107G.  Both devices are almost identical in their operational qualities, but new devices also receive additional functionality.  That is, the reviews of the Syma S107 and S107G helicopters in terms of design will be the same: the same aluminum base, color solutions and flexible blades that provide similar flight capabilities.  However, the new modification also provides the ability to control flight through a mobile device of the iPhone family.  In the package there is a corresponding adapter, thanks to which the smartphone is synchronized with the radio module of the helicopter. </p><p>  The S107C version is also interesting, the principal difference of which is the video camera.  It has already been said that <span>miniature quadrocopters</span> are more often used for shooting <span>,</span> but this design combines the design features of the line of devices and functional additions.  But here it must be borne in mind that the Syma S107 and S107G radio-controlled helicopters against the background of the S107C have a lightweight design, which increases their maneuverability.  Another thing is that the camera can be disconnected and then the characteristics are equalized. </p><h2>  General operating rules </h2><p>  By the time you use the device, you should make sure that the power sources are ready.  The battery must be fully charged and the control panel provided with a sufficient number of working batteries of a suitable format.  Then, frequency synchronization is established between the manipulator and the radio module of the device.  The complete readiness of the Syma S107 helicopter will be indicated by an illuminated indicator - it will turn on after pressing the ‚ÄúON‚Äù lever.  Also, on the remote control itself, the corresponding lamp should light up steadily without blinking. </p><p>  During use, always keep the optical window open.  This is necessary to confidently maintain the signal, otherwise the helicopter will cease to be controlled.  It is not recommended to design the outer surfaces of the case with all kinds of stickers - their presence also negatively affects the quality of signal reception.  If you plan to use the helicopter in the open air, then it is advisable to do this only in places protected from direct sunlight and without the risk of moisture penetrating under the hull. </p>

    <h2>  Flight control instructions </h2><p>  The device should be placed on a flat surface so that it is facing the rear screw to the console.  The launch is smooth - it should be controlled using the toggle switch on the manipulator.  Climbing is done by pointing the throttle stick up.  Conversely, the reduction is performed after pressing the lever down.  Accordingly, to perform rotary maneuvers, the handle stretches to the right or left.  Circular U-turns are performed in the same way.  It should be borne in mind that the Syma S107G radio-controlled helicopter can enter an uncontrolled state during unwinding.  To stop these movements will allow a special trimmer on the joystick.  After its use, the device will freeze in the air in a stable position.  Again, to prevent the risks of third-party exposure to the helicopter, you should initially make sure the safety of the operating area.  Moreover, this applies not only to outdoor conditions, but also to indoor conditions.  There should be no air conditioners, fans or table lamps on the flight deck. </p><h2>  Positive feedback about the model </h2><p>  The device as a whole makes a good impression.  Users appreciate its maneuverability, ease of control and reliability of the design, despite the miniature size.  Parts in the construction rarely require replacement and the build quality itself is not satisfactory.  Customization is also made without unnecessary problems.  According to the owners, in just 3-4 minutes after unpacking, you can organize full-fledged flights.  The workflow itself is stable and well-controlled.  The main advantages of the Syma S107 helicopter in this part are its responsiveness, balance and stability.  At the same time, both children and adults belong to the user audience.  Both groups get rather positive emotions from the exploitation of the model. </p>

    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  The device has a few disadvantages, but they are.  The main one is a modest set of spare parts.  With consumables, search problems may also occur.  Once again, it is worth noting that the model is quite reliable and very rarely needs serious maintenance.  Syma S107 and S107G helicopters are also criticized for their modest performance.  If there are almost no complaints about the mechanics of interaction, then, for example, flight time and remote control distance are not the strengths of this series of helicopters.  But, again, this problem is almost all models of this class.  But the manipulator is already quite serious criticism.  In terms of physical reliability, it is the opposite of the design of the helicopter itself.  The weakness of the controls and poor-quality assembly of the case is noted.  And this is not to mention the use of cheap plastic. </p><h2>  How much is the device? </h2><p>  Perhaps the first place in the list of advantages of this model is to put a price tag.  It is really impressive - the lower bar is 500 rubles., And the upper - about 1,500 rubles.  In the first case, we can talk about auction copies or orders directly from China.  But in both cases there is a big risk of running into a fake.  On average, an inexpensive Syma S107G helicopter or the basic version of the S107 costs 1000 rubles.  For this amount, you can get a very high-quality device at affordable sales sites.  As for the price tags of the level of 1,500 rubles, we can talk about kits with additional accessories and the same consumables. </p><h2>  How to distinguish a fake? </h2><p>  There are several signs that distinguish the original copies of the helicopters of this company.  First of all, it is worth taking a closer look at the quality of the installation of landing skids and the plastic of the fuselage.  Elements must be smooth and firmly fixed, and the material in the original version has no defects or traces of artisanal adhesions.  There is also an opinion that the blade holder with a balancer are made only of metal.  But this is not so - the Original Syma S107, S107G and their distinctive features in this component are precisely expressed in the use of plastic.  Another thing is that these are high-quality elements, and not cheap raw materials.  Fakes often have metal counterweights on the balancers.  In addition, the model‚Äôs copies use a round-shaped and black charging socket, while real Syma helicopters are rectangular and white. </p>

    <h2>  Finally </h2><p>  The device turned out to be very successful, which is confirmed by the practice of its use.  If you plan to choose a model from the initial level of GYRO helicopters, then this solution will be optimal.  Development, of course, is inferior in a number of characteristics to higher-level devices, but such comparisons can hardly be called correct.  Moreover, the price tags will be very different.  Also in the selection it will not be superfluous to determine the most suitable modification.  For example, Syma S107G Helicopter can be considered as a more functional version due to the ability to control via a mobile device. </p><p>  The S107C helicopter is also enriched with new capabilities, the main one of which is camera shooting.  And the basic version of the S107 is suitable for those who rely solely on flying without being overloaded with a third-party option.  But regardless of preferences within the family, it is worth bearing in mind the restrictions on the operation of such devices.  Belonging to the initial class of mini-helicopters not only affects flight performance, but also reduces the possibilities for using the device.  Such models are sensitive to physical interference, so you should immediately prepare for the preparation of appropriate operating conditions. </p>
