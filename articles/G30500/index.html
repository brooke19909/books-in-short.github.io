After some time, he was arrested during the implementation of the Leningrad case.  In 1950, a man was shot because of charges of participating in counter-revolutionary activities and assisting enemies.  After 4 years, he was posthumously rehabilitated.  All members of the family of Aleksei Aleksandrovich automatically came under suspicion, for which they were also arrested.  The girl‚Äôs mother was sent to Taishet camp, and Lyudmila herself was taken to the children's labor correctional colony, where she lived until 1953. </p><p>  The head of the colony, Victoria Nikolaevna, immediately noticed an active and capable girl.  They communicated with each other, and Victoria Nikolaevna did everything in order to give the baby the opportunity to build her life.  Lyudmila Verbitskaya studied at school, and then was able to pass entrance exams at the University of Lviv at the Faculty of Philology.  After her father was rehabilitated, Verbitskaya was able to transfer to Leningrad. </p>

An important place in her works belongs to the problems of the culture of speech, semantics, vocabulary and stylistics. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The woman never rested on her laurels; therefore, in 1965, Verbitskaya Lyudmila Alekseevna defended her thesis, and in 1977 she defended her doctoral work.

    <p>  What else did Lyudmila Verbitskaya leave us?  ‚ÄúLet's talk like Petersburgers‚Äù is a new creation of the philologist, which is devoted to youth slang.  The project is that residents will be able to learn about youth words and how to pronounce them correctly.  To do this, on the streets of St. Petersburg on posters, in the subway, in public transport, etc., posters were hung that contain informative information.  In an interview, Lyudmila Verbitskaya says that this project is aimed not only at city guests, but at all, because for many years they have not known the basic rules.  In addition, she notes that it is very interesting to observe how the language changes. </p><h2>  Awards </h2><p>  Lyudmila Verbitskaya has a lot of awards, so only a few of them will be listed here.  Among the philologist‚Äôs awards are the following: Order of Merit to the Fatherland (all four degrees), Order of Honor, Order of Friendship, Order of the Holy Equal-to-the-Apostles Princess Olga, as well as the title of Honorary Citizen of St. Petersburg. </p>
