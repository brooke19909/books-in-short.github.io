The title of ‚Äúyounger sister of Prague‚Äù was also held by the capital of the republic of Bratislava.  The country began an independent life with the collapse of socialist Czechoslovakia.  And every year it is gaining more and more popularity in the tourist market.  Bratislava is no longer perceived as a stopover in front of a chic Vienna.  This is a completely independent city, charming tourists with its unique family atmosphere and medieval architecture.  What do travelers reviews say about Bratislava?  This article will be devoted to our article.  Read about the <span>sights of the capital of</span> Slovakia below.  The article also provides some practical tips: how to get to the city (Bratislava), do you need a visa for Russians, what are the tours, what to buy, etc. Separately, we consider the climate of Slovakia and prices in the republic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bratislava tourist reviews" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1087638.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is Bratislava located? </h2><p>  Not all capitals are located in the center of the country.  There are those that are from the very edge.  These include Bratislava.  The capital is located on the very border of Slovakia.  Moreover, it immediately adjoins two states: Hungary and Austria.  To Vienna from Bratislava at hand - some sixty-five kilometers.  On a clear day, one capital can be seen from another.  If you look from a tall building, of course.  But to Budapest from Bratislava you need to drive a hundred and eighty kilometers.  And a very large distance between this city and the former capital of the once one state - Prague (330 km).  What is Bratislava‚Äôs first impression?  Compared to other capitals, it does not seem like a metropolis.  It is family-friendly here.  In Bratislava there is no gloss and pathos, but she does not strive for this.  Having once visited these quiet pedestrian streets, I want to return here again.  In a cozy city with the Slavic name of Bratislava ... </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Do I need a visa for the Russians? </h2><p>  Of course.  And not simple, since Slovakia is a member of the European Union and is included in the Schengen agreement zone.  But getting a visa to this country of <span>Central Europe is</span> much easier than to France or Germany.  You can apply for Schengen at the Consular Section of Slovakia.  To do this, you should first fill out an online application form on the embassy's website.  At the appointed time you need to come for the delivery of documents.  If this procedure is burdensome for you, you can contact the Pony Express Visa Application Center.  But it will cost more than the 35 euros that are required for permission to enter Slovakia.  But in the visa center they will help you write an application, take a photo and even carry out the necessary fingerprinting procedure.  A nice bonus for those who are not the first time traveling to a city like Bratislava: a visa for Russians can be ‚Äúmulti‚Äù (for two years or even five years).  Unless, of course, the tourist did not violate the rules of entry or terms of stay in <span>the Schengen countries.</span>  The visa application deadline is about ten business days. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Weather in Bratislava" class="if" height="376" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1087653.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Climate </h2><p>  Slovakia is a country stretched from west to east.  In its northeastern part, high mountains rise - the Tatra Mountains.  So the climate in the country, despite its modest size, is quite diverse.  In Tatranska Lomnica it can snow, and the weather in Bratislava will delight the sun and almost summer heat.  Due to the remoteness of Slovakia from the seas and oceans, the climate in the country is characterized as continental.  True, not the same as in Siberia.  Summer here is not very hot, and winter, although snowy, is not too frosty.  Humidity and precipitation increase as you move west.  Therefore, we can only guess what a rainy city this Bratislava is.  A visa for Russians gives the right to stay in the country for up to thirty days.  Therefore, do not be upset by short-term showers.  Just remember that the highest rainfall occurs in June. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get to Bratislava" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1087637.jpg" width="600"></div>

It will take one and a half days to go from Moscow, and this at a ticket cost of ten thousand rubles.  But the Moscow-Budapest train, which makes a stop in Bratislava, runs daily and takes its passengers to their destination without any transfers.  But there are no direct flights to the capital of Slovakia from Moscow yet.  Many tourists use Vienna Airport for their trip to Bratislava.  But it happens and vice versa.  Experienced travelers choose Bratislava airport as a launching pad for trips around Europe.  This hub is located eight kilometers from the city.  You can get to the airport by taxi (10 euros) or by bus (1 EUR).  The latter runs from five in the morning until eleven in the evening with an interval of fifteen minutes.  This bus to Bratislava airport follows from the railway station through the center of the capital.  You can buy a ticket at the machine at the bus stop, at the station or at the ticket office in the arrivals hall.  As a walking option, you can get to Bratislava from Vienna by ship along the Danube. </p><h2>  Tours </h2><p>  Trips to the countries of Central Europe are very different in price.  If you plan a flight to Vienna airport, a taxi transfer to Bratislava and a weekly stay in a double room of a four-star hotel with breakfast, then the cost of such a trip will be at least five hundred EUR per person.  But the most economical (and therefore the most popular) are <span>combined</span> bus <span>tours</span> of the capitals of Central and Southern Europe.  Warsaw, Prague, Budapest, Bratislava - reviews of tourists say <span>that such a trip is</span> very eventful and gives a lot of interesting impressions.  Bus transportation is mainly carried out only during the day, so that excursionists with fresh strength can explore new cities.  The price of such tours, however, does not include the road to the Ukrainian-Polish border.  Usually trips start in Lviv or in Uzhgorod. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What to see in Bratislava" class="if" height="451" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1087641.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How to get around </h2><p>  Bratislava - reviews of tourists at this point coincide - a very compact city.  Especially its old part, which is mainly pedestrian.  Public transport in Bratislava runs both day and night.  Only at eleven in the evening trams and trolleybuses stop walking, night buses leave the route.  Tickets for city transport can be bought at print booths and at bus stops at vending machines.  Talonchiki do not act like ours - for one trip, but for a while.  You can buy a ticket for 15 minutes, 30, an hour or a half, a day and even a week.  Until the time is up, with a ticket that is composted only at the beginning of the first trip, you can transfer to any type of public transport.  On weekends, passengers have a bonus - a prolonged ticket.  A taxi in a city such as Bratislava, tourists are advised to order reviews by phone.  So the trip will cost less (from three to five euros instead of 8-10). </p><h2>  Hail </h2><p>  To the question of what to see in Bratislava, all tourists, without saying a word, give one answer.  Castle Castle rises on a slope right above the gradually floating Danube.  This fortress arose more than a thousand years ago and at first it was the core of the city, a settlement.  By the eleventh century, people began to inhabit the banks of the Danube, and the burgade turned into a full-fledged castle, which was inhabited by the family of the feudal lord and his garrison.  <span>Bratislava Castle</span> acquired its current form in the fifteenth century.  The castle withstood the siege of Napoleonic troops, but surrendered to the huge fire that happened at the beginning of the 19th century.  It stood in ruins until the second half of the twentieth century, was restored and now houses the Archaeological and Historical Museums, as well as various exhibitions.  From the terrace in front of the main entrance or from the castle towers you can admire the beautiful panorama of Bratislava.  An excursion with a Russian-speaking guide for a group of five people will cost 75 euros. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bratislava is the capital" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1087644.jpg" width="434"></div>

    <h2>  St. Martin's Cathedral </h2><p>  This temple is second in the list of ‚ÄúWhat to see in Bratislava‚Äù.  The church began to be built in the eighth century.  Previously, it was part of the city fortifications, but later became the cathedral of Bratislava.  They consecrated it in 1452 as a coronation church.  This means that in its walls they crowned the kingdom of rulers ... Hungary.  Yes, yes, this is not a mistake.  Since 1535, Bratislava was part of the Hungarian state.  From 1563 until 1830, ten kings, eight of their wives and the Empress of Austria Maria Theresa were anointed in the kingdom of St. Martin.  The quadrangular tower of St. Stephen testifies to the high status of the temple.  She is crowned by a gilded crown.  Since 2008, the cathedral has become the seat of the Archbishop of Bratislava.  But the temple is still open for tourists to visit.  You should go inside to admire the Gothic decoration of this cathedral.  The Blue Church with a high bell tower is also noteworthy.  The monastery churches of Minority, Trinitarian, Jesuit, Ursulin and other orders added color to this ancient city. </p><h2>  Main square </h2><p>  Hlavne namestie has always been the focus of all city life.  The houses on it were built over a long period and are made in the style of Gothic, Baroque, Classicism.  In the middle of the Main Square, the Roland Fountain beats (this knight of Charlemagne is revered as the patron saint of Bratislava).  It was built in 1572 to honor the coronation of Maximilian II.  Christmas and Easter fairs take place on the square, and if the weather in Bratislava allows, it is good to relax in the shade of trees or on the terraces of numerous cafes, drink mulled wine in the winter or cold beer in the summer.  The Old Town Hall - a symbol of urban freedom and therefore the tallest building in the city - is a stunning ensemble of buildings of various times and styles.  Its oldest part is the corner turret of the end of the 13th century.  The complex of the Old Town Hall also includes the houses of Paver, Jacob, Unger, Aponiho.  Now in this palace of self-government is the Museum of the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bratislava country" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1087655.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Bronze figures </h2><p>  These are the funniest "residents" of the city with the beautiful name of Bratislava.  Reviews of tourists strongly recommend not to miss them in their travels through the streets.  Bronze figures may appear unexpectedly.  Not only from around the corner, but even from under the ground, more precisely, from the sewer manhole.  Stop, stop!  This fun plumber (or the cesspool worker - who knows?) Should not only be photographed, but also stroked with a helmet.  In this case, you need to make a wish - and it will certainly come true.  This is evidenced by the plumbing helmet rubbed with palms to a shine.  It can be seen that the inhabitants of Bratislava thus fulfill their dreams and therefore live happily.  Many tourists devote an entire day to finding bronze figures on the streets of the Old City.  This is a French soldier, leaning on a bench, and a paparazzi, aiming his camera at the entrance to the restaurant. </p>

    <h2>  What to try in Bratislava </h2><p>  If you go up to the observation deck on the support of the New Bridge (85 meters high), you can be sure that immediately endless vineyards are located outside the city.  A specialized museum also tells about the history of cultivation of vines in the local region.  Bratislava is the capital of not only winemaking, but also brewing.  To try the most delicious foamy drink, you need to go not to ordinary bars.  It is better to visit the cellar and the tasting room of one of the city's breweries.  Slovak cuisine cannot be called healthy, but, of course, the food is very tasty.  If you do not want to sharply gain a couple of kilograms, do not come to Bratislava.  And if you want to arrange a feast for your stomach, visit the Smikhovsky Dvor and Presporsky Curia restaurants. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Prices in Bratislava" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1087654.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  Prices in Bratislava are low compared to other <span>European capitals</span> .  Lunch for two with wine will cost twenty euros.  Low prices allow you to make profitable purchases, especially since branded clothing and footwear stores are present here.  However, in the capital of Slovakia there is no such an abundance of shopping centers and entire neighborhoods for shopping, as in other major cities in Europe.  What is being brought from Bratislava?  Mostly products from Slovak glass.  The richest choice is in the Rona store.  Souvenirs, according to experienced travelers, it is better to purchase on the Slovak Uprising Square or at kiosks on the Hlavne namestie.  As a tasty memo about Bratislava, you should bring home delicious gingerbread cookies. </p>
