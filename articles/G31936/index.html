Many travelers going on vacation to Turkey do not see the differences between Beldibi and Kemer.  But still, these are two completely different resorts that are 15 km away from each other.  Beldibi has gathered all the advantages: the sea, unforgettable views of the mountains, the unique blue of the sky and, of course, hospitality. </p><p>  Until the 1980s, no one had heard of this resort corner.  It was just an inconspicuous village on the Taurus Mountains and the Mediterranean coast.  Local residents were engaged in agriculture, mainly sheep, and citrus plants prevailed from plants.  But in the 1980s, investors from Germany noticed the settlement and built small hotels in Beldibi.  For several decades, this small village has become one of the most popular resorts in Turkey, which attracted tourists from all over the world.  Beldibi beckons with its clean beaches, picturesque landscapes, as if created for photo shoots, historical places and developed outdoor activities (climbing, hiking, diving and rafting).  Beldibi hotels in Turkey hospitably receive visitors all year round. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><div class="photo" data-original="travelask.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beldibi hotels" class="if uuid-2453337" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39274/2453337.jpg"></div><p>  Beldibi village is located 30 kilometers from Antalya, which is the nearest airport.  He takes planes from different cities of Russia.  Beldibi is easy to reach from this airport.  They are connected by a highway, along which buses and minibuses go, in local terms - dolmush.  So you can get to the center.  The entire road takes 30-40 minutes if there is no traffic jam at the exit from Antalya.  Those who don‚Äôt want to crowd in buses can take a taxi, but the service will be several times more expensive. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Tourism is the main area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe economy of modern Beldibi.

Their names are extremely simple: the first, second and third.  You can ask local residents about the boundaries of each of the territorial sectors.  However, without going into details, we can say that the first Beldibi area is located on the coast, and the third Beldibi is farthest from the sea.  Despite such a distribution of places - names of districts, the prices of hotel complexes in Beldibi-1 and Beldibi-3 are not very different.  There are even competitions for the rooms of those hotels located in the third district, such as Club Salima (5 stars), because from the windows you can observe a magnificent view of the foot of the Taurus Mountains, and the beach is within easy reach.
