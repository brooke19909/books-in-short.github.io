    <p>  However, fruits, vegetables, <span>sheep‚Äôs cheese,</span> pork for barbecue, home-made wine are best purchased at the Kallithea grocery market, which operates in the morning.  Here the goods are piece and home quality.  The price of fruits and vegetables is up to 1 ‚Ç¨, olives - 5-7 ‚Ç¨, cheese - 2.5 ‚Ç¨, pork - 5 ‚Ç¨ per kilogram. </p><p>  Those who wish to make a major purchase traditionally turn to the local fur salon ‚ÄúDivin‚Äù (chinchilla, mink, lynx), located at 8 Megalou Alexandrou street. </p><p>  Gourmets in alcoholic beverages purchase in Rhodes a local resinous wine called Retsina and is made from the local Atiri grape as a souvenir. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Tourists themselves highly rate the Romanza Mare 3 service. Reviews on travel agencies sites give it 8.5 points out of 10. For a three-star hotel, this is a pretty high indicator.  It is typical that many guests show a desire to relax again in this hotel complex. </p><p>  Many of them mention the friendliness and hard work of the staff, express their respect and gratitude to the manager of the hotel complex Tenezis Mantalis and manager Ksrusula Mantali. </p>
