Demand far exceeded supply, and often when asked about the availability of numbers from the handset, ‚ÄúSorry, no.‚Äù </p><p>  The situation changed by 2014, when Minsk became the capital of the World Cup.  Many hotels of various levels were built in the city, new guest houses and hostels were opened.  Today, inexpensive hotels in Minsk for tourists can be found at any time of the year and in any area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tourist hotel Minsk" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34006/849285.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Their price range is also very diverse.  These are beds in hostels for 15 dollars a day, and "presidential" rooms for 2 thousand dollars in five-star hotels.  But, despite the fact that it is quite possible to find a more modest hotel, with a more budgetary cost of living, the Tourist Hotel (Minsk) is still loved by many of its regular guests. </p><h2>  Where is the "Tourist" located? </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the hotel is quite far from the center, its location is very convenient.  Partizansky Avenue, on which the Tourist Hotel is located (Minsk), is one of the main arteries of the city and is located along the route from the National Airport towards the center.  Nearby are the metro station and public transport, allowing in a matter of minutes to get to any area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Belarusian capital.  And the nearby pine park serves as a great place for an evening promenade and provides guests with fresh forest air. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tourist Hotel Minsk" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34006/849271.jpg" width="290"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  For people traveling with pleasure, getting to the hotel will not be difficult.  Bus No. 79, trolleybuses No. 3 and 16, as well as city tram No. 7 will be delivered directly from the railway station to ‚ÄúTurist‚Äù. </p><p>  Partizanskaya metro station is located very close to the hotel, however it is located on a branch that is not connected to the railway station.  Those who choose such a route are expected to have a not very convenient transfer at the Kupalovskaya metro station.  According to tourists, this route is the most inconvenient due to the presence of a long narrow passage between the stations. </p><p>  A taxi ride is perhaps the most convenient way to get from the train or central bus station.  The fare is quite acceptable, since the distance is only about 5 kilometers. </p><p>  Regular trains and buses depart from the airport to the station, the travel time is about an hour. </p><p>  Hotel "Tourist" (Minsk) is taking all possible measures to make the stay of its guests in the Belarusian capital as comfortable as possible.  The hotel offers an airport shuttle service.  The cost is about 35 euros per person.  This method is not the cheapest, but it saves a significant amount of time.  And this is especially relevant if the terms of stay in Minsk are very tight. </p><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  The fifteen-story "Tourist" is the largest tourist complex in the capital of Belarus.  To accommodate tourists, rooms of various categories are offered - from standard single and double rooms to luxurious suites.  Non-smoking rooms are available on designated floors. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Single standard </h2><p>  Single standard is a single room with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã16 square meters.  The room has a standard bed, a wardrobe, a TV and even a refrigerator - the atmosphere is quite sufficient to spend several days.  The bathroom has a shower, hairdryer.  The cost of living is about 50 euros per person. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cheap hotels in Minsk for tourists" class="if" height="460" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34006/849277.jpg" width="306"></div>

    <h2>  Twin standard </h2><p>  This number is practically no different from the standard single.  Only sixteen meters managed to establish two beds.  A fridge and cable TV are also included.  Fluffy towels and a hairdryer are provided in the bathroom.  Cost - about 65 euros per night. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel tourist minsk reviews" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34006/849274.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Single comfort </h2><p>  Superior single room also does not have a large area.  Hotel "Tourist" (Minsk) standardly allocates the same 16 meters for its guests.  The room furniture is modern, and this room also has a large bed.  The presence of air conditioning is especially pleasing in the summer.  The price is 55 euros. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Twin comfort, double comfort </h2><p>  From the standard twin double room, the only difference is the availability of air conditioning.  As in other rooms, the furniture is modern and of high quality, the choice of television channels is huge, and the refrigerator is absolutely silent.  The cost of a room in this category is approximately 74 euros. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel tourist Minsk vacancies" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34006/849273.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Double comfort differs from the above only in the presence of a double bed 1.4 meters wide.  The price is also 74 euros. </p><p>  Based on the reviews of tourists staying at the hotel of the same name, in winter there is no difference to book a room of the category "comfort" or "standard".  They do not save on heating in the hotel.  But in the summer, air conditioning will not be superfluous, the availability of which in some rooms is provided by the Tourist Hotel.  Minsk city is increasingly suffering from sweltering heat in the summer months. </p><h2>  Single comfort plus </h2><p>  This two-room suite consists of two rooms - a bedroom and a living room, which occupy 23 square meters.  The rooms are equipped with modern furniture, an orthopedic mattress on a large bed and the coniferous aroma from the nearest park will provide the guest with a healthy and sound sleep.  The room has a radio, TV, air conditioning.  A set of dishes allows you to organize dinners directly in the room.  For accommodation in a room of this price category you will need to pay about 60 euros. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel tourist city Minsk" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34006/849275.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Suite </h2><p>  Two rooms consist of all the suites available at the hotel, Tourist, Minsk.  Photos advantageously show their comfort and luxury.  The furniture in these rooms is selected only from natural materials.  Tourists may prefer either a double bed or two single beds.  The living rooms have high-quality furniture from the best Belarusian manufacturers.  All the benefits of civilization, like a refrigerator, TV, air conditioning and more, are available.  Each room has its own individual style and is decorated in its own color scheme.  For a day spent in a room of a category of "luxury", you must pay 85 euros. </p><h2>  Payment </h2><p>  The hotel accepts both cash and credit cards.  It should be taken into account that payment is made in Belarusian rubles everywhere in Belarus. </p><p>  So that tourists can avoid difficulties with payment, a currency exchange office was opened on the second floor.  Some guests complain that the rate in hotels is not as profitable as in the city.  However, this is completely untrue.  As a rule, the difference in exchange rates between different banks is very small. </p><h2>  Business center </h2><p>  If necessary, each hotel guest can use the services of a small business center.  The guest of the capital is provided with a computer with a printer and fax.  If necessary, you can make photocopies or scan any documents. </p><p>  When checking in to each guest, the Tourist Hotel (Minsk) presents a 3-hour Internet access card. </p><h2>  Restaurants, bars, casinos </h2><p>  The restaurant is pleased to offer its customers a variety of dishes of Belarusian and European cuisine and has the ability to serve 180 people at the same time.  Opening hours - from 7.00 to 24.00.  Breakfasts are also served here, which, incidentally, are not included in the room rate.  And if the tourists' reviews about the morning menu are mostly enthusiastic, then lunches and dinners often cause complaints. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tourist hotel Minsk photo" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34006/849276.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the bar you can play several games of billiards or pool, order drinks and light snacks for them. </p><p>  Oasis Casino offers to try your luck with a game of Black Jack, poker or roulette.  It should be noted that gambling attracts many players to the Belarusian capital.  Due to the presence of its own casino, the Tourist Hotel has gained great popularity among them.  Minsk, reviews of whose visits are increasingly reduced to a description of visits to entertainment venues of this kind, are often called Belarusian Las Vegas. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tourist hotel Minsk" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34006/849270.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Each guest feels at home in the hotel, thanks to well-trained staff, which the Tourist Hotel (Minsk) can rightfully be proud of.  Jobs rarely appear, because each employee values ‚Äã‚Äãhis work and strives to make an even more significant contribution to the common cause, called the ‚ÄúTourist‚Äù. </p>
