    <p>  We see that the Chinese brand produces stylish, design-optimized devices for both home and office use. </p><h2>  Key Product Codes </h2><p>  Haier air conditioners are available in a wide range of modifications.  The manufacturer company classifies them in a special code system that allows you to determine which type the device belongs to.  Regarding modern models of air conditioners, the following main codes are accepted: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  - SU (this code indicates that the air conditioner is classified as wall mounted); </p><p>  - PU (air conditioning refers to the type of floor, column); </p><p>  - W (this code indicates that the air conditioner is windowed); </p><p>  - M (the device belongs to the category of mobile); </p><p>  - CFU (air conditioning, classified as floor-to-ceiling); </p><p>  - BU (cassette type device). </p><p>  There are also codes that classify the air conditioner according to a number of basic functions.  If the device contains the code H, this means that it can both heat and <span>cool the air.</span>  If the name of the device uses the code C, then its functions are limited to cooling.  There is a special code B - it is used for inverter air conditioners. </p><p>  How to determine which type a device belongs to?  Very simple.  For example, the Haier HSU 09HMC203 R2 air conditioner, reviews of which are widespread on the pages of online stores due to the great popularity of this device, relates, therefore, to devices that can both heat and cool the air, and the best way to install them is on the wall.  In a similar way, you can determine the type of other device modifications from the Chinese brand.  For example, Haier HSU 07 HEK303 air conditioners, reviews of which are also common, belong to the same category as a type 09HNC203 R2 device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Haier air conditioners manufacturer" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19663/751013.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Popular Series </h2><p>  Another basis for the classification of climate technology from Haier is the assignment of devices to a particular series.  Now the Chinese brand produces air conditioners as part of a huge number of series.  Consider the features of some of them in more detail. </p><p>  Among the most popular are devices of the R series. These can be inverter air conditioners.  Their peculiarity is that they are equipped with an air ionizer, which charges the atmosphere with the corresponding elementary particles.  Air conditioners of this type and manufactured by Haier (many customer reviews confirm this) make the air in the room very clean and pleasant, bringing the environment closer to the atmosphere of a mountain valley or forest.  Also in the framework of the R series, a Chinese company produces devices that are not classified as inverter.  They are characterized by the presence of the function of effective air exchange, as well as by cleaning the atmosphere of the premises.  This type of air conditioner is also equipped with an ionizer. </p><p>  Another popular series of devices is V. Their feature is that they are capable of providing fresh atmospheric air into the air-conditioned room.  This function allows you to reduce the percentage of carbon dioxide in the room.  Like the air conditioners of the previous series, these devices are also equipped with an air ionizer. </p><p>  Among the most technologically advanced inverter-type devices are those that belong to the EA series.  Their main feature is low power consumption.  This useful property of air conditioners is achieved thanks to technologies for maintaining the exact temperature level in the room, as well as the presence in the devices of effective mechanisms for heating and cooling the air.  The EA Series also produces non-inverter devices.  They are also characterized by a high level of manufacturability of the processes of heating and cooling the surrounding atmosphere.  So, for example, in the mode of increasing air temperature, the flow is directed vertically.  If cooling is carried out, then along the ceiling. </p><p>  K-Series devices are characterized by an automated system for selecting the optimal operating mode.  Also, air conditioners of this type are equipped with an indoor unit, in which there are various useful indicators.  The devices of this series can operate at three different fan speeds. </p><p>  E-series devices are air conditioners manufactured by Haier (many user reviews confirm this), which belong to the category of the most functional.  It is also characterized by a high degree of automation.  Among its notable functions is the preparation of the atmosphere of the room before going to bed. </p><p>  Haier <span>mobile air conditioners</span> are also very popular, the reviews of which are the most positive.  Devices of this type can be placed in any part of the room; they do not require installation.  Moreover, their functionality is at the highest level.  The fan of this series of devices can also operate at three different speeds. </p><h2>  Air conditioning systems </h2><p>  Another noteworthy series of devices from Haier is the H-MRV type of inverter system.  They are adapted to serve a group of rooms using a series of structural elements integrated into the system.  The corresponding type of blocks are characterized by ease of installation.  Among the remarkable features of the devices - low power consumption. </p><p>  If you continue to research <span>air conditioning systems</span> from Haier, then it is definitely worth exploring devices related to the E-Multi series.  These solutions are characterized by universality - they are equally adapted for servicing both residential apartments and offices.  Blocks that are part of the system can be of different types - cassette, wall, floor or, for example, channel.  The customer decides which one to choose based on the specifics of the premises, which he decided to equip with air conditioning. </p><p>  Another interesting system is the X-Multi.  It is characterized by a high degree of configuration flexibility.  It can also be equally effective for both home and office.  Among the main structural features of this system is that its compressor is located in the outdoor unit.  The type of system under consideration is classified as inverter.  It is characterized by a low level of energy consumption. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Haier air conditioners" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19663/751017.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <h2>  Cassette Air Conditioners </h2><p>  Haier also produces a wide range of cassette air conditioners.  They are presented in a wide range of models. </p><p>  Haier cassette inverter air conditioners of excellent quality, reviews of which are also presented on thematic online portals in large numbers, are presented as part of the AB series.  Devices of this type are notable for mounting technology.  Their indoor unit is located in the space of the false ceiling.  Using special blinds, the ceiling is protected from contamination. </p><p>  There are AB series cassette devices in the Haier line that are not classified as inverter.  Similarly, they are installed on a suspended ceiling, and air is sent in four different directions.  However, as soon as the device starts up, hot air is supplied along the ceiling so as not to cause discomfort to people inside the room. </p><p>  Among the popular ones are the cassette devices of the HBU series.  This type of air conditioner, like the previous ones, is mounted in the space of a false ceiling.  Their feature is that air is simultaneously supplied in four different directions.  In this way, temperature uniformity in different parts of the room is maintained.  In addition, the devices are able to supply outside air into the rooms. </p><p>  HCFU and AC series devices are universal.  They can be installed on walls or ceilings.  Characterized by efficient air distribution.  In automatic mode, flows are controlled both horizontally and vertically. </p><p>  HCFU instruments are also available in sub-ceiling versions.  The structural features of this type of devices allow them to be used for air conditioning of long rooms.  The air conditioners of this series also provide outside air to the rooms.  The sub-ceiling category also includes devices of the AC series.  They are characterized by ease of use and a high level of automation. </p><h2>  Air conditioner specifics </h2><p>  Having studied what the specifics of Haier series of air conditioners are, we can consider the features of the operation of the devices.  Reviews of Haier air conditioners largely reflect the practice of using certain device functions.  Users exchange opinions regarding the features of various <span>operating modes of the air conditioner and</span> their operation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Air conditioners Haier reviews" class="if" height="302" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/751116.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Haier brand produces a huge number of models of HVAC equipment.  Therefore, the specifics of the operation of a particular device should be sequentially disclosed in the relevant instructions for the device.  In some cases, air conditioners manufactured by Haier are too dissimilar in terms of operational features.  An instruction that would suit each of them probably could not be developed. </p><p>  At the same time, a set of rules and methods for working with air conditioners has been formed on the climate technology market, affecting key aspects of using the devices.  It does not matter which devices are at the disposal of the owner of the premises - if these are air conditioners manufactured by Haier, a manual of this type may well be relevant for her.  So, what do climate experts recommend regarding the operation of air conditioners? </p><h2>  Using an air conditioner: basic rules </h2><p>  Key rules that reflect the specifics of using climate technology of the appropriate type suggest the following range of recommendations. </p><p>  Firstly, it is unacceptable to place the air conditioner in those places where there is a possibility of foreign objects getting into the fan grill.  Therefore, it is not surprising that installing the device on a wall or ceiling is one of the most common methods of fixing the device.  It is unlikely that in the corresponding sections of the room, any of the people in it will accidentally place any object inside the bars. </p><p>  Secondly, using air conditioning to cool the room, you should choose a temperature regime in the values ‚Äã‚Äãof 21-23 degrees.  Lower performance may adversely affect compressor performance.  In addition, the organisms of many people are sensitive to temperature extremes, especially in the heat.  And if the user of the air conditioner sets the corresponding values ‚Äã‚Äãlower than those indicated, people in the room can catch a cold. </p><p>  Thirdly, it is important to place the base unit of the device out of direct sunlight.  Following this rule will significantly extend the <span>life of the</span> air conditioner.  Also, a stream of bright sunlight can in some cases be an obstacle to controlling the device using the remote control.  Before leaving the premises, owners of air conditioners should carefully check whether the necessary functions on the air conditioner have turned on after pressing the corresponding buttons.  Otherwise, it may happen that a person inadvertently set a lower or, conversely, too high a temperature. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Haier air conditioners instruction" class="if" height="422" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19663/751016.jpg" width="562"></div>

    <h2>  Error Codes </h2><p>  The features of the operation of Haier air conditioners, as we noted above, largely depend on the specific modification of the device.  At the same time, the Chinese brand has developed a fairly unified system for fixing errors in the functions performed by devices.  If during operation of the device there is any problem, then a code is displayed on the device‚Äôs display screen, by which you can determine what its essence is. </p><p>  What errors may Haier air conditioners make?  Consider their list. </p><p>  E0.  This code means that the device is experiencing problems with condensate drainage. </p><p>  E1.  If this code is displayed on the screen, it means that the pressure indicator in the air conditioning compressor is increased. </p><p>  E2.  This is an indicator that an ice crust has formed on the heat exchanger located inside the module. </p><p>  E3.  This code means that the compressor has not reached a sufficient pressure level. </p><p>  E4.  This is an indicator that the <span>air conditioning compressor has</span> overheated. </p><p>  E5.  This code indicates that the compressor has turned off due to the fact that its load has exceeded the permissible level. </p><p>  E6.  This is a signal that no communication has been established between different units of the device. </p><p>  E7.  This code indicates that the indoor unit cannot respond to commands from the control panel. </p><p>  E8.  This is a signal that the electric motor, which is located in the indoor unit, is overloaded. </p><p>  F0.  This code means that the temperature sensor that detects the temperature level in the room is turned off. </p><p>  F1.  This is a signal that the temperature sensor, which is installed on the heat exchanger in the structure of the internal module, is not working. </p><p>  F2.  This code means that the temperature sensor that is installed on the heat exchanger in the structure of the external module does not work. </p><p>  F3  This error code means that the street temperature sensor is not working. </p><p>  F4.  This is a signal that the temperature sensor that is functioning when the air supply is not working. </p><p>  Ff.  This code indicates that there are problems with the supply of electricity. </p><p>  These are the features that characterize Haier air conditioners.  Instructions for the use of these devices, reflecting the general moments of their operation, as well as the error codes that we have listed, will help the user ensure the smooth operation of climate control equipment. </p><p>  Now we will study what the owners of air conditioners from Haier say about the fact of using the devices. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  What are the reviews for Haier HSU air conditioners - in particular, those samples that we indicated above?  The opinions of the owners of the devices can be classified into several varieties. </p>
