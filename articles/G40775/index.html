  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Partisans of the Second World War are people with a capital letter</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>The Great Patriotic War</span> became a test for the entire population of our country.  Not only soldiers fought on the front lines, but the entire people of the country, one way or another, took part in hostilities.  Someone worked at the factories in several shifts in order to deliver ammunition to our army on time, and someone, at the cost of their health, pulled wounded soldiers from the battlefield.  Partisan detachments were also organized - people voluntarily defended the land of their country, destroying the enemy from the rear, while front-line troops advanced on the front line. </p><p>  These <span>brave people in</span> every possible and even impossible way prevented the Nazi invaders from moving inland and carrying violence and blood. </p><p>  Partisans of the Second World War selflessly pursued and destroyed the enemy: created unbearable conditions for fascist soldiers, damaged telephone communications, blew up bridges and warehouses, since their main combat activity was the destruction of communications.  For these purposes, they used both improvised explosives and advanced ‚ÄúColonel Starinov‚Äôs mines‚Äù. </p><p>  On November 15, 1943, partisans of the Second World War destroyed the Dnieper-Bug Canal, which was a very convenient way of transportation for German soldiers.  The Germans tried to restore the canal, but the partisans again destroyed it, despite the forces of the enemy.  Also partisans of the <span>Great Patriotic War</span> organized sabotage, destroying the infrastructure of the enemy, went into reconnaissance, assisted the troops, and mobilized the entire combat-ready population.  This is all without which it was practically impossible to repulse the advancing enemy forces.  With these actions, they foiled Hitler‚Äôs plans, causing significant damage to the German army. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Nazis constantly felt the danger in the territory of the Soviet Union.  This not only suppressed the moral balance of German <span>soldiers, it</span> was also a real threat. </p><p>  The first organized partisan detachments were few in number - no more than ten people.  However, the measure of the rapid offensive of the Nazis on the territory of our country, the number of people in partisan units began to increase and reached 200 people.  All these heroes were faithful to their homeland. </p><p>  In September 1942, <span>K.E.</span> was appointed commander in chief of the partisan movement.  <span>Voroshilov,</span> and it was he who was nevertheless able to fully coordinate the actions of all partisan detachments.  Thanks to this, our ancestors could inflict even greater damage to the enemy. </p><p>  The partisan movement was created in the territories of all republics that are members of the Soviet Union.  In Belarus, the most famous was the Pinsk partisan detachment.  His commander was V.Z.  Korzh.  By 1942, partisan detachments of Belarus had become so strong that they were able to smash entire enemy garrisons. </p><p>  After the Pinsk region was completely liberated, some partisan detachments of Belarus joined the ranks of the front-line soldiers and continued to fight with the Nazi invaders. </p><p>  It is difficult to evaluate the merits of these organized units.  Because of their actions, the enemy could not send several thousand echelons to the front, since the Great Patriotic War partisans disabled two and a half thousand steam locomotives. </p><p>  People of any nationality who considered the Soviet Union their Motherland, sparing no life, entered the battle against the Nazis.  Among the <span>partisan</span> detachments of <span>Belarus</span> there were several Jewish, which included people who managed to escape from the ghetto.  In 2009, the documentary film Outlaws directed by Alexander Stupnikov was shot about the actions of Jewish partisan units. </p><p>  And now almost 70 years have passed since the end of this terrible war.  The descendants can be proud of a great victory, an indispensable contribution to which the partisans of the Second World War made an opposing enemy in a single impulse. </p>
