  <section class="page js-page"><h1>To help needlewomen: ready-made Suit Patterns</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When buying ready-made clothes, we often face the fact that planting things according to the figure leaves much to be desired, and the quality of tailoring does not always correspond to the amount spent.  As a result, we get a spoiled mood and plan additional costs for fitting clothes in the studio, or from private craftsmen. </p><p>  But many women (in secret: men) know how to sew, and quite well.  Those who do not know how to handle a needle, scissors and do not know what kind of monster this is - a sewing machine, with a great desire and a reserve of patience, they can very well learn tailoring craft.  What for? </p><p>  Just in order to be able to dress fashionably and tastefully without spending large sums on the purchase of low-quality consumer goods.  What can we say about high-quality branded things - such clothes are "too tough" for many, to say the least.  In order to create an exclusive model with your own hands, it is not necessary to be able to build complex drawings, enough ability to sew correctly and accurately.  To find the necessary <em>patterns of suits,</em> skirts, dresses, coats, and in general - any clothes, now is not a problem. </p><p>  For lovers of sewing, there are a lot of magazines offering ready-made <em>patterns of jackets</em> and raincoats, blouses, trousers, tracksuits, evening dresses and even swimwear and underwear.  In addition, do not forget about the World Wide Web - you just have to type in a search engine a request, for example <em>: free coat patterns,</em> as there are many sites that offer to download a drawing. </p><p>  Especially popular are <em>patterns of suits for</em> business and classic style, patterns of clothes for children and patterns of carnival costumes.  The fact is that building a drawing of a skirt or dress is much easier, so many people who have little skill in <span>designing clothes</span> will quite cope with creating a suitable pattern.  And in order to create a competent drawing of a jacket with a collar, or trousers of various configurations, more serious knowledge and skills, plus skills in modeling clothes, will be required. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  <strong>How to adapt a suit pattern for individual parameters</strong> </p><p>  Costumes are a universal <span>form of clothing.</span>  This category includes not only business suits for the office, but also many other options: brightly colored <span>summer suits</span> with a skirt or trousers, knitted models for the home and <span>tracksuits, suits</span> for attending school or college, multi-layer fantasy models and costumes for children. </p><p>  To choose the appropriate <em>patterns for the costumes,</em> you need to clearly understand what style the finished things should be in, with which it will be possible to combine the suit, what material will be used for sewing. </p><p>  For a perfect fit, you may need to make some adjustments to the <em>patterns of your suits,</em> <strong> </strong>  because they are designed mainly for standard sizes.  Of course, there are special patterns of clothes for different figures, but they are not so diverse. </p><p>  Making the adjustment is not as difficult as it seems.  First of all, you need to know all the measures that are necessary to build the basic structure: chest, hips, waist, shoulder width, sleeve length and finished products.  Additionally, you may need: girth of the neck, shoulder (arms in the widest upper part), the length of the trousers along the inner step seam, the depth of the neckline and other specifying measurements.  If the growth is non-standard, small or large, you can lengthen or shorten the pattern, adjusting the centimeters along the waist, elbow and knees.  An important point: it is along these lines that you can regulate growth changes, then all proportions of the figure will be observed. </p><p>  If you just need to change the style, lengthen or shorten the pattern, you can simply along the lines of the bottom of the product.  Excesses along the waist line ‚Äúhide‚Äù in constructive tucks or embossed seams, the bulge along the chest line is also regulated by a change in the depth of the tucks.  The main changes, if significant, can be made on paper, and smaller amendments are made to the product already in the process of fitting.  A little advice: if you are not confident in your abilities and experience in sewing clothes is still not enough, you can train on inexpensive material with a similar structure and density.  Then it remains only to transfer the changes to the pattern and boldly take on the work. </p>
