  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Jomtien hotels are the best choice for a comfortable stay for reasonable money</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The beautiful Jomtien beach is located on the Thai coast, not far from Pattaya, but even south.  The place is relatively quiet, as it is located a little away from the center, where the hectic life boils.  But this does not mean that on the coast of the beach is deserted - just the opposite.  Just fewer people than, say, in the same neighboring Pattaya.  Many tourists, especially those from ‚Äúexperienced and experienced‚Äù, are well aware of this feature of the beach and, not wanting to participate in too much crowding, choose a vacation in Jomtien.  But there is another circumstance that attracts well-informed tourists to rest in Jomtien - this is a lot of convenient, comfortable and inexpensive hotels concentrated here. </p><p>  The peculiar hotels of Jomtien, like most hotels in Thailand in general, are remembered, first of all, by the friendly and smiling staff, most of which are explained in Russian fairly well.  It seems that every employee is happy for you.  Pretty nice feeling.  The affordable prices that Jomtien hotels demonstrate are designed mainly for an average wallet, at the level of three to four stars.  This meets the needs of tourists who come here, who mostly need the sea and cheap exotic fruits at a time when a snowstorm is circling in their homeland.  Of course, Jomtien hotels are represented by a five-star level, but there are few such places, and they are located mainly in Pattaya. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Tourists who commented on Jomtien hotels note that the most popular are several 3-star complexes.  In first place for the number of positive reviews is the Jomtien Palm Beach Hotel. All rooms are without fail equipped with air conditioning, impeccable service and the most important advantage is its geographical location.  Having left it and having traveled a short distance in 1-2 minutes, the vacationer finds himself near the highway, where he can take transport and for 10 baht of local currency (about 1 dollar) in 5-7 minutes find himself in the very center of entertainment.  Having plenty of hanging out, you can just as easily retreat into an almost home-like comfortable hotel and indulge in relaxation.  If you go towards the coast.  Then also after 3-5 minutes walk you can quickly be on the beach.  The next on the list to receive more than one positive review of Jomtien hotels is the Grand Jomtien Palas 3 star hotel.  We especially recommend it for family vacations, thanks to its spacious rooms and a leisurely lifestyle with well-developed infrastructure.  And completes the list of the most reliable and verified Amdassador hotels. It is also the cheapest institution.  The last one on the list is because it is located quite far from the center of this entertainment and fun.  Those who like frequent noisy parties in local night clubs and bars will not be very convenient to get from there.  But for those who prefer a relaxing holiday, this place fits perfectly.  The hotel has its own sandy beach, where you can even find solitude, especially for <span>couples in love.</span>  However, for entertainment you can always quickly get to the center with an inexpensive taxi, where there is everything you need for entertainment.  Slightly spoils the impression is a noticeable long-standing lack of repair in a high-rise building of 42 floors.  Yes, in the mid-90s it was a rather prestigious hotel, but now it‚Äôs a bit old-fashioned.  However, the situation in the room is quite level, everything works, including a shower and air conditioning.  For most tourists this is enough. </p><p>  In conclusion, we can conclude that the Jomtien hotels successfully fulfill the function entrusted to them to provide vacationers with a comfortable and inexpensive vacation. </p>
