    <p>  All labor awards that were accepted for rewarding in the Soviet Union changed as the country developed.  Something was added to them, other details were removed, as the alloy changed. </p><h2>  In modern conditions </h2><p>  Today, medals are memorabilia that are valuable either to collectors or to their owners as a memory of days gone by.  The value of the awards determines their quality, year of manufacture and quantity on the market.  The older the medals, the less they are left, the higher their value. </p>
