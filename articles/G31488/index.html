  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What you need to know about transport tax benefits</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Every day in our country there are new owners of personal cars.  A lot of those who sold or donated their old car, bought a new one.  All of them have to deal with the problem of paying transport tax.  As in other financial situations, everyone hopes that they will find the right to privileges on transport tax and they will be able to save something in this situation.  And there are such opportunities.  But benefits, of course, apply only to certain categories of citizens. </p><p>  Who has benefits </p><p>  Residents of the metropolitan area are often interested in whether transport <span>tax</span> has benefits <span>?</span>  <span>Moscow,</span> as you know, is a rather expensive city.  And the savings in the family budget, which will be obtained by those who receive transport tax benefits, will become quite noticeable for many.  For example, the following categories of car owners on which one or more vehicles are registered can not pay tax for one car: </p><p>  - Heroes of the USSR and the Russian Federation, as well as persons awarded three degrees of the Order of Glory; </p><p>  - war veterans and disabled people; </p><p>  - Veterans, as well as invalids of the Great Patriotic War; </p><p>  - people with disabilities due to illness (first and second gr.); </p><p>  - former juvenile prisoners of concentration camps and other similar places that were formed by the Nazis during the Second World War; </p><p>  - Owners of cars with an engine rated at less than 70 horsepower; </p><p>  - a guardian, one of the parents or one of the adoptive parents, as well as the trustee of a disabled child; </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - citizens affected by radiation ("Chernobyl victims", as well as participants in tests of thermonuclear weapons, space technology); </p><p>  - one of the parents or adoptive parents of a family with the status of a large family. </p><p>  You also need to know that in <span>Moscow, transport tax benefits</span> (in the form of exemption from it) are provided to some legal entities.  These include: </p><p>  - enterprises engaged in the carriage of passengers using public <span>transport</span> (excluding taxis); </p><p>  - residents of special economic zones (they are granted such a benefit only for 5 years). </p><p>  Controversial situations </p><p>  Residents of the entire country, regardless of whether they have benefits, regularly receive notices by mail, which contain a requirement to pay the transport tax.  Often their texts raise a large number of questions.  It is no secret that accounting for transport tax is not always clear and correct.  To know more about your rights in this matter, you need to consider one situation that occurs quite often.  We can safely say that this is the most common case.  The vehicle has been sold and deregistered for a long time, but notifications requiring the payment of tax continue to be delivered to its former owner.  Unfortunately, in many large cities, when information was transferred from the traffic police to the tax authorities, many errors arose due to the large volume of documents.  Therefore, cases when a <span>car is deregistered</span> and sold, and IFTS employees do not know about it, are not uncommon.  This situation is especially unpleasant for those who have transport tax benefits. </p><p>  What should I do if a notice arrives with a demand to pay tax on an already deregistered car?  Tax officers recommend taking a certificate from the traffic police about removing the car from the register, attaching a sales document to it and bring it all to them.  Of course, such a mechanism is valid only in the case of the official sale of a car.  If you purchased the car from you by <span>general power of attorney,</span> then such requirements are quite reasonable.  Indeed, from the point of view of the law, the owner of the car has not changed.  Therefore, in this case, the tax will have to be paid. </p>
