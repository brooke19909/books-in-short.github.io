    <p>  Most often, the error "0" appears when access to viewing channels disappears.  Usually this is due to a malfunction in the receiver program.  There can be many reasons, up to the voltage drop in the mains. </p><p>  In any case, if an error "0" occurs on Tricolor TV, what to do is advised by experts.  First of all, disconnect the receiver from power for a while.  Then turn it on again.  This procedure takes about five minutes.  When using the conditional access module, you need to remove it, and then put it back into the receiver. </p><p>  Very often, instead of the error message "0" information is displayed on the screen in the form of "DRE Coded Channel".  At the same time, it is impossible to watch broadcasts. </p>

    <p>  So what does the error "0" on "Tricolor TV" mean?  The answer should be sought in the causes of the problems.  There are universal ways to solve this problem, which are suitable for all types of receivers that are used to receive channels provided by Tricolor TV.  They can be used when channels are not displayed, but at the same time "Infokanal" works. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Bug fix "0" </h2><p>  If an error "0" is detected on "Tricolor TV", how to fix it yourself? </p><p>  First, you should check if the subscription to the package services has suddenly ended.  This is done in your account on the official website or in the menu of the receiver itself.  If the subscription has expired, then this may well cause a similar error. </p>

    <p>  It is possible that the access card is not correctly inserted in the receiver, so you need to check the correctness of its installation in the corresponding slot on the receiver.  If a conditional access module is used instead of a card, then a check should be made in it. </p><p>  If the card is inserted correctly, when you press the No.ID button on the remote control, a message will be displayed on the TV screen with its number displayed. </p><p>  Also, when an error occurs, it will not be superfluous to try resetting the receiver to factory settings.  In other words, reset them. </p><p>  This operation is quite possible to do on your own.  You need to enter the receiver menu and go to the "Settings" section.  You will need to enter a four-digit code - we type four zeros 0000. After that, you need to find "Factory settings" and select the line "Delete settings", along with the list of channels.  There is nothing dangerous in this operation, after rebooting the receiver using auto-search, the channels can be found again.  Most often, after this the error disappears. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  If the subscription is completed, and if the channels from the "Single" package are not accepted, it is possible to search for free channels.  Usually they are at the very end of the list. </p><p>  In a situation when the receiver has been turned off for a long time, there may also be a problem with the error "0" as soon as the receiver is turned on.  How to fix the error "0" on the "Tricolor TV"? </p><p>  Do not turn off the receiver, but leave it turned on for eight hours, and wait until the error disappears.  Most often this happens much earlier, after an hour and a half.  But this is only if both the antenna and the receiver are in good condition. </p><h2>  Other causes of the error </h2><p>  If the error "0" appeared on the "Tricolor TV", what should I do if the cause of the error "0" was poor quality or a low level of the received signal from the satellite?  Or the lack of activation keys.  In this case, just leaving the receiver turned on for a long time will not help. </p><p>  You can either send a request to the support service, or try to fix the antenna yourself. </p><p>  It must be remembered that when the receiver is expected to be activated, it must be turned on on the first channel - that is, on 1ORT, and not any other.  Regardless of whether there is a broadcast on it or not. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In the event of a conditional access module malfunction, this error may also occur.  To determine the version of installed software on the receiver, you need to click on the remote control to enter the menu section "Status".  You can resume the software yourself, while repairs are best provided to a specialized service center. </p>

    <p>  In most cases, the error "0" also appears when the satellite receiver is overloaded. </p><h2>  How to fix the problem </h2><p>  Having dealt with the question, what is the error "0" on "Tricolor TV", we perform several steps to resolve it ourselves: </p><ul><li>  Wait a while (usually 8-10 minutes), and the channel will most likely start broadcasting on its own. </li><li>  Reboot the receiver by turning it off for 3-5 minutes and turning it back on. </li></ul><p>  So in what situations does this error most often appear. </p><h2>  The message ‚ÄúNo signal‚Äù is displayed on the TV. </h2><p>  Firstly, first you need to try to determine who issued this message - a TV or receiver.  You should click on the OK button on the remote control - if the outcome is favorable, ‚ÄúTricolor TV‚Äù channels should appear on the screen. Otherwise, the message will appear that the channel list is empty (which means ‚Äú0‚Äù error on ‚ÄúTricolor TV‚Äù). </p><p>  If the receiver normally responds to a button press, then the cause of the error may be hidden: </p><ol><li>  If a <span>satellite dish of</span> small diameter (from 50 to 60 cm) is used or it is installed poorly and incorrectly configured, then the signal may be absent due to the manifestation of precipitation.  It can be rain and snow, even dense clouds. </li><li>  The antenna tuning could go astray.  For example, due to strong winds or blizzards.  You will either have to fix the satellite dish settings yourself, or call a specialist. </li></ol><h2>  How to set up the antenna yourself </h2><p>  In principle, there is nothing difficult to configure.  You just need to change the position of the antenna and monitor the TV screen.  The antenna should be moved gradually, slowly, literally a centimeter.  As soon as the image appears on the Info channel, the antenna needs to be fixed. </p>

    <p>  If you call up a special scale showing the signal strength by pressing the red ‚ÄúF1‚Äù or ‚Äúi‚Äù button on the remote control twice, the signal strength at the bottom of the screen and its quality will be on the right.  In order for the channels to be received stably, it is necessary that the signal level be at least 70%. </p><p>  There is a situation when some channels are not displayed, a message appears stating that there is no signal, while others are displayed normally.  The reason for this may be that transponders have changed - the frequencies at which the channels are broadcast.  You need to rescan them in either manual or automatic search mode. </p><p>  You have to enter the menu and select the ‚ÄúChannel Search‚Äù Tricolor TV. Then scan the channels. </p><p>  An error may occur in the event of a failure of the <span>satellite</span> antenna <span>converter</span> .  Then you have to replace the converter itself. </p><p>  When the reason is that the coaxial cable is damaged, replace the cable.  You can repair it, but the signal quality may be worse.  The cable connection may cause additional interference in the reception of channels. </p><h2>  The receiver does not respond when the OK button is pressed </h2><ul><li>  If the GS 8306 receiver is used, then often the output of the receiver itself is accidentally moved.  The fact is that there is a button on the remote control in the upper left part of it, the accidental pressing of which leads to a change of outputs, the image disappears.  To check which output is currently active, you can visually by the indicator.  RCA - bells are shown, HDMI - the indicator glows in its lower part. </li><li>  It is possible that the cause of the error is the television receiver itself.  It is necessary to check if the switched input is accidentally connected incorrectly.  You need to find the "Resources" button on the remote control and press so that the output matches the selected mode - Scart, HDMI or RCA. </li></ul><p>  If one of such inscriptions as ‚ÄúCoded DRE channel‚Äù, ‚ÄúNo access‚Äù, ‚ÄúError‚Äú 0 ‚Äùappears on the TV screen, then check the following: </p><p>  - The activity of the subscription "TV Tricolor".  Error "0" on the second receiver is also checked either through the personal account on the official website or in the "Personal account" section of the receiver. </p><h2>  Active subscription </h2><ol><li>  Make sure that the receiver detects the Tricolor smart card. </li><li>  Does it determine the ID number of the satellite receiver. </li></ol><h2>  Receiver menu item "Status" </h2><p>  If there is no ID number, then: </p><ul><li>  If you are using a receiver that uses a smart card for receiving channels - models GS 8306, GS 9303, GS 8302, GS 8304, GS 8300N, you must first disconnect the receiver from the network, remove the card, make sure that it is installed correctly, insert it back and turn on the receiver to the power network. </li><li>  If the receiver works without a card, and these are receivers using MPEG2 - GS 8300, GS 8300M, it is most likely that the access module has broken.  You will have to contact a service center where the module will be repaired. </li></ul>
