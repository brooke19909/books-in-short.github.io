    <p>  All guest houses in Sochi provide for group accommodation.  In the event that it is decided to relax with the whole company, it is better to worry about booking rooms in advance, since just before arrival or on the day of arrival the guest house may simply be occupied by other travelers.  Families with children are better off choosing Sochi guest houses with a pool.  Fortunately, such establishments are available in large numbers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Quite often the quiet streets of the private sector are chosen to build such establishments, since living in the midst of all events is not very convenient. </p>
