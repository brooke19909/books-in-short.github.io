Special experience to create it will not be needed.  Only zeal, inspiration and fantasy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  We will prepare the necessary materials: </p><ul><li>  sheets of color and white xerox paper, notebook sheets; </li><li>  thick cardboard; </li><li>  a strip of fabric, a ribbon, a piece of gauze or bandage; </li><li>  hot glue; </li><li>  ruler, pencil, scissors; </li><li>  stationery clips; </li><li>  small details of the decor (optional). </li></ul><p>  To better visualize how to make a beautiful notebook, the steps will be described below: </p><ol><li>  First you need to decide what the notebook will be: white, in a box or line.  Fold the selected paper in half, distribute into blocks. </li></ol><ol><li>  Among the blocks, lay partitions of colored paper. </li><li>  Cut out parts from cardboard to form a cover.  Attach the front and back to a stack of papers, fixing with clips, pre-place a piece of paper under the clamps so that there is no tram left. </li><li>  Measure a strip of gauze corresponding to the width of the future notebook.  attach to the side and grease liberally with glue. </li><li>  After complete drying, repeat the procedure. </li><li>  When the workpiece dries again, stick on top a strip of cloth or a wide tape.  You can decorate the binding with beads, stickers, rhinestones, lace or an interesting pattern. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="paintitcolorful.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="homemade notebook" class="if uuid-3153528" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113702/3153528.jpg"></div><p>  The original notebook is ready.  The thickness of the notebook depends on the preferences of the hostess and the availability of paper. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="make a notebook" class="if uuid-3153155" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113702/3153155.jpg"></div><h2>  The second way: "the heritage of the ancestors" </h2><p>  The next way will teach you how to make a very beautiful notebook in the style of an old book.  This will be a wonderful gift for lovers of folklore and gothic.  Its manufacture will seem a laborious process, but the result will certainly please the owner and its creator. </p><p>  In order to make a beautiful notebook, similar to an old book, you will need the following items: </p><ul><li>  white paper for photocopy; </li><li>  paper clips; </li><li>  pencil, ruler, scissors; </li><li>  thick cardboard; </li><li>  stationery clips; </li><li>  hot glue or Moment glue; </li><li>  synthetic winterizer; </li><li>  beautiful fabric; </li><li>  gauze or bandage; </li><li>  silver ribbon, lace; </li><li>  sewing machine or needle with thread; </li><li>  tea brewing. </li></ul><p>  Work algorithm: </p><ul><li>  To make an ‚Äúancient manuscript book‚Äù you need to age the leaves of a future notebook.  This process is simple and does not require much effort.  In a deep bowl, we brew five tablespoons of loose tea.  We cool the liquid and dip sheets of paper into it.  2-3 minutes are enough. After that the paper is taken out and dried, smoothed with an iron.  The sheets acquire a characteristic antiquity, a yellow tint. </li><li>  We measure out the prepared sheets according to the required size, adjust them in shape and fasten them on the sides with paper clips.  Fold in half and lay the seam with a sewing machine or manually.  To make the seam even, we sew some not very thick parts.  Thus, you get a few narrow notebooks. </li><li>  We put the blanks on top of each other and fasten them with clamps.  We smooth the folded sheets with a ruler under pressure so that they are even. </li><li>  From thick cardboard we cut out parts for the cover, measuring rectangles 3 mm smaller than the main sheets.  We apply on both sides of the folded foot and fix with clamps. </li><li>  Lubricate the side with plenty of glue, evenly distributing along the entire length.  Leave for a day until completely dry. </li><li>  Measuring with a ruler the width of the root, the length and height of the notebook, on the unnecessary paper we draw the cover for the notebook.  We cut the workpiece with 1 cm allowances so that the edges of the cover can be easily bent. </li><li>  We dress the draft cover on the future notebook, neatly fixing the edges of the paper on cardboard.  We glue the sides of cardboard and paper. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.instructables.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="make the cover" class="if uuid-3155321" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113702/3155321.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Cut the synthetic winterizer to the size of the cover and glue it to the cover. </li><li>  We measure the fabric with allowances of 1-2 cm to carefully wrap the paper blank and hide all unnecessary parts. </li><li>  Gluing the fabric, first we fix the corners, and then the rest of the cover. </li><li>  Apply glue to the side, distributing along the length and width, apply a piece of gauze.  After drying, we combine the details of the cover and notebook. </li><li>  In a day, the craft will completely dry.  Notepad is decorated with printed monograms, sequins, lace and ribbons. </li></ul><p>  The old notebook is ready. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Old book" class="if uuid-3155322" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113702/3155322.jpg"></div><h2>  The third way: "everything ingenious is simple" </h2><p>  Many girls puzzle over how to make a beautiful notebook out of paper.

We check that all sheets lie flat and do not go beyond the edges. </li><li>  Using a stapler, we connect the workpieces from the two edges of the side. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="jarrahotel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="necessary items" class="if uuid-3153538" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113702/3153538.jpg"></div><p>  A simple notebook is ready.

It will be a great glider for an adult woman or a personal diary that adolescent girls enjoy. </p><p>  Necessary materials: </p><ul><li>  scrap paper; </li><li>  white paper for photocopy; </li><li>  cord or ribbon; </li><li>  decor for a notebook, sticker letters, envelopes; </li><li>  stationery knife; </li><li>  iron ruler; </li><li>  plasticine stacks; </li><li>  pencil; </li><li>  large coin or protractor; </li><li>  an awl, a needle with a big eye, threads; </li><li>  stationery clips; </li><li>  hot glue or glue "Moment", "Second". </li></ul><p>  Step-by-step instruction: </p><ol><li>  Before you make a beautiful notebook for a girl, fold A4 paper in half.  This must be done carefully, applying a corner to the corner of the sheet so that all sides are even and do not protrude.  Folded paper is trimmed with a ruler and a stationery knife.  We measure with an iron ruler 0.5 cm from the edge of the pile and cut off the excess, leaving a flat edge of the future notebook. </li><li>  To make the glider stylish and beautiful, round off the edges of the sheets with a coin or protractor.  We apply the selected item to the edge of the sheets, draw a rounding pencil and cut it with a sharp clerical knife. </li><li>  Before fastening the notebook, mark the center line with a pencil and a ruler.  With dotted strokes we make bastings for flashing the notebook. </li><li>  Go to the cover.  Select scrap paper A4 size, apply to the prepared paper block.  We mark the inflection line and pre-fold the paper in half so that then there are no careless creases. </li><li>  Stack for plasticine a couple of times go through the fold line.  We connect the cover to the block of sheets, fix it with stationery clips. </li><li>  We sew the notebook using an awl and a regular needle on the inside of the paper.  You can use a sewing machine.  Glue the seam on top with glue. </li><li>  After drying, proceed to decorating the notebook.  Glue a ribbon or cord on the outside of the cover to tie the glider.  Decorate with stickers, cards, artificial flowers. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="notebook for girls" class="if uuid-3155315" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113702/3155315.jpg"></div><h2>  Photo idea </h2><p>  Thinking about how to make a beautiful notebook as a gift to friends, you can use the above instructions and Photoshop features.
