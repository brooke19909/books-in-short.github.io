This is especially reflected in the everyday sphere of human life, where many different technical devices can significantly facilitate human life.  Such mechanisms must include a simple washing machine.  It can be classified according to type, functionality and manufacturers.  But in order for such a technique to be constantly operational and to fulfill its functional duties in full, it is necessary to monitor its proper use. </p><p>  Any owner of the washing machine wants his equipment to work properly for many years, but, unfortunately, not everyone uses the filter for the washing machine with bad water, believing that this device can be dispensed with.  And very in vain, because this simple device can not only soften water and extend the life of equipment, but also reduces energy costs.  In order to understand the feasibility of acquiring such a filter, it is necessary to take into account its properties, technical capabilities and types. </p><h2>  Should I put a water purifier? </h2><p>  Of course, a washing machine can work without such an additional device.  But do not forget that <span>hard water</span> with impurities of dirt and rust adversely affects household appliances and over time this will, without a doubt, lead to its breakdown. </p><p>  This is especially true for residents of old houses, where pipes have not changed since the Soviet era and during the period of use of 20 years they have already exhausted their resources twice.  In many respects, therefore, more than half of all malfunctions of the washing machine associated with the heating element occur due to poor water quality.  But each owner of such household appliances is able to extend its service life. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A filter for a washing machine in bad water is an affordable device that traps foreign particles.  Also, such a cleaning device will protect the heating element from scale.  This is especially true for residents of houses where the water hardness level is increased. </p><h2>  How does the manufacturer solve this issue? </h2><p>  In most modern models of washing machines, the installation of such equipment of a standard type is already provided.  As a rule, it is located at the point of connection of the inlet hose to the device body.  In appearance, such a filter looks like a small grid. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="filter for washing machine in bad water" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/1478992.jpg"></div>

    <p>  However, do not forget that over time, such a technical device becomes dirty and must be cleaned.  At the same time, it should be noted that such a filter is designed only for large particles of rust and other dirt in the water mass.  Small particles, despite this, continue to fall into the tank. </p><p>  For more effective cleaning, an additional filter is necessary for the washing machine in bad water.  The types of these devices are different, so everyone can choose the most convenient option for themselves.  Therefore, most owners decide to purchase such a filter. </p><h2>  Main filter </h2><p>  The device does not apply to the main parts and mechanisms of the washing machine.  This option is intended for widespread use.  With its help, all water entering the apartment is cleaned.  The device is installed on the inlet water pipes.  The main principle of operation of such a mechanism is to purify water from various foreign particles.  Unfortunately, it does not change the chemical composition of water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="filter for washing machine in bad water types" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/1478994.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The component that is used to reduce water hardness is a consumable that needs to be supplemented over time.  A full flask is enough for 10,000 liters of water.  Those consumers who use this filter for a washing machine with bad water leave mostly positive reviews.  It is inexpensive, the filler can be found in any specialized store, scale on the heating element is practically not formed. </p><h2>  Magnetic softener </h2><p>  No installation required.  Designed to soften water.  Such a filter is attached to the washing machine in case of bad water over the inlet hose.  The principle of operation is a magnetic field.  The manufacturer does not give a detailed description of how such a device improves the chemical composition of water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="filter for a washing machine in bad water photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/1478995.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  How to choose a suitable option? </h2><p>  If dirty water runs from a tap in an apartment with impurities precipitating, it is best to install a common main filter.  If this is not possible, the cleaning element must be mounted directly in front of the washing machine. </p><p>  If the landlord doubts whether a softening filter for the washing machine is bad in bad water, it is recommended to conduct a laboratory test, and based on this, decide which cleaning device to purchase. </p><h2>  Installation of cleaning devices </h2><p>  It is made depending on the type: </p><ol><li>  Installation of main and deep filter cleaning.

It is installed according to the principle of a deep filter.  The equipment is located in front of the technical device.  The installation and maintenance of the filter can be handled independently, without the help of a specialist. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="filter for washing machine in bad water" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/1478996.jpg"></div></li><li>  Installation of a magnetic water softener.
