The former Muslim fishing village suddenly turned out to be very popular among tourists.  And all because on a crowded island, it was Kamala Beach (Phuket) that turned out to be the most suitable for a relaxing vacation, as if somewhere on Koh Samui or Koh Phangan.  It especially attracts travelers who came not for the sake of nightlife and dubious pleasures a la Pattaya.  It is located in the western part of the island, north of the bustling Patong.  There are not so many luxury hotels here, mainly ‚Äútriples‚Äù and ‚Äúfours‚Äù.  But let's talk about everything in order. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kamala Phuket Beach" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1492578.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get to Kamala </h2><p>  Arriving in Phuket by plane of international or <span>Thai airlines,</span> you transfer by taxi or minibus.  The latter will cost half the price - about four hundred baht.  It‚Äôs even cheaper to get to the island‚Äôs capital by bus, and from there by another flight to Kamala Beach.  Phuket Town is a good transportation hub connected to almost any corner of the island.  The only problem is that buses run quite rarely, about once an hour.  They are blue in color and travel through Kamalu and Surin to Bang Tao.  The distance between the airport and Phuket Town is approximately the same - about twenty kilometers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Why go to the beach "Kamala" </h2><p>  Phuket is so popular among tourists that finding a cozy place where the locals are not too spoiled by vacationers, and the prices are not so high, is quite difficult.  But it is here that all these bonuses are combined, and practically there is not a single minus.  Therefore, people who stay for a long rest - three to four weeks at least, are eager to come here.  And if in season the south of this resort can be filled with people - because of the influx of people from Patong, then its northern part still remains a protected corner.  Although the resort infrastructure is not very developed, most hotels have everything you need.  And here is a paradise for divers.  After all, the beach "Kamala" (Phuket) boasts beautiful coral reefs, located not very far from the coast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kamala beach phuket reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1492580.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sea vacation </h2><p>  It‚Äôs good to swim and sunbathe on Kamala.  The beach is quite long - it stretches for one and a half to two kilometers along a very picturesque bay covered with palm trees, so there is enough space for everyone.  <span>The sand is white</span> and shallow.  The descent into the water is gentle, but the waves are not very strong.  Sun beds and deckchairs are a little expensive.  They are mainly concentrated in the south and in the center of the resort.  There they cost about two hundred baht per day.  There is a developed tourist infrastructure, many water activities and massage parlors right on the beach.  A little further you can go to any beach bar, order something - and lie on their inventory as much as you want.  But in the very north you will have to do with your own or hotel beach towels.  But there are almost no people here, and the water is very clean and clear.  This is because in the north of the Kamala beach there are almost no different skis, bananas and scooters.  But do not forget that it is dangerous to swim here during the rainy season, because very strong undercurrents begin. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Thailand Kamala Phuket Beach" class="if" height="403" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1492581.jpg" width="600"></div>

Grandiose performances are played there, where not only hundreds of people participate, but also animals.  There is also a wonderful restaurant ‚ÄúGolden Kinnaria‚Äù.  Legends go about his amazing buffet.  To get there, you need to buy an entrance ticket to the park and pay extra for a visit.  Secondly, one of the most popular entertainment on Kamal is parachuting to view the resort from above.  And if you do not decide on this, then you can climb to the top of the Khao Phon Thurat hill.  There is an excellent observation deck, from where you can see the entire beach "Kamala" <span>(Phuket).</span>  <span>The photos</span> that can be taken from there are amazing.  After all, the resort is covered with tropical forests, climbing the rocks. </p><h2>  Where to eat </h2><p>  Even if there are no such grandiose foodcourt malls as in Patong, their absence is more than compensated by various stalls with delicious and fresh Thai food.  In addition, the main street of the resort is replete with restaurants and cafes, where you can enjoy both for a lot of money and not so much.  Yes, and on the beach itself is full of mackerel and other peddlers.  French and Italian cuisine is very popular in Kamala, so if you have the means and want to eat with a real chef, visit places like La Carbonara, Basilico and White Orchid.  Delicious <span>Thai dishes,</span> especially seafood, are cooked at Rockfish, Sweet Dreams and Ponds. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kamala beach phuket photo" class="if" height="376" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1492586.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What and where to buy </h2><p>  As already mentioned, there are no large shopping centers, but everywhere there are small shops.  Tourists buy here everything they need for relaxation - mattresses, towels, mats, flip flops, swimwear and more.  Souvenirs, simple clothes and shoes are also sold at affordable prices.  Since the beach "Kamala" (Phuket) - reviews confirm this - is the Muslim part of Thailand, the main market here is open on Fridays.  Come and you will not regret it.  You will not find so many goodies, including dried exotic fruits, as well as branded items at ridiculous prices. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels on Kamala Phuket beach" class="if" height="252" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1492590.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What to see </h2><p>  In the south of the resort there is a rather interesting Buddhist temple with beautiful modern murals illustrating the life of Gautama.  Nearby is a cozy park with a memorial to the victims of the 2004 tsunami.  It is known that the village of Kamala was wiped off this terrible catastrophe, and then completely rebuilt.  In addition to the Fantasea park, where a theatrical circus show about the ancient prince of Kamala with dances, various special effects and a demonstration of ancient Thai magic unfolds, you can visit other shows that take place in the Elephant Palace.  And on Fridays, the most famous bar in the vicinity - Skyla - organizes a disco with professional DJs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews about Phuket Kamala Beach" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1492597.jpg" width="480"></div>

    <h2>  Resort Hotels </h2><p>  The hotels on Kamala Beach (Phuket) are mainly located along Beach Road.  Unlike most resorts of the island, there is no road between the local hotels and the sea, so here you can find hotels on the first line from the sea.  Of the luxurious five-star palaces, the most popular are Ayyara Resort, Cape Sienna Hotel &amp; Villas and Naka Phuket.  Ayara Kamala is located on a hill, quite far from the beach, but it offers beautiful views from its rooms and a free shuttle to the sea. </p><p>  But Cape Sienna, on the contrary, is located on the ocean.  Therefore, all its rooms and villas (some have not only their own kitchens and private pools, but even wine cellars) - overlooking the sea. </p><p>  Fours are usually located across from the beach.  The best of them are Aquamarine and Swissotel.  The latter is interesting in that it is located not too far from the Phuket Jangseilon shopping center, and also has its own mini-water park. </p><p>  Hotels on the beach "Kamala" (Phuket, 1 line) are also three-star.  They are few, they are simple, but very functional.  An example is the Kamala Beach Inn.  There are many cheap guesthouses and apartments at the resort, such as Tara Hotel, Baan Hostel and so on. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels on the beach Kamala Phuket 1 line" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1492599.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Thailand, Kamala Beach (Phuket): reviews </h2><p>  This corner of the island is very popular with couples, lovers and young people seeking solitude.  The beach is more loved by the French, Germans and other Europeans; there are not many Russians here.  But those who have visited this region call Kamalu the best place in Phuket.  Few tourists, clear water, clean white sand, and there is everything you need.  A lot of shade from palm trees that grow everywhere.  There are even semi-wild beaches where you can hardly meet people.  Moreover, it does not bother here.  People rest mostly decent.  Reviews about Phuket hotels (Kamala beach) are very positive.  Staying in five-star hotels is called an elite rest, complete relaxation and pastime in a luxury style.  But about cheaper hotels, too, great feedback, especially about the ratio of price, quality and services.  In some hotels, a good view of the sea, in others - all conditions are created for a romantic vacation or vacation with children.  Come! </p>
