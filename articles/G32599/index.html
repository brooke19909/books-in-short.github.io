Currently, most no longer use them, but throwing up <span>does not raise a hand.</span>  The story of a <span>faceted glass,</span> who invented when - all this information is covered in secrets and legends.  The article will try to figure it all out. </p><h2>  Legends about the appearance of a faceted glass </h2><p>  Many objects and <span>things of the Soviet</span> era have a lot of legends about their origin.  This is not spared by the well-known <span>faceted glass.</span>  The history of its creation is shrouded in many legends.  Here are just a few of them that go around his appearance. </p>

    <ol><li>  Everyone has heard the name of the monumental artist Vera Mukhina.  This is the same master who designed the sculpture "Worker and Collective Farm Girl".  So, according to one of the legends, she is the one who invented the faceted glass.  It is believed that this was helped by her beloved husband, who for long evenings liked to skip a glass or two of alcoholic drink. </li><li>  Many are inclined to the version according to which the Soviet engineer Nikolai Slavyanov put his hand to the invention of a faceted glass.  He was a master of mining, then became a professor of geology.  Among his friends and acquaintances, he is known for his discoveries in the field of arc welding and compaction of castings using electricity.  The high level of development of the metallurgical industry in Soviet times is attributed to his merits. Initially, Slavyanov proposed making a glass of metal, and the options contained sketches of products with 10, 20 and 30 faces.  It was only then that Mukhina proposed to produce such a glass in a glass form. </li><li>  Another legend explains where the faceted glass came from.  The history of its creation is connected with the times of Peter the Great.  One Vladimir master of glass making, Yefim Smolin, presented the tsar with a gift with the assurances that it is practically impossible to break it.  Peter drank wine from it and threw it to the ground, saying the words: "A glass to be."  But, unfortunately, the glass broke.  However, the ruler did not show his anger.  Since then, a tradition has arisen of beating dishes during a feast. </li></ol><h2>  Where did the word "glass" come from </h2><p>  Not only the story of the faceted glass is quite foggy and contradictory, but the name of the subject itself has several opinions about its origin. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  From historical information, it is known that in the 17th century there was dishes that were made from ground small plates connected by rings, and it was called ‚Äúfinished‚Äù.  Many people think that the name of faceted glasses came from this word. </p><p>  According to another version, the word is of Turkic origin, in this language there were such words as ‚Äúdastarkhan‚Äù, meaning a festive table, and ‚ÄúTustygan‚Äù - a cup.  From the combination of these two words, the name of the glass arose, which they began to use. </p><h2>  The first Soviet glass </h2><p>  The history of faceted glass in Russia begins in 1943, when the first representative of the army of glasses came down from the conveyor of a glass factory in Gus-Khrustalny.  Many believe that this form is not just a fantasy of the artist, but a necessity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is the story of a faceted glass in Russia" class="if" height="477" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28542/1010492.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It turns out that back in those days, the first dishwashers appeared that could only perform their functions when dishes of a certain shape and size were immersed in them.  So I had to produce a glass with faces, and not round walls. </p><h2>  The appearance of a ‚Äúforeigner‚Äù in Russia </h2><p>  According to historical information, in 1943, not the first representative of faceted glasses, but the updated old one came off the assembly line of the glass factory in Gus-Khrustalny.  The history of a faceted glass (16 faces) claims that it appeared a long time ago. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  They came up with this ware item not in the USSR, but also in Russia, in the 17th century.  Evidence of this is the exhibits stored in the Hermitage. </p><p>  Confirm the antiquity of the origin of glasses and mention in a special army doctrine, which was published by Paul I in the late 18th century.  At that time, the monarch tried to reform the army, which was far from full combat readiness, and ordered a faceted glass to limit the daily dose of wine that was supposed to be for soldiers in the army. </p><p>  There is an opinion that the history of faceted glass is not connected at all with Russia.  An excellent confirmation of this is a painting by Diego Velazcas called ‚ÄúBreakfast‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="faceted glass creation story" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28542/1010430.jpg" width="469"></div>

    <p>  On the table you can also see a faceted glass, only the edges are not vertical, but slightly arched.  If you look at the time of writing the picture, and this was in 1617-1618, you can confidently say that the faceted glass, its history is not connected with Russia at all, but with abroad. </p><p>  This fact is confirmed by the fact that the method of making glasses that was used in the USSR was invented only in 1820 - the pressing method.  Launched production using such technology was already in the middle of the 19th century, and it came to Russia only in the 20th century. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  What is the secret of high strength glasses? </h2><p>  Soviet faceted glasses not only had a convenient shape and did not slip in the hand, but they were also very durable.  This was achieved by a decent wall thickness, as well as the use of special technologies. </p><p>  The raw materials for making glass for faceted glasses were cooked at a huge temperature in the range of 1400-1600 degrees, then the firing and cutting process was carried out using special technologies.  There was a period of time when lead was added to the fabrication mixture to increase strength, which is commonly used in the manufacture of crystal glassware. </p><h2>  Faceted Glass Production </h2><p>  Glassworks began to produce glasses of different volumes and having a different number of faces.  The volume could vary from 50 ml to 250, and the faces were from 8 to 14. </p><p>  The classic story of a faceted glass is considered a product with a volume of 250 ml and having 10 faces.  With its help, you can accurately measure the right amount of bulk and liquid products. </p><p>  In the 80s, they began to replace equipment in glass factories with imported ones, which led to the loss of familiar qualities of a faceted glass. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="who invented the faceted glass" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26186/1011077.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The glass, which until now had excellent durability, withstood temperature extremes and falling from the table, began to crack on the sides.  Some fell off the bottom.  The culprit is a violation of manufacturing technology. </p><h2>  Characteristics of faceted glasses </h2><p>  Despite the fact that there is a lot of information about who invented the faceted glass, the history and appearance in Russia are also contradictory, yet the characteristics remain the same.  And they differ from those of other similar products. </p><ul><li>  The diameter of the uppermost part is from 7.2 to 7.3 cm. </li><li>  The diameter of the bottom of the glass is 5.5 cm. </li><li>  The height of the glass product is 10.5 centimeters. </li><li>  The number of faces is most often 16 or 20. </li><li>  There is an edge along the top of the glass, the width of which is from 1.4 to 2.1 cm. </li></ul><p>  All glasses of the Soviet era, produced at different glass factories, had such characteristics. </p><h2>  The advantage of a faceted glass over other similar products </h2><p>  In the open spaces of the former Soviet Union, faceted glass is widespread, due to its advantages over its brothers. </p><ol><li>  It doesn‚Äôt roll off the table, for example, on a seagoing vessel during pitching and movement on waves. </li><li>  The popularity in catering establishments <span>is</span> explained by its high strength. </li><li>  Fans of drinking alcohol chose this item, since with its help it was easy to divide the bottle into three.  If you pour the liquid to the rim, then in one glass is placed just the third part of a half-liter bottle. </li><li>  The glass remains intact when falling from a decent height.  Such strength is due precisely to the presence of faces that give this property to brittle glass. </li></ol><h2>  Modern faceted glass life </h2><p>  If in Soviet times, a faceted glass was an indispensable attribute of every kitchen, now it is not so easy to find such an item of utensils.  Everything can be explained by the fact that most glass factories discontinued these products. </p><p>  At the factory in Gus-Khrustalny, where, as the story of a faceted glass says, the first faceted representative was produced, other glasses are produced that are completely transparent, which cannot be said about faceted.  Representatives of the Soviet era are produced only on order. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="faceted glass story" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28542/1010418.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Now for some, a faceted glass is an occasion to entertain the audience and become famous for themselves.  In 2005, at the celebration of the city‚Äôs day in Izhevsk, a tall tower was built almost 2.5 meters high from faceted glasses.  2024 glasses went to such a structure.  The idea belonged to one distillery. </p><h2>  Interesting faceted glass </h2><p>  No matter what the story of a faceted glass in Russia, it has always been used not only for its intended purpose.  The mistresses of the old school sometimes found him the most unexpected uses. </p>

    <ol><li>  The most famous use is the cutting with it of preparations for dumplings, dumplings.  If a larger diameter was required, then a large glass was taken, and if necessary, stacks were used.  Despite the fact that now there are a lot of devices to facilitate this process, many housewives have not stopped using an old and reliable glass for this. </li><li>  The faceted glass in the Soviet kitchen was a universal measuring device.  In old culinary editions, products for cooking were measured not in grams, but in glasses. </li><li>  Quite unusual is the use of a faceted glass as a dehumidifier.  He could often be seen standing between double glazing in winter.  Salt was poured into the glass so that the windows would not freeze.  Nowadays, instead of wooden frames, plastic bags flaunt on our windows, so there is no place for a faceted glass. </li><li>  Summer residents adapted to use faceted glasses for growing seedlings.  They look more aesthetically pleasing, do not leave trash after themselves, unlike peat cups. </li><li>  A glass can be used to demonstrate optical phenomena: if you pour water into it and put a teaspoon, it seems that it is broken. </li></ol>

    <p>  This use of glasses was practiced in Soviet times, although some methods of use have been preserved even now, and no one thinks who invented the faceted glass.  In modern kitchens, modern utensils flaunt on shelves, which looks more advantageous compared to a faceted glass, but many housewives, if there is such a rarity in their pantries, are in no hurry to get rid of it. </p><h2>  Glass Facts </h2><p>  There are some facts that are associated with a faceted glass.  Here is some of them: </p><ol><li>  The cost of such dishes depended on the number of faces.  A glass with 10 faces cost 3 kopecks, and with 16 faces - 7 kopecks.  The volume did not depend on the number of faces; it always remained unchanged - 250 ml. </li><li>  The spread of alcoholism in Moldova is associated with a faceted glass.  Historical information makes it possible to know that before the liberation from the fascists of the country by Soviet soldiers, citizens drank from small 50 ml glasses, and the Russians brought with them capacious (250 ml) faceted glasses. </li><li>  People called the Soviet faceted glass ‚ÄúMalenkovsky‚Äù.  Defense Minister Malenkov issued an order according to which 200 ml of vodka was given to a soldier.  Although this rule did not last long, many remember it. </li></ol><p>  Here are just some facts that are inextricably linked to a faceted glass. </p><h2>  Faceted holiday </h2><p>  We examined and remembered in detail about the faceted glass (history, how many faces), but it turns out that this piece of tableware has its own holiday. </p><p>  It is celebrated every year on September 11th.  This date was chosen for a reason, on this day at the glass factory in Gus-Khrustalny the mass production of these items of dishes began.  This holiday date is not considered official, but rather a national holiday, therefore not very pleasant traditions are associated with it. </p><p>  A Russian person is always not opposed to finding a reason to relax with a glass of alcoholic drink, and here, as a find, such a holiday, it‚Äôs just not a sin to drink.  Here's what to expect from such a celebration. </p><ul><li>  Of faceted glasses, it is supposed to drink only vodka, other alcoholic drinks are not associated in any way with this glassware. </li><li>  It is necessary to drink not alone, but always in the company, because it is with a faceted glass that the expression "figure out for three" is associated. </li><li>  One of the traditions of this holiday is breaking the ‚Äúhero‚Äù of the celebration on the floor. </li><li>  It would be nice to recall that tea, jelly, compote and water are drunk from faceted glasses.  Everyone remembers such glasses in cup holders in train cars. </li></ul><p>  We can say that between the concepts of "faceted glass," "history of our country," you can put an equal sign.  These two concepts are inextricably linked.  I would very much like that they would give the Nobel Prize for such an invention, and not make it a permanent attribute of all feasts. </p>
