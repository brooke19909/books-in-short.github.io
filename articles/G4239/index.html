    <p>  First of all, water affects the wear of parts.  In different regions of the country, its rigidity is different.  Moreover, the contamination of the pipeline in the regions can be critical.  In addition, problems at the power plant can lead to damage to the electronic board that is installed in the washing machine. </p><h2>  How to find out the error code? </h2><p>  If we talk about washing machines that have a display, then the error code can easily be recognized by the inscription that appears there.  In this case, you should first refer to the instructions that are attached to the model.  In it you can learn in detail about the problem that has arisen, as well as ways to solve it.  In some cases, you can fix the problems yourself without contacting a service center.  However, in any case, you should carefully read the safety rules that are indicated in the instructions, and be sure to turn off the power to the washing machine before use. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Most common mistakes </h2><p>  Most often, consumers turn to service centers due to a breakdown of the water level sensor.  This part in the washing machine is quite moody.  As its name implies, it transfers information about filling the tank with water to the control board.  The specified sensor consists of a system unit with contacts, as well as a tube.  In some cases, only the hose is damaged.  It can either disconnect from the unit or break as a result of mechanical damage.  In any case, the error code "1E" can be seen on the display of the washing machine. </p><p>  The second common problem is considered to be a malfunction with an electric motor.  The device is quite complex and its overloads always end in disrepair.  They arise, for example, when the owner loads too much laundry into the drum.  Also, the engine can be blocked if any object hit it.  In this case, the code ‚Äú3E‚Äù can be seen on the display. </p>

    <h2>  What to do with the code "1E"? </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, when the Samsung washing machine does not work, the error ‚ÄúlE‚Äù signals problems with the water sensor.  In order to independently cope with the breakdown, you will need to disassemble the device case.  To this end, it is first necessary to remove the back panel of the washing machine.  Next you can see the drain pump at the top.  Directly behind it is a water level sensor. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In order to remove the drain pump, you need to use a screwdriver.  After that, carefully inspect the sensor.  If defects are visible on the tube, it is replaced.  In some cases, it may just fall out of the block.  In this situation, it must be fixed there.  When the unit breaks, the sensor must be completely replaced.  You can purchase it at a service center by reporting the model of the washing machine. </p><h2>  Error in the washing machine "4E" </h2><p>  If the error "4E" is visible on the display, the Samsung washing machine does not turn on due to a valve breakdown.  This may be due to a foreign object that accidentally touched it.  Additionally, valve contacts may be broken.  At the same time, its winding is damaged.  In order to find out the exact cause of the breakdown, experts advise the first thing to check the correct connection of the hoses.  In some cases, the hot and cold water supply may be interrupted. </p>

    <p>  If no defects are found, remove the back cover of the washing machine and check the pipe at the connection point.  When it is broken, it is best to replace the cold water hose immediately.  Alternatively, you can consider the use of sealant.  If the damage is minor, it can simply be repaired. </p><h2>  Problems with the tachogenerator </h2><p>  Problems with tachogenerators are quite common.  In some cases, they arise precisely because of contacts.  In such a situation, the code "3E" appears on the display.  If this problem is detected, the motor winding is inspected first by a specialist.  It can be broken by overheating.  Additionally, third-party items can cause a malfunction. </p><p>  As an example: an unscrewed screw can get onto the winding.  Thus, the contacts are broken, and the engine is not able to operate normally.  If the problem is the tachogenerator relay, then users on the displays see the errors of the Samsung - 3E2 washing machine.  In this situation, the signal between the contacts will be very weak.  You can fix this problem by cleaning the relay.  If it is dirty, then the contacts are naturally blocked.  Even in the engine tachogenerator, the sensor may break.  This happens quite rarely, but the problem is considered serious.  In this case, the displays show the errors of the Samsung washing machine - "3E3".  To fix this problem, you should check all the contacts.  The gap between them should not be significant.  In this case, the signal from the sensor will pass stably. </p><h2>  What is the "5E" code related to? </h2><p>  When the Samsung washing machine stops working, the 5e error tells the user about problems with draining the water.  Most often, the malfunction lies precisely in the pump, or rather its impeller.  This element is located in the washing machine above the engine.  In order to inspect it, you must first remove the protective filter.  After that, it will be possible to twist the pump and check it.  The impeller on it is located in the lower part. </p><p>  In order to replace it, you need to use the key.  If, ultimately, the pump turns out to be operable, then the problem clearly lies in the drain hose that the Samsung washing machine has.  Error "5E" in this situation may indicate that the pipe is simply clamped.  In the worst situation, it will have to be cleaned or changed.  The drain hose is clogged most often due to the fact that various objects, such as coins and buttons, can get into it. </p><h2>  Code washing machine "UE" </h2><p>  When the Samsung washing machine is broken, the ‚ÄúUE‚Äù error signals the owner about imbalance problems.  This suggests that the laundry in the device is stacked unevenly.  As a result, the drum skews.  In this situation, the engine is not able to gain normal speed. </p>

    <p>  This error may well occur due to congestion.  In order to avoid it, one should pay attention to the model parameters.  In the instructions for the washing machine, the user can find information about the maximum allowable weight of the laundry that the drum can withstand. </p><h2>  Error washing machine "SE" </h2><p>  If the Samsung <span>washing machine does not turn</span> on, a ‚ÄúSE‚Äù error indicates a cooling problem.  This malfunction is primarily affected by the discharge of water in the pipeline system.  This happens due to the fact that its temperature is too high and exceeds 55 degrees.  There can be several reasons for this failure.  Most often, the problem of cooling lies in the sensor, which is installed in the washing machine. </p><p>  At the same time, everything is normal with the water temperature, but the system does not see this.  To solve this problem, a complete sensor replacement is required.  When disassembling the washing machine, all connections should be checked, since the reason may be that the pipes are not in place.  In this case, you can repair the model by simply putting everything in its place. </p><h2>  Engine problems (code "8E") </h2><p>  Errors of the Samsung washing machine "8E" are issued with an unstable rotation of the engine.  The reason for this can be considered violation of signals in contact.  Additionally, the control unit may be faulty.  First of all, it is the motor contacts that should be inspected.  If they are dirty, they need to be cleaned. </p><p>  When the problem is in the control unit, it is quite difficult to do something on your own.  The simplest action is to replace this part.  However, it should be borne in mind that <span>the control unit</span> is an expensive thing, and when purchasing it, you need to be sure of its necessity. </p><h2>  Power errors </h2><p>  When excessive voltage is supplied from the mains, the display will show ‚Äú9E1‚Äù.  In order to fix such <span>error codes of the Samsung washing machine,</span> it is necessary to check the current in the network.  This operation can be done using the tester.  This device is attached to all power contacts.  During the operation of the washing machine, it is also necessary to monitor the tester. </p><p>  In some cases, a malfunction may be caused by the use of an extension cord.  If its length exceeds 1 meter, then voltage reduction is possible.  The most unpleasant is the breakdown of the control unit.  In this situation, the voltage is normal, but the washing machine does not see this.  This problem is solved by replacing the control module.  However, with the code "9E1" this happens very rarely. </p><h2>  Why does ‚ÄúAE‚Äù appear on the display? </h2><p>  The inscription on the display "AE" is mainly associated with the display system of the model.  In order to fix such error codes for the Samsung washing machine, experts disassemble the control module.  At this point, all connectors must be checked for integrity.  If any defects are visible, they should be corrected.  Most often they arise due to improper soldering.  In the end, this can be called factory marriage.  If after checking the display system malfunctions, the control module changes completely. </p>

    <h2>  Code "FE": causes of failure and elimination </h2><p>  These errors generated by the Samsung washing machine indicate ventilation problems.  You can try to solve them yourself, without contacting a service center.  First, remove the back cover of the device.  There is a fan, usually on the side panel.  First of all, you need to inspect the capacitor connector. </p><p>  In some cases, its top cover may not hold.  If the capacitor is in order, then it is necessary to check the fan directly, namely its wiring.  If defects are visible on it, it should be replaced or sealed.  In this case, it is important to observe safety rules so as not to violate the isolation of the system.  Lastly, to eliminate the indicated error in Samsung washing machines, specialists examine the fan from the inside.  In this case, you need to start with the blades. </p><p>  If they lock and anything interferes with them, then the fan must be completely cleaned from dust.  Also, the problem may lie in poor-quality bearings.  As a rule, after some time they have the property of falling out.  It is very problematic to replace them independently.  Given this, it is more advisable to return the fan for repair to a service center. </p>
