  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What to choose speakers in the car: an overview of the best models and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Which car owner does not like to ride with the breeze, and even to the sounds of his favorite composition?  But in order to enjoy the high-quality sound of music, you should carefully approach the choice of speakers in the car.  Consider what to look for when choosing, we will analyze the main types and types of acoustics, as well as the rating of <span>speakers</span> depending on various indicators and user reviews. </p><h2>  Types of acoustics in a car </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Speakers" class="if uuid-2462717" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2462717.jpg"></div><p>  Before deciding which <span>speakers to</span> put <span>in the car</span> , it is worth familiarizing yourself with the <span>types of speakers.</span> </p><p>  Types of acoustics for cars: </p><ul><li>  Broadband - the sound is reproduced by one speaker, the system is easy to install, while there is no clear sound quality of music, but such speakers are in a low price category. </li><li>  Component - there are several speakers, because of which the sound is reproduced cleanly and without interference, the effect of ‚Äúpresence‚Äù is created, as it were, but the system requires certain knowledge during installation and is also expensive. </li><li>  Coaxial - the average option between broadband and component acoustics, the sound quality is high, the installation is simple, but you need to further configure the speakers. </li><li>  Mid-range - used with twitter, but not very popular with car enthusiasts. </li><li>  Cabinet - all speakers are built into the body, so the installation of the system is simple, but such speakers are dimensional, which requires a rather large space in the car. </li></ul><h2>  Where is better to place? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="blog.sonicelectronix.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Good car sound" class="if uuid-2462719" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2462719.jpg"></div><p>  Good speakers in the car - this is not only a properly selected technique according to the parameters, but also a good choice of location in the car.  It is this parameter that determines to a greater degree how the system will sound and whether it will be heard at all by both passengers and the driver of the vehicle. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Speakers are not placed in the side latches of the rear shelf and in the kick panels.  The optimal location for the acoustics is the front doors of the car, while the speakers should be located at the level of the head and ears of the driver.  Thus, the sound covers a large area of ‚Äã‚Äãdistribution and is well audible in the rear seats. </p><p>  There are also some special places for speakers already installed in some cars.  But they are not always chosen correctly, therefore, in order to get high-quality sound, the design should be redone.  For example, in the front doors of Daewoo Lanos there is a broadband speaker with a diameter of 10 cm in plastic catwalks, but even if you replace it with a more expensive look, you will not get high-quality sound.  If you replace the plastic podium with a wooden one, then it will be possible to install larger speakers and significantly improve the quality of music playback. </p><h2>  Criterias of choice </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.azom.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="which speakers are better to put in the car" class="if uuid-2462723" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2462723.jpg"></div><p>  When choosing a speaker in a car, you should pay attention to the following indicators: </p><p>  <em>Manufacturing firm</em> </p><p>  It is worth choosing the brand that has been on the <span>speaker</span> market for a long time, and its equipment is very popular.  For example, MTX, Focal, DLS, Infinity, Hertz, Alpine, Morel, Magnat and others.  Users also noted the Pioneer speakers in the car, which, although inexpensive, provide high-quality sound. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <em>Speaker and tweeter suspension</em> </p><p>  It is better to choose a rubber suspension, not cloth, tweeters - silk.  Thus, the sound will be cleaner, smoother and softer. </p><p>  <em>Space availability</em> </p><p>  If the space in the cabin allows, then it is better to take larger speakers.  The rear speakers in the car are usually selected in sizes of 6 x 9 inches or up to 20 cm in diameter. </p><p>  <em>Radio Features</em> </p><p>  Any speakers are selected depending on the characteristics of the radio.  There is a rather "finicky" technique, which requires the installation of only certain models or types of speakers. </p><h2>  The main characteristics of acoustics </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Acoustic Installation" class="if uuid-2462724" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2462724.jpg"></div><p>  Car owners and experts advise you to pay attention to the following characteristics when choosing speakers in a car: </p><ul><li>  Playback frequency - there are such systems that reproduce the bottoms or only the tops well, and there are universal options that perfectly cope with sound of different frequencies. </li><li>  Size - round or oval (the larger the size, the cleaner the lower frequencies sound). </li><li>  Power - rated and maximum (to be specified upon purchase). </li><li>  Frequencies - a wide range on which the sound quality depends. </li><li>  Sensitivity is an optimal parameter from 85 dB. </li></ul><h2>  Review of the best models </h2><div class="photo" data-original="international.mtx.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Different design and shape" class="if uuid-2462726" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2462726.jpg"></div><p>  To answer the question of which good speakers to choose in a car, specialists, as well as car enthusiasts, created a special rating depending on the type of acoustics. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  <em>Coaxial system</em> </p><ol><li>  Hertz MPX 165.3 - the best 16 cm speakers from this group, provide smooth and high-quality sound reproduction even at high volume, but require certain installation parameters, the high cost of the system. </li><li>  Focal 165 AC - sensitivity up to 90 dB, the tilt of the tweeters can be adjusted, the low-quality sound, but the upper key is somewhat weak. </li><li>  Morel Tempo Coax 6 - affordable system cost, high power and sensitivity, but low frequencies are not enough. </li><li>  Infinity REF-6522ix - a budget option, textile tweeters, well-processed bottoms, but at high volume there is noise and interference. </li><li>  Pioneer TS-1339 is the most common acoustics among users, three frequency bands, beautiful design, affordable price, but not enough low frequencies, while the number of highs is clearly overstated. </li></ol><p>  <em>Component system</em> </p><ol><li>  Hertz MLK 1650.3 - high sensitivity and excellent sound reproduction regardless of volume, but high cost and installation complexity. </li><li>  Morel Virtus 603 - low sensitivity, but good sound quality. </li><li>  Focal 165 KRX2 - reproduces sound well, but a fairly simple crossover. </li><li>  Audio System Radion 165 - low cost, high-quality tweeter, but not enough crossovers. </li><li>  Hertz ESK 165.5 - virtually no distortion, but tweeters sound rude. </li><li>  Alpine SPG-17CS - silk tweeters, good sound, low cost of the system, but the bass does not sound high enough. </li></ol><p>  <em>6 x 9 speakers</em> </p><ol><li>  Morel MAXIMO-Coax6x9 - excellent bottoms, but not very good "top". </li><li>  Alpine SPG-69C3 - running system, works well on the bottoms, but poorly reproduces sound in the middle and upper keys. </li><li>  Polk Audio DB691 - good sensitivity, but the "bottom" sound a little weak. </li></ol><p>  <em>Case speakers</em> </p><ol><li>  Mystery MJ 105BX - low price, small size, ease of installation, but low-quality low frequencies. </li></ol><h2>  Recommendations </h2><div class="photo" data-original="knowledge.sonicelectronix.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Installation Rules" class="if uuid-2462728" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2462728.jpg"></div><p>  Experts, as well as users of car speakers, give some tips regarding the purchase, installation and type of speakers in the car: </p><ul><li>  Acoustics should be purchased only at specialized points of sale, the presence of a quality certificate and a guarantee is a mandatory purchase criterion. </li><li>  The speaker input must match what the car has, because this parameter may differ depending on the make of the car. </li><li>  If a car radio with a GPS module is installed in the car, then the acoustics should be selected depending on the brands recommended by the manufacturer, otherwise the speakers will interfere with the navigation system. </li><li>  Each type of radio has certain parameters that are taken into account when choosing speakers (if the model is cheap, then buying expensive speakers for it is simply pointless). </li><li>  If the car has taken measures to insulate the cabin, then the sound will sound clearer and louder, regardless of the installed speakers. </li><li>  Installation is best entrusted to specialists. </li></ul><h2>  Motorist reviews </h2><p>  Users speak positively about the two-way speakers Pioneer TS-G6932I.  Their beautiful appearance and high-quality sound are noted, and all this for the relatively low cost of the system.  The JBL GTO-528 model, although it has high quality parameters, but when buying such speakers in the car, users recommend being careful, because there is a certain marriage in such a system.  For example, soldering was incorrectly performed in one of the speakers, which can lead to a short circuit. </p><p>  Car owners also noted the good sound of the Hertz MPX 165.3, Focal 165 AC system, but not everyone has enough sound power, <span>Morel Tempo Coax 6</span> (no wheezing), Infinity REF-6522ix (good value for money). </p><p>  Such models are easily installed: Pioneer TS-1339, Hertz MLK 1650.3 (easy, good, but expensive), Morel Virtus 603 (great sound).  Acoustics Alpine SPG-17CS, although it is considered the most common, as it can be found in any store, but does not differ in sound quality, as users note. </p><h2>  6 x 9 speakers or subwoofer? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="blog.sonicelectronix.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rear speakers in cars" class="if uuid-2462731" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2462731.jpg"></div><p>  Many car owners are wondering which speakers are best to put in a car, or maybe you should choose a subwoofer?  To do this, you need to know several characteristics.  So, 16 cm speakers reproduce bass better than 13 cm counterparts.  But even in this case, low frequencies are not enough.  Installing a subwoofer will help to complement this playback area, which will provide both loud and low sound. </p><p>  An alternative to the subwoofer is a 6 x 9 inch speaker.  They have good sensitivity (up to 92 dB / W), but subwoofers up to a maximum of 89 dB, and even finding such parameters in the technology is problematic.  In addition, ‚Äúovals‚Äù or ‚Äúpancakes‚Äù, as the 6 x 9 speakers are called, work from the already built-in radio amplifier, and a separate external power amplifier is needed for the subwoofer, which will also affect the cost of the system. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Since the car is not only a luxury, but also a means of transportation, therefore, every car owner wants to make such a pastime in the vehicle as pleasant as possible.  Playing your favorite music, besides loud and high-quality sound, depends directly on the selected speakers in the car.  After reviewing the rating, as well as reviews of both car owners and specialists, you can easily make the right choice. </p>
