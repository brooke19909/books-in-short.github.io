This city in itself is already the place that you must visit at least once in your life.  A lot of architectural monuments are concentrated in it, but there are places where something inexplicable happens.  But first things first. </p><h2>  Monastery of the Transfiguration </h2><div class="photo" data-original="stk33.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Transfiguration Monastery" class="if uuid-2539767" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70525/2539767.jpg"></div><p>  This monastery is considered the main attraction of Yaroslavl.  It is called the local Kremlin, and there is a reason.  If you compare both buildings, you can find a lot of coincidences, down to the stone wall surrounding the building, which was built around the Moscow version later. </p><p>  The center of the monastery is the Cathedral of the Transfiguration, which was built in the thirteenth century.  In the sixteenth century, a fire broke out in it, during which the building was badly damaged.  Later it was almost rebuilt. </p><p>  Tourists will be interested in looking at the frescoes and icons preserved from the time of Grozny.  It is important that the cathedral is closed to visitors from early October to early May. </p><p>  The central entrance to the monastery territory is also recognized as one of the main attractions of Yaroslavl.  This is due to the good preservation of the building, despite the fact that it was built in the sixteenth century. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Embankment of the Volga River </h2><div class="photo" data-original="yourenta.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City Embankment" class="if uuid-2539800" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70525/2539800.jpg"></div><p>  Another of the main attractions of Yaroslavl can be called the embankment.  Both locals and tourists are not indifferent to this place.  The high fortified shore, a beautiful view and an overview of the whole of Yaroslavl attract people.  According to legend, it is from this place that the city originates.  He even got a name - Arrow.  The embankment of the city has long been a favorite vacation spot due to the lack of cars, fresh air and a very beautiful view of the Cathedral of the Assumption. </p><h2>  Church of the Prophet Elijah </h2><p>  The history and <span>sights of Yaroslavl are</span> connected in this place.  The church is a unique architectural monument, which with its external and internal decoration only confirms how unique architecture was in the thirteenth century.  It is also interesting that the church has not changed in any way since its construction.  Decor elements, tiles with centuries of history, beautiful patterns that decorated the facade of the building, only confirm that the history and landmark of Yaroslavl intertwined in this building.  Inside the church is no less beautiful than outside, but the old altar iconostasis and no less ancient icons that have no copies deserve special attention. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Governor's Garden </h2><p>  Not far from the famous embankment lies another attraction of the city of Yaroslavl.  A photo with a description can be found in the guide, but there is nothing better than seeing everything with your own eyes.  The garden starts from Ilyinskaya Square and ends near the Art Museum.  It was laid back in the nineteenth century.  The park is replete with marble sculptures, granite, bronze and ceramic structures.  Each sculpture has its own highlight and idea.  The garden often organizes recreational activities for citizens in the summer.  In the park is the Governor's House, which is a museum.  On excursions you can get acquainted with the art of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. </p><h2>  Church of the Epiphany </h2><p>  You can briefly describe the sights of Yaroslavl, but then it will not be clear the full extent and beauty of historical monuments.  For example, this church was built in the seventeenth century, and to this day it arouses admiration and decorates the city.  On excursions, tourists are primarily shown <span>frescoes</span> on the ceilings and walls.  The cubic shape of the church is framed by narrow high windows that look like loopholes.  Among other things, it‚Äôs interesting that the church still works, and each of its employees will be happy to tell how it all began. </p><h2>  Yaroslavl Dolphinarium </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.tourprom.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yaroslavl Dolphinarium" class="if uuid-2539804" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70525/2539804.jpg"></div><p>  One of the main attractions of Yaroslavl, although not ancient, is the dolphinarium.  For children, this is one of the best ways to spend time.  In addition to the entertainment function, the Yaroslavl Dolphinarium also performs rehabilitation.  In the same building you can see live butterflies.  An important point is that this complex is located in the village of Dubki.  The distance to it can be overcome by bus, which departs from the central bus station of the city of Yaroslavl, or by personal car. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Tolgsky Monastery </h2><p>  Among all the cities of the Golden Ring, Yaroslavl with attractions, or rather their number, takes first place.  Another architectural monument that deserves attention is the Tolgsky Monastery.  His age exceeded seven hundred years, but the monastery is still the most striking architectural monument of that time.  Tourists are recommended to visit three chapels, in one of which the relics of the founder of this monastery are stored.  And also do not forget about the church of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker and the Cathedral itself, which is the main object on the monastery territory. </p><h2>  Assumption Cathedral </h2><div class="photo" data-original="tonkosti.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Assumption Cathedral" class="if uuid-2539780" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70525/2539780.jpg"></div><p>  This church cannot be ignored.  Built in the thirteenth century, it remained intact until the two thousandths.  Most of all, sightseers pay attention to the fifty-meter church dome, which is located in the center.  Unfortunately, you won‚Äôt be able to go inside the temple, because it is still being restored, but you can visit the museum, which is located in the basement.  The exposition is represented by objects that tell the history of the temple, how it was destroyed and rebuilt. </p><h2>  Volkov Drama Theater </h2><p>  The list of the main attractions of Yaroslavl would not be complete without a theater.  All because he is one of the first theaters with professional troupes.  The founder of the theater is the son of a local merchant Fedor Volkov.  After the foundation a hundred years passed, and only then this theater was recognized as the best in all of Russia.  Today, the theater is located in the historical center of the city.  It hosts iconic productions, events of city significance, as well as a museum.  The latter presents the first programs of performances, posters, manuscripts of plays and the entire urban theater history. </p><h2>  Yaroslavl Museum of Entertaining Sciences of Einstein </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.culture.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum of Entertaining Sciences" class="if uuid-2539771" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70525/2539771.jpg"></div><p>  The main attractions of the city of Yaroslavl include this museum.  This is a fairly young museum, it is only three years old.  But he managed to fall in love with both the townspeople and tourists.  An important difference from other museums is that everything can be touched, ironed, picked up and much more to do.  The exhibition will be interesting to adults and children, the latter it will be especially useful, as it causes additional interest in learning.  In our country, only Voronezh, Vologda and Krasnodar can boast of such institutions. </p><p>  Having bought a ticket, tourists provide themselves with an interesting guided tour, which will tell in detail and demonstrate each exhibit. </p><h2>  Yaroslavl History Museum </h2><p>  It is impossible to describe briefly the main attractions of Yaroslavl.  You can talk about them forever, but as they say, it is better to see once than hear a hundred times.  This proverb is perfect for this museum.  The nineteenth-century building alone can be described for a very long time.  The whole exhibition is aimed at revealing the history of the city, its victory and defeat as best as possible.  A nice bonus is that all the expositions are located in the original interior of the building.  Any tourist will be satisfied, because in a few hours you can touch the thousand-year history of the city. </p><h2>  Garden of the Millennium of Yaroslavl </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.mytravelbook.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Millennium Park" class="if uuid-2539776" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70525/2539776.jpg"></div><p>  The name of the park was in honor of the millennium of the city.  It is located on the embankment, occupying the territory of the former hippodrome.  Thanks to the caring citizens, administration and volunteers, the park has gained a decent look.  Now the garden is a favorite place for rest in Yaroslavl.  In the center is a large bronze sculpture in the form of a bear.  It is notable for the fact that it was presented by none other than Zurab Tseretelli.  In the park you can find all kinds of entertainment for both children and adults.  Near the park there is a boat station located on the banks of the Kotorosl River.  An ice rink opens here in winter and a city beach in summer.  If you go through the whole garden, you can find yourself on Strelka or on the central beach, it all depends on the chosen direction. </p><h2>  Anniversary park </h2><p>  Photos and descriptions of the main attractions of Yaroslavl would not be complete without the Jubilee Park.  This is one of the most comfortable places in the city, which hosts a large number of city events.  Like most attractions, the park is located near the center.  They see off the winter there, celebrate Shrovetide and conduct a large number of traditional events.  Unlike the rest of the parks and gardens of the city, Yubileiny has two names, the second - Motor-building Park. </p><h2>  Art Museum of the city of Yaroslavl </h2><p>  This is one of the most comprehensive museums in our country.  In addition, he is narrowly targeted, because of which he won the all-Russian competition "Window to Russia".  Its archive stores about seventy-three thousand items related to Old Russian, modern and classical culture.  One of the most valuable exhibits is the <span>icon of the "Almighty Savior",</span> because it is dated to the thirteenth century.  The museum began its work in 1919 and has never been closed.  There are several halls in it, each of which belongs to a certain era. </p><h2>  Church of St. John the Baptist </h2><div class="photo" data-original="fotokto.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of St. John the Baptist" class="if uuid-2539784" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70525/2539784.jpg"></div><p>  It is this church that adorns our thousandth bill.  Any person, having once seen this cathedral, remains impressed for a long time.  This is one of the reasons why it is included in the list of the main attractions of the city of Yaroslavl.  A special feature of the church is its unusual dome shape.  Usually it is traditionally made in the form of a bulb, but on this church the domes have a cup-shaped curved shape.  You can not pass by the chapel and the monument to Yaroslav the Wise.  UNESCO also recommends visiting this architectural monument. </p><h2>  Few people know </h2><ol><li>  The city coat of arms depicts a bear with a golden ax in his paw.  This is a reminder that Yaroslavl was founded on the site of the settlement "Bear Corner". </li><li>  Yaroslavl is called the first city of Christians, which is located on the Volga. </li><li>  Under Soviet rule, it was in Yaroslavl that rubber was synthesized.  This was the first experience worldwide. </li><li>  The world learned about this city only after the flight into space was performed by Valentina Tereshkova. </li><li>  UNESCO patronizes the entire city center. </li><li>  The regional newspaper "Northern Territory" appeared in 1898, and by 1905 it was closed due to criticism of the authorities.  But the team did not stop the release, but merely changed the name.  Only the word "North" remained unchanged.  For a little less than five years, the newspaper changed about forty-five names. </li><li>  One of the <span>main attractions of Russia</span> in Yaroslavl is the Transfiguration Cathedral.  For townspeople, it means about the same as the Kremlin for Muscovites. </li><li>  At the end of the fifteenth century, Tsarevich Dmitry, son of Ivan the Terrible and Maria Nagoy, died martyrly on the land of Yaroslavl.  Tsarevich was only eight years old.  Today, he is a very revered saint, because the cause of his death was never found out.  There were many versions, but not one was confirmed. </li><li>  In 1918, a massive uprising took place in Yaroslavl against the Soviet system of government.  He was crushed, but half of the city was hit hard.  The townspeople also suffered.  According to unverified data, at the time of the suppression of the uprising, half of the city's population was cut down. </li><li>  There is a small town in the region called Poshekhonye.  It is in honor of him that the famous cheese is named.  There used to be a cheese factory, on which a delicious product was invented. </li><li>  A lot of saints come from the Yaroslavl region.  These include Seraphim Vyritsky, Sergius of Radonezh, Theodor Ushakov. </li><li>  In the thirties, they planned to turn the large Rybinsk reservoir into a huge artificial lake, but it did not work out. </li><li>  Yaroslavl is also immortalized on a thousandth note.  If you look carefully, you can see Yaroslav the Wise himself, and the city coat of arms, and the gates of the Transfiguration Cathedral.  In addition, you can see the chapel of the same cathedral with a birch.  On the other hand, you can see the famous Church of St. John the Baptist. </li><li>  Yaroslavl is considered the capital of the Russian Golden Ring.  This is because the city is one of the first in terms of attendance by tourists and the comfort of hotel service.  Apart from Yaroslavl itself, tourist cities in the region include Rostov and Pereslavl-Zalessky. </li></ol><p>  This city is very rich in history and architectural monuments.  It has an amazing atmosphere, everything is imbued with hospitality and Russian spirit.  The cultural level is very high, and the service is close to European, but at the same time, the national color has not erased.  And if you travel around Russia, then you need to start from here.  Only Yaroslavl will plunge into historical events and leave behind an indelible impression. </p>
