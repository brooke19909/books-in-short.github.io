  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Braiding yourself is not as easy as it seems</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Weaving braids is a unique skill that no fashionista can do without today.  You always want to look beautiful, elegant and in accordance with fashion trends, though it is often difficult to get into the trend.  And here there is a unique chance to always be on top - the use of braids in hairstyles.  It is the braids of various weaving that do not come out of the peak of popularity and from year to year reflect the choice of stars facing the red carpet. </p><p>  Of course, every day you will not go to the hairdresser or call girlfriends for help in creating hairstyles.  Therefore, you need to master the braiding of yourself.  Yes, it is not easy!  But once upon a time the first word was utterly difficult to pronounce, but now you can chat without a hitch.  The secret of any skill lies in practice.  It is with experience that the ability to skillfully master such a technique as weaving braids to oneself comes. </p><p>  I must say that it is almost impossible to master very complex <span>braiding techniques</span> and there is no such need, but with the help of elementary skills you can look different every day with general epithets about the image: accuracy, grooming, sense of style.  Do not try to weave African braids, which when weaving in two hands take a lot of time and effort.  Make a bachelorette party and create cool hairstyles, for everyday and weekend occasions it is worth considering such types of braids as classic and French. </p><p>  Most of the girls from childhood mastered the skills of weaving a classic <span>braid on</span> dolls, and it is possible that the braiding of oneself was carried out using this type of braids.  True, even two children's braids on the sides can be turned into an interesting hairstyle that will suit a more serious girl. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Weaving <span>braids on the contrary</span> or using weaving a French braid can be difficult at first because of the already acquired skill in weaving a classic braid.  The French braid suggests weaving on the contrary, that is, from the bottom up, which very often causes confusion.  But the more often you have to force your hands to weave a French braid, the sooner a steady skill is developed, the sooner the hairstyle will turn out beautiful, neat and stylish. </p><p>  As soon as the girl decided to try braiding herself, it is worth remembering how the spikelet weaves.  A spikelet is considered a familiar braid (classic or French), which is woven throughout the head by adding strands.  Do not forget that with this weaving, you need to add a few strands that are not yet used to each strand of braids, otherwise the final result will be clumsy. </p><p>  Remembering that the hairstyle should be fashionable and stylish, you should give a couple of tips on how to diversify the daily look and add zest to a seemingly simple hairstyle.  Weaving braids with ribbons is a great way out of the situation.  You can add bright thin ribbons or wide ribbons to the hair strands almost to the tone of your hair, or string beads or rhinestones on the strands that will add shine to the hair.  But no matter what was added, any <span>hairstyle with weaving</span> braids will be interesting, memorable and well-groomed. </p><p>  This skill is perfect for both a young student and a business woman.  Braids can be used both in everyday life and for going out to some kind of a festive event.  The key condition is the uniqueness of hairstyles, mastery of performance and cute highlights that are immediately evident.  But what is especially important is that the hairstyle is done with your own hands, without attracting additional participation, with trepidation and excitement.  And until braid weaving has become a daily activity, hands will clutch at the wrong strands and do whatever is on your head, you should be patient and agile before you get a beautiful hairstyle that even a skilled craftsman will envy. </p>
