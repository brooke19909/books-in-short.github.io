    <h2>  How did the name of the reservoir appear? </h2><p>  The name Black Lake (Khakassia), the photos presented in the article, confirm this version, received due to the special composition of the water and the bottom.  If viewed from a bird's eye view, then its deep expanses are quite dark.  The reason is simple enough.  In some places, the bottom is silty, which gives a characteristic black color to the water.  Apparently, this was once the reason that the locals nicknamed him Black.  A river originates in the lake, which is also called Chernaya, and next to it is a village of the same name. </p><p>  Another fact is interesting: the main part of the bottom is covered with a layer of clay and sand.  The water in the reservoir is not as clear as in other lakes, which the Republic of Khakassia is famous for.  Shirinsky district (Black Lake is a local attraction here) is known far beyond Russia.  A lot of people come here, as healing mud procedures are quite popular. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Neighborhood </h2><p>  The lake is located in the foothills, more precisely at the foot of the mountain ranges.  The peaks here are not high, but in some places they reach 250 meters above sea level.  The lower reaches of the mountains are decorated with numerous mineral springs with salt water, which dry up in the middle of summer.  There are no mountains on the western side of the lake; there the valley is close to the Koibal steppe.  The area around the reservoir is steppe and almost without vegetation, only the eastern part is full of forests, where there are many birches and enough deciduous trees. </p><p>  Black Lake (Khakassia) has an oval shape.  The width of the reservoir is about 5 km, and the length reaches a little more than 2 km.  The lake is shallow, the depth rarely reaches a mark of 5 m. And in the drought season, the lake can be shallow to almost 3 m. The southern shores are quite boggy.  From the south of the lake, <span>the Chernaya River</span> originates and there is also the <span>Black</span> Lake Bog.  But the eastern part is great for relaxation, it is more convenient for entering the water and the shore is more equipped for beach time.  This part of the lake is mainly used by tourists.  Large recreation centers can not be found here, but this is the "highlight".  This place is perfect for those who want to be completely related to the virgin nature, leaving behind the bustle of the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Khakassia Shirinsky District Black Lake" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1143287.jpg" width="600"></div>
