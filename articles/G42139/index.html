  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Victory Park in Kirov: history of creation, description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The city of Kirov is a relatively small settlement in which about 500 thousand people live.  The main part of the city is located on the left bank of the Vyatka River.  Kirov is famous for the chemical industry, so the ecological situation in it is not the best compared to other cities in Russia.  But, despite the great industrial potential, the city is a cultural center, which has many theaters, museums, there are monuments and beautiful parks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="delovoy-kirov.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bird's-eye view" class="if uuid-2240274" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2240274.jpg"></div><h2>  The characteristic of the "green" corner </h2><p>  Victory Park in Kirov is a whole architectural and landscape ensemble located at the intersection of two streets: Lepse and Lomonosov.  Previously, there was the village of Pahomye.  During the Second World War, most of the inhabitants of this village were killed on the battlefields.  Therefore, the park zone received this name.  On the territory there is a stele with eternal flame, established in memory of the dead.  Not so long ago, military equipment was installed here, which is not suitable for operation, there are alleys and a fountain. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kirovnet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Busts of the great commanders" class="if uuid-2240277" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2240277.jpg"></div><h2>  History of occurrence </h2><p>  For the first time, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating Victory Park in Kirov arose in 1962 of the last century.  And the place was chosen not by accident, in the village of Pakhomye, which was previously on the site of the park, there were only 50 people living, 25 of whom died in the Great Patriotic War.  The idea was realized only in 1970.  It was then that alleys and steles appeared with eternal flame. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Kirov Biochemical Plant took part in the improvement of the park zone in 1977.  In that year, a wooden town was built for children.  However, to date, nothing has remained of this site. </p><p>  But this was not the only enterprise that landscaped the park.  The trust "Severovostokenergostroy" in the same 1977 established the obelisk "Komsomolskaya Glory."  From the site where the memorial is installed, a beautiful view of the temple of Sofia opens. </p><p>  City authorities in 1980 conducted coverage around the perimeter of the park area.  Four years later, the park was paved with asphalt and tennis courts.  In the same year, a fountain was launched. </p><h2>  Post-soviet period </h2><div class="photo" data-original="guns.gaspiko.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to Bulatov" class="if uuid-2240279" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2240279.jpg"></div><p>  In May 2007, on May 9, the Eternal Flame was lit in Kirov, it happened precisely on the territory of the park.  In 2010, a memorial sign was erected in honor of the village of Pahomye.  In the same year a bas-relief appeared in honor of Bulatov G. He is not only a native of the city of Kirov, but also the first to put up a red banner over the Reichstag. </p><p>  In 2015, a park of memory was built in the park, at the beginning of which four busts of the great marshals of Russia were installed: </p><ul><li>  Sokolova; </li><li>  Govorova; </li><li>  Vershinin; </li><li>  Konev. </li></ul><p>  A monument is installed in the form of a soldier. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After that, over the course of several years, decommissioned military equipment appears in Victory Park in Kirov.  It symbolizes the undying memory of the dead military personnel of the city in the North Caucasus region and in World War II.  Now you can completely inspect the equipment and even climb inside. </p><p>  Conventionally, the territory is divided into 3 zones: </p><ul><li>  exhibition area and for celebrations; </li><li>  playground, area for adults and dog walking; </li><li>  entertainment area where attractions are located. </li></ul><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Now the territory of Victory Park in Kirov is not only a place of memory of the dead, but also a center of entertainment.  There are children's towns, tennis courts and bike paths.  For those who do not have their own bicycles, there is a rental of sports paraphernalia. </p><p>  Small rides are installed for children - sports equipment and slides, swings.  The beautiful light and music fountain in the central part of the park area will also please.  It is considered not only the most beautiful, but also the largest in the whole city.  On the territory often fun children's events with prizes are held. </p><p>  For those who love measured and calm walks, quiet alleys are equipped.  These are paths surrounded by deciduous and coniferous trees.  In the evening, the park is not scary, lighting is working all around the perimeter, the security agency is constantly patrolling the territory. </p><h2>  Development prospects </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.skyscrapercity.com" data-author=": Kostya-81, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Obelisk in the park" class="if uuid-2240285" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2240285.jpg"></div><p>  Last year, an auction was held to select a contractor for laying paving slabs in the park, asphalting and uprooting stumps.  And by 2024, the opening of the alley of military glory is planned. </p><p>  Not so long ago, the administration sold part of the park (4.5 hectares) to a private company.  Several trials have already taken place, in which the judges hold completely different opinions regarding the legality of the transaction.  The dispute is still not resolved. </p><p>  I want to believe that the park will only bloom, and the eternal flame in Kirov will never go out. </p>
