    <p>  Of course, when arriving in Thailand, tourists expect to rest by the sea.  Hotel Golden Sea Pattaya 3 is located on the third coastline - the distance to the coast is about 600 m. A direct road leads to it, and the walk does not take much time.  Since the beach is public, you need to understand - rent of sun loungers and umbrellas is paid separately each time.  On the shore there is a bar where you can eat, and there is enough entertainment. </p><p>  For example, vacationers can rent a catamaran or boat, ride a boat along the coast, go sailing or get a dose of adrenaline on water skiing.  There is also a diving school, where beginners can get a certificate after a short course of training.  You can also hire a windsurfing instructor.  And on the beach there is a spacious volleyball court where tourists are constantly having fun. </p><h2>  Additional service: what to count on? </h2>

    <p>  Immediately it is worth saying that in most cases, tourists come to Pattaya, wanting to have a good time on the beach and have fun in the city.  But you can have a good rest at the hotel.  As already mentioned, in the courtyard there is a large swimming pool with clean fresh water, where you can freshen up and even play water polo with a small team.  In addition, comfortable sun loungers and wide-brimmed sun umbrellas are located on the terrace. </p><p>  Golf courses are located not so far from the hotel, which will certainly please fans of this sport.  In addition, there is the opportunity to go cycling or have fun fishing.  Do not forget about the interesting excursions that are offered almost everywhere in the city.  And there are also many massage parlors near the hotel, because it is impossible to leave the country without trying out all the wonders of Thai massage. </p><h2>  What do travelers say? </h2><p>  Sometimes a short conversation with people who have already managed to visit a particular hotel helps to make up the big picture.  So what can you hear from tourists about the Golden Sea Pattaya 3 * hotel?  The reviews are mostly positive.  The territory here is small, but well arranged, with beautiful decorations.  The rooms are clean and the cleaners really come every day, and not only clean, but change towels, replenish stocks of soap and shampoos. </p><p>  The location is also beneficial - you can walk to the beach, market and shopping center.  Breakfast is delicious, and the menu is quite varied.  Nevertheless, tourists should understand that they are not going to a luxury hotel complex with an all-inclusive system.  Golden Sea Pattaya Hotel 3 * is perfect for an overnight stay, but entertainment will have to be sought outside its walls.  On the other hand, the cost of living here is very affordable, especially considering the level of service. </p>
