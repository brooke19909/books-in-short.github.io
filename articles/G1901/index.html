    <h2>  Territory </h2><p>  This item, judging by the reviews, caused the guests of Sandhills Beach Resort &amp; SPA 3 * (many mistakenly believe that the hotel 3 *, in fact there are 4), were exclusively positive impressions.  So, according to our compatriots, the territory here is quite large, beautiful, ennobled, green.  There is a mass of nice landscape details in the form of picturesque bridges, ponds with lilies and ducks, beautiful winding paths.  Also, the hotel has many flowers, fruiting fruit trees, coconut trees.  Since the hotel is small, and there are not many guests here, some tourists have the impression that they arrived to rest in their own tropical villa, where you can enjoy the calm and lulling whisper of waves away from the noisy city. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Sandhills Beach Resort &amp; SPA only includes breakfast.  According to our compatriots, in the morning they feed very well here.  So, it is interesting that, as a rule, a buffet is served in the restaurant for breakfast.  But if there are very few guests, then the cooks will prepare dishes according to your order.  I must say that the menu here is quite diverse and includes two types of soup and meat dishes, sausages, cheeses, scrambled eggs and scrambled eggs (cooked directly with you, with any additives if desired), side dishes, stewed and fresh vegetables, various fruits, pastries, sweets, as well as freshly squeezed juices, milk, tea, coffee.  In a word, every morning you can try something new. </p><p>  Hotel guests preferred to have lunch and dinner in one of the neighboring cafes.  So, they cook here, they say, very tasty, and the prices for our compatriots will be very attractive.  In addition, there is the opportunity to try a variety of exotic products in the form of crocodile meat, ostrich, turtle, etc. </p>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Sandhills Beach Resort &amp; SPA has its own sandy beach.  Since the hotel is located on the beach, guests can walk to the sea from the living rooms in just a couple of minutes.  Since there are not many hotels in the neighborhood, the beach here is deserted, but very clean and well maintained.  According to tourists, during the night the sea ashore algae, shells, etc., but early in the morning the employees of the Sandhills Beach Resort clean up all the garbage. </p><p>  When you come ashore, a beach fight will immediately bring you the right amount of sunbeds with mattresses and towels, and set up an umbrella from the sun.  For just one dollar, he will pick you a coconut, cut it and offer it along with a straw, so you can enjoy the most delicious and freshest coconut juice. </p><p>  The sea here is for the most part not very calm.  But those who like to ride the waves will definitely like it here.  In general, our compatriots staying at this hotel were very pleased with their beach holidays. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Despite the fact that Sandhills Beach Resort &amp; SPA is a small hotel, there are two large swimming pools with a jacuzzi on its territory.  One of them is located next to the residential building, and the other is opposite the restaurant.  Near the pools there are sun terraces with a sufficient number of sunbeds.  There is also a bar where you can order your favorite drink and ice cream.  By the way, the hotel also has a children's pool.  During leisure, guests can play billiards or table football for free.  As for animation and discos, you will not find anything like this here.  Therefore, this hotel is perfect for those who want to relax and unwind from the hectic everyday life in a busy city. </p>
