    <p>  In 2007, the State Duma of the Russian Federation adopted a resolution "On the celebration of Heroes of the Fatherland Day".  Set the date - December 9th.  The initiative to create a separate day to honor their heroes in Russia belongs to <span>Boris Gryzlov.</span> </p><p>  In the same 2007, the initiative of the State Duma was supported by the Federation Council of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  Later, Russian President Vladimir Putin officially approved the celebration of Heroes of the Fatherland Day. </p><h2>  history of the holiday </h2><p>  However, the roots of the event do not lead to 2007, but much further.  In 2007, the festival of Heroes of the Fatherland was only restored. </p>

    <p>  On December 9, 1769, Empress Catherine II approved a new state award.  She became the <span>Order of St. George the</span> Victorious.  This order was awarded only to people who showed exceptional courage and valor on the military fronts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At one time he had 4 degrees of difference.  The very first of them was the highest.  <span>The Order of George the Victorious of the</span> first degree in the Russian Empire was considered the highest award for an ordinary military man who went through all the horrors of war. </p><p>  It was a silver sign.  He was focused exclusively on the lower ranks of the Russian army.  Among ordinary and small military commanders, it was considered an honor to receive such an award from the hands of the empress. </p><p>  December 9, 1917 in Russia began to celebrate the holiday of St. George Knights.  However, after the <span>Great October Revolution,</span> this triumph was completely removed.  The thing is that the Bolsheviks denied everything that was connected with the Russian Empire.  The festival of Heroes of the Fatherland was canceled. </p><h2>  Holiday is back </h2><p>  Initially, <span>George the Victorious</span> was known in Byzantium and in Russia.  He was the patron saint of princes and his subjects in military campaigns.  He was portrayed on icons, and believers paid tribute to him. </p>

    <p>  However, in Russia, not everyone reacted well to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcelebrating such a day.  But it is safe to say that this holiday is of great importance for the history of the country.  This date brings together and brings together the heroes of military exploits and ordinary soldiers of the Russian army, who have achieved great success in the field of heavy war. </p><p>  On their examples, official power and propaganda is going to educate young generations.  This day focuses on the fact that Russia is a state that, throughout its history, very often faced with military confrontations.  Mentioned are the long-standing military exploits of soldiers who have shown their valor and real courage. </p><p>  Heroes of the Fatherland are our countrymen.  However, not every Russian can be honored to receive this prestigious award today.  The most frequent ‚Äúlaureates‚Äù of this holiday are senior and junior officers.  They are the heroes of the Fatherland, the list of which is increasing every year.  However, many of them are well known, and young people know them.  Here are just some of the names of the heroes of the Russian Federation: </p><ul><li>  Zharov Alexey Viktorovich (second <span>Chechen war).</span> </li><li>  Em Yuri Pavlovich (second Chechen war). </li><li>  Yashkin Sergey Leonidovich (colonel and commander of the special forces). </li></ul><h2>  Historical moment </h2><p>  It should be noted that this award has an interesting history.  In 1991, in August, there was a putsch.  At this moment, they wanted to restore the order in order to reward the heroes of the White House.  However, this idea was not destined to come true.  After the collapse in 1992, the independent republics created their own administrative apparatuses that were occupied by the country's internal affairs.  At this moment, the procedure was launched to restore the state award of St. George the Victorious. </p>

    <p>  Various sports competitions are held on this day.  Boys and girls show their best side in their military training. </p><p>  On this day, thematic exhibitions are held in museums and lectures are given at universities that are dedicated to the heroes of the Fatherland and the hostilities in which they took part. </p><p>  Traditionally, the first persons of the presidential apparatus and the State Duma lay flowers at the main monuments of the country.

We can safely say that the Day of Heroes of the Fatherland is our national treasure.  Heroes of the Fatherland are our countrymen. </p><p>  It does not harm May 9, but only supplements it.  Holidays May 9 and December 9 are similar, but have their own differences. </p><p>  It is important that the first and second are aimed at stimulating patriotic feelings among young people.  More importantly, the Russian government decided to do this not once a year, but twice.  This contributes not only to patriotism.  On this day, educational evenings and lectures are held that help young people learn and understand their history much better.  This is now more important than ever in order to prevent wars and disrespect for one's historical past. </p>
