  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Maslow Theory</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Maslow's well-known <span>theory of needs</span> immediately attracted wide attention of the scientific community, publicists, and the public.  You can‚Äôt even unequivocally answer the question of why it has become so popular.  Either due to a rather original scientific interpretation of the socio-economic realities of the modern world, or rather free treatment of the canons of scientific analysis, due to which it has acquired, to some extent, a scandalous character. </p><p>  Abraham Maslow, a well-known American psychologist of the last century, laid out the foundations of his theory in the mid-fifties, during the period of a rather serious crisis of social science, which she experienced after the end of World War II and could not answer questions regarding a person‚Äôs place in a developing post-industrial society.  The main work of the scientist - ‚ÄúMotivation and Personality‚Äù - was a kind of attempt to rethink the <span>system of social</span> relations within the framework of the emerging new, first of all, economic reality.  Therefore, oil theory has become popular among representatives of many branches of scientific knowledge, economists, sociologists, and psychologists.  She firmly entered some political science structures, especially in the part where the scientist draws conclusions about the need for strict institutionalization of <span>political relations</span> for the stable economic development of states. </p><p>  In its simplest form, the Maslow concept should be presented as a doctrine consisting of two fairly autonomous doctrines. </p><p>  The first of them - the theory of hierarchical needs - gained popularity in developing models of post-industrial development, it is most fully reflected in the so-called theory of welfare society, and, in addition, it has become an integral part of modern economic education as a section of macroeconomic analysis. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another area of ‚Äã‚Äãscientific heritage is the theory of personality oil, the basis of which is the hypothesis of <span>personal development</span> based on a hierarchy <span>of human needs.</span>  Its significance lies in the fact that Maslow was able to carry out a rather significant historical and social excursion of the genetic development of society in its organic connection with the development of each individual and the study of the motives for this development. </p><p>  Maslow's scientific reasoning was based on the assertion that human needs have exactly the same genesis, and therefore their system of interconnection and interaction has one common property - hierarchy.  The essence of this hypothesis can be more easily presented in such a way that no matter how different the needs of different social groups and individual individuals are, these systems always have their own internal hierarchy.  Ode is quite complex and diverse, so Maslow classifies needs according to certain criteria and identifies five main groups mediated by various motives.  In addition, the theory of oil suggests a classification of the motives themselves, in which they are regarded as deficient and existential. </p><p>  To the first category, the author of the concept includes those motives that move a person to activities to satisfy the vital needs - in food, rest, sleep, etc. </p><p>  Being motives direct a person to receive pleasure, to acquire higher statuses, to realize their ideas.  These motives are clearly manifested only when the needs, motives of the first group are not relevant.  This is the first side of Maslow's hierarchical model of needs. </p><p>  The theory of oil itself classifies the needs into five main groups, they are not just distributed according to some criteria, but are arranged in a strictly defined hierarchical order, to which Maslow gave the shape of a pyramid. </p><p>  This pyramid is based on <span>physiological needs,</span> that is, those that initiate motivation for food production and other attributes of physical life support. </p><p>  On the second level, Maslow has placed security needs. </p><p>  On the next "floor" of the Maslow pyramid are the <span>needs of the socio-physiological</span> order associated with communication, sexual satisfaction, reproduction. </p><p>  The needs that are actualized in the social self of a person in the Maslow pyramid are at the fourth level. </p><p>  And, finally, the need for self-actualization of a person, his creative self-realization, the theory of oil assigns a place at the very top of the pyramid. </p><p>  This system is dynamic and interdependent: the achievement of a certain level in satisfying needs naturally acts as a motive for satisfying the needs of the following. </p><p>  In a later period of scientific activity, Maslow switched from ranking needs to simple classification of needs to needs and development. </p>
