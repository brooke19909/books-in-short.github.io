But that did not make him old-fashioned.  In two thousand and five, he underwent a complete renovation and reconstruction and now is a modern beach resort complex.  Even the most lazy tourists are satisfied with this hotel.  Beach, restaurant - almost a stone's throw.  And most of the rooms do not even need to go out to watch animated shows - all this can be seen from the balcony.  But active vacationers are delighted with the hotel.  She has a very high rating.  Why?  We will talk about this below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sunrise holiday resort 5" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1069686.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hurghada, Sheraton District </h2><p>  This is the resort place where the Sunrise Holidays Resort 5 * hotel is located.  The reviews claim that it is located five to ten minutes on foot from the "backbone" of Hurghada - the famous Sheraton street.  It connects the promenade and the old city.  There are many fast-food chains here - McDonald's, Kentucky Fri Chicken, or Pizza Hut.  But there are no good restaurants with famous chefs and gourmet cuisine on this street either.  She is known for the mass of shops with trinkets, where you can roam, ask the price and bargain.  Well, if you want to buy branded things, then you - at the very end of the street.  Life on it boils in the evening.  That's when tourists from nearby hotels massively go to the promenade.  Unlike the rest of Hurghada, it is extremely clean.  Transport on the street does not go - it is completely at the mercy of pedestrians.  Tourists write that the Sheraton Road was created in imitation of the Barcelona embankment.  No wonder even the lanterns here are made in the same artsy style. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Five Star Hotels in Hurghada </h2><p>  Hotels of such a high class are located in this Egyptian resort by the sea.  They all have their own beaches, or at least direct access to water.  Animation, entertainment, first-class and varied food - all this distinguishes five-star hotels from others.  They lure tourists with exclusive restaurants, bars where they make all kinds of delicious cocktails, and various services like spas and beauty salons.  But even against this background, our Sunrise Holidays Resort 5 * hotel wins noticeably.  The price for a room starts from three thousand nine hundred rubles, and for this money you can get a room with a sea view and first-class service.  Neither children will bother you (the hotel only accepts guests over sixteen), nor drunken vacationers.  There are not so many Russian tourists here, and the hotel is aimed at travelers from European countries and the United States. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sunrise holiday resort 5 egypt hurghada reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1069679.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Shopping prices </h2><p>  The location of the hotel near Sheraton Street is a huge advantage.  You leave the hotel, walk for a few minutes, and now you are merging with the festive crowd of tourists.  Everywhere festive showcases are burning, sellers are inviting.  Of course, you can make purchases without leaving the hotel.  But in his shops everything is much more expensive.  Therefore, it is better to go for souvenirs to the old city.  Figures of the gods, papyrus, cotton products, hookahs, aromatic oils ... Of course, you should be afraid of fakes, but for this it is worth choosing stores more solid.  The main thing is to be able to bargain.  With perseverance and luck, you can bring down the price several times.  In a word, there is a huge selection of everything Hurghada is known for.  The Sunrise Holidays Resort 5 * hotel offers many excursions, but tourists are advised to buy them on the street.  The cost of travel is dramatically different, but the service is the same.  For example, the price of a trip to Luxor is ninety dollars per person if you purchase it at a hotel.  And with street guides, the same trip will cost you forty USD.  Going with the animators to a nightclub costs ten dollars. </p><h2>  Hotel Sunrise Holidays Resort 5 * (Egypt, Hurghada) - Reviews </h2><p>  Tourists really like the hotel.  Many noted as a special bonus that the hotel does not have small children who interfere with rest.  Guests are not overjoyed by their impressions and note that a good mood did not leave them during a trip to Egypt.  In their reviews, they often note that the hotel exceeded all their expectations.  For the price that he is asking, the quality of services is more than high.  Mostly tourists from Europe - British, Dutch, Germans, have a rest in this hotel.  Although there are a lot of people, there is no crowd sensation - neither queues for food or sunbeds, nor fuss on the territory.  Those who visit discos do not interfere with tourists who prefer peace.  Everyone here finds entertainment to their liking. </p>
