From the moment of his birth, he is inextricably linked with any kind of activity, which is its function. </p><h2>  Facts from the past </h2><p>  The centuries-old <span>history of mankind</span> suggests that the functions of cities can repeatedly change.  So, in the Middle Ages, settlements arose for military-defense and trade-craft purposes.  Moreover, at the beginning a fortified settlement was built.  But it became a city only after it was overgrown with commercial and artisan villages (roundabout hail).  At that time, the administrative and political functions of cities were most developed.  There will be no difficulties with examples of such settlements.  These are many cities of Russia, such as Pskov, Velikiye Luki, Izborsk, etc. </p>

    <p>  At the end of the 18th century.  all cities that are county centers were assigned an administrative function.  But they were not limited to it.  Such cities have endowed trade and distribution and organizational and economic functions.  A similar alignment has survived to our time.  All these functions are inherent in the centers of administrative districts. </p><p>  At the beginning of the 20th century  large settlements began to play a transport-industrial role.  This was especially pronounced in the cities through which the railway passed.  The development of transport links contributed to the rapid growth of industrial enterprises.  Examples of such cities are Novosokolniki and Porkhov, Velikiye Luki and Pskov, etc. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Functions of the cities of the second half of the 20th century  shifted more towards administrative.

These are the main functions of cities that distinguish them from the list of small settlements. </p><h2>  Typology </h2><p>  What are the settlements?  There is a certain classification of cities according to the functions that are inherent in them.  Among them are: </p><p>  1. Multifunctional.  These cities play a cultural, administrative, political, and economic role.  These include the most important district-forming centers.  There is a complex territorial organization, there are a variety of wide connections. <br>  2. Cities of inter-district significance, in which transport and industrial functions are predominant.  In general, such settlements are divided into several types.  These are transport, industrial and industrial transport. <br>  3. Cities in which other functions predominate.  Their transport and industrial significance is not so pronounced.  These are small cities, local centers.  They play an organizational and administrative role for grassroots areas. <br>  4. Resort cities with specific features. <br>  5. Scientific experimental and scientific centers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Functions inherent in all settlements </h2><p>  The city is a special type of settlement.

    <p>  In the modern world, the city-forming functions of cities are their lifeblood.  They allow you to solve political and administrative, industrial and residential, cultural and commercial, scientific and educational, as well as utilities and engineering problems.  Moreover, all the listed functions of cities are closely interconnected and cannot exist separately.  New settlements arise in order to satisfy the needs of the whole country or its individual regions.  Moreover, the classification of cities by function is carried out depending on the role assigned to them. </p><h2>  Typology of city-forming activity </h2><p>  The functions of cities, which are its vital basis, are divided into central and special.  The first group includes that activity, which consists in various types of services for the population, as well as households located in adjacent territories. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Central function </h2><p>  The typology of cities within a country has its own classification with a strict hierarchy.  On the top step is Moscow.  The capital of the Russian Federation serves the entire state.  The next level is reserved for the centers of large economic regions.  The functions of the cities of Russia in this category (Yekaterinburg, Novosibirsk) are to service the regions whose centers they are.  The next level is regional.  At this level of the hierarchy are the centers whose task is to serve several administrative regions.  Such cities include, for example, Orsk and Buzuluk. </p><p>  The next step in the hierarchy is occupied by district centers.  Among them are Priozersk and Vyborg (Leningrad Oblast).  At the lower step are the intra-district centers.  The functions of Russian cities at this level are to serve a certain territorial part of the administrative region.  Such cities include Vereya and Aprelevka (Moscow region, Naro-Fominsky district). </p><h2>  Special function </h2><p>  Such a role throughout the country is given to industry centers.  The bulk of Russian cities are large industrial entities (Novokuznetsk, Magnitogorsk, etc.), as well as <span>transport hubs</span> (Nakhodka, Novorossiysk).  Science cities (Dubna, Obninsk), tourist and resort centers (Suzdal, Pyatigorsk, Sochi) are much less common in our country. </p><h2>  Urbanization </h2><p>  The process that enhances the role of urban settlements in the development of the whole country is caused by changes in the demographic and social structure of society, its lifestyle, culture, etc. </p>

    <p>  The process of urban enlargement has recently intensified significantly.  The territory of many settlements is expanding rapidly.  At the same time, industry and population are dispersed in adjacent areas.  In this regard, such functions of cities as economic and cultural are being strengthened.  A large settlement turns into a single urbanized zone, where it plays the role of the main center. </p><p>  Differences in functional purpose are also found in the list of <span>urban-type settlements.</span>  These may be construction centers, the birth of which is associated with the construction of large industrial facilities.  In addition, suburban villages have exclusively residential functions.  In the Moscow region, such are Rodniki, Semkhoz, etc. There are also villages that do not have the functions of a city.  This is observed in those settlements where industrial enterprises have already been closed, and there are no external labor relations.  Villages of this type can most often be found in the eastern and northern regions of the country, where in the past there were mining operations. </p><h2>  Classification of cities by population </h2><p>  In the event that many different functions are concentrated in one settlement, it will quickly grow and develop.  That is why all the major cities are called upon to support the activities of various spheres of society, and vice versa. </p>

    <p>  Small cities, as a rule, are monofunctional.  All settlements are divided into the following types: <br>  - the smallest, the population in them does not exceed five thousand people; <br>  - small - 5-20 thousand people; <br>  - Welterweight - 20-50 thousand people; <br>  - medium - 50-100 thousand people; <br>  - large - 100-500 thousand people; <br>  - the largest - 500 thousand - 1 million people; <br>  - millionaire cities - more than 1 million people. </p><p>  The number of inhabitants of any locality directly depends on the variety of tasks assigned to it. </p><h2>  Monofunctional cities </h2><p>  The settlements that play a specific role in society include scientific and resort centers.  What are their functions? </p><p>  <span>Cities of science are</span> formed to carry out scientific, scientific and technical, as well as innovative activities.  In these settlements, they carry out tests, experimental developments, and carry out training in accordance with state priorities for the development of scientific and technical industries. </p><p>  The functions of resort cities include the following: </p><p>  - conducting medical rehabilitation of patients; <br>  - Spa treatment; <br>  - Wellness holidays; <br>  - adoption of disease prevention measures; <br>  - cultural, entertainment and educational activities. </p><p>  To implement the first three functions, natural physical factors are used. </p><h2>  Functions of the Northern Capital of Russia </h2><p>  What is the role of St. Petersburg in the life of its population and the whole country?  Currently, the main set of functions of the city is quite wide. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what functions do cities" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/625128.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  He is: </p><p>  - a world-class historical and cultural center; <br>  - an innovative, scientific and educational center; <br>  - a business city; <br>  - tourist center; <br>  - transport and transit hub. </p><h2>  Development perspective </h2><p>  The functions of any city do not remain unchanged.  Over time, some of them are somewhat modified, while others disappear, replaced by new ones.  The same processes are typical for St. Petersburg.  The most promising functions of the Northern capital can be determined on the basis of the analysis of the external environment of the city, its competitive positions and the increasing role of human capital.  The authorities of St. Petersburg are engaged in this strategic planning. </p><h2>  Classification of functions of the Northern capital </h2><p>  All the activities of the city, which is aimed at fulfilling the tasks assigned to it, are divided into two groups.  The first of these includes functions that are practically unchanged over a long period of time.  They are basic.  The second group includes more volatile industry functions. </p><p>  What mission of the Northern capital belong to the first group?  This is a function of the city of St. Petersburg as a place for comfortable living.  This role, despite its obviousness, was not always decisive and leading.  Today everything has changed.  A successful city has become a place where talented, entrepreneurial and creative people live freely, richly and comfortably.  For this function, St. Petersburg successfully competes with cities such as Moscow, Paris, London, etc. </p><p>  The northern capital also has the function of a scientific center.  This is facilitated by numerous educational institutions.  In addition, highly qualified specialists work in the field of science in the city. </p><p>  Recently, the geopolitical influence of St. Petersburg on the level of development of other regions has significantly increased.  This expresses the metropolitan function of the city.  It hosts various international conferences, summits, forums and exhibitions.  Thus, the city successfully implemented the strategy of the second capital. </p>

    <p>  An invariable function of St. Petersburg is its role as a historical and cultural center not only in Russia, but throughout the world.  This contributes to the development of tourism and the attraction of educated people for living. </p><p>  The functions of St. Petersburg as an industrial center are gradually being modified.  New enterprises are opening up in the city, forming the latest branches of modern production.  Automotive components are manufactured here, the auto assembly sector is deployed.  The northern capital can be proud of the pharmaceutical industry created at the latest technological level.  Branches of many leading world companies are open and operate on the territory of the city.  In other words, St. Petersburg has enormous potential for becoming a center of modern high-tech industry. </p>
