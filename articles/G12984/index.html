  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to choose a channel air conditioner</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The purchase and installation of channel air conditioners is recommended for suburban cottages and private houses, as well as for office premises, where there is a need to organize air conditioning of several rooms. </p><p><br>  It is known that for the installation of a ducted air conditioner, the space behind the suspended ceiling is used; at the same time, a system of special air ducts connected to the air conditioner is equipped, for which it is important to perform the correct calculations.  Air ducts are laid in all rooms that need cooling, which causes some difficulties with installation.  This is, in fact, a good reason to start planning the air conditioning and ventilation system using a ducted air conditioner even during the design of the building. </p><p>  Not unimportant fact is the cleaning of air conditioners after a year of operation, it is not recommended to carry out work on your own, it is better to order this service from the company in the likeness of LEON GROUP LLC, prices can be viewed on the website service-conditioners.pro. <br><br>  A characteristic feature that applies to some other varieties of air conditioners is the placement of the indoor unit of the duct air conditioner behind a suspended ceiling.  For example, the difference from the cassette equipment is in the branching system of the air ducts, which are located throughout the ceiling so that the air supply through the space of the premises is uniform.  A feature of ducted air conditioners is their power, which has an indicator of up to 25 kilowatts.  This ensures their effective work both in a small office and in a multi-room house. <br><br>  If it becomes necessary to constantly clean the air, for example, to clean the room from cigarette smoke, any additional filter can be installed for these purposes.  It is also important that channel systems are able to work effectively both for heating and for cooling rooms.  The main advantages of the equipment that you should pay attention to at the time of purchase are as follows: the ability to supply fresh air;  hidden installation;  maintenance of several rooms at the same time;  the need to equip a suspended ceiling and duct system. <br><br>  Channel air conditioning is considered the best option for rural cottages.  Thanks to the ability to simultaneously cool several rooms, significant savings are achieved on the installation and subsequent maintenance of the system.  A power of 12-25 kilowatts is enough for cooling and filling with clean air even a five-room apartment.  A big advantage of the variety of air conditioners under consideration is their ability to perform high-quality ventilation of refrigerated rooms. </p></div></article>
