Nautical knots: history and scheme of knitting</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The art of knitting marine knots is actually useful not only to those who regularly sail on ships.  It will be useful for any tourist to have in their arsenal a couple of such techniques, and at least for a more durable installation of a camping tent and fitting a tent from the rain to it.  And how interesting this process is in itself!  For those who want to learn how to tie the sea knots, schemes and methods are given in this article. </p><h2>  <span>Rope knots</span> in our lives </h2><p>  Knitting knots is one of the first things that humanity has learned in the process of its evolution.  They fastened the tools, made the first snares and traps for hunting, as well as castles. </p><p>  The very first ropes were stripes from the bark of trees, vines, animal skins.  They fastened the first clothes and the first bed.  Gradually, people mastered weaving and were able to make ropes on their own, making them more durable and longer.  Yes, and it was thanks to them that its main symbol, the flag, first ascended over the state. </p><p>  A rope is a faithful companion of a person on travels, both sea and air.  Using a rope without knitting knots is hard to imagine.  These words have long been associated with each other.  It was the sailors who became the first to knit marine knots, schemes of which can be found in textbooks on rigging. </p><h2>  Nautical knots: history and scheme of knitting </h2><p>  They are an integral part of human culture, it is difficult to imagine our world without them.  New nodes continue to be invented today, and each of them receives authorship, as an invention, and a patent. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Their genius is simplicity.  They can be stopper, quick-release, protracted and non-retentive.  This art has been passed down from generation to generation.  Thanks to the ropes, the first devices for swimming on water appeared - rafts.  The knot also has a mystical meaning - this is not just a way of fastening, but a talisman that protects its owner from harm. </p><p>  The sailors of Northern Europe had a belief about three magic knots - correctly stored on ship's gear, they were kept from collapse.  There was even a ritual to unleash, which was supposed to cause the wind. </p><p>  In the heyday of seafaring, there were about 500 knots.  Their names derive from the gear to which they were applied - for example, pile or boat.  Nowadays, nodes are also identified with the country where it was invented - the Spanish gazebo or the Flemish loop. </p>

    <p>  The working ends of the cable with which knitting is carried out are called running.  They are worn around the indigenous, which remain motionless.  These ends are opposite to each other. </p><p>  And to this day, you can find nationalities that are not affected by the benefits of civilization, and they still make weapons and snares for hunting and fishing using knitting knots. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Rope knots: their types and methods of knitting </h2><p>  You will need a rope, not very thick and soft enough.  Just like in knitting, training is needed here.  The first time you remember a little, therefore, each new unit must be worked out several times.  And of course, they need to be used in everyday life, otherwise they will quickly be erased from memory. </p><p>  Yes, each of them has its own name.  But do not focus too much on them, it is better to remember the sequence of combinations.  There are not many established names, and more often they depend on the source. </p><p>  The simplest knot is knitted like this: at one end of the rope a loop is made into which the running end is threaded.  All.  Its disadvantage is a decrease in the strength of the rope.  An experienced fisherman or seafarer always cuts off random knots or replaces them. </p><p>  Testing of knitting skills can begin with the G8.  It does not reduce strength and is easily untied.  The practical value is to limit the movement of the rope.  Eight is an element of other more complex nodes. </p>

    <p>  If you need to connect two ropes, knit a straight (or reef) knot.  To increase reliability and strength at the running ends, you need to make eights.  When knitting, two ropes cross twice in succession.  One of the free ends doubles to form a bow.  If the number of running revolutions is made larger, a <span>surgical unit</span> will be obtained that fits on tensioned cables. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Excess crochets and turns can not only ruin everything, but also make one knot completely different.  Therefore, when knitting, carefully monitor the directions of the turn. </p><h2>  Classification </h2><p>  Direct or reef included in 24 major marine nodes.  Why are they called that?  It is believed that they are most used in navigation and it was with them that it all started.  In this classification, direct and reef are two nodes, although the principle of their mating is exactly the same.  The figure eight and the surgical (or double straight) also apply here. </p><p>  In those cases when it is necessary to tie the ends of two ropes, they knit a flat knot or bayonet.  Its distinguishing feature is its symmetry.  Knitting technology: one of the ends is folded with a loop, the second end is wrapped around in the same way, the ends are pulled together.  They must be intertwined one through the other. </p><p>  One of the most used in rigging is a pile unit.  The lead end is looped into the loop with the same loop.  They drag it around an object, otherwise it will not drag on. </p><p>  Separately distinguish such nodes of the "bayonet" type.  It is straightforward, with two hoses, wrecked and fishing.  The first is used for high-quality mooring.  The technology of its binding is already described above.  Everything is the same here, only the rope first wraps around the berth.  To reduce cable wear came up with a bayonet with two hoses.  At the same time, the rope wraps around the bail.  The bayonet with a collar has an additional loop.  This is done for even greater reliability.  Rybatsky differs from a node with two hoses in that the additional loop is tied, and not just thrown.  It is used for anchor. </p><p>  To tightly tie the cable on something, another rope or rope, knit a <span>knotted knot.</span>  The running end, which is surrounded around the object, is carried over the root.  The second barrier is knitted in the opposite direction. </p>

    <h2>  The most famous </h2><p>  The main quality of marine nodes is reliability, as well as simplicity and the ability to do this with just one hand.  Simplicity seems an inappropriate concept here, but in fact, intricate nautical knots fit really quickly and easily thanks to well-defined technology. </p><p>  The 15 popular maritime knots include the figure of eight, straight and flat, a bayonet with two hoses, a fishing bayonet, a retainer and a reef knot, as well as a noose, a snag, a Portuguese bowline, an improved dagger knot, a Flemish loop and a Flemish knot. </p><p>  Why are they included in this classification?  They are widely used not only in the marine business, now they are indispensable, for example, for climbers.  Imagine that you urgently need to throw a lasso with a reliable knot on a rock or quickly wrap the rope around your waist with one hand so that you are pulled out of a place inaccessible to other people. </p><h2>  Enough theory </h2><p>  Now you know what exactly are the sea nodes.  Drawings, knitting patterns for some of them, namely those that may be applicable in everyday life, are indicated below. </p><p>  Use a regular clothesline and chair for training.  First, just make the simplest <span>self-tightening knots.</span>  To do this, throw the rope over the crossbar and carry one end through the resulting loop. </p><p>  And here is how the Flemish knot fits, one of the simplest and most popular.  It is useful to you for reliable fastening of two ropes together. </p>
