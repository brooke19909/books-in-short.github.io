It is necessary to take into account many factors and also find the device at a sane price.  There are no problems with the latter.  Many manufacturers offer very interesting models for almost a penny.  Among them there is such an assembly as Samsung SC5241, the characteristics and main features of which we will consider in this material.  This is a very interesting budget product that can afford almost anyone.  That is why it is so popular.  However, let's take a closer look at it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="image-us.samsung.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="vacuum cleaner samsung sc5241 reviews" class="if uuid-3239582" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3239582.jpg"></div><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  The first thing that interests any user is what comes with the device.  <span>Vacuum cleaner Samsung SC5241</span> (black) boasts a very good delivery kit.  Of course, there is nothing extraordinary in it, but what is there is already a great achievement. </p><p>  Here is what is in the box with the vacuum cleaner itself: </p><ul><li>  Vacuum cleaner Samsung SC5241. </li><li>  The main universal brush. </li><li>  Nozzle for cleaning furniture and cleaning in hard to reach places. </li><li>  Flexible hose with power adjustment knob. </li><li>  Telescopic tube for installing brushes on it. </li><li>  Disposable filter and dust collector (also disposable). </li><li>  Set of various booklets. </li><li>  User's manual. </li><li>  Warranty card. </li></ul><p>  All this can be found in the box with the vacuum cleaner itself.  In principle, the kit is not bad.  Here are just a few brushes and nozzles.  But for the price it is excusable.  The good news is that they put at least a dust bag.  You can immediately install it and use the vacuum cleaner without hindrance.  Now let's talk about other features of this product.  He has a lot of them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="img5.lalafo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="vacuum cleaner samsung sc5241" class="if uuid-3239580" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3239580.jpg"></div><h2>  Appearance and design </h2><p>  The first thing you should pay attention to is the design of the device.  The vacuum cleaner is distinguished by its round shape and good design.  the front part is made in black.  While the back and bottom are decorated in gray colors.  The Samsung SC5241 vacuum cleaner, reviews of which we will consider a little later, looks quite modern.  The good news is that the designers did not provide the device with transparent body elements.  It would look extremely miserable.  All this transparency only spoils the appearance of the product.  It is worth noting that the vacuum cleaner has a very successful case design.  Only the front part opens.  This is where the dust bag is installed. </p><p>  On the top of the case is a power button.  She is very big, so it‚Äôs impossible to lose her.  Just below it is a nozzle for connecting a ribbed hose.  To the right of the power button is a button to start the automatic winding mechanism of the cord.  A very useful option.  The rear wheels of the vacuum cleaner are quite large.  This allows you to easily drag it everywhere with you.  There is also a carry handle.  It is mobile and in its usual state almost merges with the body.  This is very convenient, since it does not interfere if you need to fit the vacuum cleaner in a cabinet or in a nightstand.  This is what the Samsung SC5241 vacuum cleaner looks like.  We will consider its characteristics in the next chapter. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung sc5241 reviews" class="if uuid-3239579" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3239579.jpg"></div><h2>  Product Specifications </h2><p>  This unit has very interesting characteristics.  Power consumption - 1800 watts.  In this case, the suction force is 410 watts.  This is enough to cope with even the most difficult pollution.  The vacuum cleaner uses bags with a capacity of 2.4 liters.  They are usually enough for two or three harvests.  After that, the bag has to be changed.  This product also uses a fine filter type HEPA11.  This allows the unit to remove dust more thoroughly.  Also in the device there is an indicator of fullness of the dust bag.  This is a very useful option.  It is she who lets the user know that 0 the bag needs to be changed. </p><p>  Vacuum cleaner Samsung SC5241 (1800W) is designed exclusively for dry cleaning.  This means that they can not vacuum water.  Moreover, even a wet carpet can cause damage.  Therefore, you must wait until the surface intended for cleaning is completely dry.  Only then will it be possible to use this vacuum cleaner.  He is still not a detergent.  So it must be operated exclusively in a dry room and on a completely dry surface.  Otherwise, there is a possibility of failure of the device.  Or a short circuit will turn out and the house will be left without light.  Do you need it? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="elsolo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="vacuum cleaner samsung sc5241 black" class="if uuid-3239585" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3239585.jpg"></div><h2>  Vacuum cleaner dimensions </h2><p>  These are very important characteristics for any vacuum cleaner.  You must admit that few people are happy to carry a huge and heavy barrel in their hands.  Therefore, for cleaning in a small apartment, people try to buy something miniature.  And in this regard, Samsung SC5241, reviews of which we will consider in the following sections, fits perfectly.  Its dimensions are 39.50x28x23.80 centimeters.  This is one of the smallest classic vacuum cleaners on the market.  It can be easily fit into a small bedside table.  And in the corner he will not take up much space.  It is well suited for a small-sized apartment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tehnoplus.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="vacuum cleaner samsung sc5241 1800w" class="if uuid-3239587" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3239587.jpg"></div><h2>  Weight and noise level </h2><p>  Now about its mass.  Not to say that this unit was too heavy.  Its weight is 5 kilograms (with a small tail).  So this vacuum cleaner is not difficult to even carry in your hands.  And if you consider that its wheels allow you to freely move on any surface, then there are no problems with this at all.  Now about the noise level.  Agree, it‚Äôs unpleasant when the vacuum cleaner roars like a booming Boeing.  However, this baby is fine with sound.  He is extremely quiet.  Its volume at maximum speeds does not exceed 84 dB.  This is a decent result.  Some other models are much louder during operation.  So when cleaning with the Samsung SC5241, the characteristics of which we are now considering, you will not feel any discomfort.  And it is incredibly pleasing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="irecommend.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung sc5241 specifications" class="if uuid-3239589" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3239589.jpg"></div><h2>  A little about the instruction manual </h2><p>  This vacuum cleaner is equipped with an instruction manual for the device.  And it is worth noting that it is made very high quality.  Firstly, there is a full-fledged Russian language.  Without a crooked machine translation.  Secondly, everything is stated in a simple and accessible language.  Thanks to this instruction, even a child can handle a vacuum cleaner.  Thirdly, there are a variety of pictures that illustrate a particular process.  With such visual material, even a little boy will deal with a vacuum cleaner very quickly.  Not to mention an adult.  In general, the instruction is good.  Samsung has clearly taken care of the users.  And this is only a plus to the manufacturer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cache3.youla.io" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="vacuum cleaner samsung sc5241 specifications" class="if uuid-3239592" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3239592.jpg"></div><h2>  Positive user reviews </h2><p>  So, we examined the characteristics of the Samsung SC5241 vacuum cleaner.  User reviews are next in line.  It is worth noting that for the most part the comments are positive.  The owners of this device claim that the vacuum cleaner is made efficiently.  It is noticeable that exclusively high-quality plastic was used.  People also say that the device copes with its main task perfectly.  After cleaning the apartment is very clean.  And an additional nozzle allows you to remove dirt even from hard to reach places. </p><p>  Many comments are related to the reliability of the vacuum cleaner.  People claim that it works without breakdowns for 5 years.  For some, the device even crossed the six-year milestone and never broke.  Of course, such reliability is in the spirit of Samsung, but still impressive.  In general, users are happy with the purchase and recommend this vacuum cleaner to others.  It is understandable.  After all, to buy such a high-quality device for that kind of money is unlikely to succeed.  So at the moment this ‚ÄúSamsung‚Äù is the most acceptable option. </p><h2>  Negative user reviews </h2><p>  However, there are those who, for some reason, were not satisfied with the Samsung SC5241.  Reviews of this plan are few in number, but they are.  However, they do not reveal any serious flaws.  Basically, people complain that for certain cleaning modes they have to buy extra brushes.  Say, it is a pity that the manufacturer did not put them in the kit. </p><p>  Also, some users noticed that the filter clogs up very quickly in the vacuum cleaner.  This is probably the design features of a vacuum cleaner.  And a portion of negative comments went to the vacuum cleaner for the reason that it does not have the ability to regulate power.  Yes, that‚Äôs really sad.  But then the price would be completely different.  So learn to look for pros everywhere.  In general, all these comments about the alleged flaws of the device can not be called objective.  Because all of the above cannot be considered as flaws.  These are rather minor flaws.  And this is in almost every product.  There are no perfect products. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we examined the <span>Samsung SC5241</span> dry vacuum cleaner <span>.</span>  <span>User reviews</span> about it say that it is a very high-quality product that will work for a very long time without any breakdowns.  We can say that this is one of the best vacuum cleaners in its segment. </p>
