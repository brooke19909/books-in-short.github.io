This is due to many reasons, for the most part artificially and illegally created.  However, no one will dissolve relations between relatives living in one territory and working in another.  So you have to look for ways out of the situation, especially regarding monetary issues.  For example, Privat Bank helps to make transfers from Russia to Ukraine.  How easy it is to perform such operations, we study further. </p>

    <h2>  What are the options for transferring funds? </h2><p>  Currently, there are several options for transferring funds to Ukraine.  For example, you can do this by bank transfer and pay in cash at the bank's cash desk or at a specialized service manager.  Moreover, the funds you send can be credited very quickly to the card or bank account of the recipient.  Or they can be cashed through the bank cash desk, presenting a code number and passport. </p><p>  According to the same system, the Ukrainian PrivatBank also works.  Money transfer from Russia to Ukraine is carried out in compliance with the internal policy and staffing of the recipient credit organization. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Fast money transfer to the account </h2><p>  One of the most common options for transferring funds from one account to another is SWIFT (international non-cash payments), which are supported by Russian credit organizations and the Ukrainian Privat Bank.  Transfers from Russia to Ukraine using this service are carried out in any branch of a domestic bank. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  They are reliable, have a high degree of protection and a high transfer rate of funds transferred.  However, these transfers are fraught with a rather high commission.  This is especially true when you want to transfer money from Russia to Ukraine.  PrivatBank in this case will be a foreign credit organization.  This means that you will have to pay 1-3% commission for the services of the domestic bank of the sender. </p>

    <h2>  How to send a SWIFT payment? </h2><p>  In order to transfer funds using SWIFT transfer, you just need to bring your passport with you and go to the nearest bank branch.  Further, it remains to go to the cashier, to inform about their desire to transfer money from Russia to Ukraine (to Privatbank, <strong> </strong>  for example), give a passport. </p><p>  After that, it is enough to indicate the surname and name of the recipient, as well as the SWIFT code of the banks (sender and recipient).  Most often, the cashier or operator of your department fills in all of these boxes.  And, finally, it remains only to make the necessary amount, taking into account the size of the commission, to confirm the desire to make the transfer and communicate its details to its recipient. </p>

    <h2>  Sending money through a branch of Sberbank </h2><p>  The main feature of sending international non-cash payments through Sberbank is the ability to choose the appropriate transfer option.  In order to do this, you must perform the following actions: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  Go to the official website of Sberbank. </li><li>  Select the tab "Private customers". </li><li>  Go to ‚ÄúPayments and Transfers‚Äù. </li><li>  Go to the "Transfers" tab. </li><li>  In the country field, indicate ‚ÄúUkraine‚Äù. </li><li>  Write the amount of the transfer and choose the currency (rubles, dollars or euros). </li><li>  Click on the active ‚ÄúSelect‚Äù button. </li></ul><p>  And further, it remains only to choose the appropriate option among all available.  This is one of the easiest ways to make money transfers from Russia to Ukraine.  PrivatBank in this case will be the host.  And the funds themselves will be transferred from your account in a Russian bank to the beneficiary's account in Privat. </p><h2>  Are there any restrictions when sending money to Sberbank? </h2><p>  When sending transfers from Russia to Ukraine (to Privat Bank), you need to know about the existing restrictions.  So, in Sberbank, the maximum amount of wire transfer is $ 5,000 per day, and the minimum is $ 15.  In rubles, the minimum amount starts from 50 rubles. </p><p>  If you want to transfer a large amount, you will need a justification for the transfer and the availability of relevant certificates from the tax and other government agencies. </p>

    <h2>  Can I make a transfer through the Golden Crown? </h2><p>  Not so long ago, Privat Bank was considered the most loyal financial institution for Ukrainians.  Transfers from Russia to Ukraine (Zolotaya Korona, one of the most famous payment systems) could be safely received from this bank.  However, starting in March 2016, such operations are no longer performed.  Due to bilateral sanctions (on the Russian and Ukrainian sides), users say, the ban on such transfers was extended for a year. </p><p>  It is hard to say whether the given period will be extended or the Golden Crown system will resume its work in the territory of neighboring Ukraine.  PrivatBank itself confirms this information.  Money transfers from Russia to Ukraine - ‚ÄúContact‚Äù <strong> </strong>  (another translation system) are also prohibited.  Under the "Ukrainian taboo" were other systems, including: </p><ul><li>  Hummingbird. </li><li>  "Leader". </li><li>  Unistream. </li><li>  "Anelik." </li><li>  "Close". </li></ul><h2>  Do transfers work through Western Union? </h2><p>  The Western Union international system is currently operating and payments are being processed.  In order to make such a transfer, you must come with a passport to the nearest bank or organization that supports such transactions. </p><p>  Further, it remains only to indicate the surname and name of the recipient, deposit money taking into account the commission (not more than $ 3, less often 1.7% of the amount) and find out the secret code.  After instant crediting of funds, do not forget to inform its recipient. </p>

    <h2>  Is it possible to transfer money from Russia to Ukraine on a PrivatBank card? </h2><p>  This issue worries more and more Ukrainians working in Russia and sending money to their relatives.  According to them, it is possible to implement the plan according to a certain scheme.  It is enough that the sender from Russia has an electronic wallet, for example, QIWI, WebMoney or Yandex.Money. </p><p>  Moreover, you can transfer money from wallet to wallet (if the Ukrainian side has wallets of the same international system).  All that remains is to withdraw virtual money to the Privat card. </p><p>  You can do this using virtual exchangers that transfer money from your wallet to a card.  To perform operations on the card, you need to register on the exchanger‚Äôs website, indicate your passport details, number and validity period of the PrivatBank card. </p><h2>  Transfer of funds from an account in a Russian bank </h2><p>  Another option for transferring money is opening an account with a Russian bank.  However, according to experts, this should be a legal account with the appropriate registration with the tax office.  And already from it it will not be difficult to transfer funds to another account opened in the Ukrainian "PrivatBank".  However, this option is suitable only for Ukrainian citizens legally working in the Russian Federation. </p><p>  According to experts, the size of the commission in this case will pleasantly surprise.  When performing operations between accounts, it will be only $ 1-2.  That's just the maximum amount of such a transaction should not exceed the aforementioned maximum. </p><h2>  Trust card transfer to a third party </h2><p>  And finally, a not very legal, but acceptable option to make a transfer is to draw up a bank card and give it to your relative.  In this case, he will know the secret code and will be able to withdraw money without problems.  That's only officially the banks do not give permission to perform such operations.  Therefore, if this scheme is revealed, then violators can be quite well punished.  Of course, they will do it their own way, for example, by blocking the card. </p><p>  In a word, despite all the difficulties, it‚Äôs quite possible to transfer money from the Russian Federation to Ukraine, and even to the PrivatBank card.  The main thing is to know how to do it.  Therefore, choose the method that is most convenient for you. </p>
