    <h2>  Water tower </h2><p>  Behind the memorial complex, you can see this grandiose structure, towering above everyone else.  For his sake, beginner climbers come to the city of Zaraysk.  Sights can continue to be examined along the way to the tower, moving along Krasnoarmeyskaya street.  On the way, you can see the exemplary house, the Church of <span>Elijah the Prophet</span> with a small bell tower, the house in which I. I. Shcherbakov lived. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The tower was built at the beginning of the 20th century, it is made in the Italian style and resembles a <span>chess piece.</span>  Now it does not fulfill its initial functions, but access to it is possible.  As already mentioned, she is primarily interested in thrill-seekers who decide to climb the wall by hooking a hook on the loophole window.  Judging by the reviews, this is an impressive adventure. </p>

    <h2>  Museum of the sculptor A. Golubkina </h2><p>  Having been at the <span>water tower,</span> you can further inspect Zaraysk.  Sights, reviews of which are warmed by the sincere love of Russians to their homeland, will be most interesting to residents of neighboring cities, because they are living evidence of history.  Turning right after the tower, you will come to a small square house, which is the church of the Icon of the Mother of God of Kazan.  Already from her the road will lead you to the house-museum of Golubkina.  It was opened in 1974.  Here the life of a great woman passed; these walls conceal memories of her childhood and youth. </p><p>  On the ground floor you can see the sculptures of a talented master, and on the second floor there is a room where she lived, personal belongings and documents telling about her life and career.  The exposition is very interesting, it is worth seeing to everyone who came to Zaraysk.

    <h2>  White Stone Church of the Annunciation </h2><p>  Leaving the Golubkina museum, you get to the central automobile ring.  Here is a monument to Ilyich.  Further it is worth moving along Dzerzhinsky street to get to a wonderful church.  Its construction is associated with tragic events.  In 1608, 300 warriors were killed in battle in the vicinity of Zaraysk.  They were buried in a <span>mass grave,</span> and nearby laid the foundation of a wooden church.  The building that you see today - the stone Annunciation Church - began to be built in 1777, and completed at the beginning of the 19th century. </p><p>  In 1835, a stone three-tier bell tower was installed, a refectory was added a little later.  This is the only church in the city that did not stop serving after the revolution.  Many ancient icons from the destroyed temples have been preserved here.  Judging by the reviews, this place is an amazing energy that cannot be described, you need to feel yourself.  Immediately behind the church building, you can visit the mound, the mass grave. </p>

    <h2>  Cathedral of St. John the Baptist </h2><p>  Another magnificent architectural monument with a difficult fate, which Zaraysk (Moscow region) can boast of.  The sights of the city are interesting not only in themselves, their history is also fascinating.  For the first time the cathedral was erected in the 16th century, but soon it was dilapidated and was demolished.  In 1764 it was built again, but it did not stand even 100 years - the walls fell apart.  Already in 1821 a new church was built of brick, and in 1928 it was closed, the bell tower was blown up.  For a long time the building was used as a cinema.  The cathedral was reopened in 1992, and 2 years later a wooden bell tower with 10 bells was erected.  Only in 2009, restoration work was completed. </p><h2>  Zaraisk Kremlin </h2><p>  If you decide to visit the sights of Zaraysk, do not forget about the real gem - the local Kremlin.  He is one of the ten most beautiful in Russia.  Built in 1528 by order of Vasily III, it still retains its pristine beauty.  The Kremlin has 3 towers, three of which are with gates.  The St. Nicholas and John the Baptist Cathedral have also been preserved.  For more than 150 years, the Kremlin has defended the borders of the state from raids. </p><p>  Today it is one of the largest museums in the Moscow region, which can not be ignored.  The museum collection includes a magnificent collection of paintings.  This is the work of Russian artists I. E. Repin and <span>L. Bakst.</span>  Of the contemporaries, the works of M. G. Abakumov are presented.  There is an exhibition of European painting, which shows paintings by A. Molinari, I. Bardou.  This exhibition is of particular interest to connoisseurs of fine art. </p><p>  The exposition of arts and crafts is widely represented.  These are magnificent samples of furniture of the XVII-XX centuries.  Bright windows showcase Russian, European, Chinese and Japanese porcelain, glassware and bronze.  Elegant collections of fabrics include samples of lace, clothing of peasants and urban residents of the Ryazan province of the XIX century. </p><p>  A visit to the Kremlin is the most memorable event for tourists who come to see the sights of Zaraysk.  This is probably why the museum is devoted most of all to rave reviews, although a person far from creativity may have enough to inspect the Kremlin itself. </p><h2>  Cathedral of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker </h2>

    <p>  The Orthodox Church of the Moscow Diocese operates on the territory of the Kremlin.  This magnificent five-domed white-stone temple replaced its predecessor, made of wood and not having survived the test for centuries.  The main shrine of the temple is the miraculous icon of St. Nicholas.  At the beginning of the twentieth century, the cathedral was closed, all valuables were removed from it, and the faithful returned it only after 70 years.  Today he is acting again, Sunday school classes are taking place within its walls. </p><p>  Here is the holy spring "White Well".  In 2000, the territory of the "White Well" was landscaped, the Nikolaev Chapel and the bathhouse were erected, and the source itself with pure spring water was re-consecrated by the Metropolitan.  Tourists note that the temple itself and the water from the source give a very special state of peace, tranquility and confidence in the future. </p><h2>  Dostoevsky Manor </h2>

    <p>  On this journey through the city comes to an end.  You have visited almost all the sights of Zaraysk.  Photos of cozy streets and original buildings will long remind you of the moments spent here.  It remained on the road to call in the old Dostoevsky estate.  It is located 12 km from the city, in the village of Darovoe.  The father of the author of famous works bought this estate in 1831.  In the writer's work, the village of Darovoe, as well as the nearby village of Cheremoshnya, are often mentioned. </p><p>  Today, a museum with the same name "Manor of F. M. Dostovsky" has been created here.  You can come here from the city by suburban bus, private car or bicycle.  The museum is open daily from 9:00 to 18:00.  Today there is not much left of the estate, only a wooden wing is open for visitors. </p><p>  At the exit you can still ride along the Silver Ponds.  The whole tour can be completed in one day, but it will give a lot of pleasant impressions.  All tourists say that in terms of saturation it is equal to the weeks devoted to daily worries.  Be sure to choose the time the next weekend and go on a family trip. </p>
