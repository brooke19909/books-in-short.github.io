    <p>  Before you leave <span>Moscow for Bulgaria, you</span> should take care of all the necessary documents on the road.  Of course, the main document is a Bulgarian visa, which can be replaced by a <span>transit visa</span> to Romania.  However, this is not enough.  A road traveler should bring with him not only rights, but also a green card, as well as take out insurance.  The car should also be fully ‚Äúequipped‚Äù.  In addition to the first-aid kit, it should have a cable, a fire extinguisher, a yellow vest with reflective stripes and a couple of warning signs.  Especially zealous for the presence of such a set are Bulgarian traffic inspectors. </p><p>  Going to Bulgaria by car, you should take care not only of transport, but also of overnight, especially if children take the trip.  To do this, plan a route in advance.  Three routes lead from Moscow to Bulgaria - through Ukraine, Moldova or Belarus.  In the first two cases, you can cross Romania - this will add brightness to the journey.  From Belarus to Europe you can leave </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="summer holidays in Bulgaria" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3325/48165.jpg" width="599"></div>  Rez Novaya Rudnya - this border point is located near the city of Mozyr.  Through Ukraine, Bulgaria can be reached through the Porubie point, which is located near Chernivtsi, and the Vypostovichi point will serve to enter Ukraine.  Romania can be crossed using the border points of Siret and Guirgiu, and Bulgaria will let travelers through the Ruse crossing.

What to do next?  It all depends on which company you came to this wonderful country.  If the car is full of noisy youth, it is better to choose a resort with a variety of entertainment and vibrant nightlife.  Usually, youth companies go to Sunny Beach or Golden Sands - this is where the most ‚Äúparty‚Äù resorts are.  Summer holidays in Bulgaria are very diverse.  There is also a quiet hotel for couples.  Children will especially like the resorts near Kranevo and Albene, their pristine beaches and fragrant <span>pine forests.</span>  And if it gets boring, nearby are historical places like <span>Stone Forest</span> or Balchik, where the Queen‚Äôs Castle was erected </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to relax in Bulgaria" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3325/48171.jpg" width="410"></div>  Mary.

    <p>  <span>Where is it better to relax in Bulgaria for</span> people with modest means?  Indeed, many can not afford the luxury hotels of Golden Sands.  For this, there are places like Sozopol or Nesbyr.  The streets in the towns are narrow and cobbled, and the restaurants will treat you with traditional Bulgarian dishes.  These places are very calm - there is silence in them as soon as a noisy baby goes to bed.  History lovers will appreciate Veliko Trynovo.  This city is located quite far from the bustling coastal resorts and is filled with history to the top, because it was here that the Bulgarian kings were crowned and the patriarchs and bishops lived.  Well, those who are aiming for a beach holiday should be aware that Bulgaria is not a subtropical country.  It is located on the <span>Balkan Peninsula,</span> but the summer temperature there is lower than that of the "neighbors". </p><p>  It doesn‚Äôt matter if you are planning a beach holiday or excursions.  Any trip to Bulgaria by car will be unforgettable. </p>
