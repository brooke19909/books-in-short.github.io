You can buy it in a specialty store, guided by your own preferences, or you can try to do it yourself.  In addition, to design an embroidered image, you can take a simple photo frame and decorate it according to your own taste, using improvised means (beads, stones, shells, glass, etc.).  So, in this review we will talk about <span>how to make a frame</span> for embroidery, and what you need to think about in order for everything to work out qualitatively. </p><h2>  Some design features of embroidery in a frame </h2>

    <p>  Naturally, you can always turn to workshops for help.  Everything can be done there qualitatively, and the work will be done in the shortest possible time.  And you can spend your time on some other occupation than on creating a beautiful design.  All that is required from a person is to choose a style that baguette frames for embroidery will display.  However, doing it yourself is more interesting.  In addition, when creating a product with your own hands, you can fully reveal your taste preferences and make everything so that the product looks perfect in a certain design. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For the frame to serve as an excellent decoration, when creating it, you will need to be guided by the general style of housing.  Or you can just make her style match the style of embroidery.  In addition, you should pay attention to some recommendations that will not be redundant. </p><p>  First, when <span>designing embroidery,</span> it is necessary to take into account its thematic focus.  For example, stories, animals and still lifes will look perfect in a wooden frame.  If the embroidery depicts sea open spaces, then it is worth using a plastic frame, which will be additionally decorated with, for example, shells.  Children's drawings will look great in a frame of cardboard.  Summing up the above, we can say that the frame for embroidery should not only correspond to the features of the picture, but also emphasize them. </p>

    <p>  Secondly, do not forget about the shape of the frame.  It will also largely depend directly on embroidery.  It is worth emphasizing that the silhouette should completely repeat those outlines that the composition embroidered with its own hands possesses.  Therefore, an oval, rectangular, square or round frame for embroidery can be used. </p><p>  Thirdly, you need to choose the right sizes.  Small compositions will simply look wonderful in this kind of frame, from which there is an indent from embroidery that exceeds two centimeters.  In addition, you need to create a frame that will not touch the edges of the image. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Fourth, the color of the frame should be selected in the color scheme that prevails in the embroidered composition, or, conversely, in the tone rarely found in the composition. </p><h2>  The first way to create a passepartout </h2>

When creating it, you can use cardboard, which will be cut out in the form characteristic of the composition.  In order to do this, the embroidery must be placed face down on a flat base.  In the center of the canvas should be placed the basis of cardboard.  After that, you need to bend the edges of the embroidery and sweep them so that the material is stretched.  After that, the composition is placed in a frame, closed with a sheet of plywood and fastened with small studs.  Everything should be done carefully and carefully so that the front of the resulting product is not damaged.

    <h2>  The second way to create a passepartout </h2><p>  Passepartout can be made so that the cardboard is visible and acts as a background for the entire composition.  To achieve this, it is necessary in the middle of the base of cardboard to cut a silhouette to the size of the painting itself.  Then the resulting model is placed on top of the embroidery itself.  The resulting product is covered on the back with another sheet of cardboard and fixed with carnations.  Such a mat can be inserted into a separately manufactured frame, or can be left as is.  As a result, a frame for embroidery from cardboard will be obtained. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Making a picture after creating a frame </h2>

    <p>  When placing an embroidered picture in a frame, attention should be paid to those visual features that are characteristic of a person.  The embroidery should be placed in a frame so that the picture is in the center.  In other words, you need to make sure that the embroidery is not shifted to any one edge. </p><p>  It is worth considering the design of the front of the embroidery with glass.  If the composition is located under it, then you can not worry about the fact that it will become covered with dust and lose its original saturation.  To prevent the image from being distorted, a small distance must be left between the glass and embroidery. </p><h2>  How can I glue a wood frame? </h2>

In this case, curly profiles need to be joined in a "mustache".  In other words, the edges of the parts must be sawed at an angle equal to 45 degrees.  In order for the embroidery frame to turn out to be of high quality, without gaps in the places to be glued, you will need to use special clamps that are improved day by day.

    <p>  There are several ways to glue wood frames.  The first is to use <span>angle clamps.</span>  But this method has certain inconveniences.  Not all clamps can be used to create small frames. </p><p>  The second option is not widespread.  It consists in the fact that the parts to be glued are pulled together by a tape of rubber, which is bonded in the form of a loop.  In order to use this method, you need to have some skills.  In addition, you will need to very accurately cut the ends at a certain angle.  Both methods should be described in more detail. </p><h2>  The first option for gluing the frame </h2>

On the edges, it will be necessary to fix the supporting bars by means of self-tapping screws.  You should pay attention to the fact that the bars should be located at an angle of 90 degrees relative to each other.  To do everything accurately, you need to use a square made of metal.

    <p>  After this, it is necessary to take pre-prepared parts from wood, the ends of which are already sawed, and apply glue solution to them.  Then, you need to take two long clamps and just tighten the parts tightly.  During compression, you should monitor the corners of the frames so that they are pulled together not only tightly, but also without displacements. </p><h2>  Pulling the frame with rubber band or rope </h2><p>  Now we will discuss the option when a frame for embroidery from wood is created by tightening with rubber bands.  To do this, you need to make a base with four persistent bars, and not with two, as it was in the previous case.  The corners of the frame will be pulled together from the inside by a tape of rubber, rope or cable.  In the classic version, all corners should be pulled together with one bolt, and the stop angles will need to be installed on 4 rails located diagonally. </p>

    <p>  The whole complexity of this method lies in creating the construction itself for contraction.  Once created, you can use it further in the manufacture of other frames. </p><h2>  Creating a ceiling skirting frame </h2><p>  In order to get a beautiful frame for embroidery, you will not need to exert maximum effort and look for some expensive materials.  Everything can be made from a simple baseboard.  To do this, you need the following materials and tools: </p><ol><li>  Skirting board made of polystyrene or polystyrene. </li><li>  An adhesive solution with which you can firmly glue together all the details.  An excellent option may be the glue that is used when installing ceiling tiles.  But a really perfect solution would be to use a <span>glue gun.</span> </li><li>  Stationery knife. </li><li>  Miter box. </li><li>  Coloring matter. </li><li>  Ruler with marker. </li></ol><p>  If you suddenly have doubts that this frame will not have high strength, then you should remember the purpose of the embroidery - it will hang on the wall and delight with its beautiful appearance.  Therefore, such an indicator as strength does not play an important role here.  Where lightness and durability are more important.  And these indicators of the tile are at a high level. </p><h2>  What needs to be done to get a beautiful frame? </h2><p>  First of all, you need to carefully measure the embroidery, so that the frame fits perfectly to it.  After that, all dimensions are applied to the skirting board using a ruler and marker.  The miter box is necessary in order to qualitatively and evenly cut the ends at an angle of 45 degrees.  Before you begin to glue the parts obtained as a result of the above work, you need to put them together.  This must be done in order to ensure compliance with all parties.  When all the checks are done, it is necessary to apply the adhesive solution to the ends of the parts from the plinth.  Then the parts are bonded to each other until the glue dries.  For this, it is not necessary to use a special device.  Skirting parts can easily be pressed together using your own hands. </p><h2>  Frame Finishing </h2>

    <p>  After you receive a frame for embroidery from the baseboard, you will need to paint it.  The color scheme is chosen for certain taste preferences, as well as in full accordance with the embroidered composition.  As a result, the resulting version will look quite beautiful and elegant.
