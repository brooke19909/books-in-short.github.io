It’s probably better to start with the good.  So, everyone praises the well-groomed green territory of the sanatorium, the excellent medical base, the polite staff, the wealth (but also not too much!) Of fun, the presence of three mineral springs. </p><p>  However, there are also shortcomings, which slightly overshadows the positive impressions that Anapa can give.  The sanatorium "Rodnik" received negative reviews in 2014 due to uncomfortable rooms and poor nutrition.  Many complain about the lack of fruit, the uniformity of the side dishes and too small portions.  Although the food in this resort is a normal diet and, in principle, it is unlikely it can be different.  People who suffer from a number of diseases remain satisfied with such a menu. </p><h2>  Additional services </h2><p>  Travelers in their own vehicle are provided with a parking space located in the resort.  The Rodnik Hotel offers a library, a cinema and concert hall, day and evening animation, a dance floor, free Wi-Fi in Internet cafes and rooms, a bar and a restaurant.  On the territory of the sanatorium there is a branch of Sberbank and an ATM, pharmacy, gift shop. </p><p>  For an additional fee, guests can use the services of the aesthetic beauty center, organize business events in the conference room, visit the sauna, hammam, hairdresser.  There is also a tour desk where you can sign up for educational trips to Anapa and other cities of the Black Sea coast. </p>
