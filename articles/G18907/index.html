What are redoubts, drops, redans and flushes?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The story of the confrontation between people began from the time when one of them picked up a stick.  But over time, the instruments of war improved, and the resolution of any conflicts in this way became an expensive and very lengthy matter.  After all, both sides developed both measures of active influence on the enemy ‚Äî cold weapons and firearms, reconnaissance, sabotage activities, and passive ones ‚Äî guard duty, fortifications, a strategy for the location and movement of troops, which were supposed to protect them from surprises and provide countermeasures when meeting with enemies. </p><h2>  Why were military defenses used? </h2><p>  This article is about the importance of short-term and long-term field fortifications and their types: we will consider what redoubts, lunettes, redans, flushes and trenches are.  After all, their influence during the war on the depletion of the warring parties is enormous.  On the surviving drawing of that time, which is attached right there, the structural scheme and the role of the most common supporting structures are indicated.  The document perfectly demonstrates what a redoubt is and what its components are (trenches for firing from a different position, elements for strengthening the embankment and building barriers).  The survival of the unit depended on these points of continuous defense, so they were carried out conscientiously. </p>

    <h2>  Differences between temporary support structures and redoubts </h2><p>  At the same time, there were less responsible fortifications.  Depending on whether an offensive was planned or a long defense under cover of artillery, which was located in an open area, field or solid fortifications were being prepared.  For shelter during the offensive, trenches, dugouts and dugouts were used - they provided protection only from rifle fire.  If there was a need to defend, then in order to maintain the combat effectiveness of formations and to protect against shelling, defense structures were erected.  Based on the terrain and natural difficult terrain, they formed a defensive line. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Types of major fortifications.  Redoubt and lunette </h2><p>  To find out what a redoubt is, one should turn to the history of military structures of the 16th-19th centuries.  This term owes its origin to the French word, which means shelter.  Traditionally, in fortifications, the redoubt took on the role of protecting infantry formations, artillery from enemy fire.  Its shape could be arbitrary, but the contour was always closed from the rear to restrict enemy access.  In practice, four-, five-, and hexagonal fortifications were most often used.  Often they were located behind redans or flushes - protruding parts of the earthen mound, reinforced with bundles of brushwood, raw brick constructions, adobe or sacks of earth, and a slope of about 60-120 ·µí.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe redoubt was surrounded by several rows of stone or earthen ramparts, a wooden picket fence and a moat that could be filled with water.  From the back of the structure, a passage for the garrison was provided, which could number from 80 to 1000 soldiers. </p><p>  The lunet, in contrast to the redoubt, had different outlines in plan: its front and flanks were facing enemy positions, but the rear remained open.  This design is explained by the fact that the lunette was not designed to repel attacks from the rear, and its flanks usually relied on an extensive network of trenches or natural barriers (swamps, rivers, lakes, mountains or yars, etc.).  The image below shows what a redoubt is.  Photo taken from a bird's eye view, as its surroundings are inaccessible. </p>

    <h2>  The influence of <span>fortifications</span> in the modern world </h2><p>  Today, all this terminology seems outdated and far from the realities of war.  But when reading fiction about the Patriotic War or historical works about those times, many inadvertently ask themselves questions: who is Raevsky, what is a redoubt, and what is its role on the battlefield?  Unfortunately, these words depart from widespread use, but for those who are interested in the history of the confrontation between Napoleon and Kutuzov, they cannot be empty.  Indeed, in the battle of Borodino the further fate of Russia was decided - to soar or prostrate oneself in front of the interventionists.  It is possible that if the Russian army did not know what a redoubt was, the year 1812 would not have existed for the country in principle.  Indeed, precisely because of the courage of the Slavic army, which, when defending the <span>Shevardin redoubt,</span> used the most radical measures, the Fatherland was saved. </p>

    <p>  In the modern world there is no need to build such massive fortifications, because thanks to various types of weapons their role is reduced to zero.  Nevertheless, their stone bastions remain a magnificent architectural monument for posterity. </p>
