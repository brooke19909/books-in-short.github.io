They are found at great depths of the cultural strata of the earth.  Artifacts manifest themselves at those levels at which, according to today's ideas, there should not have <span>been</span> not only people, but even primates. </p><p>  ABOUT </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Age of humanity" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10523/12368.jpg" width="400"></div>  questioning ‚Äúhow old is humanity?‚Äù, school textbooks confidently wrote that it was forty thousand years old, but the first creatures like humans appeared more than two million years ago.  Such figures were obtained by scientists in 1967.  However, over time, various evidence began to emerge that the age of humanity should be in the millions of years.  For example, during <span>archaeological excavations</span> in California at a depth of seven meters, a parking lot of prehistoric people was discovered.  Traces of fire and parts of stone, rough guns were examined.  The result hit the expedition: the age of the parking was determined at 200 thousand years.

    <p>  Then the scientist L. Lika discovered the skull of a zijanthropus and various stone tools, the analysis of which indicated that their age was more than two million years.  I was looking for the answer to the question "how old is humanity?"  another expedition.  Its participants were fortunate enough to find artifacts in Ethiopia that make it possible to conclude that this age can be safely moved back by 4,000,000 years. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you delve deeper into the problem, it will become clear that the development of mankind dates back to an even earlier period.  For example, in Kenya, a jaw bone was found that belonged to our distant ancestor who lived 13 million years ago!  Findings tell us about individuals.  However, there are data that relate to entire individual civilizations.  They eloquently indicate that they have a much more significant age than previously thought. </p><p>  Next to Mexico City is a <span>step pyramid,</span> exploring which, scientists decided to assume how old humanity is.  In ancient times, its predominant </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Human development" class="if" height="261" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10523/12369.jpg" width="390"></div>  part was flooded with lava erupted from a volcanic crater.  As it turned out later, it was created five million years <span>BC,</span> although it was believed that in this region at that time there were no civilizations at all.  As we can see, this is direct evidence of an organized life.  Using <span>radiocarbon analysis</span> and various modern measurements, it was determined that a person left this building in 2160 BC.

    <p>  It is also interesting that a date dated 12,042 BC was carved on one of the walls in central Africa.  In addition, records of later dates were discovered.  Excavations prove that close to this region there were also developed civilizations, for example, where Peru is now located, bas-reliefs with strange creatures depicted on them were found.  According to experts, this civilization existed 20,000 years before our era.  And how much information is published about the mysterious Hyperborea, the mainland of Arctida, our ancestors of the Aryans, who lived, according to our contemporaries, 18 million years ago! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How old is humanity" class="if" height="303" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10523/11609.jpg" width="554"></div>

    <p>  Unfortunately, modern science takes into account only documentary evidence that answers the question of how old humanity is.  But besides them, there are also non-traditional, difficult to explain sources (ancient manuscripts, traditions, maps of the continents from the 15th century, unexpected finds in recently inaccessible places).  These evidence and facts also allow us to establish the true age of mankind.  As you can see, the Earth is reluctant to part with its secrets. </p>
