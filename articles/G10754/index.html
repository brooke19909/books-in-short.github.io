    <h2>  Positive feedback on the Riviera </h2><p>  Choosing a place to stay, it will be wise to get acquainted with the impressions of other tourists who stayed in the complex.  This will help not only weed out low-quality hotels, but also understand what exactly you want to get from your vacation by choosing the Riviera hotel (Montenegro, Petrovac).  Reviews about him are mostly positive.  Tourists vacationing here note the following advantages of the complex: </p><ul><li>  Tasty, varied and healthy food.  Children always have something to eat.  Lots of delicious cereals serving amazing strawberry ice cream.  Lots of meat and seafood. </li><li>  Very nice location.  A lot of greenery, the hotel is just buried in flowers.  Nearby is one of the most beautiful beaches of Montenegro - Lucice. </li><li>  The rooms are clean and spacious, equipped with good plumbing.  Always tidy up on time. </li><li>  In the evenings, the restaurant always has live music. </li><li>  Excellent facilities for families with children.  Good playground, lots of toys.  There is a clearing for active games. </li></ul><h2>  Negative reviews of tourists </h2><p>  Unfortunately, there are no resort complexes without flaws.  There are always errors, the main thing is that they do not greatly affect the vacation of tourists.  The Riviera Hotel <span>(Montenegro, Petrovac)</span> was no exception <span>.</span>  <span>Reviews in</span> 2016 note the following disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  An extensive construction of a new five-star complex is underway near the hotel.  In the summer, construction is frozen, so there is no loud noise, but the appearance of the unfinished building greatly spoils. </li><li>  Despite the large number of small guests at the hotel, there is no children's animation. </li><li>  The air conditioner buzzes at night and does not cool the room well. </li><li>  Wi-Fi works poorly and not everywhere. </li><li>  The carpeting in the rooms is poorly cleaned and not vacuumed at all. </li><li>  In the evenings, the bar offers only paid drinks, despite the all-inclusive system. </li></ul><p>  Thus, this complex will be an excellent option for those who want to relax inexpensively with their families on the Montenegrin coast.  The area and the sea are very clean, the staff is friendly, and the food is delicious.  But young people resting here can be a little boring.  One way or another, the Riviera Hotel (Petrovac, Montenegro), the reservation of which begins long before the start of the holiday season, is very popular among Russian tourists.  Many of them liked their vacation, and they are happy to relax here again. </p>
