It is famous for its heroic and rich historical events.  A huge number of medieval monuments and architectural ensembles built in the Baroque, Neoclassical, Rococo and Gothic styles are concentrated here.  For one period, Eger was the residence of bishops, and today it is considered the archbishopric center.  The <span>population of Hungary</span> perceives this city as a symbol of the country's patriotism. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="eger hungary" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1436809.jpg" width="590"></div>

    <h2>  Brief information about geography and history </h2><p>  Eger, which Hungary can be proud of, is located in the Northeast region of the state, near the southern mountain slopes of Matra and Bukk.  A settlement was built at a distance of 130 km from the capital of the country, on the shores of the small river Eger.  The city is home to 60 thousand people.  The life of the village is based on the legend of how Istvan Dobo, constable of the Eger fortress, in 1552 for almost a whole month with a small detachment opposed the Turks, who were 20 times superior in strength.  Many <span>monuments, books,</span> customs and museums are dedicated to this feat. </p><p>  At the beginning of the 10th century, the Hungarian conquerors occupied the territory on which Eger (Hungary) is located today.  This fact is confirmed by the graves found by archaeological scientists within the village.  Armed men were buried in the graves, and Arabian coins were also found there.  The time of birth of the city coincided with the reign of the king of St. Stephen.  In 1241, the Mongol-Tatars invaded Eger.  They almost completely destroyed the village.  But when the Mongol-Tatar army left the city, the period of its development began.  At that time, the same Eger fortress was built, which we mentioned above.  During the years 1458-1490 the Episcopal Palace was erected.  This happened during the reign of King Matthias. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Eger city Hungary" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1436810.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Eger Attractions </h2><p>  Eger <span>(Hungary),</span> whose <span>sights</span> are of interest to many historians and travelers, attracts attention with the fortress around which the city was built.  At that time, when Istvan Dobo held the defense of the structure, it was badly destroyed as a result of bilateral military operations.

Today, the attraction has its original episcopal Gothic style exclusively on the model presented in the fortress museum of Istvan Dobo. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The attention of travelers is also worthy of the Cathedral, built in the neoclassical style.

    <h2>  Thermal springs and treatment </h2><p>  Many travelers are attracted to the city of Eger.  Hungary has at its disposal several medicinal and healing sources.  Some of them are located in this city.  Eger is one of the largest resorts in the country.  Water from thermal springs treated various ailments back in the Middle Ages.  The first bathing houses in the village appeared in the XV-XVI centuries.  Here they took water procedures in wooden barrels and steam baths.  The bathing culture was actively developed by the Turks who came to the Hungarian lands.  They generally appreciated the indescribable power of healing water.  To this day, many Turkish bath houses have been preserved in the city.  These are steam baths and hot water baths.  In Eger, at the beginning of the 17th century, a Turkish bath was erected, which still exists today.  Here is a modern center of balneology. </p>
