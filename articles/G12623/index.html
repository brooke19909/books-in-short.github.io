This question interests citizens when they begin to notice a violation of their own rights.  Usually this topic mainly concerns those who took a loan or a loan.  Debtors more often than others face a violation of the rights and terms of the contract.  In some cases, the complaint is raised by ordinary customers.  If something doesn‚Äôt suit you, you have every right to complain about the organization.  But how to do that?  What are the scenarios? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to complain about the bank" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1322195.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Possible ways </h2><p>  Where to complain about the bank?  There are a lot of answers to this question.  You yourself have the right to choose the place of appeal.  Only with all the circumstances of the situation.  It is not always possible to contact one or another service to write a complaint about a banking organization.  There are exceptions.  Without regard to circumstances, you have the right to contact: </p><ul><li>  head office of the bank; </li><li>  court; </li><li>  anti-collection agency; </li><li>  Rospotrebnadzor; </li><li>  Federal Antimonopoly Service; </li><li>  communications surveillance service; </li><li>  the prosecutor's office; </li><li>  Central Bank </li></ul><h2>  Main office </h2><p>  Where can I complain about the bank?  To begin with, it is worth starting with the most humane measures.  We are talking about contacting the main office of the organization.  Typically, cities have branches, and the head office is in the capital.  This is where you will have to send your complaint. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When is contacting the main office suitable?  As practice shows, in all.  If your rights have been violated, as well as if you have any complaints about the work of the department, you can contact the higher authorities.  At the initial stage, this is the head office of the company. </p><p>  After you submit the application, the answer should come within 10-15 days.  Usually all customer complaints are taken into account.  What if this did not happen?  Where to complain about the bank in this case? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where can I complain about the bank" class="if" height="242" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1322193.jpg" width="599"></div>

    <h2>  Rospotrebnadzor </h2><p>  Any company provides certain services.  Therefore, it falls under the influence of the Law on Consumer Rights.  If it is not respected, you can safely complain to Rospotrebnadzor.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter which company you are talking about - regular or banking.  The main thing is that your rights are violated. </p><p>  To translate ideas into reality, it is necessary to write a complaint to Rospotrebnadzor for a particular bank.  You must clearly state in it all the circumstances and violations that have occurred.  If there is any evidence of an organization‚Äôs misconduct, attach it.  And after that, send your <span>application to Rospotrebnadzor.</span> </p><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear where to complain about the bank.  A response from the organization should come about 30 days after receiving your complaint.  If you are "heard", all violations will be quickly corrected.  In practice, citizens rarely turn to the specified authority.  More often, other scenarios take place.  Fortunately, there are many more. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Antimonopoly </h2><p>  For example, you have the right to contact <span>the Federal Antimonopoly Service.</span>  Not too common, but you need to know about it.  After all, if you are looking for where to complain about the actions of the bank, you will need to consider all possible solutions to the problem.  They can be different, even almost not found in practice.  But you need to know them fully.  Maybe it‚Äôs your case that is suitable for appeal to a particular authority. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to complain about the actions of the bank" class="if" height="290" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1322192.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Antitrust authorities may be contacted when <span>antitrust laws are</span> violated <span>.</span>  But most often here it is recommended to write complaints in cases where you are misled or imposed by some services.  Conversion is extremely effective. </p><p>  What can be called the term "misleading"?  For example, you decided on some service by watching an advertisement, but it did not indicate the important points of concluding an agreement and assisting you. </p><p>  Another reason for applying to the FAS may be coercion to something.  For example, if, when issuing a loan, the bank insists on insurance with a partner insurance company.  It is illegal.  Therefore, you will have to contact the antitrust service. </p><h2>  Communications Supervision Service </h2><p>  Where can I complain about the actions of the bank?  Sometimes, as has already been said, there is an appeal to the communications supervision services.  Perhaps one of the rarest phenomena that can only be observed.  After all, there are very few reasons why the population applies here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If you have suspicions or strong arguments that the bank violates the rules of storage and processing of information, it is in the previously mentioned service that you must write a complaint.  There is no more reason to implement the idea.  Have to choose another place of treatment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to complain about the bank" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1322191.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Remember: your data must be kept confidential.  Access to them in a banking organization is available only to a specially authorized person.  And no one else.  The transfer of personal information about customers to third parties is a direct violation of the law.  Therefore, you have the right to contact the communications surveillance service.  Only appropriate treatment and evidence of violation will be required.  Or good reason to complain about a crime by a banking organization of the law. </p><h2>  Prosecutor's office </h2><p>  Where to complain about the <span>VTB 24 bank</span> or any other?  A good option would be to contact the prosecutor.  A fairly common phenomenon that many citizens resort to.  It is recommended that you first contact the head offices of banking organizations, and if there is no sense in this, then you should already go to the prosecutor. </p><p>  As a rule, people come here with a variety of problems.  This is a universal place to file complaints.  Unless you should complain about the work of a specific department (service).  It is useless, and inefficient.  Where is it better to contact the head office of a banking organization. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to complain about calls from the bank" class="if" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1322194.jpg" width="588"></div>

    <p>  You can usually find complaints at the prosecutor's office that indicate violations of the law in force in Russia.  Remember: if the bank has broken the law, you can safely go with a statement to the prosecutor.  An answer from him will come to you about a month after the appeal.  Not too fast, of course, but the result after such an act will be noticeable.  The prosecutor's office is one of the most influential organizations capable of protecting bank customers.  You should not neglect this place. </p><h2>  Collectors </h2><p>  It is hard to imagine, but the so-called anti-collection companies also take place.  Thinking about where to complain about Tinkoff Bank or any other?  Then consider the option with anti-collection organizations. </p><p>  It‚Äôs not so hard to guess when it‚Äôs worth contacting here for help.  If we are talking about ‚Äúknocking out‚Äù debts and attracting collectors without warnings and legal grounds, you have every right to come to anti-collectors.  They will help calm down collection organizations and deal with the bank. </p><p>  A similar scenario does not develop too often.  After all, anti-collection companies are not yet available in all cities.  Yes, and they were originally intended not to fight with banks, but to defeat collectors.  So you can consider a similar approach to solving the problem, but it is recommended to postpone it "in the long box" and do not remember until the bank attracts collectors to the showdowns.  Then you can without any doubts ask for help from anti-collection companies. </p><p>  How exactly?  It is enough to simply clarify the situation (preferably in writing), and then pay for the services.  Everything, you can wait for the results.  They will not keep you waiting.  Progress after the collision of collectors and anti-collectors is visible almost immediately. </p><h2>  Court </h2><p>  Where to complain about Russian Standard Bank and more?  If you have time, you can resort to the help of the judiciary.  Also a very common situation.  As soon as the rights of the population are violated, it is recommended that you first try to solve everything peacefully, and then deal with the court.  District will do. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where you can complain about the actions of the bank" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1322196.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The lawsuit will have to describe all the violations that bother you.  Also, the nuances of illegal actions by the bank are indicated here.  If there are witnesses, invite them.  And do not forget to include data on these people in the lawsuit. </p><p>  An important point is the proof of violations.  Everything that can indicate the unlawfulness of the actions taken by the bank is listed in the statement of claim and is attached to it.  The more you have grounds for accusation, the higher the likelihood of success. </p><p>  For what reasons to contact here?  For any.  The court is a place that will help protect your rights, regardless of the situation.  As practice shows, when disagreeing with banks, law enforcement agencies are usually on the consumer side. </p><h2>  Central bank </h2><p>  Where to complain about the bank?  Sometimes the population has a chance to contact the Central Bank.  This is the most serious decision you have to make.  Remember, the grounds for such complaints should be really good.  Just because no one will engage in conducting thorough audits of an organization. </p><p>  As practice shows, this phenomenon is not too common.  But the process is no different from writing a complaint in any other instance.  You are required to file a statement and evidence of violations, if any.  Or a detailed history of why you think your rights are violated (or the law). </p><p>  After you send an application to the Central Bank, you can only wait for an answer.  He will come in about a month (more precisely 30 days).  Sometimes already with the results of checking the actions of a banking company. </p><h2>  Grounds for contacting the Central Bank </h2><p>  If you are wondering where to complain about calls from the bank, do not disturb the Central Bank.  It has already been said that the grounds for applying here should be really compelling.  Which ones?  You can call an approximate list of situations in which you have the right to legally draw the attention of the Central Bank to violations: </p><ol><li>  The lender violates bank secrecy, discloses information about the borrower and his documents. </li><li>  The Bank violates the conditions for opening deposits and accounts. </li><li>  Unreasonable refusal to issue a bank card. </li><li>  The Bank refuses to provide you with information about services (data on deposits and services). </li></ol>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  What should be summed up?  If you violate existing laws, as well as your rights by the bank, you are able to contact a huge number of instances.  Which option to choose?  It is necessary to look at the circumstances. </p><p>  The most effective and common methods are: filing a lawsuit or appeal to the prosecutor.  If your rights have been violated, try to act immediately.  The more time passes, the less is your chance of success in achieving justice. </p>
