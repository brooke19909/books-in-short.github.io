In addition, it is one of the few countries in Europe that has retained its national currency, and not switched to the euro.  Perhaps that is why many collectors and numismatists collect coins from Switzerland. </p><h2>  Short story </h2><p>  The official currency of Switzerland is the Swiss franc, which was put into circulation in 1798. Soon it was discontinued to be issued, and resumed only in 1850. Then Swiss coins appeared, although the release of metal coins on the territory of the country was earlier. </p><p>  <span>The Swiss franc</span> is divided into one hundred rappens.  To date, the Central Bank of Switzerland issues coins in denominations of five, ten and twenty rappen.  There are also metal ones worth half a Swiss franc, one franc, two and five.  Coin in two rappens was no longer minted in 1974, and in 2006 the issue of coins worth one rappen was discontinued. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The 5 rappen coin is made from an alloy of aluminum, copper and nickel.  All the rest, apart from commemorative and anniversary, are made of an alloy of copper and nickel in a ratio of 750 to 250. On the reverse of coins of denominations of five, ten and twenty rappen face value is framed by a wreath, and on the obverse is an allegorical image of a human head and the inscription Swiss Confederation on Latin. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="coins of switzerland" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47468/1773426.jpg" width="509"></div>

This is an allegory to Helvetia, which is the personified symbol of Switzerland.  Around Helvetia is 22 stars. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="coins switzerland Price" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47468/1772824.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  The coin of 5 francs (Switzerland) depicts on the obverse the image of the national literary hero of the country of William Tell.  Also on the obverse is an inscription - Swiss Confederation in Latin.  The reverse shows us the image of the coat of arms of the country, framed by stems of edelweiss and gentian flowers. </p><h2>  Swiss coin value </h2><p>  Collectors do not often purposefully collect Swiss money, but there is still interest in them.  You can buy Swiss coins without much difficulty, even in Russia.  Of course, not every antique store or specialized outlet has Swiss stores.  But there are many online stores where you can easily buy Swiss coins.  The price for them is usually not too high.  Regular coins in denominations of 5 rappen will cost you only 20-30 rubles.  The cost varies depending on the year of minting and the degree of preservation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Also, pricing is influenced by its face value and circulation of the issue.  So, commemorative coins of Switzerland, which are issued periodically, will cost much higher than ordinary coins, minted regularly and in large volumes.  For example, commemorative coins issued by the centenary of Le Corbusier in 1987 can be bought in Russia for about 500-600 rubles.  Roughly the same will be worth other commemorative coins minted in the 80s. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="coin 5 francs switzerland" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47468/1772823.jpg" width="490"></div>

    <p>  The older the coin, the higher its value.  This is due to the antique value, as well as the fact that the longer the coins are in circulation, the more difficult it is to find them later.  Rarity adds an amount to the price.  In this case, the cost is determined individually.  This is done by a qualified specialist who forms the price, guided by a number of factors.  An experienced collector can independently determine the <span>value of a</span> Swiss <span>coin</span> , but in this case the probability of an incorrect estimate is high. </p><h2>  Commemorative coins </h2><p>  Commemorative coins in Switzerland, although issued, but this is not constant.  Most often, their denomination: ten, twenty and fifty Swiss francs.  In 2005, a series of bimetallic ten-franc coins was issued, which depicted Mount Jungfrau.  In 2009, another 10 francs series was released depicting the Swiss National Park. </p><p>  In 2007, a batch of commemorative coins depicting the Mouton fortress was minted.  Their face value was equal to 20 francs.  In 2004, coins were issued in denominations of 50 francs, and they depicted Mount Matterhorn. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Coins of Switzerland, although not in extremely high demand among collectors, are still quite interesting.  They are collected abroad more often than in Russia.  Therefore, finding them there is easier.  In specialized Russian stores, the selection of Swiss coins is small, but in online stores there is plenty to choose from.  Their cost is not too big, and it‚Äôs not difficult to order. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="coin value switzerland" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47468/1772826.jpg" width="493"></div>

    <p>  For the general collection, Swiss coins will be a great addition and decoration, so it makes sense to pay attention to them.  And the fact that they are not in high demand in Russia will make them a kind of exclusive to your unique collection.  If you want to buy a certain coin, which is not in Russian online stores, then you can also search for it on foreign platforms.  Often rare copies are sold at online auctions. </p>
