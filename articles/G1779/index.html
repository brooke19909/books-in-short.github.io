The city is only thirty years old.  It appeared instead of the fishing village, in which 30 thousand people lived, and today more than 10 million inhabitants live and work in the metropolis.

Shenzhen (China) has become a major financial, industrial and transportation center of the republic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="shenzhen china" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/1444072.jpg" width="600"></div>
