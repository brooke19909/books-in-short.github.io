Plastic Bottle Craft Ideas</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Now popular <span>crafts from recycled materials, the</span> so-called <span>waste material.</span>  <span>This is the</span> new life of already used items.  In the article, we will offer the reader options for crafts from bottles, plastic containers for water and juices.  Some crafts require a lot of preliminary work and a long collection of material. </p><p>  Let's take a closer look at what can be made from bottles.  In addition, you need to prepare sharp scissors, gouache or acrylic paints, brushes, a binder in the form of wire, ropes, an adhesive gun.  Making crafts using plastic bottles is a very exciting experience. </p><p>  Thanks to the secondary use of plastic items, you can significantly save money, and implement any of your fantasies and ideas. </p><p>  From plastic bottles you can make decor items: lamps, vases, phone coasters and pens, toys for children, Christmas-tree decorations.  It is easy to arrange the territory of the kindergarten and the personal plot, make bird feeders and hang decorations near the tree house in the winter.  You can dream endlessly. </p><p>  Consider some interesting ideas and a workshop from plastic bottles of crafts. </p><h2>  Funny vases </h2><p>  In a nursery or in a kindergarten group, you can make bottle vases for indoor flowers with funny muzzles of animals.  You will need three plastic two-liter bottles.  Their color is unimportant, since they will be painted with paints. </p><p>  To cut out a drawing, you first need to take a marker and draw a template.  For a gray mouse, draw round ears, for a panda bear - semicircular and slightly beveled to the side, for a cat - triangular. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Then we take sharp scissors and cut out the shape of the muzzle and ears along the contour.  It remains only to properly paint the vases from the bottle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rossbearpost.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Recycled Vases" class="if uuid-2260328" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2260328.jpg"></div><p>  The mouse is painted with gray paint.  On ears pink circles and a nose are drawn.  Black paint - eyes and mustache.  The cat can be painted with bright yellow or orange.  After drying, triangular ears and a semicircular spout are applied with pink paint.  Panda painted in white.  The eyes, ears and nose on the face are painted in black.  It is advisable not to paint the inside of the bottle so as not to harm the plant.  So that the paint does not wash off, the container can be covered with acrylic varnish or use acrylic paints instead of gouache. </p><p>  When the product dries, you can fill the ground and transplant flowers.  In the bottom of the vase, you can make small holes so that there is an outflow of excess water.  Then you will need a pallet - a small plate. </p><h2>  Penguin </h2><p>  To create a toy penguin from a bottle, you must first prepare the blank.  You will need thick PVA glue, two 1.5-liter transparent bottles, paints, a shred of cloth for a scarf and threads for a pompom. </p><p>  On one of the bottles, a bottom 5 cm high is cut off with scissors around the circumference. On the other, you need to cut a narrow neck, leave the bottom and body of the bottle 15 cm high. Then you need to glue a small bottom to the second, longer part.  It turns out a blank for a penguin, which has the same structure on both sides. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="wonderfuldiy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Plastic penguin" class="if uuid-2260331" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2260331.jpg"></div><p>  Then use the marker to draw the penguin's face.  In order not to see the glued joint of two bottles, you need to glue it with tape.  You can use a thin color, so that later on top of it do not apply paint.  When the workpiece is done, you can start painting the penguin from the bottle. </p><p>  To do this, you need black, white, red paint and any color for a hat.  When the drawing is applied, the product is put to dry.  In the meantime, you need to pick up a scarf for a penguin that matches the color of the hat.  In the upper recess you need to glue the pompom.  An adhesive gun is best for this. </p><p>  We remind the reader how to make a pompom out of yarn.  Two rings of the same size are cut out of cardboard.  The outer circumference will correspond to the size of the decoration for the hat.  Then we wrap the thread around the ring and tie it to a knot.  Then the thread is threaded into a large needle and threaded many times inside the rings until the inner hole is completely filled. </p><p>  Then the scissors are inserted into the outer gap between the rings and cut in a circle.  Next, you need to turn a simple cotton thread between the paper rings several times and tie the yarn tightly so that the threads do not fall apart.  It remains to cut the cardboard and remove the rings, and then make a pompom.  If he made uneven edges, then with scissors we give him the shape of a ball. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Spiders on strings </h2><p>  If you do not know what can be made from bottles, then create your child such cheerful spiders that are hung on threads or thin ropes.  They can be hung in a room by a window, and the wind will wave them.  They will look ridiculous on a tree in the country. </p><p>  Such spiders can be made from bottles of any color.  A hole is pierced in the lid where the thread is inserted.  A tight knot is tied on the inside of the cork so that the thread cannot slip into the hole. </p><p>  Crafts are made from bottles of different sizes, then spiders are obtained in different sizes.  You can make a large spider mom from a 2-liter bottle and babies from 0.5 liters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rope spiders" class="if uuid-2261565" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2261565.jpg"></div><p>  To make crafts, you need to trim the bottom of the bottle and cut the top of the cone into thin strips.  These are the legs of a spider.  The edges of each limb are rounded with small scissors so that there are no sharp corners.  Then you need to form the folds on the legs.  To do this, plastic strips are pressed with your fingers in several places, simulating the spider's paws.  To make the toy look funny, you need to glue a pair of eyes to each figure.  They can be made of plasticine using the white color and the color of the pupil cap.  <span>Foam balls</span> can be used on which pupils are colored with colored markers. </p><h2>  Christmas tree made of plastic bottles </h2><p>  Recently, it has become a fashionable trend to protect nature, namely, green trees, which are thrown out after the New Year holidays.  People are trying to preserve the forest stands that suffer from such vandalism. </p><p>  Every year, more and more people put Christmas trees made of artificial materials in their homes, come up with creative ideas.

Inventive craftsmen and the New Year's beauty did not leave attention. </p><p>  Such a forest beauty can be put in the office, in the courtyard of a private house, cafe or on the site of a kindergarten.  In order to make a Christmas tree from plastic bottles, you need to collect a lot of identical, preferably green bottles.  In order for the tiers to be installed one on the other, it is necessary to cut circles of different diameters from corrugated cardboard.  To prevent the coasters from being seen, you need to lay out a lush colored rain on cardboard. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ghajnsielemprimary.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Christmas tree" class="if uuid-2260339" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2260339.jpg"></div><p>  In a circle, each tier is wrapped either with transparent tape or with a food thin film.  At the top, you can install one bottle and put on top a cone with a decorated top.  If you wrap such a tree with a garland with luminous lights, then the New Year tree will sparkle brightly. </p><h2>  Santa Claus under the Christmas tree </h2><p>  Under a plastic Christmas tree, you can make Santa Claus from a bottle.  You need to take a small capacity - 0.5 l or 1 liter.  So that the craft does not fall, it is better to collect sand in a bottle.  The main work on the image of the character beloved by the kids will consist in coloring.  You need to have some fine art skills to draw a face, a beard, a mustache and a costume of a fairy-tale hero. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Santa Claus" class="if uuid-2261547" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2261547.jpg"></div><p>  Volumetric mittens can be made of plasticine.  The final touch in creating Santa Claus from a bottle will be sewing hats with a pompom.  For this, it is best to use a red felt sheet.  A triangle is cut from a material bent in half, the base of which corresponds to half the diameter of the neck of the bottle. </p><p>  An inner seam is made along the leg.  The hat is decorated with a white pompom and a rim that can be made by gluing cotton.  You can put Santa Claus under the tree, both real and plastic. </p><h2>  Christmas decorations </h2><p>  New Year‚Äôs toys can be made different from bottles using a cut bottom.  To make the cut smooth, it can be melted with a hot iron or a candle.  On the inside of the bottom draw snowflakes, ornament. </p><p>  You can take multi-colored bottles, or you can paint over a transparent version.  In one of the corners you need to make a hole for a thread or a thin rope, for which New Year's toys from bottles will be hung on a Christmas tree. </p><div class="photo" data-original="comefare.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Christmas decorations" class="if uuid-2261566" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2261566.jpg"></div><p>  It is most convenient to glow a spoke on a fire and burn a round and even hole.  Then a thin thread is threaded into it and tied to a knot at a distance of 10 cm. You can also create decorations on the curtains.  To do this, instead of a thread, you need to insert a clerical pin in the toy, unbending one edge.  For him, like on a hook, such snowflakes are suspended on a fabric. </p><h2>  Take care of the birds in winter </h2><p>  Winter is a difficult time for our smaller brothers.  At this time, it is advisable to feed the birds with grains and fruits.  Plastic containers are an excellent material for the manufacture of both houses for birds and places where you can pour food into them. </p><p>  If you do not know how to make a bottle feeder, then consider the options presented in the photo below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dontpayfull.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bird feeders" class="if uuid-2261560" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2261560.jpg"></div><p>  From a three-liter canister you can make a wonderful birdhouse for birds.  To do this, you need to paint over or glue the container with self-adhesive, preferably a natural brown color.  Roof details are cut from other bottles and inserted under the screw cap.  A round inlet is made on the side.  It is advisable to melt its edges so that the bird does not cut the legs. </p><p>  For feeders, you can take a two-liter transparent bottle or a container from the washing gel, just wash it well.  A canister of thick plastic is cut, as in the photo in the center, and attached to a tree branch by the handle.  Grains there must be added daily. </p><p>  Now we will introduce the reader to how to make a feeder from a refillable bottle.  Seeds or cereals are poured into it until the end, and small cuts are cut in the sides, in which spoons are inserted.  It‚Äôs convenient for the birds to sit on a spoon, and the grains will slowly spill out as they eat. </p><p>  This type of feeder is convenient in that, having collected the tank once, you can not check its fullness for several days.  The bottle is hung by a hook screwed into the cap. </p><h2>  Exotic palm from bottles </h2><p>  In summer, several palm trees can be made from brown and green bottles in the summer cottage or kindergarten.  But for this you need 2-3 strong metal thin tubes, as a basis for trees.  The trunk of a palm tree consists of brown trimmed bottles worn on the pipe.  A minimum of 15 bottles will be needed for each trunk, depending on the height of the tree.  The bottom and the ‚Äúbody‚Äù are cut off in each container at a distance of 10 cm. </p><p>  On each bottle, a wide edge is cut by triangles and the plastic is bent outward to create the appearance of layered elements of the barrel.  The first bottle is put down on the pipe and is inserted tightly into the ground.  The second and subsequent containers are inserted in the same way with pressure so that they do not move among themselves.  When the required height is reached, work on the barrel ends. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wmsecret.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Palm tree" class="if uuid-2261523" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2261523.jpg"></div><p>  To make foliage, you need to have several green two-liter bottles that are cut along.  The bottom is pre-trimmed.  Carved palm leaves are cut from two halves of the bottle with sharp scissors. </p><p>  When 5 or 6 bottles are prepared, you can begin to attach them to the tube.  To do this, you will need to pass the wire into the pipe, you will need as many segments as there are leaves.  A hole is made in the bottle cap along the diameter of the wire.  After it is done, a strong knot is tied, then the carved part of the bottle is twisted. </p><p>  You can add plastic bananas to the branches on top.  Everything, the palm from the bottles is ready! </p><h2>  Beautiful table lamp </h2><p>  From plastic bottles, you can create not only the design of land, but also elements of home decor.  So, from a wide capacity and plastic spoons you can make a table lamp "Pineapple". </p><p>  A bottle is made from a bottle.  First, the threaded neck and the bottom are cut off.  Then, spoons painted yellow are attached to the transparent glue in layers.  Previously, they carefully cut the handles.  Begin gluing from the bottom up. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.labellecarte.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pineapple like a shade" class="if uuid-2261571" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2261571.jpg"></div><p>  Pineapple tail is cut from several bottles of green and strung on top of the ceiling.  All small parts are mounted on a transparent glue, you can use an adhesive gun.  Then a new decor element is put on the place of the old on the lamp.  Do not forget about safety measures, plastic should not come into contact with an incandescent lamp.  An LED safety lamp is inserted into such a lamp. </p><h2>  Interesting ideas </h2><p>  You can make any toy for a child from bottles with your own hands, for example, a pig, a mouse, a car, a train.  From tanks with a trimmed bottom, you can design rackets for catching the ball.  If you put the bottles in a row, you can use them as skittles and knock down the ball.  Sand is poured into a 1.5-liter bottle, and you need to try to put on the ring, so that you get the Ring Ring game. </p><p>  And if you make a set of animals, you can play table-top theater with your children, making up funny stories.  Plastic flowers - tulips, daffodils and even roses will look beautiful in vases.  Wonderful daisies are obtained from the bottom, which will delight all year round. </p><p>  Many useful gizmos can be made from plastic bottles - a stand for a mobile phone and for books or pencils.  In cut containers, you can plant seedlings and arrange the edges of the flowerbed.  Some desperate inventors even make a raft from empty bottles tied together and go on a trip along a river or lake. </p><p>  If you fasten the bottles together, you can make furniture, a basket for toys.  For the home craftsman, empty containers can be adapted for small parts - screws, bolts, screws, confirmations, nails, drills and other trifles, so necessary in the household. </p><p>  Do not rush to throw away empty bottles, because now you know what can be made from bottles, think, maybe, having read our article, and you want to do some kind of craft together with your baby, at the same time extend the life of the secondary material.
