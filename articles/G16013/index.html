Museums in Tula</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Tula is one of the <span>most ancient cities in Russia.</span>  <span>The city</span> arose on the lands inhabited by the Slavic tribe of Vyatichi.  For many centuries this city was a very important administrative, industrial and commercial center.  It is inextricably linked with historical events that entailed the unification of all Russian lands under Moscow. </p><h2>  First settlements </h2><p>  The exact date of the founding of the city has sunk into oblivion, but for the first time it became known about it from the annals dating back to 1146.  Modern Tula is located south of the first settlements.  Over time, residents moved closer to the area where the Tulitsa River flowed into Upu.  Here Chernihiv princes decided to build an oak fortress and call it Tula. </p><h2>  Development </h2><p>  The defensive structure occupied an important strategic position and was located on the southernmost edge of the Russian state, which had just begun to form.  The fortress repeatedly passed from hand to hand.  She survived the invasion of Batu in 1237 and Tokhtamysh in 1382, as well as numerous raids of the Nogai and Crimean Tatars.  Even the Lithuanian conquerors managed to visit here!  Only in 1503 did Tula finally depart to the Moscow Principality. </p><p>  In 1514, Moscow Prince Vasily III inside the oak fortress ordered the stone city to be built, that is, the Kremlin.  The construction was completed after 6 years.  Since that time, Tula has become a defensive line, protecting the southern approaches to Moscow.  Later, in the XVII century, the city was already a well-fortified reliable military camp, at any moment ready to repel enemy attacks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Tula fortress has always been quite densely built up and populated, and all because the market was located on its western side, where brisk trade was conducted.  Rapidly developing crafts were supposed to meet the needs of residents and the defense needs of the state.  Since the construction of the stone Kremlin, the city of Tula has become the center of an important defensive line that guards the southern approaches to the capital of the Moscow principality. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  This city is quite popular among tourists because it has a rich historical past.  He can tell a lot of interesting facts about the formation of the Russian state and the emergence of crafts, so guests have something to see in Tula. </p><p>  You can just go for a walk around the city, but it is best to use the services of professional guides.  Travel agencies offer interesting Tula tours not only for adults, but also for schoolchildren.  Numerous museums and unusual floating fountains will surely please you and your children. </p><h2>  Museums </h2><p>  Given the rich past of the city, tourists and locals with great pleasure visit the museums of Tula and its other attractions.  It will be interesting to learn about the history of the development of weapons, the famous delicacy, <span>printed gingerbread,</span> or the oldest Russian factory for the production of accordions and button accordions. </p><p>  One of the most famous is the <span>Tula Museum of Fine Arts.</span>  It has several branches: the Tula Kremlin, an exposition dedicated to the works of the artist P.

    <p>  The museum exposition clearly conveys every stage of the life of a talented master.  Here you will not find either cartoons or cartoons, although he was a member of the famous trinity of cartoonists "Kukryniksy".  The artist's works presented here consist of portraits and still lifes, a special place in his work is given to the landscape.  And this is understandable, because Tula was endowed with the native land for Porfiry Nikitich, endowed with beautiful panoramas that one would like to put on the canvas. </p><p>  This exhibition is interesting not only for adults.  If you decide to go on an excursion to this ancient city, then take your children with you - they will have something to do.  A variety of events are held for them, for example, entertaining lectures, including ‚ÄúHello, Museum‚Äù, musical matinees, etc. An excellent creative team will always find something to please and surprise the kids and their parents. </p><h2>  The city of gunsmiths </h2><p>  As you know, the museums of Tula are very interesting and informative.  Tourists who come to this city in large numbers try to visit them as much as possible.  One of such cultural places is the famous Tula State Museum of Arms, where not only adults, but also children can spend their time with benefit.  Believe me, there is something to see here.  In Tula, from ancient times, they were engaged in the development and production of weapons.  Excursions prove to visitors the crucial importance of arms production in shaping the great history of Russia. </p><p>  For example, when at the beginning of 1940 it became clear that the Soviet Union could not avoid a war with Germany, engineer G. S. Shpagin began to design new weapons for the Red Army.  Tula began to develop and manufacture a new model submachine gun at its factory - the famous PPSh. </p>

    <p>  An extensive exhibition, put on public display, allows guests to find out complete information about the development of weapons, from the XVI century to the present day.  The museum includes collections of models of muzzle-loading combat, automatic, sports, hunting and other weapons.  In addition, there is a beautiful numismatic collection that contains commemorative and anniversary medals, orders, state awards and badges. </p><p>  There is also a fund with historical documents and print media.  Not the last place in it is occupied by the graphic collection - drawings of <span>automatic weapons</span> and sketches of its decoration.  Such famous artists as I.V.Sherbino and V.P. Gustov worked on them.  The print media includes magazines found at the arms factory in the late 19th century: The Artillery Journal and The Weapons Collection.  This also includes books on historical subjects about weapons and autographs of famous gunsmiths N.F. Tokarev and M.T. Kalashnikov. </p><p>  A range of historical values ‚Äã‚Äãcloses the artillery collection.  It is represented mainly by samples of gun trunks, which also causes considerable interest and makes an indelible impression on museum visitors. </p><h2>  Museum "Demidov Necropolis" </h2><p>  Speaking of what to see in Tula, it is impossible not to recall the Demidovs, who are known as the dynasty of large industrialists.  Their family included lawyers, military men, writers, musicians, gunsmiths, scientists, philanthropists, and simply philanthropists.  Demidov traveled around the world and collected antiques and works of art. </p>

    <p>  The museum exposition has a collection of 300 exhibits presented in a historical and everyday style.  For example, a samovar of A. Yu. Parichko‚Äôs system with a removable jug for fuel is rarely seen in Russian exhibition halls or in private collections, but you will certainly find such a copy in the Tula Samovar museum.  Here is the oldest example of the first Tula factory of the Lisitsyn 1800. </p><p>  Here, tourists will find decorative samovars from the most unexpected material: glass, porcelain, vines, wood, clay, birch bark and even sugar.  Museum guides will certainly show guests other types of water heaters: a samovar-coffee pot, a samovar, a beaten man and unique examples from the Soviet Union.  Their size is also of great importance.  The museum presents both huge seventy-liter pantries and tiny samovars, designed for only three drops of water. </p><h2>  Tula gingerbread </h2><p>  Speaking of Tula, it is impossible not to recall the world famous Tula gingerbread cookies.  In honor of this delicacy, a whole museum of the same name was founded in the city.  Having been here, visitors will learn the history of the preparation of delicious sweets, its centuries-old rites and traditions.  The walls of the museum keep many secrets, including how to make a real, traditional gingerbread for this area.  Tula, by the way, has always been famous for its extraordinary delicacies.  The oldest of them, which has survived to this day, was prepared in 1685. </p>

    <p>  The most popular are two floating fountains, which are located on <span>the Upa River</span> near the Zarechensky Bridge.  They are located at a distance from each other in such a way that they can be seen not only walking along the bridge or along the river, but also from the windows of the Tula State Museum of Weapons.  The presented fountains throw trickles of water up to three meters high above the surface of the river.  Similar fountains can be found only in ten settlements of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  Tula is the same age as Moscow.  That is why there is a lot of interesting things.  So what to look at?
