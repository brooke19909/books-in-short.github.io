This, in fact, is the end of Crimea.  Next is the sea.  Translated from the Crimean Tatar name means "place exempted from taxes."  Indeed, a long time ago (XV ‚Äî XVIII centuries) the population of this part of Crimea did not pay taxes.  So it was said in the "Tarkhan letters." </p>

    <h2>  Clear water and wild cliffs </h2><p>  If you want to know what the earth looked like millions of years ago, then here you are.  It seems that civilization got a little lost and did not end up in Tarhankut (Crimea).  Not only is this a sparsely populated territory, but travelers are always sparse here.  But there is no silver lining.  As a result, it was possible not to spoil the pristine beauty of the Tarkhankut Peninsula.  Today it is the cleanest stretch of the Black Sea coast. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The cape of the same name is the very point beyond which in the west - only the sea.  Namely, it is a big attraction.  For such transparent water on the coast you will not see anywhere.  If you ever come here, don't forget the scuba gear or snorkel mask.  You can look at the inhabitants of the sea yourself.  Or for a small fee, experienced divers will show you what is going on in depth. </p><p>  The transparency of the sea here is such that underwater photography competitions are held. </p><p>  Nearly the Tarhankut Peninsula, the vertical cliffs of limestone are fabulously beautiful; they break off at the very sea. </p>

    <h2>  Cinema Place </h2><p>  There is another attraction that the Tarkhankut Peninsula is famous for.  Olenevka is a village near which there are such beauties that many filmmakers chose these rocks, caves and bays for their amazing shots. </p><p>  If you go by car along the sea from the village (a dirt road), then after a quarter of an hour you will find yourself at Cape Big Atlesh.  And the panorama is like from some kind of magic.  The cliffs of the rocks here are snow-white.  Their height is already 40-60 meters.  Clean yellow beaches hid behind such small coves.  The sea itself and the sky are deep blue.  Caves with grottoes are both green and white.  The shore whimsly curls in an arc. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But the Turtle - that‚Äôs the name of one rock.  Nearby another.  In it, the wind, along with the waves, pierced the Arch of large sizes.  She is like a symbol of this cape. </p><p>  Metal steps lead to the arch.  The staircase was built recently.  But who cut down another staircase in the same limestone is unknown.  But it was precisely along it that the heroine from the movie Taman went to the boat.  It was shot based on the novel by M. Yu. Lermontov.  And also near the Arch there is an unusual form of the grotto.  He attracted the attention of the creators of two films at once - Amphibian Man (1961) and Pirates of the 20th Century (1979). </p><p>  But beauty is beauty, and in general the rocks of this Tarhankut Peninsula are very insidious for those who are at sea.  The number of ships sinking here is decent.  Almost like in the waters of Kerch or Sevastopol.  Only pirates and smugglers have long been calm in these bays.  The entire coast is paved with caves, grottoes, bizarre boulders.  There they hid. </p><p>  At Cape Small Atlesh there is a giant tunnel (98 m long).  It is also the ‚Äúwork‚Äù of waves.  Its height is from 8.5 meters to 10.7 (at different points).  Here, even the most desperate daredevils are breathtaking.  This is an extraordinary natural structure.  The protagonist of the movie "Pirates of the XX Century" makes his way along this very transition to the island to the pirates. </p>

    <h2>  Bowl of love </h2><p>  We convinced you how unusual and attractive the Tarkhankut Peninsula is?  Rest here will be unforgettable. </p><p>  So, you have come here.  Let me then give you one more piece of advice.  Be sure to swim in the bay with the original name "Bowl of Love."  It is also a purely natural pool.  Nature took care to surround it with boulders.  And the name will immediately become clear if you look closely.  After all, the pond is in the shape of a heart!  True, very big ... </p><p>  To the bottom in the bay - six meters.  With the sea itself, the Chalice is connected by a relatively small underwater tunnel.  The ichthyander in the film was exactly how it went into the house of his father. </p><p>  Well, local people were not slow to come up with a ritual.  Before young people sign the registry office, they must make sure that their family will be durable.  How to do it?  But simple.  Holding hands, at the same time, the girl and the boy need to jump into this huge "cup".  If under water their hands part, then not far from the divorce.  But no - together forever. </p><h2>  Museum at the bottom </h2><p>  Are you an avid fisherman?  Then do not pass by.  On these shores every spring and autumn mullet and mackerel - more than enough.  At Cape Bolshoy Atlesh - a fishing camp.  So welcome.  And do not forget to repeat: "Catch, fish, big and small." </p><p>  But the fish that live in the sea is a natural thing.  But listen to what people have created with their own hands.  This is incredible! </p>

Almost distilled!  You look from above - and the bottom is visible.  Scuba jokers made the ‚ÄúAvenue of Leaders‚Äù there.  Here and Lenin, and Dzerzhinsky, and Kirov.  More precisely, their busts embedded in stones.  Nearby is a sign.  She explains that in August 92, a museum was opened by a certain V. Borumensky.  Sail from the coast about 100 meters - and you will see for yourself.  Moreover, over time, sculptures of Beethoven with Pushkin, Yesenin with Blok, Pyotr Tchaikovsky and others joined political figures. And they stand among stones overgrown with algae, mussels!

    <p>  Filmmakers from Simferopol realized that many of the tape about this wonderful museum would be interesting.  Moreover, there is nothing similar anywhere in the world. </p><h2>  Scientific discoveries </h2><p>  Not only lazy people come here to the Tarkhankut Peninsula (Crimea), but they also work.  It will be interesting to such professionals as a biologist or archaeologist, hydrologist and paleontologist.  Once, scientists saw an imprint of fish on one limestone.  She obviously swam here a very long time.  And it was not small - more than a meter long. </p><p>  Another sensation was when they found a colony of limestone deposits.  Directly open a museum of paleontology in the depths of the sea. </p><h2>  Jangul </h2><p>  So briefly, the locals call the rocky limestone reserve.  In fact, it is a landslide coast.  Also a miracle of miracles!  It spreads over an area of ‚Äã‚Äã10 hectares.  It looks like this: steps run along the coast for 5 km, and pyramids and pillars rise above them. </p>

And the plateau itself has become attractive to many tourists.  And is it really possible not to love this sea, unusually transparent?  Bizarre beaches?  Beautiful steppe?  We add that in small gorges marvelous flowers grow, the grass turns green juicy.

    <h2>  Ghost valley </h2><p>  It happened a long time ago.  In 1933, in the summer, local villagers heard an incomprehensible roar.  What happened?  Later it turned out that about one beam (Ternovskaya), huge limestone (length - 500 m, width - 200 and 35 - height) simply crawled to the sea. </p><p>  And again, one can note the creative work of nature.  As a result of a landslide on the shore, the "Valley of Ghosts" was formed.  But how else can you call these marvelous figures from rock fragments?  Some see towers and pyramids.  In others - statues of giant animals. </p>
