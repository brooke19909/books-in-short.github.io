    <h2>  History of the estate </h2><p>  The house with a piece of land belonged to the family of the mother of the gardener Alexander Grivko and was used as a summer residence.  Mother wanted to retire, move from Moscow to the estate and build a new house.  So says Alexander himself.  But in 1999, his mother died, never realizing her dream.  Sons, Alexander Grivko and his brother Ivan, completed the building and began to break up the garden. </p><p>  Alexander himself was fond of plants from childhood and from the age of 20 began to engage in floriculture on a professional level.  Glory to the landscape designer came unexpectedly.  Famous customers appeared, the TV 6 channel, banks, designer Yudashkin and others. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Today, the Orekhovno estate of the Pustoshkinsky district is home to the family of his brother Alexander and a ‚Äútraining ground‚Äù for the bold ideas of the designer. </p><p>  The territory of the estate since the 90s has grown significantly due to neighboring plots.  The swamp is drained and turned into a pond.  There is a huge plant nursery that Alexander, Ivan and his family are engaged in. </p><p>  The Orekhovno estate of the Pustoshkinsky district is officially included in the tourist route of the region.  This house is on a par with such historical places as, for example, the Pskov-Pechersky Monastery and Pushkinogorye.  By the way, trips to gardens are very popular in England, where the hand of a landscape designer worked.  The British come to such places to enjoy the beauties and enjoy a cup of tea or coffee.  In our country, this movement is only gaining momentum, people unite in communities, exchange experiences, seedlings and go to visit each other. </p><h2>  general description </h2><p>  The prototype of the estate in Orekhovno Pustoshkinsky district of the <span>Pskov region</span> is a classic Italian garden.  The centerpiece of the site is the house.  Outwardly, it is very similar to a small castle in the Anglo-Norman style.  There are many terraces around the building.  Each of them differs in functional purpose and style of design. </p><p>  The windows of the house and terraces offer a gorgeous view of the entire plot.  All terraces are connected by stairs.  On the estate there is a large garden, greenhouse and fruit trees.  Ivan, brother of Alexander, his wife and son, several garden workers live in the estate.  The whole territory is well-groomed, nowhere is there a single weed or garbage. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The total land area is 5 hectares.  Almost all the plants in the estate are ideally adapted to the local climate, they are selected in such a way that the beauty is all year round. </p>

    <h2>  Lawn at home </h2><p>  Around the house there <span>is a</span> regular <span>garden layout</span> , with a ground floor and a round lawn surrounded by unusual conifers.  There is also a fountain and a water cascade.  <span>The regular style was</span> created with the help of western thuja of different varieties. </p><h2>  Water </h2><p>  The pond in the estate of Orekhovno Pustoshkinsky district has an unusual shape.  There are channels and backwaters, small islands.  On one of them there is a wrought-iron arbor where you can dream or have a tea party.  A bridge runs across the pond.  On the other side, the feeling is that the castle is somewhere far away.  There are many hills and meadows.  There is even a grotto that looks outwardly very ancient. </p>

    <h2>  Garden </h2><p>  The garden is partly Victorian.  In one part of it, low trees and plants are planted.  Along the paths, roses and hydrangeas are planted.  In the upper garden, a covered gallery of lindens is formed, the tops of which have a cubic shape.  In the center is a sculpture of Amur.  Her Alexander brought from France. </p><h2>  Greenhouse </h2><p>  On the estate is not quite an ordinary greenhouse.  It was brought from France and dates from the 19th century.  The foundation of the greenhouse is stone, which gives it and the entire site an unusual raid of "intelligent" antiquity. </p>
