Sea of ​​Azov welcomes tourists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Currently, a small resort town in the Zaporozhye region (Ukraine) - Primorsk - is especially popular.  The Sea of ​​Azov, the photo of which is in the article, is right there in the palm of your hand.  40 km from Primorsk there is another popular resort city - Berdyansk, and 150 km - the village of Kirillovka.  Here you can find a great place to relax, recover and recover, and all the conditions for this are created by nature itself. </p><p>  The city is located at the beginning of the Inhabitant Spit, which runs along the entire coast of the sea and separates it from the estuary.  This is what distinguishes the city of Primorsk.  The Sea of ​​Azov itself is shallow, which will be convenient for families with children, and the depth grows smoothly, without rifts, compared with the same Kirillovka.  An ideal place to learn how to swim.  Therefore, you should not refuse to buy a ticket in the direction of a beautiful town.  Any tourist will receive an unforgettable pleasure from staying on the Sea of ​​Azov.  Keep this in mind. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Primorsk Sea of ​​Azov" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1156015.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nature reserve </h2><p>  Around the reserve - beautiful steppe nature, clean sandy beaches.  The warm Sea of ​​Azov warms up in the summer to +26 - + 28 °, a unique estuary that separates the sea from land, and, of course, the healing sea air.  The oxygen content in the sea air on the Azov coast is 1.5 times higher than on the coast of the southern part of Crimea. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Healing properties </h2><p>  By the way, Upholstery estuary is rich in healing mud.  Procedures using estuary mud have a beneficial effect on the peripheral nervous system, and struggle with problems of the musculoskeletal system. <br>  In general, natural conditions and ultraviolet rays of the sun help to improve health in such a village as Primorsk.  The Sea of ​​Azov will become an unforgettable place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest in Primorsk Sea of ​​Azov" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1156019.jpg" width="556"></div>

    <h2>  Residence </h2><p>  The infrastructure of the resort town and the adjacent "agglomeration" is quite developed, will be able to satisfy the needs of both family and youth recreation, and the presence on the shore of various health resorts is replete with a variety of rooms from economy to luxury. </p><p>  Of course, as in any other city, except for bases, <span>resorts, boarding houses,</span> you can relax in the private sector.  Just keep in mind that Primorsk itself (the Sea of ​​Azov should be seen by everyone) is 2 km from the water area, and if you stay in the private sector, you will need to get to the reservoir on foot or by bus and taxi. </p><p>  Along the coast runs the largest street of the city - Kurortnaya, it is where all the bases, motels, boarding houses, and children's health camps are located.  A well-developed network of health resorts on the coast will provide a choice for everyone: those who like to relax in a noisy company, and those who want a quiet secluded holiday.  They are located on Kurortnaya Street, separated from the sandy beach by an estuary, through which 300 m long bridges are laid. This is a unique feature of this place, but for some it may seem like a problem.  <span>Holidays in</span> Primorsk (the Sea of ​​Azov - we are talking about it) will be better if you choose a complex with a separate access to the sea, not through the estuary. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the city itself there are markets, pharmacies, a bus station, cafes, banks, discos.  There is no airport or railway station here, the nearest transport hub is 30 km from the city - st.  Elizavetovka.  Shuttle taxis often run from the station to the city. </p><p>  Vacation prices in 2016 are affordable.  Without problems, you can find an inexpensive option with a minimum of amenities, as well as more expensive - luxury.  Holidays in the private sector are traditionally cheaper. </p>
