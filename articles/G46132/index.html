True, you must pay for access to the Network.  Therefore, many are interested in how to use the Internet for free. </p><h2>  Access to the global web through a public access point </h2><p>  A data exchange standard such as Wi-Fi allows you to connect to the network without using wires.  But before you use the Internet for free, you must first make sure that your laptop or computer supports this technology. </p><p>  If the device has a Wi-Fi module, then it turns out in restaurants, cafes and other similar institutions where this opportunity is provided, to surf the Internet for free.  Those who live near large shopping malls were especially lucky, because you can try to connect to an open network without leaving your home. </p><p>  Almost every day there are new Wi-Fi points, but, unfortunately, most of them are under a password.  Nevertheless, there are many establishments that distribute the Internet for free using this technology to attract new customers and advertising.  However, public Wi-Fi has its drawbacks: </p><ul><li>  connection speed is poor; </li><li>  low level of data security; </li><li>  access only within the institution. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to use the internet for free" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44769/1509746.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><h2>  How to use the Internet of neighbors for free? </h2><p>  In addition to the above method of connecting to the network, there are others.  Suppose if you don‚Äôt want to go out of your house, then you should try to connect to a neighbor‚Äôs Wi-Fi.  At the same time, it is better not to crack his password, try to negotiate with him.  Otherwise, they can be held accountable for illegal access, and relations with tenants in the stairwell are likely to deteriorate. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="use the internet for free modem" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44769/1509747.jpg" width="600"></div>

In these offices equipment for creating Dial-UP connections is often found.  To arrange remote access, you will need a landline telephone and a modem, when dialing to which the caller can use the Internet for free.  The modem, however, in this case gives too low a speed - no more than 56 Kilobits per second.  In addition, Dial-UP technology is considered obsolete. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to use the internet via modem for free" class="if" height="282" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44769/1509748.jpg" width="580"></div>

    <h2>  Promotions from the provider </h2><p>  Before using the modem for free, first find out about the current promotions of your provider.  There are Internet service providers who do not charge for the first 30-40 seconds of connection, but you need to quickly leave the Network after the end of free access.  To manage to do this, you can install a special program that can break the connection on the penultimate second, after which it restores it again. </p><p>  In addition, some providers provide access to many Wi-Fi points in the city to their subscribers.  You can find out about this in the support service or on the supplier‚Äôs website. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to use the internet for free in a computer" class="if" height="303" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44769/1509751.jpg" width="539"></div>

To receive rewards, you should connect this option in your account on the operator‚Äôs portal or contact the Customer Support Center.  When 150 bonuses accumulate, you can activate 100 MB of free Internet.  Also available for connecting 500 MB, 1, 2 and 20 GB. </p><p>  At Megafon there is also a campaign that allows you to receive a reward for communication.  For every 30 rubles spent, the subscriber receives one bonus.  If desired, each client of this operator can participate in the bonus program, you just need to send a message to number 5010 with the text 5010. You can connect this option in other ways: </p><ul><li>  using the dialed command * 115 # on the mobile device; </li><li>  through the "My Account". </li></ul><p>  Having accumulated 40 bonuses, they can be spent on 100 Mb, and 180 - on 500 Mb. </p><p>  Free traffic is provided by another equally popular Tele2 operator.  To get it, you need to connect to the bonus program by calling the Support Center, or by typing * 116 * 9 #.  The remuneration received is allowed to be spent on the Internet and other services.  To activate the free 1 Mb it will be enough to score 7 points, and for 5 Mb you will have to spend 30 bonuses. </p><p>  Beeline offers its customers the opportunity to use the Internet for free for a week.  During this trial period, you can verify how it works.  True, such an option is available only to subscribers of a prepaid <span>settlement system.</span>  To do this, you need to activate the "Highway 1 GB" service by calling 777. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to use mobile internet for free" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44769/1509750.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Connection to an alien line at the entrance </h2><p>  A huge number of people are looking for information on how to use the Internet for free.  In high-rise buildings, you can often see that there are wires from different providers in the shields that go to neighboring apartments.  Some people have the thought of connecting to them, but this is not worth it, because most often the operators work using the PPPoE protocol.  Even if you can connect to someone else‚Äôs cable, you won‚Äôt be able to access the Internet without a password and login. </p><p>  So we looked at all the reasonable ways to use the Internet for free.  On your computer, be sure to check for the presence of a Wi-Fi adapter before proceeding with their implementation. </p>
