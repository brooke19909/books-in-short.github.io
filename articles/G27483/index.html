  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Siberia where Tyumen is located</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The city was officially founded in 1586 as a prison.  Now Tyumen is an actively developing center of <span>Western Siberia.</span>  Where the city of Tyumen is located, once upon a time there was the Tyumen Khanate.  "Tyumen" in translation from Turkic means "lowland."  Indeed, the city as part of the Tyumen region is located in the southeast of the West Siberian lowland plain. </p><h2>  Keeping up with the times </h2><p>  But there are other options that interpret the name of the city as “my property” and “city on the way”, “thousand”.  Like it or not, they will all reflect the true meaning of the city. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="57.1612975" data-lng="65.52501719999998" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/2/9/5/1/2951.png"></div><p>  Where Tyumen is located, a caravan road once ran from the Volga region to Central Asia and back - the "Tyumen port".  The rivers Tura and Tyumenka connected the city with the Far North and the Far East.  In those ancient times, these were powerful water currents, which in spring spills covered large areas where the Zarechny microdistricts and the Zareki private sector are located in the city of Tyumen.  After the earthquake, the riverbeds changed, and the full flow left.  The first wooden city was built in the immediate vicinity of the capital of the Khanate of the Golden Horde - the citadel of Chingi-Tura.  This fortress disappeared after the conquest of these territories by Ermak by sovereign decree. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Over the past centuries, wherever Tyumen is located, the roads and interests of not only domestic entrepreneurs and pundits converge.  Tyumen is a key hub of the Trans-Siberian railway.  There is a river port, two airports - Plekhanovo and Roshchino. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tztour.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lovers Bridge over Tura" class="if uuid-2451219" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2451219.jpg"></div><p>  The composition of the modern city consists of 214 entities, which for the most part are garden non-profit partnerships. </p><h2>  Science, art, entrepreneurship </h2><p>  By the beginning of the XVIII century, Tyumen was famous for its artisans in the leather industry, blacksmiths, soap makers, cabinetmakers, bells.  The goods were not only popular in the domestic market of the country, but also were sent abroad. </p><p>  Modern Tyumen is famous for its oil and gas industry, both mining and refining.  Prominent representatives are Gazprom, Lukoil, Tyumenneftegaz, TNK-BP, Antipinsky Oil Refinery. </p><p>  The main enterprises are also aimed at providing the necessary components of a leading industry.  But there are other specialized enterprises, such as OZ Electron, the Tyumen Battery Plant, the Tyumen Aircraft Engines plant, and the engineering plant.  Woodworking industries, a plastic plant, a poultry factory, a distillery, a Tyumen plant for the production of medical instruments and equipment are actively developing. </p><div id="sjcont"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  They give light and heat to TPP-1 and TPP-2. </p><p>  Thanks to the natural gas and oil deposits where Tyumen is located, more than 50 research institutes and design institutes were created, including a branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bloggerru.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tyumen &quot;Bolshoi&quot; Theater" class="if uuid-2451229" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2451229.jpg"></div><p>  This <span>Siberian city</span> has its own "Big" theater.  Rebuilt by a generous philanthropist from his own home, the theater became the first haven of a professional troupe in the city.  The building was regularly updated, restored.  Once, it was here that Peter Vilyaminov and Evgeny Matveev first came onto the stage. </p><p>  The presence of a large and well-developed hotel service, rich cultural life, banking services, excellent telecommunications promotes the establishment of interstate relations and the stable development of the region. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  This area is for strong-willed people.  Where Tyumen is located, winter lasts up to 10 months of the year, since 90% is the region of the Far North. </p><p>  The temperature in summer in reality ranges from +18 ° Ϲ to +38 ° Ϲ.  In the cold season, on average -24, that is, from -14 ° Ϲ to - 46 ° Ϲ.  In conjunction with continuous cold arctic winds and hot winds from Kazakhstan, a sharply continental climate is obtained. </p><div class="photo" data-original="newsprom.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Winter city" class="if uuid-2451237" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2451237.jpg"></div><p>  But despite all this, it was not in vain that the first settlers in the VIII century chose this place.  Endless taiga forests, flooded with a variety of animals, full-flowing and catch-rich rivers attracted nomads. </p><h2>  Entertaining uniqueness </h2><p>  In the same place where the center of modern Tyumen is located, the first fortress was once located 430 years ago.  This is reminded of the "Tyumen erection stone" and the remains of the historical foundation. </p><p>  Now Tsvetnoy Boulevard stretches here - the pedestrian zone of the city, there are five squares, museums, a city circus, squares, a department store, places of recreation and entertainment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.factroom.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Square Siberian cats" class="if uuid-2451226" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2451226.jpg"></div><p>  Here is the <span>Square of Siberian cats.</span>  This is a memory of those 238 representatives of the cat family that were sent by special cargo in a warm carriage to the liberated Leningrad.  It was these cats that saved Hermitage masterpieces from hordes of rats. </p><p>  Another fact from those times.  Few people know that during the Second World War it was in Tyumen that the mummified body of V.I. Lenin was stored in the building of the Agricultural Academy. </p><p>  Tyumen is a city with a wide soul.  There will be enough warmth for both guests and those who want to connect their lives with it. </p>
