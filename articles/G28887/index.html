So, in the hotel restaurant three times a day a buffet is served <span>.</span>  It presents both national Turkish dishes and international cuisine.

In addition, during the day, tourists can "kill a worm" in the hotel with delicious snacks. </p><h2>  Sea and beach </h2><p>  Despite the fact that La Vella Hotel 3 * is a small hotel, it has its own beach.  It is located 300 meters from the hotel.  On the way to it you need to cross the road.  An underground passage has been built for pedestrian safety.  On the beach you can comfortably sit on the sun loungers.  For an additional fee there is the possibility of using equipment for entertainment and water sports. </p>

    <h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  As for entertainment, since La Vella Hotel 3 * is small, it does not provide a special entertainment program for its guests.  Therefore, if you want a team of animators to amuse you from morning until late at night, then it makes sense to find another hotel to stay.  At La Vella, you can have a good time swimming in the pool and sunbathing on the sun terrace, equipped with comfortable sun loungers and parasols.  You can also play ping pong and billiards at the hotel.  On the beach you can use equipment for sports and fun on the water for a fee. </p><p>  The bulk of entertainment is concentrated outside the hotel.  So, at the reception you can book a tour you are interested in or rent a car and go to any corner of both Alanya and the whole of Turkey on your own.  You can also rent a bike at the hotel and take a ride in the surroundings.  Since the hotel is only a couple of kilometers from the center of Alanya, the entire entertainment infrastructure of the capital of the tourist region is within walking distance.  Therefore, you can always visit local shops, restaurants, bars, clubs and other institutions. </p>

    <h2>  La Vella Hotel 3 *: reviews of tourists from Russia </h2><p>  In order for travelers to have a more complete impression of this hotel, we suggest that you familiarize yourself with the comments of our compatriots who have already stayed here during their vacation in Alanya. </p><p>  First of all, tourists note the excellent location of the hotel.  So, the distance to the sea is only about three hundred meters.  Therefore, in just a few minutes you can walk to the beach.  Despite the fact that you need to cross the road along the way, there will be no problems with this, since there is an underground passage.  In addition, the plus is the fact that La Vella Hotel is not in the very center of Alanya.  Therefore, the night here is quite quiet.  If you crave noisy entertainment, then many restaurants, bars, clubs and discos are within walking distance. </p><p>  As for the hotel rooms, in general, tourists found them acceptable.  So, the rooms here are small, but clean and comfortable.  They are equipped with only the most necessary.  True, some guests were confused by the very compact showers, but many three- and two-star hotels both in Turkey and in other countries ‚Äúsin‚Äù this.  Room cleaning was carried out quite regularly - once every three to four days. </p><p>  Different opinions are expressed about the <span>food at</span> La Vella.  So, someone found the food here acceptable, while someone was not satisfied.  However, experienced tourists recall that it is pointless to expect to see a sumptuous buffet with a mass of dishes from an economy-class hotel.  Therefore, dissatisfaction was expressed mainly by travelers who had previously vacationed in more expensive hotels, but this time decided to save money, but at the same time counting on the same level of service and food. </p><p>  As for the staff, in general, there are no complaints.  The only minus some tourists considered the fact that most of the employees not only do not speak Russian, but also very poorly understand English.  However, if necessary, you could always contact the hotel employee who speaks English. </p><p>  Since the hotel is small, special entertainment is not provided here.  So, the animation is missing.  In the evenings, music is played in the bar.  The hotel employees are taken to a disco and taken away from there. </p><p>  As for the pool, tourists found it clean and comfortable.  However, guests pay attention that due to the proximity of other buildings, not so much sun falls here, so it‚Äôs impossible to sit comfortably on the terrace for the whole day. </p><p>  In general, we can say that the La Vella Hotel 3 * hotel is well suited for those people who do not plan to spend most of the time on the hotel territory and want to save on the cost of living. </p>
