On it, as a rule, is written only the name of the company and the model itself.  In addition to the device, the back cover and the battery, the buyer is provided with charging with a USB output, a cord for connecting to a computer (microUSB).  There is a <span>warranty card,</span> instructions for use.  Headphones are not included. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The phone supports two SIM cards.  During the conversation, the interlocutor is clearly audible, the speakers work well, the sound range is individually regulated.  In addition, the smartphone supports a flash card (but no more than 32 GB). </p><p>  The back cover is matte, pleasant to the touch.  The Huawei Y5C device (the review will cover all the technical aspects) will not be able to slip out, since the panel is very convenient in your hand.  There are practically no fingerprints on it.  The company logo is shown on the back of the case, and there is also a camera (8 megapixels), a dual LED flash.  The speaker for conversations is located below on the case, and for playing sounds - behind. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="huawei y5c review" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1039987.jpg" width="489"></div>

    <p>  The Huawei Y5C Black smartphone is no different from its white counterpart.  Their sizes: width - 67 mm, height - 134 mm and thickness - 10 mm.  The phone is relatively heavy, its mass is about 147 g. However, this can not be considered a drawback. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the right side of the smartphone, you can see the ‚Äúrocker‚Äù volume, the unlock and power button.  At the top is a charging connector, a USB cable and headphones.  The front side of the smartphone has a front camera, as well as touch buttons for convenient use of the phone. </p><p>  The screen is equipped with a protective glass, which allows you to wear the device without a special coating (film).  However, the phone is budgetary, so you need to understand that it protects only from minor scratches.  The display is bright, clear, it is possible to change the contrast. </p><h2>  Interior design </h2><p>  The Huawei Y5C phone, the review of which will, of course, affect the internal design, runs on Android 4.4.  The shell is installed by Huawei;  there is no Menu button, which is already an ordinary thing for most smartphones.  Applications are sorted by type;  All shortcuts are displayed on the desktop. </p><p>  The numbers during dialing are very large, and therefore easy to read, the keyboard itself is comfortable, the buttons are designed for dimensional fingers, there will be no problems with entering numbers.  What can not be said about the virtual keyboard for typing messages.  The letters are somewhat narrower, but you can get used to this after a while.  The font is too small. </p><p>  Further.  1 GB of RAM, 8 GB of internal and 5 GB of free memory provides the user with a smartphone Huawei Y5C.  A review of the device makes it clear that such characteristics positively affect the operation of the phone.  There is support for Wi-Fi, as well as light and proximity sensors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="huawei ascend y5c" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1039992.jpg" width="377"></div>

There are some basses.  It should be borne in mind that even the best quality videos will have to be watched not in the best possible way, since the color spectrum is scarce and primitive.  In addition, the picture is pixilated, so the file becomes ugly and with extra noise.  For fans of watching movies, this phone is clearly not the best option. </p><p>  On the Internet, the system of the device quickly loads both pictures and videos.  When viewing the first one, you can see that the display shows itself quite well.  The image is clear, bright and intense. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone huawei y5c black" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1039997.jpg" width="535"></div>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The Huawei Y5C camera (the review already covered this topic) has autofocus.  The pictures are really very high quality.  Also in the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù you can find various functions such as glare, highlights, as well as changes in brightness, contrast, white balance, etc. </p><p>  We can say that the main plus of this inexpensive smartphone is the 8-megapixel camera.  It is possible to shoot video in Full HD quality. </p><p>  The front camera is 2 megapixels, which is not the worst option.  It is easily enough for talking on Skype and for ordinary selfies. </p>
