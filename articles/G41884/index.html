This year the ‚ÄúFavorite Domodedovo‚Äù residential complex will be commissioned, located in an ideal place for a happy life.  The first phase of the complex has already been commissioned.  Now there is an acceptance of apartments by interest holders and the issuance of keys, and in the second stage, the final preparations for the state commission are being completed.  We offer information on the advantages of the complex and its shortcomings, as well as on how to buy real estate here. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  By name, it is easy to guess that the residential complex "Beloved Domodedovo" was built in the city of the same name, located 37 km from the center of Moscow and 20 km from the Moscow Ring Road.  The place for construction was chosen wonderful.  To Kashirskoye highway from the complex is less than 1000 meters, to the airport about 10 km, to the railway station "Domodedovo" a little more than 3 km.  Near the complex is Talalikhina Street, on which you can quickly and easily exit onto the M4 highway.  In addition, for the convenience of residents, Lunnaya Street has been extended.  The complex‚Äôs neighbors are SNT Fir-2 and ZhK Evropeisky, a little further away is Druzhba residential complex. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Favorite Domodedovo" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1662790.jpg" width="504"></div>

The stop is three to five minutes on foot from the housing of the residential complex, but you will have to travel about half an hour by minibus to the nearest metro station. </p><h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  LCD "Beloved Domodedovo" was built in the Western district of the city, considered the most prosperous in terms of ecology.  There are no industrial facilities here, there are no major highways in the immediate vicinity of the complex either, which is a big plus.  Literally 50 meters from buildings 4 and 5, and from the rest about 150 meters begins the Ushmar forest, where you can take wonderful walks in winter and summer.  At 2 km from the complex there is another wonderful natural site - the river Rozhayka.  It is small, but fish is caught very well here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Favorite Domodedovo photo" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1662771.jpg" width="502"></div>
