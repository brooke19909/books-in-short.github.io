It is considered a very cozy Turkish area due to the fact that it is located next to the mighty Taurus Mountains, and pine forests grow around it.  In any place you can enjoy the splendor of the surrounding nature and breathe in the fresh sea air. </p><p>  The entrance to the sea is pebbled on almost the entire coastline, but some hotels fill their beaches with sand or equip the descent into the sea with special stairs and pontoons. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  In the village of Beldibi, 15 km from the center of Kemer and 23 km from the city of Antalya, in 1995 a hotel was built, which was originally called Poseidon, and later was renamed to Belpoint Beach Hotel 3 *.  In 2012, repairs and restoration were carried out in it, furniture and appliances were replaced.  Over the years, the hotel has gained its loyal customers and a good reputation due to the optimal ratio of price and quality. </p>

    <p>  The rooms are small, comfortable, but the furniture and plumbing are the simplest.  Towels are changed regularly, but the cleaning of the hotel leaves much to be desired. </p><p>  Location, number of services, prices and other factors affect travelers when they choose a hotel.  Kemer, a 3-star hotel similar to Belpoint Beach, attracts tourists who are vacationing in Turkey for the first time, or those who prefer economy options. </p><h2>  Holiday Prices </h2><p>  The price of hotel accommodation depends on the season, demand and occupancy of the hotel.  At the very beginning of the season, when there are still a few people, the cost is set to the lowest.  But on the May holidays, when many tourists from Russia rush to go to Turkey to bask in the sun, prices are rising.  So, the cost of a standard double room at the beginning of the season can be about 24,230 rubles.  But in May days it increases to 29 120 rubles.  While in August or July a ticket may cost 36,400 rubles, but on a last-minute tour at the hotel you can relax together for 24,750 rubles. </p><p>  People who have visited the Belpoint Beach Hotel are advised to bring rubber slippers for entry into the sea or buy on-site.  You should not count on a strong and stable Wi-Fi signal, it is better to solve all working issues before or after a vacation.  In general, you should not expect anything supernatural from this hotel.  This is a good but simple hotel for a budget holiday. </p>
