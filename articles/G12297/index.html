    <h2>  System requirements </h2><p>  <span>To get started, it's worth figuring out what devices Android Pay runs on.</span>  <span>The requirements that Google makes are not too high.</span>  <span>An NFC chip (for making payments) and Android version 4.4 (for installing the Android Pay application) must be installed on your phone.</span>  <span>It seems to be simple, but in fact there are a number of restrictions that may interfere with the inclusion of Android Pay:</span> </p><ul><li>  <span>Firstly, the service works only on those gadgets that operate under the official firmware (developer versions and less popular assemblies are not supported).</span> </li><li>  <span>Secondly, there is a list of smartphones on which it is impossible to enable Android Pay.</span>  <span>These are <span>Nexus 7,</span> Elephone P9000, Samsung <span>Galaxy Note 3, Galaxy</span> Light and S3.</span> </li></ul><p>  <span>As for the terminals, then everything is quite simple.</span>  <span>For payment, any terminal that supports PayPass or PayWave technology is suitable.</span>  <span>Such terminals are installed in almost any, not even the most prestigious store or point of sale.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  What banks and cards does it work with? </h2><p>  <span>Just like in the case of other payment systems, Android Pay started only with a part of banks operating in Russia.</span>  <span>Fortunately, among them are all the most popular institutions in great demand: Raiffeisen Bank, Russian Standard, Rocketbank, Otkritie, Sberbank, Tinkoff, a number of other less well-known organizations and a payment service from Yandex "</span>  <span>With shops, the situation is no worse.</span>  <span>Almost all popular retail chains showed interest in the new technology and pledged to support its work.</span>  <span>This is quite natural, since these same networks already work with Apple and Samsung.</span> </p><h2>  How to connect? </h2><p>  <span>What phones Android Pay works with, figured out, now you need to connect this service.</span>  <span>If you have already paid for any of the Google services and linked your bank card to your Google account, then installing the Android Pay application, immediately find them in the list.</span>  <span>If there are no linked cards, you will have to enter all the details yourself.</span>  <span>You can use the built-in credit card scanner, but it is often mistaken with the number (it is not clear why Google could not bring the technology to mind).</span> </p><p>  <span>Before you add a card, do not forget to set a password on your device, otherwise Android Pay will respond with an error and prohibit paying anything.</span>  <span>After adding the card, you will need to confirm it.</span>  <span>You can confirm the card using the SMS code or by calling the technical support service of the bank and verifying that you are connecting your card to the mobile payment system.</span>  <span>You will be charged 30 rubles for confirmation, but will be returned after some time.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Security </h2><p>  <span>Your card data is stored on Google‚Äôs servers and is securely encrypted on them.</span>  <span>Not your real details are used for payment, but specially formed sets of numbers - tokens.</span>  <span>This does not mean that a permanent connection to the servers is required to work.</span>  <span>No, tokens are created on servers, but then uploaded to each individual device and stored there until a payment is made.</span>  <span>Apple and Samsung devices have a separate physical space for storing tokens, which significantly increases the level of security.</span>  <span>Plus, Android Pay, one way or another, will ask for access to the Internet when tokens run out in the device, which is a significant drawback.</span> </p><p>  <span>To make each purchase, you will have to enter a password, a key code or put your finger on the fingerprint scanner (it all depends on what protection method is used on your phone).</span>  <span>If you disable any of the blocking methods, then all data regarding your bank cards will be destroyed.</span>  <span>If the gadget has been lost or stolen, then you can remotely erase information about attached cards.</span>  <span>In general, do not worry about security.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Possible problems </h2><p>  <span>The most popular question that has surfaced on the Web since the launch of the payment system is ‚Äúwhy Android Pay does not work on Xiaomi.‚Äù</span>  <span>The problem really exists, and all owners of Chinese gadgets have encountered it.</span>  <span>Yes, Android Pay does not work on Meizu either.</span>  <span>The reason is the international firmware that users put in order to translate the interface language into Russian.</span> </p><p>  <span>Another problem that users face is the return of goods.</span>  <span>The fact is that the token that hides your details will be saved for only one terminal, and in order to make a return, you will have to look for exactly that terminal.</span> </p><h2>  Promotions and discounts </h2><p>  <span>The launch of each payment system is accompanied by discounts and promotions, which are designed to popularize services among the masses and make people try it at least once.</span>  <span>Of the stocks known today, it is worth allocating a 50% discount on travel in the Moscow metro.</span>  <span>50% discount on paying for an Aeroexpress ticket and the same discount on buying any burger on the Burger King fast food chain.</span>  <span>It all works as follows - you pay the full price for a ticket or any other product, and for some time half the amount is returned to your card.</span>  <span>This means that in the absence of the necessary amount, it will not work to use the promotion.</span> </p>
