It is difficult to imagine modern life with the student version of the package outside the window in the winter or a home-made hinged box in the same place.  Today, manufacturers of refrigerators divorced with interest.  It is very difficult to give preference to someone in all this variety of brands.  Today we‚Äôll talk about AEG refrigerators and learn all about them. </p><h2>  history of the company </h2><p>  AEG is a German company that since its founding has specialized exclusively in the electric power industry, household goods and mechanical engineering.  The original company does not exist at present, but the AEG brand is actively used to promote goods by the Swedish company Electrolux, which also specializes in mechanical engineering.  The company is now not German, but Swedish.  In fact, it launches AEG Electrolux refrigerators, not just AEG.  But not so simple. </p><div class="photo" data-original="markselectrical.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="aeg refrigerator with bottom freezer" class="if uuid-2441772" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3296/2441772.jpg"></div><p>  In the market we see AEG refrigerators and <span>Electrolux refrigerators,</span> but we will not get into the jungle of marketing and bureaucracy.  For the buyer, there is no big difference in the subtleties of the brand, because both Germany and Sweden are the countries that do real things with unsurpassed quality.  It is worth noting that the AEG division still survived in Germany.  Although the company is now owned by a company from Sweden, there are still on sale refrigerators of this brand made in Germany. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Company Refrigerators </h2><p>  The entire range of the company is high-quality modern solutions for well-off people who value style and quality.  AEG refrigerator is a purchase for decades, not years, as is the case with cheap counterparts.  It is worth recognizing that the company does not inflate prices too much, there are offers on the market and much more expensive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.appliancecity.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fridge aeg" class="if uuid-2441767" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3296/2441767.jpg"></div><h2>  Features </h2><p>  A distinctive feature of AEG refrigerators is their resistance to voltage fluctuations.  It is worth saying that in our country, power surges will soon be considered the norm, because we are already used to it.  It is sad, but it is.  So, the refrigerators of this brand cope with this moment easily.  But still, like everything physical in this world, the refrigerator protection system must have some kind of resource.  I don‚Äôt want you to exhaust it by your own example.  It will not be superfluous to turn on the refrigerator in the network through a ‚Äúfilter‚Äù or through a voltage regulator. </p><p>  AEG refrigerators are well thought out and have flexible settings, it is convenient and practical.  I must say that this is a technique for people.  There is nothing fashionable, superfluous, far-fetched in it, but there is everything that is needed.  Add to all this the perfect workmanship and reliability.  Perhaps the best representative in their product category is ready! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.newlifeappliances.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="aeg refrigerator without freezer" class="if uuid-2441773" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3296/2441773.jpg"></div><p>  You can consider the strengths of refrigerators with specific examples.  We present to your attention the most purchased models. </p><h2>  AEG S refrigerator </h2><p>  Big, beautiful, <span>handsome.</span>  <span>This is</span> if in three words, but it is possible in more detail.  Indeed, this refrigerator attracts its appearance from the first glance.  With the design of the model, everything is in order.  But this is not the main thing in the refrigerator. </p><p>  The height of the model is 203 centimeters with the standard two other components of physical dimensions (60 centimeters by 66 centimeters).  The 78 liter freezer is divided into 3 drawers.  This is not the largest indicator for such large refrigerators.  It is worth noting the smooth running of the boxes, not every manufacturer offers this, sometimes you need to make a lot of physical effort to move the freezer drawer full.  In this freezer, drawers move along the runners. </p><p>  The freezer with NoFrost technology allows you not to defrost it and prevents the growth of the "fur coat".  In general, the technology is called Twin Tech NoFrost and involves two separate refrigerant circuits, which allows you to maintain optimal conditions in the refrigerator compartment and in the freezer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The model has a special box in the refrigerator compartment for special storage of meat and fish, it quickly cools the contents to 0.5 degrees.  The technology is called Quick Chill.  The Multi Air function provides clear and even air circulation in the space of the refrigerator. </p><div class="photo" data-original="newsroom.electrolux.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://newsroom.electrolux.com/uk/2011/07/26/aegs-latest-a-fridge-freezers-perform-to-perfection-and-save-up-to-40-more-on-energy-bills-than-a-standard-a-rated-model/"><img itemprop="image" alt="fridge aeg s" class="if uuid-2441776" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3296/2441776.jpg"></div><p>  The model is thought out, made as competently as possible.  There are standard shelves on the door.  It is noteworthy that the lower of them is not at the very bottom of the door, but slightly higher.  This allows you to make boxes for vegetables more spacious.  A convenient shelf for storing glass bottles is provided.  This is a very convenient thing, and it is very strange that many manufacturers stubbornly ignore this point in their devices. </p><p>  In this model, a replaceable carbon filter is installed to absorb odors.  It is worth saying that he copes with the task perfectly, absorbing all the smells, even the harshest and strongest.  In general, the model is easy to use, the instruction of AEG refrigerators is almost never required.  Everything is thought out, simple and intuitive. </p><p>  The fridge handles are comfortable, the touch control panel.  The surface is not easily soiled.  AEG S is very quiet at work.  Of some weaknesses, it is necessary to mention that the box for storing eggs here is designed for only 6 pcs., Of course, there is a place to put an additional box, but why should not the producer do it himself?  Especially in the refrigerator, which is far from a budget class. </p><h2>  Refrigerator AEG Santo </h2><p>  Very reliable devices that can last for decades.  Also beautiful, also quiet and also expensive.  Approximately from the same price category as the model that we reviewed above.  Two-chamber model.  Quick Chill, Multi Air systems in stock.  The refrigerator is large - 200 cm in height.  The model is two-compressor.  Manual defrosting of the <span>freezer</span> .  By the way, lovers of manual defrosting are not so few today.  The thing is that in such a freezer, products are stored for longer and do not dry out, and in freezers with the NoFrost function, this happens. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fermelumic.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.fermelumic.com/Aeg-Khlschrank-Santo.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="fridge aeg santo" class="if uuid-2441775" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3296/2441775.jpg"></div><p>  The model is equipped with various sensors, they show operating parameters, and will also warn you if there is any malfunction in the refrigerator.  This is more convenient than finding out that the freezer does not freeze by the specific smell of rotten foods there, which have been warm for several days.  This model is good, and if you have the financial ability, then it is definitely worth considering when buying.  AEG Santo is available in several colors. </p><h2>  Built-in refrigerators </h2><p>  In our country, such refrigerators are only gaining popularity.  But in Europe and the USA they can be found almost more often than classic models.  <span>The built-in</span> AEG <span>refrigerator</span> , in fact, differs only in its built-in function, all other parameters are similar to other units of the manufacturer.  Prices for built-in appliances are traditionally biting, regardless of even the manufacturer.  The injustice of a beautiful life!  A model in this category from this manufacturer costs well over fifty thousand rubles. </p><p>  With such models you can make your kitchen more stylish and harmonious.  If your financial situation allows you to waste money such as AEG built-in refrigerators, then it is entirely possible to dwell on them.  This will make your home more stylish and emphasize your personality. </p><p>  AEG SCR41811LS is a popular embedded model.  The freezer is located below.  Standard compressor.  Thoughtful interior space.  The LowFrost function significantly reduces the formation of a ‚Äúfur coat‚Äù in the freezer.  This is an alternative to the NoFrost function, but without drying the food.  Defrosting is required twice less than in a standard freezer.  The refrigerator is equipped with LED lighting - this is a bright light and a minimum of electricity consumption.  This model is optimally suited for the average family.  The volume of the refrigerator is sufficient, and the model itself is not too bulky. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  I must say that reviews of AEG refrigerators confirm that this household appliance is at the highest level.  According to reviews, many refrigerators of this brand have been working for two decades in a row, and I already want to change them, because they are outdated morally (style, functions), but it is a pity to throw away the unit that works, no matter what! </p><div class="photo" data-original="longeatonappliances.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="aeg refrigerator for a large family" class="if uuid-2441771" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3296/2441771.jpg"></div><p>  There are also minor comments, like the ones we voiced above.  A pro box for storing just six eggs.  And there are also very interesting reviews.  For example, about the charcoal filter of refrigerators, which is able to overcome even the smell of smoked fish and create a completely neutral atmosphere in the workspace. </p><h2>  Competition </h2><p>  This brand is one step above the budget.  These are models from the middle price category and expensive refrigerators.  But they are worth the money spent on them.  The company has enough competitors, but it <span>holds the blow</span> with dignity and continues to show excellent sales ratings from year to year, no matter what.  Sophisticated technology for many years - German quality, coupled with Scandinavian brevity.  This is a win-win option for everyone and for all time.  The lineup is wide, and everyone can find their model among the manufacturer's assortment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.uk-appliances.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="aeg refrigerator inside" class="if uuid-2441770" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3296/2441770.jpg"></div><h2>  Total </h2><p>  The company does really good things.  You will never see AEG refrigerators in TV commercials, as well as, for example, Porsche cars that are very good, and they have their own audience, which takes them even without intrusive, stupid ads.  Exactly the same situation with AEG.  There are people who know the brand and respect, there are many such people, and therefore advertising is not needed. </p><p>  If you have the means to buy such a refrigerator, and you love everything of high quality and despise consumer goods, then you should buy AEG.  But just know that you can get bored with him, because, despite decades, he will work, work and work. </p>
