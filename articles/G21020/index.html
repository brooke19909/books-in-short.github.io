Aztec Empire</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In 1168, the Aztec ruler led his people from the island of Astlan in search of a new homeland.  According to legend, the Indians wandered for about 200 years, and did not choose a place where they could settle.  But nevertheless, they settled on two small islands in Lake Texcoco.  Here they replenished strength and reserves, after which they went to the more fertile lands of the Valley of Mexico City. </p><p>  Having established a second homeland, the Aztecs began their new history.  They were a prosperous nation that constantly and systematically developed.  But the end of their story came quickly and unexpectedly. </p><h2>  Historical and political background </h2><p>  The Aztec empire practically did not develop until 1440.  She literally wallowed in battles and battles with local tribes.  But in 1440, Montezuma I came to power, who carried out a number of reforms, both political and economic.  With its help, the empire becomes famous throughout the Mexican valley.  The power of her army is truly awesome.  And so much so that some tribes themselves come to become part of the Aztecs, surrender without battle. </p>

    <p>  The state grew, new lands were added.  During this period, the Aztec ruler clearly understands that a number of administrative and political reforms are needed.  The rites of sacrifice are gaining momentum.  Of course, even during this period, bloody wars do not stop, but they are diluted with diplomatic relations.  For example, leaders invited neighboring rulers to watch battles between prisoners.  Usually they ended with the death of both, but the sight was really terrifying and interesting. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Montezuma the Elder </h2><p>  The ruler of the Aztecs Montezuma I the Elder came to power in 1440. His reign sets a new round in the development of the empire.  There are several points that became main during his power. </p><p>  Firstly, sacrifices made in the form of fights between prisoners become popular.  The battle ended in the death of one of them, while the second was killed by people specially designed for this.  However, the Aztec, who captured the most powerful enemy, was given different gifts. </p>

    <p>  Secondly, almost all sacrifices take on a political context.  Nearby leaders are invited to enjoy the bloody spectacle.  This is also done in order to instill fear in the neighbors. </p><p>  And thirdly, mass executions are gaining popularity.  But they are, rather, psychological intimidation for the Aztec people, so that people see what punishments await them if they decide to disobey the high priest or ruler (later these ranks will merge together). </p><h2>  Montezuma the Younger and its features </h2><p>  In 1502, Montezuma II the Younger became the ruler of the Aztecs.  The years of his reign were not remembered by the special replenishment of territories.  Conquest missions, of course, were accomplished, but they actually did not bear fruit.  For almost the entire period of Montezuma‚Äôs reign, the Younger was forced to maintain authority on the already existing lands: uprisings were suppressed, rebels were eliminated. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Like its predecessors, this leader was not able to conquer the Tarascans and Tlashkalans.  The latter completely surrendered under the full responsibility of the Spanish conquistadors, providing them with everything they needed.  Moreover, this was done only in order to annoy the hated Aztecs. </p><p>  The memory of Montezum II remained as the greatest diplomat of his time.  The political system of military expansion continued, but the regime was somewhat relaxed.  Bloody rituals and sacrifices faded into the background, and attempts to attract the states of all the peoples of the empire to the economic situation came forward.  There were no conquests, but mutually beneficial alliances were concluded. </p><h2>  The reign of Montezuma II </h2><p>  During the reign of Montezuma II, there were several noteworthy historical events.  These include not only those bloody wars waged by the new Aztec ruler, but also others that do not affect the battle of the incident. </p><p>  For example, in 1509, a tribe watches a comet.  This was a terrible sight for the Aztecs, because they could not explain the reason for the appearance of a luminous object in the sky.  The priests also could not decipher the message, although everyone was sure that these were the words of the Gods. </p>

    <p>  In the period 1512-1514.  several natural disasters occur in the empire, which begin with severe earthquakes and end with global drought.  Many people are dying and the harvest, the time of famine.  For several years, the war is suspended, as there is no strength and desire to gather soldiers for new military campaigns. </p><p>  In 1515, a rumor was circulated for the first time that white bearded people appeared on the mainland.  Priests interpret this as a human manifestation of the Gods.  Therefore, Montezuma does not plan to defend himself against the invaders, he is going to meet them with open arms. </p><h2>  The death of Montezuma II </h2><p>  When the Indians first heard about the aliens from other continents, the Aztec ruler sent his messengers to them.  Upon their return, they had to talk about the culture of new people, and also sketch them.  After reviewing the information received, it was decided that Hernan Cortes is a hero and God.  Therefore, Montezuma the Younger instructs that the Indians meet the Spaniards in a cordial and friendly manner. </p><p>  The first few days, friendship between two different nations persists.  But, as it turned out, the mission of the Spaniards did not have clear goals.  The Europeans seemed to the Indians greedy for gold, as they plundered all the treasures, took away gold items, plundered shrines and tombs.  The Aztec patience came to an end, they changed mercy to anger. </p>

    <p>  When Montezuma entered the square to pacify the crowd, he was stoned.  There are two versions of his death.  According to the first, he died from injuries sustained from his fellow tribesmen;  according to the second - the Spaniards killed him, to whom he decided to fight back. </p><h2>  Montezuma Treasures </h2><p>  The Spaniards found several places where the Aztec treasures were hiding.  Initially, when they were still on friendly terms with the Indians, they discovered fresh brickwork in the walls of a government castle.  Naturally, they decided to see what was hidden behind her.  There were a lot of jewelry, gold.  Assuming that the Indians might hide other treasures, the Spaniards did not show that they knew anything. </p><p>  But Montezuma turned out to be smarter.  He saw that the masonry was moving.  Therefore, the ruler offered the Spaniards the treasures they found as a gift.  He asked them to take all the gold to the Spanish authorities, thinking that they would leave the empire.  But the enemies remained, wanting to find more gold. </p>

    <p>  The Aztec treasures were almost completely looted.  However, it is believed that some treasures remained intact to this day. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  It is believed that the last emperor of the Indians was Montezuma II.  But in reality this is not so.  During the battle with the Spanish conquistadors, a siege was carried out on the capital of the Aztec empire.  Cortez‚Äôs squad constantly received reinforcements.  Within two months, it was possible to achieve complete depletion of the city of Indians, in fact, all of them were destroyed. </p><p>  Before the complete fall of the state on August 13, 1521, the Spaniards captured on the lake shuttle, where there were <span>noble people.</span>  They tried to flee.  Quautemock was here - the last Aztec emperor to marry the youngest daughter of Montezuma.  He was tortured to find out where other treasures were hidden.  But even after several days of grueling bullying, Kuautemok said nothing. </p>
