    <h2>  Grand Park Kemer Hotel 5 *: reviews </h2><p>  A more accurate picture of the current conditions of rest at the hotel can be obtained by reading the objective reviews recently on various travel sites.  For ease of use, reviews are divided into categories: </p><ul><li>  Location and territory of the hotel. </li><li>  The occupancy, condition and comfort of the rooms. </li><li>  Beach and sea. </li><li>  Food at the hotel. </li><li>  Animation. </li><li>  The work of the staff. </li><li>  Paid services. </li></ul><h2>  Location and territory of the hotel </h2><p>  Grand Park Kemer Hotel 5 * is located in a very beautiful natural place, quiet and comfortable place on the outskirts of the village of Beldibi.  At a distance of one minute walk there is a bus stop with which you can easily reach Kemer in half an hour, and to neighboring villages in 5-10 minutes.  According to tourists, the location of the hotel is very convenient and good for relaxing, especially pleased with the fact that the hotel is right on the beach. </p><p>  The territory of Grand Park Kemer Hotel 5 * itself is small, which, according to vacationers, is rather a plus than a minus, because anywhere in the hotel can be reached in 1-3 minutes.  Uncharacteristic for this region is that there is practically no greenery around the perimeter of the courtyard, but guests do not consider this fact something critical. </p><p>  Slides on the territory work according to a certain schedule, this time, according to tourists, is enough. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Room occupancy, condition and comfort </h2><p>  Guests who have just arrived at Grand Park are immediately welcomed with champagne, so filling out documents is more fun. </p><p>  Check-in time according to hotel rules is after 14:00.  For different tourists, it ranged from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., from which we can conclude that the rooms are provided as they become available and available, and this is carefully monitored by the staff. </p><p>  Most tourists notice that all rooms of the <span>Grand Park Kemer Hotel (Turkey) are</span> small, but their modest area, 25-40 square meters, is indicated in the descriptions.  There are those to whom these sizes seemed quite spacious.  At the same time, the rooms are cozy, there is everything necessary for a decent rest, appliances and furniture are in good condition.  There were isolated complaints of guests about the quality of cosmetics for taking a shower - soap and shampoo were not separated, a single jar with a dispenser was provided, the product, according to tourists, smelled badly and caused itching. </p><p>  The view from the balconies of the rooms, most of the guests found excellent.  Pleasant for guests was the singing of cicadas, which was heard in the district in the evenings.  What characterizes the room very well - when closing the balcony, not a single street sound is heard inside. </p><p>  There are different reviews about cleaning, there is no regularity of its quality from the tip, so we can conclude that cleanliness depended on the professional qualities of the cleaners in different shifts.  Mostly guests are satisfied with the cleanliness and frequency of linen and towels. </p><p>  In cases of breakdown of furniture or equipment in the rooms (refrigerator, air conditioning, safe), the repair took place in a matter of hours and during the absence of guests. </p>

    <h2>  Beach and sea </h2><p>  Most tourists appreciated the location of the hotel actually on the beach.  That is, I did not have to go to him especially. </p><p>  Holidaymakers characterize the beach itself as sandy (pebbles are almost not mentioned in reviews), wide and clean, with a sufficient number of sunbeds and umbrellas.  Although, judging by the reviews, many "thrifty" people still have the habit of taking a place by the sea or pool and not using it. </p><p>  The sea deserves the highest praise from vacationers - all, as one, argue that it was very warm, almost hot, affectionate, clean.  Sunset at sea on the bridge, people's legs practically do not come in contact with pebbles, so special shoes are not needed in fact.  For those who like to jump and dive, there is a low pier where you can also relax on sun loungers, the place there, according to tourists, is especially comfortable.  The adjacent location of the sea and the pool turned out to be a big plus, resting on one sunbed, you can swim there and there. </p><p>  There is a lifeguard team on the beach. </p>

    <h2>  Animation </h2><p>  In the summer of 2017, the animation team consisted of only three people and led in Turkish and English; in the autumn, two Russian-speaking girls were added to the children's club.

Those who wish to dive can practice for free under the guidance of animators, and then dive with an employee of the diving club. </p><p>  Children in the afternoon can spend time in the kids club, where they made crafts from different materials, painted face painting and conducted dance classes. </p><p>  In the evening, for the children, a disco was held, according to tourists, boring and monotonous, and the animator responsible for it did not try at all.  For adults, a foam show was organized, a neon disco or a program with performances by guest artists: Cuban dancers, local artists.  After the evening programs, adults were offered a transfer to a night club in Kemer. </p>

    <h2>  Staff work </h2><p>  The staff of the <span>Grand Park Kemer Hotel 5 * hotel (Turkey, Kemer) is</span> polite, friendly and welcoming.  Most of the staff speak English and Russian.  It has already been mentioned above that each guest is greeted with champagne, they immediately put on bracelets and send them to eat and explore the territory if the room is not yet ready to be populated.  Tourists admit that the staff of this hotel is absolutely unobtrusive, as it sometimes happens, and strictly observe subordination, which is certainly a plus. </p><p>  The girl whose workplace was near the reception deserved special praise.  According to the guests, she can be contacted on any issue, she will help and protect the interests of vacationers. </p><p>  The territory of the <span>Grand Park Kemer Hotel (2017 reviews confirm this)</span> , including the pools are always perfectly cleaned, the staff is constantly busy with something.  The rooms are cleaned mostly well, the cleaners behave modestly, but they always smile kindly. </p><p>  The kitchen staff looks good and neat, clean the dirty dishes instantly, immediately set a table, carefully listen to requests, advise and wish them a pleasant appetite and a good rest. </p><p>  The animators are also friendly and friendly, some tourists were very sorry to say goodbye to them. </p><p>  Among all the reviews, one from a young family crashes into the eyes, who had problems with settlement, cleaning and who were evicted a few days before the end of the trip.  Among other impressions of tourists, this review is absolutely atypical, does not coincide with the opinions of many, based on certain facts.  It is likely that by mistake they didn‚Äôt write a review about this hotel or the situation was individual, which can be sorted out after hearing only two sides. </p><p>  A single complaint of a tourist was noticed that the hotel did not show any sign of attention to her husband on her birthday. </p>

    <h2>  Paid Services </h2><p>  There is a SPA salon on site, where you can get a massage for extra money.  In earlier reviews, there is information that a Turkish massage therapist showed a little more attention to female clients than was necessary according to his professional rules, but after the remark he corrected and apologized.  Apparently, the hotel administration did some work and improved the rules, because after a month they write in the reviews that the massage therapist can be chosen by gender, both women and men are working on their conscience, customers were satisfied. </p><p>  In the shops on the territory of the hotel, reasonable prices for the entire assortment of goods are identical to those of the shops of Beldibi. </p><p>  On the beach for an additional fee you can scuba dive, parachute, ride a banana or a scooter, as well as book a boat trip on a yacht.  Everyone who tried these entertainments on themselves, left positive reviews. </p><p>  In general, the reviews of <span>Grand Park Kemer Hotel 5 * receive both</span> positive and negative, if you trace their dynamics, it becomes obvious that the problems of one period (the lack of Russian-speaking animators, the behavior of the massage therapist in the SPA salon, equipment malfunction) were eliminated in the future as reported by tourists who were here later.  Considering all the advantages, you can safely recommend this place to rest for young people, companies, families with young children and older people - everyone will find what they need for themselves at the Grand Park Kemer Hotel 5 *. </p>
