Soft toy dog</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the master class presented below, we will talk about <span>how to crochet a dog.</span>  Schemes and a description of the necessary actions will also be offered, so that even beginner needlewomen will not have problems.  So, we invite interested readers to read the detailed and step-by-step instructions. </p><h2>  If you want to do well, do it yourself </h2><p>  Most of us are used to giving children soft toys for various holidays.  However, many modern copies, placed on store shelves, are very expensive, and look somewhat strange, and sometimes even scary.  Therefore, many creative people are thinking about how to independently make a funny, cute and kind character.  The charming doggie shown in the main photo will surely please the child.  Perhaps he will even become the most beloved and dear friend.  Largely because the dog was tied to a soft toy by a close person - mother, grandmother, aunt, sister. </p><h2>  Preparatory stage </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet a dog" class="if uuid-2971757" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2971757.jpg"></div><p>  Before you start knitting a cute doggie, you should prepare the stuff for stuffing.  Experts believe that ordinary cotton wool is better not to use.  After all, such a product will turn out to be too heavy, if necessary it will be quite difficult to wash and dry it.  Therefore, it is wiser to take a synthetic winterizer or holofiber.  For example, you can gut an unnecessary pillow and stuff it with your product contents. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is also worth noting that the toy shown in the photo has circles on its paws - appliqu√©s.  The dog is crocheted according to the technology that we will study further, and the stripes are cut from felt.  However, this condition is optional, if you want, the needlewoman can relate these details. </p><p>  It is still necessary to prepare a sewing needle, threads of suitable colors and scissors.  It is more reasonable to choose a hook during or after the purchase of yarn.  After all, the tool should be equal to the thickness of the thread. </p><h2>  Yarn selection </h2><p>  Needlewomen, who are professionally engaged in knitted toys, note that special children's yarn is best suited for such products.  It is very soft and does not cause allergies.  In addition, it is absolutely safe for babies who are used to chewing everything that comes to their hand. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet dog toy" class="if uuid-2971754" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2971754.jpg"></div><p>  To knit the dog shown in the photo, knitting threads of four colors are required: the main one is beige and three additional ones are white, black and blue.  And it is better to use yarn from one company, but in different shades.  Then the finished product will be the same density. </p><p>  It is impossible not to note one more important nuance, in the main photo the toy being studied is a soft dog, made in beige and blue tones.  But if you wish, you can use your own combination or what the child likes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Knitting features </h2><p>  For people who are familiar with the technique of amigurumi, the implementation of the studied product will not cause difficulties.  However, it is important for beginners to clarify several important nuances that determine the quality and beauty of the craft.  To begin with, any toys are knit in a spiral with columns without crochets.  Moreover, a new loop must be tied in such a way as to grab both threads of the previous row.  The technology can be explored in the following picture.  The image on the left illustrates the wrong actions, on the right - the right ones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to knit toys" class="if uuid-2971647" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2971647.jpg"></div><p>  Another important feature of knitting toys "Soft dog" is the initial stage.  Having formed an amigurumi ring, the next 2-3 rows must be knitted, moving counterclockwise.  That is, like any other thing.  Then the circle needs to be turned inside out.  As a result, the initial tail will be inside the craft.  Next, knit in the opposite direction - respectively, clockwise. </p><h2>  How to knit amigurumi ring </h2><p>  In the previous paragraph, a term incomprehensible to many beginning needlewomen was mentioned.  Therefore, now it is necessary to clarify it, because otherwise, studying the scheme and description of the dog with a crochet will be meaningless.  The product is still not very neat. </p><p>  So what does the amigurumi ring mean?  In fact, this is a special way to start knitting any toy.  The technology is pretty simple: </p><ol><li>  We wind the thread two times on the index finger of the left hand. </li><li>  Carefully remove the loop. </li><li>  And crochet, making six single crochet. </li><li>  We connect the last loop of the row with the first. </li><li>  Then we gently pull on the initial tip so that the center of the circle tightly closes. </li></ol><p>  If the necessary actions have not been clearly explained, you can consider the graphical instructions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="amigurumi ring" class="if uuid-2971640" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2971640.jpg"></div><h2>  We knit the head </h2><p>  Having dealt with the preparatory stage, the terms and features of the technology, we proceed to the implementation of ideas.  To do this, carefully study the MK Crochet Dog presented below.  We start by completing the head of a soft toy: </p><ol><li>  We take the main yarn. </li><li>  We form an amigurumi ring. </li><li>  In the 2nd row, we knit two out of the loops of the previous row - we make an increase.  Thus adding 6 new loops. </li><li>  In the 3rd, we increase through one single crochet.  Also add 6 loops. </li><li>  Turn the circle and knit in the opposite direction. </li><li>  From the 4th to the 11th row, we also add loops.  But with each row we increase the interval between increases - the number of columns without a crochet.  In the fourth row there should be 2, in the eleventh - 9. </li><li>  In total, 66 loops should be obtained. </li><li>  The next part of MK "Crochet Dog for Beginners" involves knitting 4 rows in a spiral. </li><li>  Next, we begin to reduce the loop.  From the 16th to the 24th row in even rows of 2 through - 31, 30, 29, 28, 27 single crochet.  Odd just knit. </li><li>  In the 25th row, the interval is 12 bars, in 26 - 11, in 27 - 6, in 28 - 5. </li><li>  We leave 36 loops and knit 7 rows in a spiral. </li><li>  We fill the head and knit another 7 rows. </li><li>  We reduce 6 loops in 5 rows. </li><li>  Do not forget to add filler. </li></ol><h2>  We knit a little body </h2><p>  To carry out the next step of the instruction, no circuit is needed.  The description "Dog crochet" will explain the necessary actions much better: </p><ol><li>  We take beige yarn and form an amigurumi ring. </li><li>  From the first to the 14th row we knit according to the technology described in the previous paragraph. </li><li>  In the 15th row, we reduce the loops with an interval of 31 columns. </li><li>  All evens from the 16th to the 38th are simply knit. </li><li>  In the 17th, the interval is 14 bars, in the 19th - 13, in the 21st - 12, in the 23rd - 11, in the 25th - 10, in the 27th - 9, in the 29th - 18 , in the 31st - 17, in the 33rd - 16, in the 35th - 15, in the 37th - 14, in the 39th - 13, in the 40th - 12, in the 41st - 11. </li><li>  In the 42nd row, it is necessary to reduce half the loops, we make 12 decreases. </li><li>  Also in the 43rd already 6 decreases. </li><li>  Then fill the body with filler. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to crochet a dog" class="if uuid-2971753" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2971753.jpg"></div><h2>  We knit paws </h2><p>  MK toy amigurumi rarely consist of step-by-step schemes.  The description "Crochet Dog" also includes graphic illustrations of only the basic steps - knitting loops and forming an amigurumi ring.  And all because the strict observance of increases and decreases is much more important in this technology, the rest of the product is pretty boring.  Without complex patterns, moving in a spiral.  Therefore, further textual instructions for the implementation are also proposed: </p><ol><li>  First we work with two front legs. </li><li>  We knit an amigurumi ring, 6 loops were added in the second row. </li><li>  From the 3rd to the 6th, we add one new loop, gradually increasing the interval of 1 column to 4. </li><li>  In the 7th row, the interval is 17 columns, in the 8th - 18, in the 9th - 19, in the 10th - 13, in the 11th - 14. </li><li>  We knit the next 3 rows in a circle. </li><li>  From the 15th to the 19th, we make a decrease at equal intervals (10, 9, 8 SC). </li><li>  In the 16th, 18th, 20th and from the 22nd to the 41st - we knit the available number of loops. </li><li>  From the 42nd we make reductions.  In this row, through 7 columns, in the 43rd through 2, in the 44th through 1. </li><li>  Then we pass to the hind legs. </li><li>  From the 1st to the 10th row we knit, based on a pattern for the head. </li><li>  We knit the 11th row, applying only one loop of the lower row. </li><li>  3 next knit as usual. </li><li>  In the 15th we alternate: 18 sbn *, decrease, 20 sbn, decrease, 18 sbn *. </li><li>  From the 16th to the 19th, we reduce the intervals marked with an asterisk by 1 column. </li><li>  In the 20th, we alternate: 13 sbn *, decrease, 8 sbn, 2 decreases, 8 sbn, decrease, 13 sbn *, at 21 - 12 sbn *. </li><li>  In the next five rows we make a decrease through 6 columns. </li></ol><h2>  Product assembly </h2><p>  Having prepared the main details of the crocheted large dog, we finish the additional ones - eyes, nose, ears, tail and collar.  Their description is presented below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet dog" class="if uuid-2971716" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2971716.jpg"></div><p>  Then we sew all the parts together, add felt appliqu√©s, embroider fingers, make out the nose and smile. </p><h2>  Simple crochet dog </h2><p>  If the presented master class is still difficult for a novice master, you should practice with simpler toys. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet dog" class="if uuid-2971751" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2971751.jpg"></div><p>  Thus, crocheting a large or small dog is not difficult.  It is only necessary to prepare the necessary materials and tools, and then understand the instructions. </p>
