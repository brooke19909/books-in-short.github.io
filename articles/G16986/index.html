She has been doing this for more than 7 years, so her experience cannot be taken away.  Each device appears on store shelves with high-quality assembly, good technical characteristics and a typical design.  This year there was a good "average" smart HTC 626G Dual Sim.  Its characteristics are slightly out of line with the cost.  We will deal with this and other issues further. </p><h2>  Included </h2><p>  As usual, HTC Corporation did not indulge its fans with generous equipment.  They didn‚Äôt put anything special in the box for the new model: the same network adapter and USB cable, as well as user instructions.  Nothing else will be found.  Although some buyers are still lucky to see headphones in the box. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc 626g dual sim specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1407379.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Smartphone <span>HTC Desire 626G</span> Dual Sim looks very beautiful.  Corporate design continues to follow its concept.  Therefore, looking at this model, you immediately notice the features of its ‚Äúbrothers‚Äù.  Most of the front panel is occupied by a screen, which visually reasonably increased due to the black frames.  Moreover, they were placed not only on the sides, but also from the bottom / top.  Above and below the display, the plastic elements of the case are visible. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Above is the <span>front camera</span> and earpiece, from below the earphone is opposed by an external speaker.  This location is convenient, because if you put the phone on the back, the sound of the call will not be muffled.  Also, when viewing a video speaker, it does not close by hand, but the sound goes directly to the user. </p><p>  It should be said right away that the HTC Desire 626G Dual Sim smartphone comes in two colors: dark blue and white.  Objectively, the dark version looks better.  This is due to the fact that the entire case is made in a noble blue color, and the turquoise border surrounds the sides of the device.  This contrast looks pretty. </p><p>  On the rear panel in the left corner is a round window of the lens.  Underneath is a flash.  The middle of the lid is decorated with the company logo, which also contrasts with the main color of the case.  By the way, the material is made using soft-touch technology, it is matte only in the case of the blue version.  But the light version has a glossy back cover.  It strongly attracts fingerprints and scratches. </p><h2>  Body elements </h2><p>  HTC did not change anything.  The volume rocker is on the right side of the case, and the power button is also placed there.  On the left side is a slot for two SIM cards and a memory card.  At the top there is a place for headphones, and at the bottom there is a connector for a charger. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone HTC Desire 626g dual sim" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1407381.jpg" width="600"></div>

To do this, just pry the lid.  Under it, we will see three places for microSD and two nano-SIM. </p><h2>  Comfort in detail </h2><p>  Externally, the phone HTC 626G Dual Sim turned out to be very high quality and presentable.  It feels tactile to work with the blue version of the smart.  It has no sharp corners, they are rounded, so it is convenient to hold the device and use it with one hand. </p><p>  Plastic is very high quality.  Thanks to him, the phone is lightweight, which visually does not match the dimensions.  Although the screen is 5 inches, due to the frames in height the phone turned out to be almost 147 mm.  Its width is 71 mm, and the thickness is 8.2 mm.  With such dimensions, the smartphone weighs only 137 grams. </p><h2>  Screen Secrets </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, the display size of the HTC 626G Dual Sim Blue is five inches.  The screen resolution is 1280 x 720, which is justified for this price category.  But nothing is known about the type of matrix.  For what reason this information is hidden to users, it is not clear.  In appearance, the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãsimilar to IPS.  The screen is moderately bright and has calm colors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc 626g dual sim price" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1407378.jpg"></div>

    <p>  It is also possible that the display used Super Clear LCD screen technology.  The viewing angle is good, saturation and contrast are normal.  That is, the screen of HTC 626G Dual Sim, whose price is about 10 thousand rubles, corresponds to this cost. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  With brightness a little overdone.  On a sunny day, the smartphone behaves perfectly on the street with a maximum level.  But at night, setting the minimum brightness is less comfortable, since the screen shines too much. </p><p>  The sensor is also of high quality.  It is capable of capturing up to 10 simultaneous clicks.  There is <span>an oleophobic coating,</span> although in practice it seems that it is absent.  The fingerprint screen collects well, but it‚Äôs difficult to wipe them.  By the way, some owners of the device were unsatisfied with the hypersensitivity of the display.  But this is not a systemic problem, but rather a habit. </p><h2>  an old friend is better than two new ones </h2><p>  Since the model was released last year, there can be no talk of Android version 6.0.  But the smartphone for some reason was not even awarded the fifth version of the OS.  Android 4.4 KitKat is available for HTC Desire 626G Dual Sim owners.  The characteristics of this software platform do not stand out.  The only thing that the system was supplemented by the proprietary shell Sense UI 5.3. </p><p>  For the rest, the smartphone is unremarkable inside.  From software there is a lot of superfluous.  But besides this, there is a whole set of Google and office programs.  The phone‚Äôs menu is branded standard.  Regarding OS updates, there is no need to wait for innovations.  There are doubts that the manufacturer will update the devices to the fifth version, although some are hoping for the already famous Android 6.0. </p><h2>  Budget </h2><p>  Since HTC 626G Dual Sim has a price of about 10 thousand rubles, you should not expect much from the technical ‚Äústuffing‚Äù.  The <span>MediaTek MT6592 processor</span> works with eight Cortex-A7 cores.  Their clock frequency is 1.7 GHz.  For the graphics meets the chipset Mali-450.  In principle, for such a smartphone these are acceptable indicators.  In "Antutu" performance was estimated as much as 32 thousand points.  For a device of this price category a very worthy result. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc desire 626g dual sim specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1407380.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Owner reviews about what HTC Desire 626G Dual Sim features are positive.  No one complained about lags and ‚Äúbrakes‚Äù.  The smartphone works smoothly and efficiently.  Many even called this model "smart." </p><p>  In practice, it is.  The phone is really in the "top five" to cope with the stable operation of the interface, the continuous operation of the Internet and multitasking.  Games also go without problems.  But for some powerful toys, such as WOT Blitz, to work adequately, you have to sacrifice the quality of the graphics. </p><h2>  Up without memory </h2><p>  On HTC 626G Dual Sim, the memory specifications upset.  Immediately it seems that the developers forgot what price range the smartphone is in.  It seems like 1 GB of RAM is not entirely sad and critical.  Nevertheless, it is clear to everyone that this is not enough in 2016.  Some companies have released devices with 6 GB of RAM.  Of course, for such models the price is higher, but <span>1 GB is</span> completely sad. </p><p>  It turned out that the amount of RAM is not the saddest.  The internal memory here is 8 GB.  It seems to be tolerable, but, as you know, only 4.4 GB is available to the user.  That is, it is already half less.  As practice shows, many in our time are already missing 16 GB. </p><p>  It immediately lights up, because the phone has support for a memory card up to 32 GB.  And here is where the HTC 626G Dual Sim reviews got completely devastating.  It turns out that it is impossible to use an external drive to store games and applications.  What the developers thought was not clear, but now the question arises: what is the price then? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc 626g dual sim reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1407382.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In general, the HTC 626G Dual Sim has its memory characteristics - the weakest point.  Especially for those who do not know how to deal with such problems.  For the more advanced, there is a solution to this memory shortage.  You can specifically search for the application in the "Play Market".  It will allow you to distribute all the software and games so that there is enough space for everything. </p><h2>  How many lives? </h2><p>  Since this model is a monopod, the battery cannot be removed.  Its capacity is 2000 mAh.  This is a standard indicator for such a phone.  Given the memory problems, it is unlikely that the owners will play endlessly or use other entertainment. </p><p>  The device can withstand a working day with moderate use.  That is, it is more suitable for business people who need a couple of hours of calls per day, mail and surfing the Internet.  If you play it, then it will lose its entire charge in 4 hours, if you continuously watch the video in 8 hours. </p><h2>  Ordinary photos </h2><p>  The HTC 626G Dual Sim features a camera nothing special.  Pictures in the afternoon are good.  But they do not reach the indicators of 13 megapixels.  The aperture has a good 2.2 value, so the pictures are well detailed.  By the way, the interesting thing is that photos are best taken in macro mode, but only if the lighting around is good.  At night, the image does not shine with quality. </p><p>  The main camera shoots video in Full HD at a frequency of 30 frames per second.  Of course, some presentable videos will not work, but to capture something memorable is more than enough. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc 626g dual sim blue" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1407384.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  The front camera has 5 megapixels and in practice justifies this value.  She takes good selfie pictures, and the video conversation is comfortable. </p><h2>  Wireless networks </h2><p>  As you know, this smart does not have LTE frequencies, this is another reason why the price of the device becomes unjustified.  Of course, the developers found a way out of the situation, and they released a version with 4G. </p><p>  HTC Desire 626G Dual Sim EEA features 2G / 3G networks.  Navigation with A-GPS support also works great, although the lack of GLONASS is a little sad.  But for many, this option is not so significant.  All other standard functions, such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, cope with the work correctly.  Among other things, the smartphone is available acceleration sensors and screen orientation, as well as a <span>digital compass.</span> </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Of course, HTC couldn‚Äôt launch a bad smartphone on the market.  Nevertheless, he has too many shortcomings.  Of the good, its really beautiful appearance and the screen is above average.  The rest of the characteristics did not justify their price. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc desire 626g dual sim eea" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1407383.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  The operating system could immediately be put more or give users the opportunity to upgrade to 6.0.  Maybe not everyone uses 4G frequencies, but for this price it would be possible to add them to the device.  Memory problems were generally unclear.  If you can put up with 1 GB of RAM, then the incomplete functioning of the external drive is annoying.  In general, there are two ways out: either reduce the price or fine-tune the model. </p>
