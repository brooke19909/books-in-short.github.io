    <p>  Its modern U-shaped hotel building, directed by the "legs" of this "letter" directly to the sea, covers a fairly spacious, albeit compact, recreation area around the pools.  This arrangement provides its guests with a gorgeous seascape, as well as a view of a very well-groomed territory with neat lawns, a garden of palm trees, exotic and flowering plants. </p><p>  The water area adjacent to the hotel beach is characteristic of the coast of Hurghada.  It is not very rich in corals, the beach is sandy.  It is convenient for families with children. </p><p>  Hotel - belongs to the category of ‚Äúfive-star‚Äù economy class.  Rest in it is quite calm, the animation is not very intrusive, which determines a fairly wide range of its clients: families with children, men and women separately resting, and pensioners. </p><p>  The hotel complex personnel is responsible for customer service.  The latter circumstance determines the geography of its guests.  Most vacationers are from Western Europe, mainly Germans, there are few Russians.  It is advisable to communicate with the staff of the hotel complex in English, since most of its employees (the latter does not apply to those on duty at the reception) do not know the Russian language sufficiently. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What time of year to buy a tour? </h2><p>  So, you decided to fly to Egypt.  In this case, we highly recommend that you take into account the climatic features of this country. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sea ‚Äã‚Äãstar beau rivage hurghada" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/747490.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  According to guest reviews of Sea Star Beau Rivage Hotel 5 *, a tropical desert climate is felt here almost all year: the temperature of the Red Sea is not very unfavorable for swimming only in the winter months, the sea is cool, in addition, a piercing cool wind constantly blows.  Because of this, the winter beach <span>season in Egypt is</span> problematic.  Hotel guests for the above reasons prefer to swim at this time in the heated pool, and not in the Red Sea.  Although the cold weather (in our understanding) in the winter in Egypt, of course, does not reach.  Indeed, the local January average temperature is +16.4 <sup>0</sup> . Therefore, the hotel complex is in demand by tourists almost all year round. </p><p>  On the other hand, hot weather and active tropical sun in the summer months may also not be entirely appropriate for comfortable rest for middle-aged and older people, especially those accustomed to a cooler climate.  Indeed, hotel guests write about the ‚ÄúEgyptian‚Äù activity of the sun, unusual for middle-latitude residents, in July-August: it is advisable to stay on the beach until <sup>11:00</sup> in the morning, but if the sunbathing citizen at the same time stays in the sun for more than half an hour, he will ‚Äúburn out‚Äù. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Therefore, readers of this article, we strongly recommend buying a tour at Sea Star Beau Rivage Hotel in the ideal months for a vacation in the Land of the Pharaohs: May, October, November.  However, it is worth considering that in November, due to the holidays, the price of the tour rises significantly.  Note to the readers of this article: at the current time, in the month of May, a tour for a couple of holidaymakers lasting 7 nights has a fairly favorable price - from $ 969. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  There is one more reason that makes rest in this hotel complex for holiday-makers economically advantageous.  Many couples ‚Äúliked‚Äù the pricing policy of the Sea Star Beau Rivage Hotel 5 * hotel: for children aged 4 to 12 years, the cost of the tour is reduced by 50%.  The hottest hotel complex accepts the smallest spa guests (up to 4 years old) for free. </p>

    <p>  An obvious ‚Äúplus‚Äù of the hotel is also a comfortable sandy beach, convenient for small tourists, located 100 meters from it, and a shallow lagoon located near it.  However, the entrance to the water is not purely sandy.  It is distinguished by an abundance of pebbles, so special shoes are recommended for swimmers.  However, adult holidaymakers can do without it, if you go into the water from the hotel pontoon.  In this case, the swimmer immediately appears in the company of exotic fish, which you can enjoy for a long time. </p><p>  As most reviews say, it is advisable to take a place on the beach until <sup>8:00</sup> a.m.  Resorts, adapting to this circumstance, often ‚Äúcooperate‚Äù: ‚Äúlarks‚Äù occupy their familiar ‚Äúowls‚Äù place in advance. </p><p>  Perhaps that‚Äôs why (although there are enough umbrellas and sunbeds on the beach of the Sea Star Beau Rivage hotel for everyone), hotel guests who arrived at the beach by ten in the morning find that all the sun loungers set in advance are already occupied.  Therefore, they are forced to ask the beach staff to transfer the reserve lounger to the free section of the beach and pay a few Egyptian pounds for this additional service. </p><p>  Based on the real experience set forth in the reviews of hotel guests, in order not to ‚Äúburn out,‚Äù it is worth using an anti-tanning cream with a protection factor of 30 or 50 (16 is not enough), as well as sunbathing no longer than <sup>11:00</sup> . </p><p>  And finally, about the pleasant.  Guests writing a review about Sea Star Beau Rivage Hotel note that the sea in the waters of its beach is magnificent.  However, here it is also necessary to take into account the specifics of the densely populated marine fauna and flora of the Red Sea.  Reviews of ‚Äúexperienced‚Äù recommend that new arrivals immediately purchase in a small shop located opposite the hotel complex, for $ 4 a set consisting of a mask with a pipe, as well as special beach slippers that protect your feet. </p><h2>  Territory and pools </h2><p>  It is comfortable for spa guests to relax in this hotel.  On a compact, limited by the U-shaped hotel building Sea Star Beau Rivage, the territory is equipped with two rather large swimming pools.  One of them, the smaller one, is heated.  For the most part, twice a day, vacationers, divided into teams, play water polo, and also do aerobics on the site near it.  The organizing and entertaining beginnings in these classes are animators. </p><p>  The water in the pools is clean, chlorinated, but the smell is inaudible.  The hotel building was built taking into account the fact that in the winter time the ‚Äúletter P‚Äù covers the territory of the pools from the cool wind.  Therefore, the wind does not really bother people bathing and in the neighboring recreation area. </p><p>  If you are hungry, you do not have to go to a restaurant.  In the relaxation area by the pool in the daytime there is a bar with drinks and snacks that can be eaten. </p><p>  It should be noted that here they do not include loud music, quietly and constantly maintain cleanliness, animators are tactful.  Perhaps that is why, according to reviews, the pool area was chosen by German pensioners.  It seems that they even prefer it to the sea. </p><p>  In the evening, the water in the pools, palm trees planted on the territory, and buildings are illuminated artistically and accentuated.  The very view of a night hotel provides aesthetic pleasure and creates a romantic atmosphere. </p><h2>  Catering </h2><p>  There are 4 restaurants at Sea Star Beau Rivage 5, of which one is the main <span>buffet,</span> and three are by appointment.  There are also five bars and an internet cafe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sea ‚Äã‚Äãstar beau rivage 5" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/747495.jpg" width="600"></div>

But in the harvest season, guests are fed various fruits. </p><p>  However, as follows from the stories of the guests of the hotel, meals can be greatly diversified using the services of restaurants working by appointment.  The most organized tourists regularly get to sign up for dinner in an Italian or fish restaurant.  By the way, the hotel‚Äôs fish guests almost unanimously give high marks. </p><p>  Briefly introduce you to the specifics of the still unmentioned hotel bars.  Hookah lovers and Egyptian drink lovers visit the Oriental Corner Bar.  For lovers of beer, non-alcoholic and low-alcohol cocktails in the lobby area there is a pub.  Waiters take drinks and snacks to the Upper Terrace terrace. </p><p>  The hotel has an internet cafe Cofee shop with a plasma screen, billiards, computer games. </p><h2>  Hotel Service </h2><p>  Client judgments about their tour show that worthy standards of service for their guests are supported by the Sea Star Beau Rivage hotel.  Reviews 2014, as well as reviews for previous years, note attentiveness to vacationers.  In particular, the employees on duty at the reception help hotel guests to resolve issues of concern to their household almost immediately upon their request, in the current time mode. </p><p>  Hotel guests really feel that the staff of Sea Star Beau Rivage 5 (Hurghada), their staff, really value their work.  This can be seen even by how thoroughly both the territory and the client rooms are cleaned.  In addition, bath accessories (meaning soap, shampoo, shower gel, toothpaste, etc.) are always replaced on time when they are used up. </p><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  The hotel has 279 rooms.

An unexpected and pleasant bonus for hotel guests is a huge balcony, furnished with a <span>coffee table</span> and chairs.  Here in the evening it is very nice to watch the sunsets. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  In many hotels, the unprofessional guides have already become <span>a byword.</span>  Resorts in their reviews recommend not buying excursions with artificially high prices from them, complain about their carelessness. </p><p>  However, there are pleasant exceptions.  All this does not apply to guides Sea Star Beau Rivage (Hurghada).  Reviews of the guests of the hotel complex note the exceptional friendliness of the hotel guides, their competent advice, knowledge of the Russian language, a high level of excursions.  Based on the foregoing, most tourists, hotel guests still buy some (limited) number of excursions offered by guides and, in most cases, positively mention guides in their reviews. </p><p>  Rich in sightseeing tours of Egypt.  Sea Star Beau Rivage - a hotel located in one of its provinces - Hurghada, is remembered for its guests, including excursions.  By the way, the administration and staff of the restaurant are sympathetic to tourist travelers.  The restaurant for them, by reservation, prepares rations on the day of the tour, and arriving at the hotel complex late in the evening, tourists have the opportunity to dine.  This service is called a delayed dinner. </p><p>  After analyzing the reviews of holidaymakers vacationing in the Sea Star Beau Rivage (Hurghada), we can highlight the most popular excursions bought by them: </p><ul><li>  Cairo (Pyramids and Sphinx of Giza, Cairo National Museum); </li><li>  Luxor, in ancient times - Thebes, the capital of the Land of the Pharaohs (monumental structures of the "city of the dead"); </li><li>  Israel (shrines of the Christian and Jewish faith); </li><li>  visits to historical shows in the Castle ‚ÄúA Thousand and One Nights‚Äù (Hurghada); </li><li>  dolphinarium; </li><li>  "Jungle" - water park; </li><li>  El Gunna ("Venice on the Red Sea"); </li><li>  boat trip on a yacht. </li></ul><h2>  Hurghada - an international level water sports center </h2><p>  Thousands of water sports enthusiasts fly annually to the capital of the Red Sea province, Hurghada.  There are also among the guests of the hotel in question.  The most popular among fans of outdoor activities are windsurfing, kitesurfing, diving.  After analyzing the information from the sites, we counted only 41 diving schools.  A certain part of the hotel guests (there are not many) go to these schools almost every day, as if they were working.  The goal is to get an international diver certificate of their chosen qualification. </p><h2>  Animation </h2><p>  The chic beach animation by Sea Star Beau Rivage deserves a special review.  Many vacationers agree that, in principle, this is intangible know-how (enthusiasm, cheerful disposition, ironic recklessness, courage of the animation team: DJ Hassan, Deborah, Mr. Boy, Karina, Matthias, Past, Susie, Sofia) - the most remarkable that remains in memory after visiting this hotel complex. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel sea star beau rivage" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/747492.jpg" width="400"></div>  Animators on their feet in the morning, they attract spa visitors to morning exercises, water aerobics.  In the afternoon, they organize a boccia game, beach volleyball.  Also, to the delight of the spa guests, competitions in belly dancing are arranged.  In the evening from 23 <sup>00</sup> to 2 <sup>00</sup> a disco is organized in the hotel disco club.  Moreover, up to 24 <sup>00,</sup> alcoholic beverages in it are free.

    <h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  Two kilometers from the Sea Star Beau Rivage 5 Hotel (Hurghada) is the city center of shopping, where all tourists seek - Saqqara.  Immediately upon arrival in Turkey, before 24 hours have passed, experienced holiday-makers rush here to purchase cosmetics, perfumes, chocolate, alcohol at duty-free prices at the duty free shop. </p><p>  Also, despite the local "biting" prices, the athletes were lucky: it is profitable (an order of magnitude cheaper than in Moscow) here you can buy branded high-quality sportswear directly in the Senzo Mall.  Reebok and Adidas products are really attractive for budget travelers. </p><p>  It is useless to bargain here, since prices are fixed.  And the high price level is explained by the location of the Saqqara shopping district - in the midst of five-star hotels.  The logic is simple: tourists from <span>Western Europe</span> in their homeland are faced with higher prices for branded goods, so the prices of Saqqara are acceptable for them (which can not be said about all tourists from the countries of the former CIS). </p><p>  On the restored promenade of Saqqara, which is called New Marina, you can not only take a walk, but also visit a bar or restaurant.  The most famous is the Hed Kandi Beach Bar, where guest DJs perform. </p><p>  However, guests of the Sea Star Beau Rivage 5 hotel (Hurghada) still buy most of the souvenirs in one of the traditional areas of the city - in Al-Dahar.  We are talking about cute ‚ÄúEgyptian‚Äù handicraft souvenirs that guests of the Pharaohs Country are happy to bring after leisure as souvenirs: T-shirts, magnets, key rings, etc. A great variety of them can be bought here, and moreover, inexpensively. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Briefly summarize our review of the rest in a five-star hotel.  His services are in demand, they are worthy of the level and inexpensive in price. </p>

    <p> Indeed, good service with daily expenses from one resort not exceeding one hundred US dollars is demonstrated by the Sea Star Beau Rivage hotel considered by us in Hurghada. The reviews of its guests are mostly positive.
