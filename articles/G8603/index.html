    <h2>  Pandora and her gift </h2><p>  At the behest of Zeus, the great master Hephaestus made a statue of a young girl.  Aphrodite came and gave her beauty.  Athena appeared - and the girl became a beautiful needlewoman.  Hermes flew in, and from him the beauty learned to flatter beautifully.  The gods gave her everything that they perfectly owned, and therefore they called the girl Pandora. </p><p>  The gods sent the young beauty to Prometheus to give him a golden casket, which later became known as the Pandora's Casket.  But, not trusting Zeus, the titan refused the gift.  Then Pandora went to Epimetheus, who was the brother of Prometheus.  Seeing a pretty girl, Epimetheus forgot that he promised his brother not to take gifts from the gods.  The mysterious <span>casket of Pandora</span> intrigued Epimetheus, and he quickly opened it.  All kinds of misfortunes escaped from the conclusion and spread throughout the earth.  The girl was frightened and closed the casket.  And one gift, warming a person in hours of sadness and parting, did not manage to get out of the box.  And that gift was hope. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Very soon, misfortunes and troubles came to the earth.  Diseases haunted people, hunger and death did not give humanity rest.  They sneaked up unnoticed, since Zeus did not allow them to talk, and took millions of victims with them.  With these events began the famous feat of Prometheus.  The myth is studied even in the lessons of literature and history. </p><h2>  Prometheus and the Flood </h2><p>  Lord of the gods could not calm down and conceived the <span>Flood.</span>  Hearing this, Prometheus reported everything to his son Deucalion.  In the built ship, Deucalion and his wife Pyrrha escaped and were the only ones on earth.  At the home of Prometheus' mother, a married couple began to collect stones and immediately throw them behind their backs.  Hitting the ground, they turned into men and women.  It was a rebirth of the human race.  Later, the couple had a son, Ellin, the future founder of Hellas.  So the feat of Prometheus saved mankind, but the Gods were furious. </p><h2>  Punishment of Prometheus </h2><p>  With the help of faithful servants, Zeus sent the hero to the ends of the world and chained him in a chain at the cliff.  Wild pain experienced Prometheus.  His groans shook his mother’s heart.  But he did not submit to Zeus.  The gods carefully watched the sufferer, and people sympathized with their hero. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Almost everyone believed that the Thunderer won.  But only Prometheus knew one secret that the <span>goddess of fate</span> whispered to him <span>.</span>  The power of Zeus will soon end, since his son, born of Thetis, will take the throne.  But if Thetis becomes the wife of a mortal man, then their son will also be a hero, but not a rival of the thunder. </p><p>  Centuries passed.  Prometheus, hungry and thirsty, was still in chains.  But suddenly Zeus found out that the prisoner knew his future.  The Thunderer offered to exchange the secret for freedom, but Prometheus refused.  He set his conditions: release and recognition of punishment as unfair.  The brief feat of Prometheus was passed from mouth to mouth, so such myths have survived to this day. </p>

    <h2>  New trials of Prometheus </h2><p>  The lord did not yield to Prometheus, only subjected him to new sufferings.  He placed him for the time of the unfortunate in the darkness, where the souls of the dead roam, and returned back to the rock in the Caucasus.  And he sent an eagle to hatch Prometheus' liver daily.  Over night, the wound healed, but in the morning it all repeated again. </p><p>  We heard loud groans of the titan, cried from grief and begged to tell the secret: </p><ul><li>  ocean nymphs; </li><li>  brothers </li><li>  mother. </li></ul><p>  But the hero insisted on recognizing his innocence.  The feat of Prometheus was not recognized, but he was ready to pay for the truth with his own liver. </p>

    <h2>  The liberation of Prometheus </h2><p>  Zeus could not stand it and admitted defeat.  He freed Prometheus and learned the secret. </p><p>  Thetis became the wife of King Peleus.  In marriage, they had a son, Achilles, who became the great hero of the <span>Trojan War.</span>  The feat of Prometheus is not the only one, many titans went against the Gods, helping people. </p><p>  Prometheus, in memory of his suffering, left himself one link in the chain with a piece of stone.  And people, in order to remember the act of titanium, began to wear rings with stones.  This is how the feat of <span>Prometheus</span> sounds <span>.</span>  <span>The summary of the</span> myth is often retold in literature lessons. </p>
