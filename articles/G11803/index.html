    <h2>  Rome: photos of the city, its description and history </h2><p>  This city is located in the central part of the <span>Apennine Peninsula,</span> near the place where <span>the Tiber</span> River flows into the <span>Tyrrhenian Sea.</span>  Once this settlement was the center of the powerful Roman Empire.  Today, Rome is the capital of Italy.  Its population is about three million people.  Interestingly, in Rome there are two independent state entities: the Vatican and the tiny enclave state of <span>the Order of Malta.</span> </p><p>  According to an ancient legend, the city arose in the VIII century BC.  Its founder was one of the royal twins who were fed by a she-wolf, Romulus.  The city was named after the second brother - Rem.  However, according to modern scholars, the first settlements on the site of modern Rome appeared long before the birth of Romulus and Remus.  But in those days, people inhabited only the Palatine Hill.  The large city, located on seven hills, Rome became much later. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At first the city was ruled by kings, then the Republic was proclaimed here, at the head of which there were consuls (from the 5th century BC to the 30s of our era).  After that, Rome turned into the Roman Empire under the control of emperors who were in power until the V century.  After another seven centuries, secular church authority was established here, and the city became the residence of the Pope.  The full-fledged capital of Italy, the city was proclaimed in 1870. </p><p>  Today, attracted by many interesting cultural and historical monuments, numerous tourists annually arrive in Rome.  The city center, where the bulk of the attractions are concentrated, was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List and is under the patronage and protection of this organization.  Thus, today the famous phrase that all roads lead to Rome finds confirmation once again.  Indeed, almost every one of us dreams at least once in this Eternal City on seven hills. </p>

    <h2>  Where to go in Rome? </h2><p>  If you have a map of the <span>sights of Rome</span> in front of you <span>,</span> then you can immediately note that this city has a really huge number of historical monuments.  Therefore, if you plan to spend only a couple of days in the Italian capital, then you should not try, as they say, to "embrace the immense."  In this case, it is recommended to visit only the main attractions.  We offer to learn more about them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Pantheon </h2><p>  The Pantheon is an ancient temple, built two thousand years ago, during the reign of Emperor Augustus.  This building is rightfully considered one of the most remarkable in Rome.  In ancient times, the main Roman gods were worshiped here - Zeus, Neptune, Venus, Mars and others.  During the services, a variety of animals were sacrificed, which today reminds us of a nine-meter hole in the dome of the church, under which in ancient times was a sacrificial altar.  In general, during its two thousand year history the Pantheon has been a pagan temple, and a bastion, and a church.  But only in the Renaissance, thanks to the efforts of the unforgettable Raphael, he again regained its former greatness.  Today, the Pantheon attracts many tourists not only for its rich and interesting history, but also for the fact that a number of Italian monarchs are buried in it. </p>

    <h2>  Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore </h2><p>  Any guide to Rome without fail recommends visiting this famous church.  The basilica was erected on the site of an ancient church in the distant 352 year.  Then it was rebuilt several times, becoming more magnificent and luxurious.  The last reconstruction of the basilica was carried out in the XVIII century. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Spain Square </h2><p>  This place in Rome is very popular with tourists.  The square got its name in honor of the palace of Spain, built in 1622 and at that time the former residence of the Spanish ambassador to the Vatican.  Here is the <span>staircase of Spain.</span>  However, to climb it, you will have to overcome a number of difficulties, since its steps have an uneven shape and different heights.  However, many tourists try to climb higher so that, comfortably sitting on the steps, enjoy the magnificent views of the panorama of the north-eastern part of the Italian capital and the picturesque fountain of Barkaccia. </p>

    <h2>  Vatican </h2><p>  If one of the points of your trip is Italy, Rome, a guide to this city without fail will recommend you to visit the Vatican.  This state is the smallest in the world, and here is the residence of the Pope.  In addition, the Vatican has a number of unique historical and cultural monuments: the Vatican Library, Piazza San Pietro, the chapel of Pope Nicholas V, St. Peter's Basilica with the <span>Sistine Chapel</span> and others. </p><h2>  Roman catacombs </h2><p>  Not a single map of the sights of Rome is complete without mentioning the local catacombs.  In total, there are 67 of them in the city.  In ancient times, burials of deceased residents of the city were located here.  During the period of persecution of Christians, which lasted for four centuries at the very beginning of the first millennium AD, Roman catacombs became shelters for supporters of Orthodoxy.  Here were the graves of martyrs, over which later monasteries were erected.  Despite the fact that the authorities of Ancient Rome were engaged in the persecution of the first Christians, the reverence of the inhabitants of this city for the dead was so great that the catacombs were not destroyed, but survived until our times. </p>

    <h2>  Terms </h2><p>  In ancient times, the baths served not so much as bathhouses, but were places of public life of the Romans.  Here we met with friends, made deals, made useful contacts.  The first baths were built in 25 BC near the Pantheon.  The largest structures of this type, accommodating up to three thousand people, were erected by order of the Emperor Diocletian in the 4th century.  Therms were distinguished by their luxurious decoration: they were decorated with sculptures, equipped with libraries, gardens, trading floors, etc. </p><h2>  Coliseum </h2><p>  Not a single guide to Rome ignores this magnificent amphitheater.  The Coliseum was built in the first century and became the largest building intended for mass entertainment throughout the Roman Empire.  So, this amphitheater could simultaneously accommodate 50 thousand people.  To this day, the Colosseum has come no longer in perfect condition.  Nevertheless, this building has retained its magnificent spirit to this day. </p>

    <h2>  What to do besides sightseeing? </h2><p>  Of course, having arrived in the city of Rome for the first time, most tourists spend most of their time exploring historical monuments.  However, if you don‚Äôt want to go too deep into history or it‚Äôs not the first time you‚Äôve arrived in the Italian capital, you can also pay attention to other entertainments.  For example, you can go to one of the concerts that are held at the Olympic Stadium.  It is quite often performed by both Italian and foreign performers.  Also, this city will be a real find for opera lovers.  The most impressive performances are held in the <span>Terme of Caracalla.</span>  The summer season here always opens with the staging of the Roman Opera House. </p><p>  Rome is also an expanse for football fans.  After all, it is here that two world-famous football clubs Roma and Lazio are based.  So it is not surprising that quite a large part of tourists in Rome are fans. </p><h2>  Night life </h2><p>  Since Rome is a modern metropolis, it boasts a rather vibrant nightlife.  In the city center you will find many cafes, clubs and bars where you can have a great evening. </p>

    <h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  Any guide to Rome necessarily includes information about shopping in this city.  The main shopping street in the Italian capital is Via del Corso, stretching from Piazza del Popolo to the central square of the city.  It can be reached both by ground and underground transport.  By the way, the metro map of Rome can be found everywhere: in a guidebook, in a newsstand, at a public transport stop, etc. So, if you decide to take the metro, you need to choose line A and get off at Flaminio station. </p><p>  Another street that is attractive to shopaholics is Via Nazionale.  It stretched from Termini Station to Piazza Venezia.  On both sides of the street there are many shops and boutiques of famous brands. </p><h2>  Kitchen </h2><p>  In fairness, it should be noted that Rome, like Italy as a whole, attracts millions of tourists not only due to its historical and cultural attractions, but also by local cuisine, which, by the way, is considered one of the best in the whole world.  Therefore, having arrived in the Eternal City, you can indulge yourself in the gastronomic plan. </p><p>  Local catering establishments are of various types: pizzerias (this is the simplest and most democratic option), taverns, cafes, taverns and restaurants.  It should also be noted that regardless of where you will have lunch - in an expensive restaurant or a cheap pizzeria, be sure that you will always be served a tasty and high-quality cooked dish.  After all, Italians have great respect for food and their guests. </p>
