Adherents of a healthy lifestyle will be especially pleased with their vacation: in the village on many streets, special simulators are installed for everyone who wants to practice. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Goldcity Hotel 5" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2058070.jpg"></div>

    <p>  A lot of entertainment is presented on the beach.  Here you can ride a jet ski and pedal boats, a banana, go diving and windsurfing, parachute, rent a scooter or buy a yacht tour. </p><h2>  Goldcity Hotel 5 * (Kargicak): reviews </h2><p>  Many of our compatriots are happy to recall a vacation spent at this hotel.  In Turkey, hotel complexes of a similar level are rarely found.  The vast majority of Russians rate this hotel for the highest score.  There are practically no negative reviews about him. </p><p>  The excellent number of rooms of the hotel, especially the villas located on the mountain slope, is to the liking of all tourists.  Here you can retire to one of the two two-story apartments.  Tourists really liked the balconies with sun loungers.  In general, judging by the reviews, the location of the villas is provided so that the probability of being seen from neighboring rooms is completely excluded. </p><p>  Our compatriots also liked the food.  There is always a lot of food, and very diverse.  Many say that this hotel also offers pork dishes, which is not always found in Turkey.  Thoroughly thought out the schedule of restaurants, pubs and bars: throughout the day, one of them must be open. </p><p>  The hotel area is simply huge.  Apparently, the owners thus compensated for the remoteness from the sea, providing for it a lot of entertainment services.  The entire first floor is a spa.  There is also a cinema on the territory: once a week you can watch a film in Russian. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Goldcity Hotel 5 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2058079.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In general, the entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel is thought out to the smallest detail.  Loved the Russians water park. </p><p>  There are a lot of pluses in Goldcity Hotel 5 *, however, there is also a minus - remoteness from the sea.  But the hotel also decided this question.  Every half hour, a bus leaves for the beach.  However, some express dissatisfaction with the fact that very often, for example, during lunch hours, it is crowded, so you have to wait for the next one, and this is somewhat annoying.  This circumstance was especially not pleasant to those who had a rest with children. </p>
