    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Opinions of tourists regarding this issue diverged somewhat.  So, some of the guests claim that the food here is monotonous.  In addition, some guests complained that the menu does not contain seafood (except for fish).  However, most of the travelers claim that the choice of dishes here is not as wide as in hotels of the five-star category, but you will not have to eat the same thing every day.  So, according to them, for lunch and dinner there were always many dishes of poultry and fish, salads, soups, snacks, sweets, pastries and fresh fruits.  True, meat was not served very often, but this situation is typical for many hotels in Turkey.  In addition, something was always cooked on the grill for dinner ‚Äî cutlets, turkey, vegetables, fish, etc. At lunch, the Inzhekum ‚Äã‚ÄãWest Hotel 4 * restaurant served delicious pizza.  And at about 3-4 o‚Äôclock in the afternoon, guests had the opportunity to treat themselves to junk food in a snack bar. </p><p>  As for drinks, their choice here, according to tourists, is generally the same as in most hotels in Turkey.  So, guests can enjoy a beer, wine and local brandy.  Juices are powder.  Visitors to the restaurant during breakfast, lunch or dinner can themselves pour coffee or tea from the machine.  During the day, these drinks can be enjoyed at the bar. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="incekum west otel 4" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1030984.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  As travelers note in their reviews, in ‚ÄúIncekum West Hotel 4 *‚Äù you can confidently count on an excellent beach holiday.  So, at the disposal of guests there is not one, but several beaches at once.  At the same time, one of them is located in a cozy lagoon, and one - on the part of the famous Incekum beach.  And everywhere under your feet you will have a soft, fine, clean sand.  When entering the water, the bottom in most cases is also sandy.  But there are several places where you can descend into the water from the pier.  At the bottom there are stones.  By the way, some guests even snorkeling in these places, as in the water you can see numerous fish and other marine life. </p><p>  All beaches have comfortable sun loungers and plenty of sun umbrellas.  So the hotel guests have the opportunity to have a great rest, swimming in the warm gentle sea and sunbathing, sitting comfortably on a sun lounger. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="incekum west 4" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1030982.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment at the hotel </h2><p>  As our compatriots note, the hotel in question is more focused on a calm, measured family vacation.  Therefore, noisy entertainment and discos until the morning you will not find here. </p><p>  In general, the hotel has three pools - a large outdoor, indoor and children's.  There are sun terraces and bars nearby.  During the day, animators offer those who wish to participate in water aerobics, gymnastics, play boccia or darts. </p><p>  In the evenings there is an entertainment program.  However, it seemed boring to most vacationers, with the exception of the days when guest artists performed. </p><h2>  For children </h2><p>  The Inzecum West Hotel 4 * management took care of the youngest travelers as well.  So, for them, a children's club operates throughout the day, where kids are offered various fun and educational activities in accordance with their age.  In the evenings, a mini disco is held. </p>
