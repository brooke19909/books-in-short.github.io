Rest in the Iron Port: photos and reviews of tourists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Iron Port is a resort on the Ukrainian Black Sea coast.  It is popular among residents of the country, as well as among Russians, Belarusians and Moldavians.  Since ancient times, tourists came here with modest means and the same demands.  But recently, the resort began to develop rapidly.  Both the owners of the private sector and the administration of the recreation centers are reconstructing the number of rooms in order to lure more demanding customers.  Of course, there are places where you will not find anything other than a bedside table and a bed with a pressed mesh bottom.  But the prices for such billets are appropriate.  The private sector remains cheaper and more affordable than the base.  Rest in the Iron Port is better to think about in advance, because in the season (July-August) there may not be enough places for everyone who wants to warm the bones in the sand of Tavria.  And since demand here immediately raises the price of offers, then it is also worth paying in advance.  This article, built solely on reviews and photos of tourists, will help you choose the right recreation center. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Base rest in the iron port" class="if" height="471" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/970103.jpg" width="585"></div>

    <h2>  Resort Attractions </h2><p>  The settlement of Zalizny Port is located in the Kherson region, in the area in which the center is a town with another interesting name - Gola Pristan.  The resort is spread between the sea and the wide steppe.  The beaches of the Iron Port are golden sand mixed with shells.  A distinctive feature of this coast (at least comparing with Skadovsky) is the absence of coves and bays, as well as a deeper sea.  <span>The color of the water</span> here, like in the ocean, is saturated aquamarine.  Due to the configuration of the coast, the sea is unpredictable here.  Storms are replaced by a calm calm in a couple of hours, cold and warm currents regularly come.  The building of the Iron Port has one feature.  The entire private sector is located away from the sea.  And on the very shore the best recreation centers in the Iron Port lined up next to it.  One side of the village rests on the Black Sea Reserve.  The resort organizes excursions to the iodine-bromide geyser, the salt lake, to the islands of Tendra and Dzharylgach, to Askania Nova, to the ancient city of Olbia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Recreation facilities in the iron port with a pool" class="if" height="317" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/970107.jpg" width="487"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get to the Iron Port? </h2><p>  There is no railway line to the south of the <span>Kherson region</span> where the resort is located.  In summer, a bus runs from the station to the Iron Port itself.  Travel time is a little less than two hours.  On your car you need to follow the road signs, passing Tsyurupinsk and Golaya Pristan.  Much faster and carefree (but also much more expensive) you can get to the resort by taxi.  The car will take you to the very gates of the base.  Rest in the Iron Port is cheerful.  "Kherson Las Vegas" was dubbed the resort by the locals themselves.  And reviews of tourists confirm this.  The resort with its lively nightlife resembles Koblevo <span>(Nikolaev region)</span> or Zatoku (Odessa).  Therefore, if you want a quiet sleep, choose a recreation center away from the so-called boardwalk - the coastal strip in the center of the village.  It is where all the disc clubs, restaurants and other entertainment venues are located. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Recreation center mriya in the iron port" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/970228.jpg" width="480"></div>

    <h2>  <span>Pensions, hotels</span> and guest houses </h2><p>  The tourist infrastructure of the Iron Port is gaining momentum every year.  Now you can’t say that in the 1950s it was an ordinary state farm.  Five kilometers stretched along the sea about fifty boarding houses and family mini-hotels.  In the center are the buildings erected back in the 80s of the last century.  They are surrounded by vast and shady parks.  Newer boarding houses often do not have such territory, but conditions are better in them, often there are pools.  But the best accommodation option, according to reviews, are tourist centers.  Holidays in the Iron Port can be both budget and luxurious.  It all depends on the location and comfort of the room.  From the boarding houses you can recommend “Victoria”, “Vlad”, “Constellation”, “Olbia”, “Vivat”.  Well-established guest houses "Galychanochka", Villa Grande.  As for the tourist centers of the Iron Port, there are more than twenty of them in the resort village.  They are the middle ground between expensive pensions and villas and poor private service.  Which one to choose? </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Recreation facilities in the Iron Port with a swimming pool </h2><p>  For a long time "Kherson Las Vegas" was perceived by the inhabitants of Ukraine as a place of budget and unpretentious rest.  But times are changing, and the Iron Port has acquired boarding houses, hotels and recreation centers with a very decent range of services.  We start our inspection with just such.  On the first line from the sea rises the four-story building of the Dolce Vita boarding house built in 2011.  The room stock - seventy guest rooms of the standard, superior and luxury categories - offers vacationers air conditioning, televisions, refrigerators and other amenities.  Other tourist camps also have a pool.  Rest in the Iron Port will be unforgettable if you choose the "House Caravan".  Only five minutes to the sea from the three-story building.  On the territory of this recreation center there is a cafe with a hookah and live music, parking, a playground, a sauna.  You can arrange three meals a day or cook yourself in the shared kitchen.  Recreation facilities such as Breeze, Paradise and Amulet have their own pools. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Recreation center jasmine in the iron port" class="if" height="408" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/970236.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  "Jasmine" </h2><p>  Reviews very much praise this place, despite the fact that it is remote from the sea.  You need to go to the beach for about ten minutes.  The Jasmine recreation center in the Iron Port is managed by one family, and the atmosphere here is truly sincere.  The owners treat the guests as relatives.  There is an equipped kitchen with everything you need, but reviews highly recommend paying for accommodation with meals: cook Irina is just a sorceress.  Prices for rooms depend on their comfort.  The cheapest (shower and toilet on site) in August cost 60 hryvnia per person.  But even in such a standard 3-4-bed room, there is new furniture and Internet access.  A room of a higher category cost a vacationer this summer a hundred hryvnias.  If food is included in the price, then a day of rest in "Jasmine" per person will cost 200 UAH. </p><h2>  The recreation center "Solar" in the Iron Port </h2>

    <p>  This recreation center is located one hundred and fifty meters from the sea.  Vacationers assure that, despite the central location, the territory of the “Pearl” is quiet at night.  The kitchen for self-cooking is equipped with everything you need, but reviews are advised to pay a meal at the hosts.  The portions here are simply huge, the food is delicious and varied.  Three meals a day are worth 125 hryvnias per person.  On the territory there is barbecue, coals, skewers.  Nearby, fifty meters away, is the village market and the bus terminus.

    <p>  From the Ukrainian language, the name of this recreation center is translated as “dream”.  This place is located right on the beach and a little bit far from the center.  The recreation center "Mriya" in the Iron Port is ideal for families with children, because it is not noisy here, and the sea is a couple of meters away.  Remoteness from the center does not mean isolation from civilization.  Nearby there is a cafe and a grocery store.  The local dining room offers set meals.  The recreation center consists of a two-story building and several wooden apartment houses.  The latter can be with all amenities - toilet, shower, air conditioning.  But there are economical options: just a bedroom and a small kitchen with a refrigerator and a gas stove.  Toilet and showers are on site.  In 2015, budget houses had a 10% discount for students and senior citizens.  The building has rooms with all amenities. </p><h2>  Fly </h2><p>  Recreation center “Fly” in the Iron Port is located in the central part, next to the bus stop “Lyubava”.  Nearby is a market, shops, pharmacy.  To the sea go 350 meters.  The two-story building of the base consists of standard class rooms of various capacities (from two to five people).  All rooms have a bathroom with shower, fan, refrigerator, set of dishes.  Weifai covers the entire territory of the base.  A playground is provided for children.  The parking lot is guarded.  A nice feature of this base is its budget.  Prices range from 75-150 hryvnia for one place.  Reviews also note that the shared kitchen is well-equipped.
