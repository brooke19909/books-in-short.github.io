  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The village of Sosnovoborsk, Penza region</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The working village of Sosnovoborsk, <span>Penza region,</span> is located in the east of the region and is the administrative center of the district of the same name.  Today, a little more than 6000 inhabitants live here, which is 3 thousand less than in 1992.  In the village there are small industrial and agricultural enterprises, educational and cultural institutions. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="53.2936217" data-lng="46.25053439999999" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="8"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/3/4/7/6/3476.png"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Sosnovoborsk (Penza region) is comfortably located in a picturesque hollow between the forested hills.  The river Teshnyar flows through the village, which flows south into the Sura.  Fresh healing air, a balanced climate (warm in summer, snowy in winter) and plenty of greenery are the main assets of the settlement.  The name itself gives rise to images of a pine forest, descended from Shishkin's paintings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="moyaokruga.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="The surroundings of Sosnovoborsk" class="if uuid-2485749" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2485749.jpg"></div><p>  In a straight line to the regional center - 85 km.  However, the road by car will be much longer.  From the center of the village to the outskirts of Penza - about 147 km, about 1.5-2 hours by car.  You can also get an alternative way: by the Penza - Syzran railway with a bus transfer at the Suzyum station.  There is a post office in the village.  The index of Sosnovoborsk in the Penza region is 442571. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Start </h2><p>  The exact time of the foundation of the settlement is not known.  Earlier, dense coniferous forests grew in the vicinity, and the area was inhabited a little.  In the region, there were mainly military and guard outposts and settlements that controlled trade routes.  The largest was the Truevskoye Settlement, laid down by the Cossacks in the 17th century. </p><p>  At the end of the 18th century, rich high-quality pine forests attracted the attention of industrialists and merchants.  Large-scale felling of wood and its alloy to Penza began for the entire processing throughout the Sura River basin.  According to local historians, in 1792, at the confluence of the Alileyka River in Teshnyar, the nobles Chimbasov, Shutov and Major Saburov laid the Sursky farm, where the loggers lived. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mapio.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The village of Sosnovoborsk, Penza region" class="if uuid-2485756" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2485756.jpg"></div><p>  By the middle of the century, a little distance from the farm a place arose, called Neskuchnoe.  In 1839, a cloth factory was built here, which was sold three years later to the landowner Litvinov.  The new owner turned around in full: enlarged production, erected a small dam on Alileyka, concluded profitable contracts for the supply of cloth with the railway and the military. </p><h2>  Further development </h2><p>  The abolition of serfdom greatly influenced economic relations.  The Sursky farm and Neskuchnoe grew so much that they became a single settlement of Litvino.  The village was named after the landowner, who previously owned the local serfs.  Administratively, it belonged to the Gorodishchensky district. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 1877, in the ‚Äúagglomeration‚Äù of Litvino, Shutovka, and Aleksandrovka (which in the future formed the backbone of Sosnovoborsk, Penza region), there were 62 courtyards with half a thousand inhabitants, a factory, an inn and a church.  By 1912, the number of yards exceeded a hundred, which indicates the development of the settlement. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mapio.net" data-author=": , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sosnovoborsk Penza Oblast: photos" class="if uuid-2485759" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2485759.jpg"></div><p>  The advent of Soviet power did not greatly change the local way of life.  The factory continued to work, due to which the village was given the status of a working village in 1928.  In the same year, the Litvinovsky District was formed as part of the Middle Volga (Penza) region. </p><p>  By the beginning of the 1940s, the manufacturing sector expanded due to the creation of a sewing and shoe artel, and its own power station operated.  Social facilities were built.  In the working village there was a mini-hotel, 2 libraries, a hospital, and a secondary school.  Radio dots and telephone lines were installed in the houses.  On the eve of the war, Litvinovo was renamed Sosnovoborsk (Penza Region). </p><h2>  Economy </h2><p>  Today in the village are: </p><ul><li>  butter factory; </li><li>  industrial complex; </li><li>  timber mill; </li><li>  cloth factory "Creator Worker"; </li><li>  Bank branches. </li></ul><h2>  Social and cultural life </h2><p>  Responsible for spiritual development, education and health in the village of Sosnovoborsk, Penza region: </p><ul><li>  primary and two high schools; </li><li>  two nurseries and 3 kindergartens; </li><li>  6 libraries; </li><li>  2 houses of culture; </li><li>  2 paramedic points; </li><li>  polyclinic and district hospital; </li><li>  church; </li><li>  museum of local lore; </li><li>  Center for Children and Youth Creativity; </li><li>  School of Music. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.myshared.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sosnovoborsk Penza Region Index" class="if uuid-2485747" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2485747.jpg"></div><p>  The pride of the district center is the Penza Higher Forest College, where annually about 500 people receive the specialty of economist and forestry technician.  Personnel for local enterprises are prepared by the Sosnovoborsk Technical School No. 36. A more detailed description and photo of Sosnovoborsk in the Penza Region can be found on the administration website. </p>
