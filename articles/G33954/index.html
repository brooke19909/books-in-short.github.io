Montmartre has long been a place of concentration of creativity.  Prospect Saint Germain invariably amazes with luxury and attracts all wealthy people.  La D√©fense is a business district, it can be described as an island of modernity and progress among ancient attractions.  But the Latin Quarter in Paris is a place of concentration for the younger generation, which is behind the future of France. </p><h2>  <span>What is the Latin</span> Quarter and where is it located? </h2><p>  Where is the Latin Quarter in Paris located?  Student streets are located in the sixth and fifth districts of the city, on the left bank of the Seine around the world-famous Sorbonne University.  The quarter got its name from the Latin language, which was used in the Middle Ages.  An interesting fact is that it does not have clear boundaries.  Its center is located between colleges and the Seine. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="48.8513782" data-lng="2.343215299999997" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="15"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/3/0/1/8/3018.png"></div><p>  Nowadays, the very concept of the Latin Quarter is more likely to refer to most of the fifth district, located east of the boulevard Saint-Michel.  Students at nearby universities usually spend time in inexpensive cafes and bistros.  And in the warm season, they move to the <span>Luxembourg Gardens.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Quarter history </h2><p>  Ever since the Middle Ages, the Latin Quarter in Paris has become a haven for representatives of bohemians and intellectuals.  The Sorbonne gave the world many talented scientists, philosophers, representatives of art and literature.  The quarter has become a favorite place for students, educated people and thinkers.  Initially, the Latin quarter was called only a small area on which the Sorbonne was located.  But later the borders expanded significantly to other educational institutions.  And the definition itself has become a symbol of campuses around the world.  The charm of the quarter was so liked by many residents that it became very popular.  Currently, few students can rent an apartment in this area. </p><h2>  How to get to the Latin Quarter in Paris? </h2><p>  Where exactly the Latin Quarter is located is difficult to say even for local residents, since this is not an administrative unit.  Its territory is of uncertain size.  In general, you need to focus on the hill of St. Genevieve. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.meetmeout.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Latin Quarter Streets" class="if uuid-2455832" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2455832.jpg"></div><p>  The Latin Quarter in Paris is a historical concept, not an administrative one.  Therefore, if you plan to visit it, then you should pay attention to the territory around the Sorbonne, because the area does not have clear boundaries. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  How to get to the Latin Quarter in Paris?  Two most convenient options can be recommended: </p><ol><li>  Take the metro line 10. Exit at Cluny-la-Sorbonne Station. </li><li>  From Notre Dame you can walk along one of the bridges (across the island of Cit√©).  Locals recommend the San Michel Bridge.  Crossing it, you will find yourself in one of the most interesting places of the quarter - on the famous Boulevard of San Michel, which is incredibly popular among the Parisians themselves.  Walking along it, you will quickly reach the Sorbonne Square. </li></ol><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  If you want to see the famous area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city and not miss anything, it might be worth ordering a tour of the Latin Quarter in Paris.  Experienced guides will show you all the sights and tell about their history.  At your request, travel companies can create a personalized program for you based on your wishes.  Excursions can be individual and group. </p><p>  You can also book a private guide who will be with you throughout your stay in Paris. </p><h2>  Sorbonne </h2><p>  You can start your tour of the Latin Quarter in Paris with the Sorbonne, which is the heart of the area.  The story of the appearance of the main institution is as follows ... Louis the Ninth somehow drew attention to a canon named Roberto de Sorbona.  He soon made him his confessor.  With the support of the monarch, Robert recruited his own students, and later organized a spiritual college for students from poor families, financed from the state treasury. </p><p>  Currently, the Sorbonne includes thirteen universities, which study the most diverse areas in science.  Four institutions are located in historic buildings, all the rest are in other areas or even in the suburbs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sorbonne in Paris" class="if uuid-2455833" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2455833.jpg"></div><p>  The Sorbonne became very popular in the fourteenth century, when a split occurred in the church.  In the sixteenth century, she teamed up with the theology department of the University of Paris.  During its existence, the Sorbonne has released from its walls many future architects, poets, philosophers.  Already closer to our times, the institution has completely transformed.  People wise in life began to gather here, who led discussions about the key points of politics and various sciences. </p><p>  No less progressive were the students of the institution.  In 1968, students staged a riot, demanding a change in the education system.  The police tried to disperse them, but the students did not disperse.  The confrontation lasted for some time, after which the uprising took effect, and gradually the education system was significantly changed. </p><p>  On the campus is the Sorbonne chapel, created by Cardinal Richelieu. </p><h2>  Subway station </h2><p>  The list of attractions of the Latin Quarter in Paris should include the metro platform on the tenth branch of the Cluny-Sorbonne.  She first earned in 1930.  But after the outbreak of war, it was closed.  It was again opened for the carriage of passengers in 1988.  The station got its name from the University of Sorbonne and the Cluny Museum.  She is distinguished by her unusual appearance.  The high arches are decorated with a blue-red flame, on which are painted the paintings of famous citizens who once lived in the Latin Quarter of Paris. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Paris metro station" class="if uuid-2455838" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2455838.jpg"></div><p>  Among them are the comedian Moliere, the monarchs Philippe Augustus and Henry the Fourth, the poet Baudelaire, the architect Souflo, the playwright Racine and others.  Below the walls are lined with white tiles, on which the name of the station flaunts.  Gray granite benches are placed on the platforms.  The author of the project was Jean Bazin, who believed that the station building has a certain atmosphere that is conducive to thought. </p><h2>  Saint Michel Square </h2><p>  What to see in the Latin Quarter in Paris?  You should definitely take a walk along Saint-Michel Square, which is the most vibrant place in the area.  From it originates the boulevard, on which there are numerous cafes and shops.  On it you can find on sale any books.  This place is a real holiday for used books. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripsavvy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Latin Quarter Cafe" class="if uuid-2455870" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2455870.jpg"></div><p>  Unique volumes of literature are sold directly under the open sky.  Colorful sellers are able to tell a lot of interesting things to their customers.  The boulevard itself is a local attraction. </p><h2>  Museum of the Middle Ages </h2><p>  Continuing the conversation about the sights of the Latin Quarter in Paris, it is worth recalling the old Cluny Museum.  Within its walls is now a <span>museum of the Middle Ages.</span>  It differs from other similar institutions in that it is away from modernity.  Its entire appearance has remained unchanged since the nineteenth century.  Inside the building there are no cafes and other additional organizations that are part of the entertainment industry. </p><p>  The museum has one feature.  Its exposition lacks the orderliness and systematization that are inherent in such institutions.  A collection of oddities designed for simple human curiosity.  The collections of the institution are largely unique, and therefore deserve the attention of guests. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.parisinfo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum of the Middle Ages" class="if uuid-2455855" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2455855.jpg"></div><p>  Once upon a time, Roman baths were located on the site of the Cluny Museum, some of which have survived to this day.  In the fourteenth century, the Cluny Abbey was built in their place.  In the future, the mansion was repeatedly rebuilt, therefore, in its style there are elements of Gothic and Renaissance.  During the redevelopment, a lot of unnecessary elements appeared - blind alleys, stairs to nowhere and more.  Subsequently, the building was confiscated and for thirty years was used differently. </p><p>  The history of the museum itself begins around 1933, when the private collection of the Renaissance of Alexander du Sommer was placed in the walls of the mansion.  After the death of the owner of the meeting, the state bought the collection from relatives.  Since then, the museum has become state.  Within its walls you can see statues of biblical kings, unique tapestries of the Middle Ages, fabrics, trellises. </p><h2>  Pantheon Construction History </h2><p>  A walk in Paris is simply unthinkable without exploring the Latin Quarter.  One of its main attractions is the Pantheon.  At one time, the architectural monument was negatively perceived by local residents, for today it can be safely called one of the symbols of Paris.  The Pantheon has changed many owners, at different times in history its purpose has changed, as a result, he became the tomb of famous personalities. </p><p>  The construction of the building was started in 1744.  In those distant times, Louis XV was about to take part in the battle with his troops, but the disease mowed him.  Many believed that the king‚Äôs life was coming to an end.  But the monarch did not give up, praying to Saint Genevieve, he promised to build a temple in her honor.  Soon, Louis recovered, but his favorite died.  At first, grief, and then state affairs did not leave the monarch with the strength to design the temple.  And yet the king did not forget his promise.  After 11 years, on his orders, the architect Souflo set to work on the project.  At first, the Catholic Church opposed the project, so the author had to change its shape, making the temple more like a Catholic basilica. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cityzeum.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pantheon in Paris" class="if uuid-2455862" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2455862.jpg"></div><p>  The first stone was solemnly laid by Louis XV in 1764.  Construction took 25 years.  The main difficulties arose precisely with financing.  When the temple was almost finished, cracks were discovered in the pillars that supported the vault.  An entire commission was created, which nevertheless decided that the construction was carried out correctly, so the problem lies in the poor construction of the pillars themselves, which need to be redone. </p><h2>  The fate of the Cathedral of St. Genevieve </h2><p>  Louis XV himself and Souflo himself did not see the Cathedral of St. Genevieve ready-made.  Both of them had already passed away by then.  Shortly after completion of the construction, a revolution began.  Many temples of Paris were plundered.  But the Cathedral of St. Genevieve was not touched.  True, by that time he was already the Pantheon.  The revolutionaries decided that it should become the burial place of real heroes.  Soon, burials began to appear in underground galleries.  Here were Russo, Voltaire, Marat. </p><p>  Having come to power, Napoleon restored the status of the church to the church, so he again became the Cathedral of St. Genevieve.  But the role of the tomb was left for him.  True, the next revolution again made the building a Pantheon. </p><p>  Initially, the Parisians accepted the new building with hostility, since they had long been accustomed to Baroque buildings.  But the architect Souflo decided to move away from the old traditions and bring something new to the face of Paris.  In the design of the temple, he combined at once four styles: Greek, Romanesque, Gothic and Baroque.  An interesting fact is that now architects believe that the building is made in a classic style. </p><h2>  Cafes and restaurants </h2><p>  Cafes and restaurants in the Latin Quarter of Paris, according to many tourists who have been here, have a special atmosphere.  Each institution has its own permanent audience, as well as its culinary and cultural features.  If you want to take part in literary conversations, then you should visit Brasserie Balzar. </p><p>  Proponents of classic Middle Ages cuisine can visit the Chez Rene Bistro to taste a rooster in wine.  But in the institution Coco de Meu it is worth trying dishes of the freshest fish, which are delivered from the Seychelles.  The cafe de la Mosquee near the mosque offers not only Arabic dishes, but also the opportunity to visit a real Turkish hammam. </p><h2>  Paris Bakeries </h2><p>  In the Latin Quarter of Paris, bakeries are another attraction.  All tourists recommend looking into one of them.  During a walk around Paris, you can eat delicious pastries in them.  The most famous bakery quarter is La Parisienne.  Any Parisian will show you the way to it.  The range of pastries in it simply defies any description.  All guests recommend tasting branded croissants, which can be safely called the creation of local confectioners.  Currently, you can find up to 20 of their varieties.  Each of them has its own special taste.  The Parisians themselves simply adore croissants stuffed with pieces of chocolate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Latin Quarter Bakery" class="if uuid-2455879" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2455879.jpg"></div><p>  Travelers note that the range of pastries is not limited to croissants.  In the pastry shops you will be offered a variety of delights: shuket, pies, eclairs, mini-tarts and other sweets.  No less diverse pastries with meat, vegetable or fish fillings.  Visit any bakery in Paris and you will never forget its amazing flavor. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  According to tourists, the Latin Quarter in Paris is a place that is definitely worth a visit.  Without visiting here, you simply will not feel the unique atmosphere that is characteristic of the city.  Even local cafes can be safely ranked among the sights.  Before visiting the quarter, you should buy a card that will help you orient yourself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Saint Michel Square" class="if uuid-2455848" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2455848.jpg"></div><p>  Tourists note that a lot of time needs to be spent on visiting local attractions.  It is simply impossible to see all the most interesting at a time, but there is always an incentive to return here again. </p>
