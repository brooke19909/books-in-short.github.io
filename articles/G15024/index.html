You can use the opinions of vacationers as a more detailed description of Larisa 4 *.  For the convenience of readers, we divide the reviews into topics: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  General impressions of the hotel. </li><li>  The rooms. </li><li>  Food at the hotel. </li><li>  Beach. </li><li>  Animation. </li><li>  The work of the staff. </li><li>  The work of hotel guides. </li><li>  Paid services. </li></ul><h2>  General hotel experience </h2><p>  According to the vast majority of guests, the hotel "Larisa" <span>(Beldibi, Turkey) is</span> very <em> </em>  cozy and welcoming.  The greatest impression is made by nature, pleasing the eye with its magnificent views.  Throughout the territory it is clean, green, banana, lime, pomegranate, fig and orange trees, very neat and well-groomed lawns grow.  All plants are watered daily, the gardener is very diligent in his work.  From any place on the territory of the hotel offers a gorgeous view of the mountains.  Most tourists who have experience in other hotels in Turkey rated Larisa higher than five-star complexes. </p><p>  In the lobby there is a good Internet signal, at the peak of the heat and before eating, vacationers often "sit" in their gadgets. </p><p>  Those who are going to go there with young children and strollers should know that the hotel does not have an elevator.  Guests staying in a bungalow appreciated the convenience of having a playground nearby. </p><p>  The pool is clean and well maintained, but the water in it is cold, so it was often empty. </p><p>  Around the hotel there is an abundance of needles: <span>Lebanese cedars,</span> junipers, pines, creating incredibly clean and fragrant air. </p>

    <h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  The rooms of the Larisa 4 * hotel (Beldibi) are in the buildings and separately - the so-called bungalows.  The guests who settled in the high-rise building were impressed by the views from the balcony, especially from the apartments on the third floor - they were breathtaking from the mountain landscape.  There are only three rooms with a view of the wall throughout the hotel.  Those who got the bungalows were pleased with the peace and quiet, achieved by remoteness from the main building.  There are almost no complaints about cleaning and changing clothes.  There were isolated cases when they claimed that without a tip they clean poorly and do not change towels.  The quality of furniture and plumbing is satisfactory, although some had something to complain about.  Settlement, according to reviews, was fast and almost always without problems.  If guests arrived early, they were immediately sent to eat at the restaurant and the beach so that their expectation was not tedious. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  According to tourists, there were 2 significant shortcomings in the hotel's food: not enough meat and a meager assortment of breakfast dishes.  The rest of the buffet is commendable.  By summarizing the reviews of nutrition in Larisa, you can make an objective detailed description of it, and everyone will decide for himself whether it meets personal needs. </p><p>  Breakfast included a variety of pastries, jams, honey, cereals, lean cereals, variations of egg dishes (not every day), soy sausages, cheeses, coffee, tea, milk, fruit powder drinks. </p><p>  Lunches and dinners for an assortment of dishes are approximately the same: </p><ul><li>  mashed soups that deserve a lot of good reviews; </li><li>  chicken or fish in different versions (adult tourists and their children especially liked the fish); </li><li>  sometimes - lamb with vegetables, goulash; </li><li>  offal: hearts, navels, liver; </li><li>  side dishes: potatoes, pasta, rice, vegetables: raw, steamed, grilled, stewed, fried;  mushrooms and legumes; </li><li>  many types of salted cheeses, which most vacationers found very tasty; </li><li>  all kinds of greens; </li><li>  olives; </li><li>  various pastries; </li><li>  a wide range of fruits: apples, tangerines, peaches, watermelons, melons, nectarines, grapes; </li><li>  many kinds of desserts; </li><li>  a small number of dishes in the children's menu. </li></ul><p>  The guests expressed their admiration for the layout of the products - very creative, real "pictures" of food. </p><p>  The hotel administration allowed taking food to the rooms and in the courtyard there were tables on wheels for dirty plates, so that they would not create discomfort for vacationers, remaining in the rooms.  Such loyalty of the hotel staff was very beneficial for families with small children, they took fruits for snacks.  At the same time, some guests were indignant at the greed of their neighbors who dialed a huge number of fruits and threw them spoiled into the ballot boxes the next day. </p><p>  An afternoon snack (pastries and gingerbread cookies), according to tourists, is very modest. </p><p>  Drinks evoked different impressions.  Coffee and milk deserve praise, some liked alcohol, others suspected that it was diluted.  Beer and wine deserved good marks.  The assortment, in general, was wide, but someone lacked it, and these tourists rested in bars with their own alcoholic drinks. </p><p>  It should be noted that many vacationers feared the Koksaki virus, which was often mentioned in the news in the summer months of 2017.  But there was not a single case of illness in this hotel from July to August. </p><p>  Despite the compliance / non-compliance of the hotel food with the taste preferences of each individual guest, all the guests agree that it is impossible to stay hungry here. </p>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The distance to the beach is about 150 meters, and the road to it brought pleasure to vacationers because of the natural beauties.  According to reviews, the promenade is very beautiful, near the picturesque Ataturk Park.  The beach itself is spacious, it is possible to relax in the shade of umbrellas, litter bins are installed.  If cleanliness was imperfect, then, according to vacationers, they themselves are to blame.  Sun beds are enough for everyone at any time of the day. </p><p>  The sea is crystal clear, warm, affectionate, the entrances are cleared, although there have been cases of injuries on stones. </p><p>  There is no hotel free bar on the beach, you can drink and eat for money in a cafe. </p><p>  Nearby is a wild beach, which was liked by absolutely everyone who managed to visit there.  You can get to it for a fee on a banana or on foot - the distance is very small.  Guests of this hotel unanimously recommend everyone to visit it. </p>

Animation is divided into daytime (exercise, yoga on the lawn) and evening. </p><p>  After dinner, guests are offered the following activities: </p><ul><li>  <em>Disco for children</em> - the program is the same every day, but this does not prevent the kids from being delighted with it. </li><li>  <em>Adult animation</em> - fire shows, belly dancing, "Mrs. and Miss Hotel" - shows do not repeat throughout the week.

    <h2>  Staff work </h2><p>  The quality of the hotel staff pleasantly surprised the guests.  They are attentive, prompt, show, agree on a hammam and quickly solve problems.  Everyone speaks Russian. </p><p>  The restaurant workers deserved especially kind words - very nice, neat and attentive guys, trying to do everything for the comfort of guests.  They clean the guests at the restaurant right away, run around, fuss.  Therefore, the tables are always clean and food supplies are replenished. </p><p>  The guests were pleasantly surprised by the love of the staff for their work and the ease with which he coped with the work.  Often, employees were seen singing while performing their duties, which greatly touched the guests. </p><h2>  Hotel guides </h2><p>  Among the positive assessments, dissatisfaction with the work of hotel guides stands out.  They have many complaints related to intrusive attempts to sell excursions much more expensive than on the beach or in an agency.  The difference in price among different tourists ranged from 10 to 50%. </p><p>  A travel agency right near the exit from the Larisa Hotel (Beldibi, Kemer) left pleasant memories for holidaymakers due to the quality of its service and the variety of excursions on offer. </p>

    <h2>  Paid Services </h2><p>  The hammam earned the praise of the vacationers.  A very diligent master works in it, who professionally talks about various diseases and their prevention, makes wellness massages.  Hammam treatments are recommended at the start of your vacation for a better tan. </p><p>  Guests are advised to definitely visit the gift shop at the hotel - here are the lowest prices in Turkey, a friendly and generous host. </p><p>  For more serious shopping, tourists recommend going to Antalya or Kemer, since the range of goods in the small village of Beldibi is very limited.  Recommended purchases include Turkish textiles, leather and fur, jewelry. </p><p>  Animators at the end of the disco in the hotel cafe offer trips to a night club in Kemer.  Those who have been there, note that the discos are excellent, there are a lot of people, the programs are interesting, they are advised to go there at least once for a vacation. </p><p>  All the above information leaves no doubt: the Larisa Hotel in Beldibi is a great place to relax in all respects.  Many reviews of tourists contain warm words addressed to the hotel staff and promises to return here again.  Almost everyone was sorry to go home. </p>
