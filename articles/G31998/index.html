Mobile phone with large buttons for seniors</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In our age of speed and technological achievement, despite the fact that life has become much more comfortable, older people have incredibly difficult.  With some certainty, it can be argued that mobile communication as such for single old people or people with disabilities is a kind of salvation.  The inevitable aging process makes itself felt in various forms of its manifestation.  Most often, in elderly people, visual acuity decreases and hearing is dulled.  It is in such cases that the phone with large buttons can be considered the most convenient to use.  It is about such gadgets that will be discussed in the framework of this article, as well as about many other things that one way or another must be provided for in the process of choosing and buying a cellular device for a senior citizen. </p><h2>  The usual thing </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Phone with big buttons" class="if" height="494" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/547733.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Many of us heard from the lips of our elderly parents that the phone we donated was not very convenient: small keys, a too bright or dull screen, incomprehensible and extremely confusing navigation.  In general, the operational moment in this case is far from the ‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù value.  That is why our old people can not always reach us, or an urgent call is delayed in terms of its implementation due to the fault of the above technical reasons.  Meanwhile, a cell phone with large buttons, a monochrome screen and a simple menu can nullify all the inconveniences and difficulties.  Let's look at some ‚Äúage-friendly‚Äù mobile devices, as well as determine the preponderance of a choice. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  So, the new ‚Äúgrandmother‚Äù, convenient in every way ... </h2><p>  You might ask, ‚ÄúWhy not the old one?‚Äù  It is difficult to disagree, since before they really released a lot of modifications, the design feature of which was precisely the large buttons, a monochrome screen and a simple menu.  Moreover, even today you can meet, so to speak, such retro units as <span>Nokia 3310</span> or Siemens A55.  However, it is hardly possible to find a new (fully functional) battery on ‚Äúsuper-reliable‚Äù mobile devices that have been discontinued long ago.  The owner of "short-term availability on the network", to put it mildly, you will not envy.  And what kind of comfort to talk about when the charging socket constantly breaks or the charger does not withstand the intensity of use!  As you know, it‚Äôs easier to buy a new device than dooming a pensioner to torment with old electronics.  That‚Äôs why we‚Äôll dwell on the modern solution to the ‚Äúmobile problem‚Äù of the <span>elderly.</span> </p><h2>  Optimal size </h2><p>  Often a large mobile phone with buttons is the most suitable communication device for a senior citizen.  And there is an explanation for this: </p>

    <ul><li>  In the case when a person does not remember where he put it, it is much easier to find a large thing than a miniature "little thing", which is compactly arranged in the upholstery gap of the sofa. </li><li>  A moderate-sized phone is more comfortable to hold in your hand.  At the same time, tactile sensations from pressing naturally reacting keys are preferable for an aged person than the process of aiming at the microelements of the control panel. </li><li>  With age, retirees lose coordination.  A large mobile phone with buttons solves this problem. </li></ul><h2>  Color or monochrome? </h2><p>  Not always a black and white option is a mandatory argument in favor of a suitable choice for a pensioner.  Often, the right color scheme is much more pleasing to the eye than the two-tone ‚Äúgray‚Äù.  However, it all depends on the preferences of the future owner.  After all, looking at the sent MMS-photo on a bright and colorful screen, and even in high resolution, is undoubtedly better than looking at the dull shades of a monochrome image.  Of course, the simplicity of the device implies some functional limitations.  Therefore, often for the sake of practicality, a phone with large buttons is equipped with a small black and white screen, the brightness and contrast of which are easily adjustable. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  This is the most common version of "visualization" in cellular devices of this type.  It is worth noting that the color realism of the picture requires significant energy consumption, which does not always correspond to the general purpose of the use of devices such as "grandmothers".  Of course, low-functional cellular devices equipped with a black-and-white display are capable of staying active for quite some time.  The standby time under this condition can generally be calculated in a week.  Therefore, you should still adhere to the middle ground.  And if preferences are given to the color image, then the manufacturability of the display should correspond to the value of "energy-efficient", and the battery should be maximized. </p><h2>  High functionality </h2><p>  A touch-screen phone with large buttons on the screen (virtual keyboard) is most preferred for the elderly, whose needs cannot be met by the standard of truncated simplicity.  To date, the market for mobile products has a fairly large assortment of such "grandmothers" whose functionality allows you to: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  Take pictures and video. </li><li>  Listen to music. </li><li>  Enter the Internet. </li><li>  Make video calls (Skype). </li><li>  Watch television through the built-in TV receiver. </li></ul><p>  Such a "grandmother" phone with large buttons will be appreciated by your elderly parents.  Indeed, to everything else, the device can be controlled by voice commands, it is able to read messages and will always tell you that it must be connected to a charger.  So, as you can see, no one forgets about ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù pensioners! </p><h2>  The ultimate no-frills standard </h2>

    <p>  It is worth noting that the above-described version of the ‚Äúgrandmother‚Äù, although it has a high-capacity battery, will still be discharged much faster than a device ‚Äúsharpened‚Äù for a specific purpose - maximum simplicity and comfort in use.  Therefore, for most pensioners it will be quite enough if: </p><ul><li>  A phone with large buttons, the photo of which you see above, will have a large marking of the keys. </li><li>  A large font will be displayed. </li><li>  The ringtone is loud enough. </li><li>  The sound from the auditory speaker (speaker) is high-quality, without extraneous noise. </li><li>  In the modification there is a button "SOS". </li><li>  As an additional functionality - a flashlight. </li><li>  The installed battery has a high capacity. </li></ul><h2>  Brand "grandmothers" </h2><p>  A cell phone with large buttons - such a device can be considered convenient and at the same time easy to manage.  In addition, ‚Äútactile mechanics‚Äù is more reliable and less energy-intensive than sensory technology.  Therefore, in the process of choosing a mobile communication tool for your elderly parents, grandfathers or grandmothers, focus on these options: more stable and time-tested.  Today there are not many manufacturers of cellular devices that specifically specialize in the production of "grandmothers."  However, their products have a number of differences.  However, you can easily make a choice.  After all, you know the preferences of your relatives. </p><h2>  Russian teXet </h2><p>  A phone with large buttons, the price of which can vary from 1,000 to 3,000 rubles, today virtually every pensioner can afford.  Ergonomic design and practical casing combine with operational simplicity and complemented by affordable cost.  Advertising must be true above all, and a Russian company proves the truth of this statement in each of its products.  Today, for the elderly, the company produces a sufficient number of modifications, among which the teXet TM-B111 phone can be highlighted. </p>

    <ul><li>  Monochrome TFT display with a resolution of 128x64 pixels. </li><li>  Loud speaker and powerful vibromotor. </li><li>  Emergency key for five numbers. </li><li>  Built-in flashlight. </li></ul><p>  A phone with large teXet buttons is incredibly practical.  The keys are easy to press.  Due to the reasonableness of the location, shape and composition of the material from which the buttons are made, the fingers do not slip.  The menu is elementary in understanding, and its optimally selected functionality makes it possible to solve the necessary tasks with special ease.  Large text does not complicate the process of reading SMS, and soft backlighting does not irritate the eye.  Voice guidance will incredibly facilitate the poorly seeing pensioner dialing process.  The SOS button located on the rear panel of the device allows the user to enter the <span>emergency call</span> menu and instantly make a call or send SMS to the desired number.  Nothing more, just the most necessary for a stable and reliable connection. </p><h2>  Finnish NOKIA </h2><p>  Cheap phones with big buttons are not a definition of a low-quality product.  Since the line of budget cell phones from the world famous Nokia brand - in particular 1100, 1101, 1200, 1208, 1280 - is, first of all, durability in use and the ascetic minimum of functionality.  The devices are easy to maintain, and the time (duration) of their battery life deserves all praise.  The intellectually clear menu does not cause any difficulties in the process of work, the user accurately finds the necessary option in the phone‚Äôs functionality.  Any of the above mobile devices will become an indispensable means of communication for a pensioner.  Low price, paradoxically, corresponds to high quality - this is a Nokia phone! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Telephone" class="if" height="479" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/547735.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  With big buttons from China </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the Middle Kingdom is often associated with low-quality stamping, it still makes sense to turn its eyes to some mobile devices of Asian origin.  Of course, do not forget that the cell phone for a pensioner must be reliable.  Therefore, before you acquire this or that modification, you need to devote some amount of time to studying the subject of your curiosity.  User reviews, comments left on thematic forums will help you make the right choice.  Do not forget that when buying a mobile device in special electronics stores, you will in advance secure yourself from acquiring low-quality goods. </p><h2>  Phillips Phone </h2><p>  With large buttons, devices of the specified company abound.  Nevertheless, the <span>Philips Xenium X2301</span> model can be considered the best option <span>.</span>  At a relatively low cost, this communication device is ideal for the elderly.  If you purchase this smartphone, and that is exactly what X2301 is, then the owner will find a lot of pleasant additions.  The device is equipped with a docking station, which means that the charging process is simplified, since you no longer need to connect a separate memory and ‚Äúaim‚Äù in a dedicated slot of the device.  Just insert the phone into the dock connector and the charging process is activated automatically.  In this modification, there is a camera, but the resolution of 0.3 MP is somewhat upsetting, but the power button of the video finder located under the optics in a strange way will again pleasantly impress you.  In general, matte black plastic has a lot of mysteries.  However, only a few of them are somewhat alarming, the rest of the brand, as always, is on top. </p>

Alcatel, already familiar to you, has released a modernized version of teXet TM-B416 this year.  The external panel (closed state of the device) is equipped with active light indicators: incoming message, call, charging indicator and current status of the alarm mode.  Another innovation was the 1.3 MP integrated camera, which is also located on the front of the case.  Now the device supports two SIM cards.  An FM radio is provided for listening to radio stations.  Communication capabilities are enhanced by activating the Bluetooth module.  This model is available in two colors: black and dark red.  It will not be superfluous to mention the next "brainchild" of the British company Fly, which this year came in second place in smartphone sales in Russia.  This is a phone with large buttons Fly Ezzy Trendy, also a clamshell due to its design features.  The front of the case is equipped with a front display and a camera with a resolution of 1.2 MP.  The main, however, as well as the secondary screen, is made using TFT technology.  Color reproduction is quite high-quality and even in bright light the graphics are clearly distinguishable.  Large font, SOS key, flashlight, support for two SIM cards are also present in the presented model, as well as in the above device.  It is worth noting that the cost of the "Briton" is almost identical to the price of the Russian teXet TM-B416.  Therefore, you decide which modification to give your preference. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Before you give your family a convenient and reliable phone, it would probably be wiser to go to a specialty store together with your favorite ‚Äúsenior citizens‚Äù and gently try out a few ‚Äúgrandmothers‚Äù.  After all, a rashly made choice may not at all correspond to the expected results.  As a result, the color display may well become an irritant for sore eyes, and the sound that sounds quite loud to you - a "mosquito squeak" for grandma or grandpa.  However, if you are sure that your gift will correspond to the proper result, please the old people! </p>
