    <h2>  Pavlovsk, the history of the city </h2><p>  The city of Pavlovsk in the St. Petersburg suburban area is located just a few kilometers from Tsarskoye Selo, the terrain is flat, with small gentle hills.  Between the hills there are lakes; untouched forests grow on the territory.  The Slavyanka River, which flows into the Neva, became an additional argument in favor of laying the city, in those days, the river water was clean and suitable for the needs of the population.  So the place was chosen for the construction of the city of Pavlovsk.  St. Petersburg - represented by the Governor General - supported the project and construction began. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Pavlovskaya Sloboda was built up with straight streets and inhabited by court people, ministers, artisans and peasants - the whole people are about 300 people on both sides of Slavyanka.  They also built the stone church of St. Mary, a free school for children and a large <span>stable yard.</span> </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Pavlovskaya fortress, a famous fortification, with fortifications that have fallen into decay since the time of the war with the Swedes, was restored by Paul I for military activities of army officers who lived in the fortress.  There were also soldiers' barracks.  There was in Pavlovsk a house for the disabled of the marine corps of Russia with 30 seats, which was fully provided in accordance with the tsar's decree. </p><p>  There was a charity hospital for a simple people with 26 beds - for women and men, with free treatment.  And finally, a military hospital with 40 beds was functioning, which was regularly visited by Paul I. </p>

    <h2>  Construction stages </h2><p>  The first stage of the construction of the palace park began in 1782, under the patronage of the architect Charles Cameron at the site of the wooden chambers Paulust.  Initially, the palace was an ordinary noble estate with commercial buildings and a relatively small park.  However, Paul I, for whom, in fact, the palace complex was being built, did not agree with the architect Cameron regarding the scale of the park and the palace itself, the future emperor wanted more impressive sizes.  And after many disputes and even conflicts with the heir to the throne, Cameron had to change his approach and expand the territory of construction.  In the fall of 1782, the main building of the palace was already standing and side galleries were being completed. </p><h2>  The final version of the residence of the emperor </h2><p>  Immediately after the coronation of Paul I to reign (in 1796), the newly-made emperor ordered to radically rebuild his summer palace, expand its premises as much as possible and equip nearby territories with the latest European fashion.  The lead project was entrusted to the architect Vincenzo Brenna.  Over the next four years, the Pavlovsk Palace was completely rebuilt. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  The Tsar‚Äôs office was located in the new palace, and with his first decree, the emperor annexed to Pavlovsk the nearby villages - Fedorovsky Posad, Tyarlyovo, Krasnoye Selo and Lipitsy along with the lands and peasants.  And the city received city rule, headed by the chief administrator, by royal decree.  Since then, the palace began rich receptions with balls.  However, the emperor did not manage to live in his summer residence; on March 12, 1801 he was killed by the conspirators. </p><h2>  Pavlovsk after Paul I </h2><p>  After the death of Emperor Paul I, his widow Maria Fyodorovna remained to live in Pavlovsk.  Over the 27 years of her reign, the city and the park, and especially the palace botanical garden, have reached an unprecedented peak.  When the empress died in 1828, Pavlovsk ceased to exist as a royal residence.  The city turned into the patrimony of the younger brother of Nicholas I, Prince Mikhail Pavlovich, who cherished the prosperity of Pavlovsk, handed out plots of land around the city for building neighborhoods, paid much attention to landscaping.  Under Mikhail Petrovich, a charity children's shelter and a free primary school appeared. </p>

    <h2>  Railway </h2><p>  The city of Pavlovsk and Tsarskoye Selo in 1836 were connected by the first Russian railway with a length of only a few kilometers, but its significance was historical.  At first the ‚Äúpiece of iron‚Äù was horse drawn, and soon steam locomotives began to walk on it.  The trips were fun and free.  For trains, the Pavlovsky Station was built, which later turned into a music venue and became the venue for world-class concerts.  It was conducted by the maestro Johann Strauss himself.  The railway was completed, and in the autumn of 1837 trains were already bringing passengers from St. Petersburg. </p><p>  <span>St. Petersburg</span> - Pavlovsk, or Pavlovsk - St. Petersburg ... How to get there?  This issue quickly lost its relevance with the advent of the railway.  The residence city of the Russian tsars gradually turned into a fashionable suburb for summer residents from St. Petersburg.  In a short time, through the efforts of Prince Mikhail Pavlovich, the city appeared: a theater, a meteorological observatory, an art gallery and a public library. </p><p>  In 1902, another railway line was laid, in the Vindavo-Rybinsk direction, which passed along the Tsarskoye Selo section of the railway to Tyarlyovo, and from Tyarlyovo to St. Petersburg.  Soon, almost the entire intelligentsia of St. Petersburg began to visit Pavlovsk and cost cottages on the banks of the Slavyanka.  In 1874, the city government issued 323 permits for the construction of country houses. </p>
