  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Who is a promoter. Such a mysterious profession</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In modern society, there is a demand for professions that were not in demand before.  Who is such a promoter, not everyone knows.  However, one has to hear about such a profession more and more often.  Therefore, let's talk about what the promoter does and what are his responsibilities. </p><p>  The promoter is engaged in the promotion of goods or services.  He works directly with each client.  This position is necessary in stores, at exhibitions or presentations. </p><p>  When a <span>new product</span> arrives on the market <span>, the</span> promoter communicates product information to visitors and customers.  He answers their questions, provides them <span>with brochures,</span> product samples, talks about the product and shows it in action. </p><p>  Not everyone knows who such a promoter is, but many have encountered his work.  The main task of a person in this profession is to attract a buyer and make him interested in a new product or service. </p><p>  Such a position may be on the staff of any company that produces goods or services.  Usually he is hired for the duration of the promotion and paid for his work for every day.  If the work is done well and the product has found its potential buyers, then additional remuneration may be paid.  In the event that the promoter could not identify and find customers who may be interested in a product or service, fines for outstanding work await him. </p><p>  We decided who such a promoter is.  Now we will analyze the pros and cons of this profession. </p><p>  The promoter has a <span>free schedule.</span>  He is busy for the duration of the campaign and has an hourly pay.  There are good career growth opportunities.  That is, a company can take a promoter for a permanent job, because such promotion of <span>goods and services</span> among consumers is very effective. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But, like every profession, the work of a promoter has several disadvantages.  The most important drawback is temporary employment, and accordingly, the inconsistency of earnings.  You have to work under any circumstances and sometimes under any weather conditions.  Almost all the time you need to spend on your feet, which is a little tiring. </p><p>  After we find out who such a promoter is, we need to decide on the data that he should possess.  Mostly young people are taken to this position.  Very often this is a side job for students, which can be combined with study.  The promoter must have a presentable appearance, have a <span>neat appearance,</span> be sociable and be able to attract people to communicate.  The presence of defiant makeup, flashy accessories is not desirable.  The promoter should inspire confidence among <span>potential customers, the</span> desire to communicate.  Therefore, it must be an open person, sociable and friendly.  Additional requirements for behavior and appearance may be made by the customer.  Perhaps this will be the company's branded clothing or some piece of advertising. </p><p>  Having all of the above requirements, you can hold the position of promoter without having a special education.  There are preparatory courses that will teach you to navigate in any non-standard situation, talk about products and the necessary appearance. </p><p>  The promoter must have a good vocabulary and excellent diction.  This is due to the fact that his job is to constantly communicate with people.  He should be able to convey information to a potential consumer so as to arouse his interest. </p><p>  Now that you know who these promoters are, perhaps this profession will become of interest to you.  It can be used as extra income.  But first, think about whether you really possess the qualities necessary for this work. </p>
