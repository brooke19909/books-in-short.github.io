This region has long been called the "Golden Coast" of Spain.  The resort got its name because of the color of fine sand, shining in the sun, like gold.  Such a wonderful comparison gives us an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe beauty of the local beaches. </p><h2>  A bit about the resort ... </h2><p>  Every year, the famous resorts of the Costa Daurada attract many tourists: there is a shallow and warm sea, and there are slightly more sunny days during the year than in other regions of Spain.  Many kilometers of beaches have excellent infrastructure.  A lot of shops, hotels, entertainment centers, restaurants, bars and cafes, nightclubs and discos are built along the coast. </p>

    <p>  For those who have chosen the all-inclusive system, for breakfast, lunch and dinner, all drinks are served free of charge.  But half-board, for example, drinks are not included, they must be paid separately. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Complex infrastructure </h2><p>  The hotel has a 24-hour reception.  There is a main restaurant and a poolside bar on site.  If necessary, you can use the conference room, laundry, left-luggage office.  There is free parking for hotel guests, and you can rent a car if you wish. </p><p>  The neighboring 4R Salou Park Resort II, which is also part of the 4R chain, has a paid gym and spa.  They are at ground level. </p><p>  The hotel has three swimming pools (water is not heated) with a relaxation area near them.  There is a bus stop near the hotel, from here you can get to any place you are interested in. </p><h2>  Hotel beach </h2><p>  4R Salou Park Resort (Salou) is located on the coast, to get to the beach, you must cross the road and go down the stairs to the water.  There is absolutely no shadow on the shore.  Renting two sunbeds and an umbrella per day will cost seventeen euros.  The sea is very warm, since it is rather shallow, the water manages to warm up well.  For children, this is a very convenient and suitable place.  The beach is clean and beautiful; it is cleaned daily. </p><h2>  Resort Benefits </h2><p>  If you have chosen Spain as your vacation destination, Costa Daurada (Salou) could be one of the best options.  The Spanish coast is known for its stunning beaches and crystal clear sea.  However, a beach holiday is not the only thing worth visiting this extraordinary country for.  Spain has a long and rich history, and therefore there are many monuments and simply beautiful, interesting places that are definitely worth seeing. </p>

    <p>  4R Salou Park Resort 3 * has a good location.  We already mentioned that there is a bus stop near the complex, from where you can get to all the most interesting places that tourists like to visit. </p><p>  Salou is considered the most "Russian" resort in all of Spain.  From May to the end of October, life boils and boils on the coast.  During the walk you can walk along King Jaime Boulevard.  The favorite place for young people in Salou is the amusement park called Port Aventura, which is famous for its water park with its steep and stunning slides.  Traditionally, in the middle of August, Golden Nights is celebrated annually.  They are accompanied by mass street festivities and beautiful fireworks shows.  Such holidays are often held in the town. </p><h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  Almost all the <span>sights of Salou</span> are located on its promenade.  In the evening, fountains begin to ‚Äúsing‚Äù in the light of night lights. </p><p>  Vacationers can visit the Museum of Modern Art, located in the Old Fortress from the time of the Saracen raids (16th century).  The most wonderful way to see Salou is to go round it on a tourist train. </p><p>  The resort will be interesting for lovers of active nightlife.  On Playa Ponente beach, most of the nightclubs are concentrated.  There are noisy parties thundering daily, famous DJs perform.  The most popular on the Costa Daurada is the Pacha Club. </p>

    <p>  Listing the most famous sights of Salou, it is impossible not to recall the Catalan estate, located right in the center of the city park.  It has been preserved in its original form.  This place will help to get acquainted with the life and life of ordinary peasants. </p><h2>  4R Salou Park Resort: reviews </h2><p>  Summing up the conversation about the Salou Park hotel, I would like to refer to the reviews of those vacationers who managed to visit here.  According to tourists, the main advantage of the complex is its excellent location.  The beach is just a couple of minutes walk.  To go ashore, you must pass 111 steps.  This does not burden at all, but people aged may not be very comfortable. </p><p>  The coast is very beautiful and clean.  But sun loungers and umbrellas on the beach are quite expensive (17 euros).  Salou has many beautiful beaches that are all worth seeing.  Each has its own characteristics and deserves attention. </p><p>  The hotel itself does not stand out anything special.  Everything is quite simple and concise.  There is no impressive lobby or lounge. </p><p>  The rooms in the complex are nice and clean.  The furniture is quite simple, but without any defects.  Most of the apartments have wonderful sea views.  The rooms are cleaned daily and with high quality.  But beach towels in the hotel for some reason are not provided, they simply do not give out.  Some tourists prefer to leave tips for the maids, but this is their personal wish. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  As for nutrition, it is organized at a very good level.  Experienced tourists are still advised to prefer the all-inclusive system.  The complex offers its guests a wide selection of dishes.  The best <span>hotels in Salou (4</span> stars) are not always as well fed as in the Salou Park hotel.  Although, as elsewhere, there are negative reviews regarding the insufficient number of fruits on the tables. </p><p>  The hotel's restaurant offers a special diet menu for children, which is good.  But it‚Äôs not entirely clear why it includes french fries, nuggets and the rest of fast food.  You understand, this is unacceptable for our compatriots.  Of course, children love such junk food, but kids should not eat it.  However, such an incident can be quite simply solved by offering children cereals from an adult table.  The hotel has wonderful ice cream, a lot of it, and it is different.  During the holidays you can try all the varieties and choose the most favorite. </p>

    <p>  Several times a week, the main restaurant organizes wonderful themed candlelit dinners with special, catchy dishes.  This is a real holiday for guests.  The rest of the evening meal does not contain bright, any special dishes.  In general, the food is very high quality and tasty. </p><p>  For those guests who prefer to take half board with food, there will also be no problems.  Around the hotel you can find many restaurants and cafes, which are very tasty.  However, it should be borne in mind that free drinks are served only to those who eat on an all-inclusive basis.  All other guests will have to pay extra for the selected drinks. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  There is a good kids club on site.  An evening disco is especially interesting for children.  As for adult animation, many tourists believe that it is not enough. </p><p>  There are also complaints about audibility in the rooms.  The fact is that evening programs for adults go until one in the morning.  This makes it difficult for tourists who live on the lower floors to relax. </p><p>  The hotel has beautiful clean pools, however, they do not heat up, and therefore the water in them is sometimes cool.  Vacationers note that at the beginning of summer, sea water is also not warm (although it is hot during the day, but the nights are cold). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="4r salou park resort spain" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1459034.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel service is good, the staff is friendly and courteous, the reception staff are trying to resolve all issues.  As for some sports entertainment and leisure, there are practically none.  The hotel claims to have a spa and fitness room.  In fact, they are located in 4R Salou Park Resort ii - this is a neighboring complex, part of the 4R Hotels chain. </p><p>  Tourists are very pleased with the very atmosphere of the resort, wonderful walks and excursions around the town of Salou.  There really are a lot of beautiful and interesting places that are worth visiting with the children: water park, entertainment centers, light and music fountains.  If you wish, you can even go to Barcelona and admire its sights.  In our article, we mentioned only a small number of local beauties.  In fact, there are many more, and therefore tourists always have an extensive excursion program, which is difficult to see during one vacation. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  4R Salou Park Resort (Spain) is a budget hotel.  In principle, there is everything that is necessary for a full vacation.  However, if you are used to relaxing in more fashionable places, then you are unlikely to like the complex, since there are no beautiful and expensive rooms and interiors.  Everything is designed in a simple and concise style. </p><p>  In general, if you do not make excessive demands, the hotel may well be a good option for an inexpensive family vacation.  A sea of ‚Äã‚Äãwonderful experiences will surely be guaranteed! </p>
