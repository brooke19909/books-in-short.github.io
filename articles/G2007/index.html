Of these, one-fourth of the equipped beaches account for 73 km.  But despite this, the rest here is wonderful.  We invite you to look into the small family-run hotel Aquarius 3 *.  Budva is the city where it is located, and at the same time the best and most fun resort in the country.  There are many places for entertainment, many narrow old streets, which are so interesting to walk along, many gorgeous beaches and even more attractions that give the city a special highlight.  The owners of our hotel are pleased to all guests and try to make their stay in the country pleasant and comfortable. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Without exaggeration, in each review of tourists it is reported about the convenient location of Aquarius 3 *.  Budva is located approximately in the middle of the coastline.  This is one of the smallest regions of Montenegro.  On the one hand, it is washed by the <span>Adriatic Sea,</span> on the other three, the resort towns of Kotor and Bar adjoin it, as well as the second capital of the country, Cetinje, which does not have access to the coast.  Hotel guests can easily visit all these amazingly beautiful places, since the distances here are small.  So, to Kotor - only 22 km, and to Bar - about 35 km.  The bus station is located from Hotel Aquarius ten minutes away.  Also very close are the market, the Old Town and the coast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aquarius 3 Budva" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1568366.jpg" width="511"></div>

The country has two international airports, the first is near the city of Podgorica, the second is 4 km from the city of Tivat.  Airplanes from Russia fly to Podgorica only in season, and the distance from there to our hotel is about 52 km.  But the path lies through the famous <span>Skadar Lake.</span> </p><p>  There are more flights to Tivat from Russia, moreover, they exist not only from Moscow, but also from Samara, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod, and St. Petersburg.  From the airport, called the same name as the city - ‚ÄúTivat‚Äù, to the hotel - only about 20 km, which the transfer overcomes in no more than half an hour.  It is also easy for independent tourists to get to Budva from there.  There is a highway 100 meters from the exit from the terminal, and there is an unofficial bus stop in all directions.  Those who do not like to ‚Äúvote‚Äù on the roads can drive up to the bus station (1.5 km away), and there they can buy a ticket to any desired city and ride in comfort. </p><p>  In addition to the air, there is a land route "Moscow - Montenegro".  It passes through Belarus, Poland, the Czech Republic, Austria, and Croatia.  Travel time - from 44 to 65 hours (depends on the route number, which must be specified in the travel agency where the tickets are purchased).  Bus tickets are no cheaper than plane tickets.  This type of travel may be of interest to those who wish to ride in Europe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel aquarius" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1568364.jpg" width="509"></div>

The hotel occupies a corner position, so roads run from both sides - one with more busy traffic, and the other a narrow and very quiet one.  There is not much parking space in front of the main entrance to the Aquarius, but the hotel staff does not look at the guests' cars.  The territory in "Aquarius" is as compact as possible.  In fact, it occupies the entire hotel building, surrounded by flowers and a small garden with evergreen trees.  Under their canopy, a recreation area is equipped.  There is no pool at this hotel. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Hotel "Aquarius" is very small.  In the lobby of his only four-story building, on the second floor, there is a reception.  The hostess of this institution sometimes speaks good Russian.  Basically, at the front desk there is staff who understands only their mother tongue and English.  At the reception, guests can use the safe, take an iron, call a taxi, check bus routes, buy a tour, invite a doctor.  The lobby has a wonderful corner with sofas and armchairs.  It is convenient to just relax or sit on the Internet using free Wi-Fi. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Montenegro" class="if" height="344" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1568363.jpg" width="516"></div>

According to tourists, the second is somewhat more comfortable than the first.  There are only 19 rooms in the hotel, floors are 4. There is no elevator, you can get into your room only through intricate staircases, which are an integral part of the building design, and you can get to the first floor only by first going up to the reception and then going down again , but already on another, small staircase.  Every single room in the hotel is different both in area and in design.  Some are very spacious, others are too compact, some have bathtubs, others have showers, and others have only a shower with a tray and a curtain.  Another difference is the balconies.  In some rooms they are not at all, and in some there are very spacious terraces.  All this must be clarified when booking.  But the views from the windows of all rooms are approximately the same.  They can be on the road, neighboring hotels and city buildings.  They clean the hotel very high quality, linen and towels are changed every other day, hygiene products provided on the day of arrival are regularly replenished.  The hotel rooms are so different that we decided to dwell on their description in more detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aquarius Montenegro" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1568361.jpg" width="512"></div>

There is a nice little restaurant in Aquarius called Aquarius. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Budva Hotel Aquarius 3" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1568362.jpg" width="511"></div>  Breakfasts are served European, buffet style.

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  In Montenegro, the climate is warm, but not hot, due to the mountains and vast forests.  In the summer at sea resorts the thermometer‚Äôs column jumps to +30 ¬∞ C on rare days, basically it freezes in the region of +25 ... +26 ¬∞ C, and in winter its readings are about +9 ¬∞ C.  Water in the Adriatic Sea, off the coast, warms up to +24 ¬∞ C, but by October it cools down to +18 ¬∞ C.  Wonderful beaches are said to be the best on the coast, Budva boasts.  Hotel Aquarius 3 * is located close to the seashore and from the marina, from where boats to the islands start.  But on the mainland, the rest is wonderful.  Guests need to walk only 500 meters to the nearest Slavyansky beach. Its cover is sandy, with pebbles, the entry into the water is good, but the beach is too crowded.  Behind the old city there is another, called "Mogren", more beautiful and cleaner.  You can also go to the beaches of "Yaz" or "Ploce".  All of them are municipal.  Sun loungers and umbrellas are everywhere paid, on some beaches, for example, on Yaz, excellent playgrounds are equipped. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel Aquarius 3 Budva Montenegro reviews" class="if" height="344" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1568365.jpg" width="512"></div>
