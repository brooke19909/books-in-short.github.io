  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What coins are valued by collectors?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Collecting is a common hobby; coins are often collected.  Such people are called numismatists.  If you decide to replenish their ranks and start collecting banknotes, first you need to know which coins are valued and which are not.  After all, the very taste of collecting is to have a rare copy that others do not own. </p><p>  To begin with - a small educational program, an excursion into history.  Throughout all time, banknotes were made in large quantities - this was dictated by the needs of expanding trade.  Many of these specimens have been preserved, only those that, in principle, cannot be obtained or restored, have been lost.  Due to the fact that some coins were in use for a long time, they wore out, outwardly became unattractive, while others completely lost their attributes.  Therefore, among them, you need to choose those that have retained higher quality. </p><p>  Each country has its own, most valuable coins, so a novice collector should not collect immediately all that he comes across.  It is necessary among these specimens to look for those that are well preserved.  This means that it was precisely such coins that were of value during their release, therefore they were stored in special conditions, and they were not running. </p><p>  In order to know which coins are valued, it is necessary to study the criteria that determine the value.  These, first of all, include such as a combination of rarity, class, and demand from collectors. </p><p>  The combination of rarity depends on the number of copies issued and the number of coins that have survived and have survived to this day.  Collectors usually pay attention to the specific signs that are on them.  They are called the stigma.  Most valued are those on which there is a <span>mint mark.</span>  Among such banknotes, copies from the United States of America, Chile, and Colombia are most often found.  But coins from Bolivia and Peru are less popular - these poor countries issued their signs, not too caring about their attributes. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In order to determine which coins are valued, you need to pay attention to the class.  The instance class is the state of the mark today compared to the state when it was issued.  Usually, beginners cope only with the simplest task - they determine the age, starting from the date of coinage on its side.  However, this does not determine the value of a coin among numismatists at all.  In order to make up its value, you need to know not only the release date, but also its circulation, as well as popularity.  Only an experienced numismatist who has been collecting for many years can determine this.  In order to understand which coins are valued, you can check them in the catalog.  It indicates the series of the product, its quality, but the market value of the item is not indicated at all. </p><p>  If we talk about Russian coins, then today these cash equivalents are very popular among collectors.  For example, 5 rubles with a portrait of Alexander the Third (gold), which were issued in 1888, were auctioned for one hundred and fifty thousand, but the silver hryvnia (silver), released in 1741, went for ninety thousand rubles.  A record amount of one hundred twenty thousand dollars received at the auction of a silver ruble.  It was trial, and released in 1806.  According to experts, there are only two such coins in the world.  If you look at what coins are valued at Russian auctions, it‚Äôs worth summarizing that these are coins of Russia and the USSR, which are in good condition and in small quantities.  They are a decoration of any collection, especially if they are provided with proper care, maintenance in a special album, as well as compliance with a certain storage temperature. </p>
