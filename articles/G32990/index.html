The same can be said about the Samsung NX Mini model that has appeared on the market relatively recently.  Reviews of the first buyers indicate that this is far from all of its positive characteristics.  For such a modest size, the capabilities of the camera are simply impressive.  And she shoots just fine.  All this becomes clear at the very beginning of using the Samsung NX Mini.  An overview of the model is presented in more detail below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung nx mini" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/517197.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Compactness </h2><p>  The novelty appeared in domestic stores in early 2014.  At that time, it became the most compact camera of all those models that are equipped with an interchangeable lens and are presented on the market.  Indeed, even taking into account the installed optics, it can be discreetly hidden in the pocket of a jacket or jacket, not to mention a woman‚Äôs handbag.  The only exception is the wide-angle option.  However, such a compact size is not the best way affected ergonomics.  More specifically, the grip handle is not quite enough, so in order to prevent the camera from slipping out of your hands, you need to slightly support it from the bottom. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  general description </h2><p>  The appearance of the <span>Samsung NX</span> Mini as a whole is classic.  The body and top panel are made of magnesium alloy.  The lateral and front faces of the camera, together with the insert under the finger, are distinguished by a leather-like texture, despite the fact that they are made of high-strength plastic.  The model is available in black, white, brown, pink and turquoise.  On the back there is a touch monitor, the diagonal of which is three inches.  If necessary, it is rotated 180 degrees.  This feature compares the Samsung NX Mini.  The reviews of its owners indicate that, thanks to this decision, it is very simple to create "selfie" so popular in our time. </p><p>  There is also a classic switch to five positions, which serves to select the automatic focus mode, type of shooting, as well as information displayed on the monitor.  There are buttons around it to enter the menu, select a mode, delete and view files.  The key to enable video recording with the indicator can be found under the ear designed for the strap. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung nx mini review" class="if" height="256" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/517195.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The lens eject button is located on the front edge, and the NFC area is located on the left under the camera name.  The AF-assist lamp and built-in flash are mounted on a metal insert.  There are no functional elements in the left panel.  On the right side, right behind the cover, there are wired connectors - micro-HDMI, micro-USB, as well as a compartment for the battery and a slot for a micro-SD memory card. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The place for mounting an external auxiliary flash, as well as the microphone hole, are located on the top panel.  It should be noted that the ports are covered with a rather tight plug, which is not always obtained from the first try.  Above the controls there is an oval hole with a built-in speaker, as well as a strap eye.  A thread is provided on the bottom for mounting the camera on a tripod. </p><h2>  Complete set and equipment </h2><p>  The Samsung NX Mini has a 20.5 megapixel sensor and a touch screen with rotation function to create self-portraits.  Moreover, the camera boasts good functionality and modern wireless capabilities, which include support for Wi-Fi and NFC.  By purchasing a model, in a compact box you can find the camera itself with optics, a cable for charging and synchronization with computer equipment, a power supply, a small external flash and a thin wrist strap.  In addition, software discs and short user manuals are packaged separately. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung nx mini reviews" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/517200.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Functionality </h2><p>  For high-quality shots, this Samsung camera has a host of features.  One of the most interesting of them is Wink Shot.  Its essence is as follows: looking into the lens, it is enough to just blink, after which the new product will take a picture of itself in two seconds. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The next function is continuous shooting, which is carried out at a speed of six frames per second.  The shutter speed is 1/16000 second. </p><p>  Another ability of the camera is called Tag &amp; Go.  It provides the ability to wirelessly transfer captured images to any tablet or smartphone that supports NFC. </p><p>  Thanks to the Mobile Link program, you can send multiple photos at once.  The Remote View Finder function allows you to control the camera using a smartphone.  Pictures can be sent simultaneously to several devices (maximum - 4).  The Group Share program allows you to do this. </p><p>  You can directly upload photos from the camera not only to social networks, but also to the Flickr and Dropbox services.  In addition, one cannot fail to note the Baby Monitor mode.  Its essence lies in the fact that the smartphone left in the room with a small child monitors the volume of the sound in the room and instantly sends the image to the camera display as soon as the baby wakes up and begins to cry or just make noise. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung nx mini Price" class="if" height="291" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/517199.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Interchangeable lenses </h2><p>  The novelty is fully compatible with the fifteen lenses that are part of the NX line and sold separately.  This is facilitated by a special adapter called the NX-M.  Along with this, the manufacturing company released three lenses that are designed specifically for the Samsung NX Mini.  The review of each of them is full of positive characteristics.  Between themselves, they differ in the conditions under which each individual copy is adapted. </p><p>  The first option is a <span>wide-angle lens,</span> which is most suitable for self-portraits and landscapes.  The second supports wide-angle shooting of photos and videos.  As for the third instance, it is designed to create portrait photographs with a blurry background and detailed foreground. </p><h2>  Daytime shooting </h2><p>  As noted above, the Samsung NX Mini is equipped with a relatively large matrix with an effective resolution of 20.5 megapixels.  It was made using DSI CMOS technology, which provides the ability to create photos with a high degree of detail and convincing tone reproduction.  At both maximum and average <span>focal lengths of the</span> lens during the daytime, it is difficult to find any chromatic distortions in the images. </p><p>  As noted in the reviews, in order for the model to successfully cope with high-contrast scenes, it is recommended to use features such as HDR and "Auto brightness +".  Otherwise, the photos taken will show the loss of details in white. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung nx mini camera" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/517201.jpg" width="515"></div>

    <h2>  Low light shots </h2><p>  The happy owners of this gadget say that the novelty leaves far behind many competitors in such a parameter as shooting in low light.  According to this indicator, it reaches even the level of cameras with larger sensors, namely, entry-level mirror models, as well as expensive mirrorless modifications.  In this case, the camera reliably transmits even small details and copes with red shades, which are usually difficult for digital sensor assemblies.  The same can be said about the transfer of delicate pastel and bright luminescent colors. </p><h2>  Macro mode </h2><p>  The Samsung NX Mini camera, as stated in the reviews, impresses with its impressive capabilities when using the macro mode.  In the case of using a standard lens on objects located in the immediate vicinity, it focuses quite clearly, regardless of the focal length.  This characteristic becomes very useful when shooting when the sun is at its zenith or from the side. </p><h2>  Video recording </h2><p>  Video recorded using the Samsung NX Mini is saved in MP4 format.  Using a special codec, it is compressed.  The highest possible video quality is Full HD (frequency is 30 frames per second).  Using a function called ‚ÄúMulti-Movement‚Äù, you can pre-set the rate of deceleration or acceleration of the recording when watching videos.  Using a mechanical ring in a standard lens, the user has the ability to zoom in and out on the image when shooting.  In the case when frame-by-frame or continuous auto focus is selected, the camera will automatically adjust the focus.  Manual control during video shooting is not possible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung nx mini camera" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/517202.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Photo indoors </h2><p>  Pictures taken on the Samsung NX Mini in a well-lit environment are very high quality.  At the same time, one cannot but note the fact that we are talking about cases where photographs are viewed on a computer monitor or TV, and the picture is reduced.  If you increase it to one hundred percent size, the uniform areas suffer a little, namely, colored and fuzzy spots appear. </p><h2>  Prices </h2><p>  An important issue for consumers is how much the Samsung NX Mini costs.  The prices for this camera at different points of sale in our country vary.  In the company‚Äôs company store, the device can be purchased for 12,990 rubles.  In online stores, it costs 13-15 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung camera" class="if" height="395" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/517196.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  In general, the developers managed to create a rather elegant and compact model, which is also very advanced in its capabilities.  The potential of this camera for beginners as they gain experience will gradually be revealed more and more.  It should also be noted that when purchasing additional lenses and accessories, the capabilities of the device can be significantly increased. </p><p>  A large list of functions related to the wireless transmission of information, allows you to quickly share with friends and acquaintances pictures and videos as easily as using a smartphone.  Well, far from the least important advantage of the Samsung NX Mini model is the price of the camera, which can be called quite affordable and fair for a camera with such capabilities. </p>
