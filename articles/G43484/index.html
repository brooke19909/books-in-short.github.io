The Nanshan Center for Buddhism, located near the city of Sanya, is a famous tourist complex.  An ancient temple has been restored on its territory and a landscape park has been laid out, giving visitors peace and harmony. </p><h2>  Nanshan temple </h2><p>  A sacred place for all Buddhists is dedicated to Guanyin - the most revered goddess.  An ancient legend has been passed down from generation to generation, according to which a small ship once wrecked in this place, and 12 miraculously saved monks built a temple here as a token of gratitude. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Buddhism Center Nanshan Photo" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1774826.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The Nanshan Center for Buddhism is a huge complex surrounded by a green park located on an area of ‚Äã‚Äã50 square kilometers.  For the convenience of tourists, open electric cars run here that stop at every attraction.  Transport tickets are valid throughout the day, and visitors can sit and go at their convenience, which simplifies the movement through the gigantic complex in the sweltering heat. </p><h2>  Gates of Enlightenment </h2><p>  Entrance to the Nanshan Center for Buddhism, whose photos convey its exotic beauty, is through the Heavenly Gate.  They are decorated with two hieroglyphs inscribed by the oldest calligrapher of the country, which denote two important concepts - unity and nonduality.  According to Buddhist philosophy, in order to achieve enlightenment, you must go through this gate.  There is also the so-called happiness gong, in which all visitors who stand in line beat three times, calling for luck, wealth and prosperity. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Merciful Liberation Park </h2><p>  Walking through a picturesque park called Mercy Liberation, you can get into the Valley of Longevity through an alley dedicated to the centenarians of the peninsula.  Red ribbons are tied everywhere with golden hieroglyphs - wishes of love, happiness and other blessings.  Especially for tourists from Russia at the points selling shreds of fabric, there are signs with the translation.  Each guest who visits the Nanshan Center for Buddhism attaches ribbons to statues or trees, and no one removes them.  It is believed that the gods always fulfill their cherished desires. </p><p>  Built in the classical Chinese style, the park with bamboo thickets and pretty arbors resembles a paradise in which it is so nice to meditate and relax from the city bustle. </p><h2>  Longevity Alley </h2><p>  On the picturesque alley there are stands with photographs of people who have reached a hundred years of age, as well as excerpts from interviews with them.  Everyone will be able to learn their secrets, which consist in an active lifestyle, proper nutrition, communication with loved ones.  The fact is that on the island, where the old people are very respectful, there are a large number of people older than 80 and 90 years old.  An interesting festival is held once every two years, where long-livers are publicly congratulated and presented with gifts. </p><p>  Everyone will be able to climb the top of the mountain along the stairs, which have ten thousand steps.  The hill offers stunning views of the rainforest and the giant statue of the goddess.  In the Valley of Longevity, tourists find a sculptural composition consisting of three turtles, symbolizing family happiness with children and grandchildren, respect for old age and peace. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Temple of the Goddess of Mercy </h2><p>  The colorful center of Nanshan Buddhism, opened 18 years ago, is famous for its magnificent temple, where a golden statue of the eight-armed goddess of mercy is installed.  Having achieved perfection, the caring and compassionate Guanyin, who did not want to go to nirvana, begged the gods for happiness for people and saved them from various disasters and troubles. </p><p>  The tall statue of the goddess is made of 140 kg of pure gold and encrusted with precious stones, whose total weight exceeds 400 carats.  For believers, the main relic is a piece of the ashes of the Buddha himself, stored inside the statue.  The walls of the temple are filled with small cells, where miniature images of the goddess left by tourists and believers are installed.  By the way, each visitor will be able to purchase a figure, on the plate of which his name will be engraved, however, taking it with you will not work, since a copy should remain in the temple. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nanshan Center for Buddhism" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1774749.jpg" width="476"></div>

    <p>  Near the construction is a gigantic jug carved in stone, filled with rainwater.  At its base there is a container in which goldfish swim, and tourists are happy to feed them rice.  An old legend tells that water from a vessel will pour out and cleanse the earth only when all wars cease in the world.  Buddhists believe that such a day will come soon. </p><h2>  Guanyin statue on an artificial island </h2><p>  The end point of the route is an artificial island, in the center of which stands a bronze statue of the goddess.  Two of her faces look at the South China Sea, and one faces the people.  The height of the Guanyin sculpture is 108 meters (this number is considered sacred in China). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hainan Center of Buddhism Nanshan" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1774743.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Believers who come from different parts of the world to the center of Nanshan Buddhism touch the gilded lotus petals on which the great goddess rests.  At the foot of a statue weighing 2600 tons there is an elegant temple with special stands where red ribbons with wishes are attached. </p><h2>  Nanshan Buddhism Center: how to get there </h2><p>  Those who want to visit a local attraction on their own must first get to the city of Sanya.  You can get from Moscow to the resort with transfers, and departure is from Sheremetyevo Airport. </p><p>  Getting to the Nanshan Temple, open from 8:00 to 18:00, is easy: buses at numbers 25 and 29 run in the international tourism center, which will take you to the final stop in an hour - the largest Buddhist complex in Asia. </p><p>  In addition, you can buy an excursion, the price of which (about 65 euros) includes: round-trip transfer, walk with a guide and tickets for an electric car. </p>
