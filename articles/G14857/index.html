    <p>  Clean air in these parts has healing properties.  It is saturated with volatile pine and medicinal herbs.  In his works, the Russian poet Aksakov praised the beauty of the steppe lake Kandrykul, noted the incredible transparency of its water. </p><p>  According to one of the legends that came from the depths of centuries, near the lake at the top of Nuratau was the palace of the khan.  Many strangers paid attention to this picturesque place and asked residents about it.  The answer was: "Khan-torganer" (the khan lives).  It is believed that over time the phrase was distorted to ‚Äúkandra‚Äù, and it became the name of the lake. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Kandrykul - a lake in the west of Bashkiria </h2><p>  The reservoir is located in the center of the Bugulminsko-Belebeyevskaya plain.  Its origin is associated with karst processes - the dissolution of rocks and the formation of voids in the earth's crust.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe mirror is 15.6 km <sup>2</sup> .  The average depth of the lake is 7.2 m, and the maximum is 15.6 m. The lake is fed mixed, due to <span>precipitation, and the</span> flow of groundwater.  There are many springs at the bottom and along the banks, but rivers do not flow from the lake.  Salinity is low, so Lake Kandrykul in Bashkiria is considered fresh, although salinity is felt at the bottom. </p>

    <p>  Low mountains approach the shores of the reservoir, flanking the water area from the west, southeast and south.  There is a picturesque island of Utrau in the northwestern part of the lake, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich reaches 4.5 hectares.  The island is covered with dense forests and flood meadows. </p><p>  The significance of Kandrykul Lake as a natural object lies in the unique combination of flora and fauna, and the great ecological and scientific potential of the water area.  In addition, the reservoir, its coastal landscapes have recreational and balneological value. </p><h2>  Natural features of the lake </h2><p>  Kandrykul is a lake located in the continental climate.  It is characterized by hot summers and frosty winters.  In July, the air temperature sometimes rises to +36 ¬∞ C, and in January it drops to the same level, but only with the ‚Äú-‚Äù sign.  A feature of the forest-steppe zone to the west of the Ural Range lies in better moisture than in the mountains and east of the watershed.  Peaks delay the movement of air flows from west to east, the amount of precipitation in the same direction is almost halved.  Snow cover is established in November and lasts until April. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>
