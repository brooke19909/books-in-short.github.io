    <p>  Local hotels can offer a lot of entertainment for kids, in particular, children's rooms are provided for them, and there is a special menu in the dining rooms for young tourists.  For a fee, parents can hire a professional nanny to look after the child at a time when parents need to leave. </p><p>  Everyone who came to Kemer should look at a local attraction - a unique cave complex Belbidi to enjoy the magnificent beauty of the waterfall. </p><h2>  Antalya </h2><p>  So, your tourist destination is Turkey.  Where to relax with a child in September?  Naturally, in Antalya, where all the conditions for a comfortable family vacation are created.  Tourists call this place the “Turkish Riviera”: the mild climate of the Mediterranean, the azure-colored waters of the bay, resembling a crescent moon in combination with bizarre rocky shores with archaic buildings form a unique landscape of beauty.  Here you can choose a hotel of varying degrees of comfort, because the tourist season in Antalya lasts 275 days a year.  Well, about your rich excursion program, fun nightlife and attractive shopping prospects, your friends and relatives have repeatedly told you.  Antalya can be recommended first of all to those who are used to combining business trips with sea vacations, since a significant part of the beach areas here are located within the city, and hotel complexes are focused on recreation "outside the territory". </p>

    <p>  As for resettlement, it is better to prefer a hotel club system or bungalow.  Why?  The thing is that with this option, children are in a protected area, and therefore, fathers and mothers can weaken their “supervision” and fully relax while the nanny looks after them. </p><p>  Try to check into hotels where there is a lot of vegetation, as trees can protect children from the negative effects of sunlight. </p><p>  Information on the cost of services in hotels should be analyzed in advance.  Also, it will not be superfluous to know in advance how much the rent of rooms will cost.  Their cost depends on several factors: the stardom of the hotel, the type of room and the period of the tourist season. </p>
