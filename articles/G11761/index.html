    <h2>  The vision of a mysterious pyramid </h2><p>  Traditionally, the image of the pyramids in our minds is associated with the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAncient Egypt.  Meanwhile, a significant number of them were discovered and investigated in Central America.  However, the news that appeared in the media in the 80s of the XX century became a real world sensation. </p><p>  They cited the report of the American pilot D. Gausman, given to them by the command in March 1945.  This message continues to be a sensation today.  According to the pilot, while he was returning from a mission flying thirty kilometers from the Chinese city of Xi'an, his plane began to suddenly lose altitude for some unknown reason.  When it fell so much that it was below the clouds that covered the earth, the amazed American had a truly fantastic sight. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Beneath it lay a gigantic white pyramid shrouded in a strange radiance.  It seemed that it was made of some kind of silver stone or even metal.  Having flown over the mysterious colossus several times and made a series of photographs, the pilot continued on his way, and as he moved away from the pyramid, his car again began to gain height. </p><h2>  Skeptics' opinions </h2><p>  The report he presented did not inspire the confidence of scientists and, together with the pictures attached to it, spent forty years in the archive.  The pilot's story seemed too unbelievable, and even the photographs taken by him in general cast doubt on their authenticity. </p>

    <p>  According to the calculations made on their basis, the height of the structure reached 300 m, and the length of the side of the base was no less than 230 m, which was exactly twice the size of the largest building in the world - the Cheops pyramid.  Nevertheless, it was this building, previously unknown to world science - the Great White Pyramid in China, the photo of which is presented in the article - that became one of the main mysteries of the past century.  As it turned out later, she was not alone. </p><p>  For many unknown years, the Chinese authorities carefully concealed the presence of pyramids on the territory of their country.  They succeeded because the satellites did not exist at that time, and it was impossible to make out anything from space.  However, the pyramids were the same awl, which was very difficult to conceal. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  New Zealand Enthusiast </h2><p>  Following the American pilot, an aviator from New Zealand Bruce Katie told them about the world, who also opened the Great White Pyramid during the flight in the 60s.  In China, as he found out later, at the beginning of the 20th century, two Australian merchants traveled and in their diaries described the construction they saw, but not one, but more than a dozen.  Finding the opportunity to familiarize themselves with their recordings and managing to obtain the appropriate permission from the local authorities, Bruce Katie traveled to the area indicated by them.  There he made sketches, as well as photographs of 16 <span>pyramids, the largest</span> of which was the White Pyramid. </p><p>  In China, oddly enough, the locations of these ancient monuments were closed to visitors not only to foreigners, but also to their own citizens.  What is used in other countries to attract tourists and profit, here was one of the secret objects. </p>

    <h2>  The beginning of the study of the Chinese pyramids </h2><p>  Only in 1994, some relief was made for the Austrian archaeologist Hartwig Hausdorff.  As a result, in the Qiyanyan area, a vast and sparsely populated area, he discovered a whole valley of pyramids, numbering more than one hundred of these ancient structures.  They all had the correct geometric shape and, despite being smaller than the tallest - the White Pyramid (in China), the photo of which the American pilot presented in his report, still reached forty meters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Official recognition by the Celestial authorities of the presence of pyramids on their territory followed only in 2000, and access to them by archaeologists was very limited on the grounds that they are all in close proximity to military facilities.  Nevertheless, even this made it possible to carry out certain studies. </p><h2>  Valley full of mysteries </h2><p>  The place where the largest number of these historical monuments is located is called the Valley of the Pyramids.  Here they are concentrated more than four hundred.  Unlike the Egyptian ones, the Chinese and those found in Central America have a truncated top, forming an even horizontal platform.  In China, they are made of local clay, called "loess". </p><p>  It is important to note the following fact: despite their impressive size, reaching 50 meters in height or more, all of them, with rare exceptions, are monolithic and, accordingly, cannot be tombs, since they do not have internal cavities.  Why, then, were these colossi constructed? </p><p>  Among them, a group of 20 structures located in a regular square stands out, the sides of which are precisely oriented to the cardinal points.  It is established that the oldest pyramid of this valley was built in 1032 BC. </p>

    <h2>  Victims of an unknown weapon </h2><p>  The most interesting object of archaeological research was the White Pyramid.  In China, the coordinates of this structure (34 ¬∞ 26 '05' 'N and 108 ¬∞ 52' 12 '' E) are not a secret since D. Gausman published them in his report in 1945.  Excavations have shown that it is the tomb of one of the emperors of the Qin dynasty - Gao Zong.  It was also found that during its construction at least 700 thousand people died, the remains of which were then laid in the walls of the pyramid and densely compacted with layers of soil.  This event dates back to 200 BC. </p><p>  Such a barbaric custom was not new to archaeologists, something else struck them.  The fact is that the bones of all the victims were randomly mixed together, as if before death people were torn to pieces by an unknown force. </p><h2>  Wrath of the mysterious forces </h2><p>  A more detailed study made some adjustments to the overall picture, but it also added mysteries.  It became obvious that the dead were not builders, but an army of servants of the emperor, intended to accompany him in the afterlife, but they were killed using unknown high-tech weapons, traces of which could not be found. </p><p>  Another interesting fact has been established.  As it turned out, the emperor‚Äôs burial was carried out at his request in a pyramid built almost a thousand years before and without an internal cavity.  Apparently, the existing channel leading into its bowels was pierced specifically for burial.  Was not the death of so many imperial servants a reaction of unknown forces to enter the restricted area? </p>

    <h2>  Unknown anomalies </h2><p>  In the area where the White Pyramid is located <span>(Xi'an, China),</span> a large number of abnormal phenomena that are not explainable are also recorded.  There were, for example, cases of the mysterious disappearance of people and unprovoked plane crashes.  In addition, very often people who fall into this area cease to navigate in space and have <span>memory lapses.</span> </p><h2>  Holders of ancient knowledge </h2><p>  In this regard, the records of two Austrian businessmen who visited this area at the beginning of the 20th century (discussed above) took on a new meaning.  In their diaries, they describe a meeting with a Buddhist monk who told them that the White Pyramid in China was built by the emperor - a descendant of the "sons of heaven."  An ancient legend tells how his ancestors flew on iron fire-breathing dragons and gave people some secret knowledge. </p><p>  There are, if not direct, then indirect confirmations to these words.  For example, the Chinese professor Wang Shiping made a curious discovery related to the place where the White Pyramid is located.  In China there is a geometric center of all parts of the world, and, as it turned out, the pyramid is located at this point, which, of course, proves the knowledge of the ancient builders about the spherical shape of the Earth, as well as the shape and location of the continents. </p><p>  If we assume that the "sons of heaven" had real prototypes, then who could be them, if not aliens from outer space?  The white pyramid in China, the photo of which puzzled scientists back in 1945, is surrounded by so many inexplicable, but documented evidence and facts that it involuntarily creates the feeling that some extraterrestrial force erects barriers, preventing the penetration of modern people into them. </p>

    <h2>  Unexpected and bold conclusions </h2><p>  After a comparative analysis of the features of the construction of pyramids located on different continents and thousands of kilometers away from each other, scientists found so many similarities in them that they involuntarily suggest that they are all the creations of one highly developed civilization.  For example, the White Pyramid in China is largely identical to similar structures of the American continent and North Africa. </p><p>  It is also interesting to note that in many photographs transmitted to the Earth from the surface of Mars, elevations are clearly visible, resembling pyramids in their outlines, exposed to time and natural erosion.  If these are really <span>artificial structures,</span> then, undoubtedly, they are the work of the same builders, by whose will the White Pyramid was erected in China.  History, unfortunately, does not always provide comprehensive answers and sometimes makes scientists content with only hypotheses.  However, they also stimulate the inexhaustible enthusiasm of researchers. </p><h2>  What does the White Pyramid in China look like from the satellite </h2><p>  And in conclusion, another interesting observation by scientists made in recent years.  As you know, the most modern technology has been placed at the disposal of researchers today, thanks to which the monuments of ancient civilizations are studied, including the White Pyramid in China.  A photo from a satellite flying over the place where it is located showed a completely unexpected picture. </p><p>  It turned out that it is the basis in the group of pyramids, in its location exactly corresponding to the position of the stars of the constellation Cygnus, personifying eternal life in Chinese mythology.  Previously, they had no idea about this, since it was possible to see the big picture only from space.  Hence the question: who and why needed to create this giant symbol? </p>

    <h2>  Key to the dream </h2><p>  It is very possible that the reason the Chinese kept their pyramids secret for a long time from the rest of the world is because of some secret knowledge, the key to which they are.  And it is possible that the solution to this ‚Äúeighth wonder of the world‚Äù can raise world civilization to a whole new level, opening up before people unknown opportunities and fulfilling their dream of immortality. </p>
