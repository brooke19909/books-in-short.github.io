    <h2>  Ancient history: state on the banks of the Nile.  Time of occurrence and first inhabitants </h2><p>  Egypt, like many other eastern countries, arose in the place where there was a constant source of water.  In China, the first settlements appeared along the banks of the Yangtze and the Yellow River, Mesopotamia was located in the valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates.  The state on the banks of the Nile, Ancient Egypt, was no exception. </p><p>  In addition to the source of water, the river gave the inhabitants of Ta-Kemet (the ancient name of the country) fertile soil, which made it possible to obtain a rich harvest. </p><p>  Egypt arose about six thousand years ago.  The date of its formation, accepted by most researchers, is the middle of the fourth millennium BC.  e.  Who inhabited the state on the banks of the Nile at that time? </p><p>  At the beginning of the fourth millennium BC.  e.  on the territory of future Egypt, Caucasian-shaped proto-Egyptian tribes are formed.  They have already entered the period of the emergence of agricultural communities.  In addition, they began to engage in cattle breeding.  They already had a <span>sedentary lifestyle.</span>  The first buildings appear - granaries and dwellings. </p><p>  At the end of the Eneolithic along the banks of the Nile, several proto-states already existed.  <span>This period was</span> called pre-dynastic by researchers, since Egypt was not yet united under the authority of one ruler into one administrative unit. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  United Egypt and its first ruler </h2><p>  It is believed that around 3000 BC.  e.  The Upper and Lower Kingdoms, which had been at war before, were united into a single state.  Egyptologists have very little data on those times, so the question of the ruler who became the head of a united Egypt is controversial.  They are considered Menes, who, according to the ancient historian Manetho, founded a single state.  Other researchers think that he and Pharaoh Narmer are one and the same person. </p>

    <p>  If there is still controversy over the identity of the first ruler of Egypt, the date of the emergence of a united country along the banks of the Nile is considered to be precisely established. </p><h2>  Natural conditions </h2><p>  Why did the territory of the future Egypt attract the first inhabitants?  First of all, it was Neil.  He is the source of the fertility of the earth, a real gift for farmers.  The silt remaining after the <span>floods</span> made the soil soft, and it was easy to process even with a wooden plow.  The climate made it possible to get several crops a year. </p>

    <p>  The peculiarity of Egypt was that all the necessary raw materials were nearby.  There were almost no metals in the country, but they were mined in neighboring areas.  What the state on the banks of the Nile experienced an acute shortage of was the tree. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Egypt was very well located geographically.  The Nile was navigable and allowed to connect the country with neighboring states, for example, with Nubia. </p><h2>  The country on the banks of the Nile and its inhabitants.  Agriculture and life of the ancient Egyptians </h2><p>  Despite favorable conditions and climate, farming in Egypt required a lot of effort.  The floods of the Nile left behind not only fertile silt, but also wetlands where dangerous animals were found.  Winds blowing from the desert brought sand, which covered the crops and canals.  Agriculture in Egypt was irrigated, and many kilometers of canals were built for this, which constantly had to be maintained in working condition.  The first inhabitants of the country had to spend more than one hundred years to turn Egypt into a fabulous place. </p><p>  The main agricultural crops of the Egyptians were wheat and barley.  Due to the unusual softness of the soil, sowing was peculiar.  At first the grain was simply scattered across the field, and then a herd of goats or pigs was chased through it.  They trampled grain into the soil with their hooves. </p>

    <p>  Harvested early - in April-May.  Ears collected in sheaves were threshed, again, with the help of cattle.  They laid out the crop on the ground and drove a herd along it.  The hooves did an excellent job and knocked the grain out of the shell. </p>
