Remember the Russian folk tales in which they themselves, as well as plants growing nearby, possessed mystical power. </p><p>  What kind of mysterious places are these?  Approximately 10% of the earth's surface is occupied by areas with a high level of moisture, capable of accumulating peat.  When its level becomes thirty centimeters, the site turns into a swamp, which in nature acts as a natural filter of water. </p><p>  Many believe that nothing grows in the swamps, but this is a fallacy.  The species composition of these sites is sometimes richer than the forest one.  For the most part, these are <span>moisture-loving plants</span> that prefer places where it is warm, with a lot of sun and water.  One of the most famous is the grassy marsh duckweed plant.  It is this small emerald plant that densely covers the water surface near the coast in the warm season, and in winter it sinks to the bottom of the reservoir, where it expects heat in the form of a kidney. </p><p>  Swamp plants can be divided into several groups.  Microphytes living at the very bottom of the swamp (approximately 6-meter depth).  Macrophytes live in the water column (further 3 meters from the coastal zone).  Plants of the first level inhabit the water space in one and a half - three meters from the coast.  The next level is represented by plants that occupied the water surface near the shore.  But in the immediate vicinity of the water grow trees and shrubs, representing coastal vegetation. </p><p>  Today, marsh plants are used with pleasure by owners of private houses to decorate their small <span>artificial ponds.</span>  Gardeners are very fond of <span>marsh marigolds,</span> terry golden flowers which in April will delight the eye with their splendor.  In May, clusters of white or pink flowers will delight you with a trifol, otherwise called a three-leafed shift.  Of course, you can not ignore the iris.  In height, this magnificent plant reaches 1 meter.  And the dense powerful leaves and flowers of stunning beauty will not leave anyone indifferent.  White, blue, bright yellow, violet and manganese flowers of iris, also called iris, can be planted both in a pond (the root layer of water should not exceed 30 centimeters) and in moderately moist garden soil.  These marsh plants will become your favorites.  In June - July, common calamus blooms.  The rhizomes of this miracle plant are widely used by traditional medicine.  Chastukha ordinary will delight you with its white flowers from June to September.  It can be planted at a depth of about 20 centimeters.  But the <span>broad-leaved cattail</span> will suit you only if you are the owner of a fairly large reservoir, since the plant reaches two meters in height.  For a small pond, a small cattail is more suitable, which in the autumn will surely attract attention with ears of flowers. </p><p>  Among ornamental herbs that can grow in wet places, gardeners prefer mannitol.  He is valued for the elegant <span>flowers of yellow</span> or white stripes.  This unpretentious plant loves heat, sun and moisture. </p><p>  Among other things, there are many trees and shrubs that prefer marshy soil.  By planting an alder, willow or birch near a pond, you will provide these trees with much-needed life-giving moisture.  Blueberries and cranberries, the favorite berries of most Russians, have always grown in swamps.  The beautiful melliferous plants heather and rosemary also prefer oversaturated areas. </p><p>  Many beautiful legends are composed of swamp plants.  Some of them are poisonous, and some are considered medicinal.  But be that as it may, the swamp plants will always amaze the imagination with a variety of colors.  No wonder many poets and composers were attracted and attracted by the mystery of the swamps, their bewitching beauty.  And marsh plants will always be a gift of the wild. </p>
