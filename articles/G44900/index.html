This satellite is under the scrutiny of scientists around the world, it is being studied not only from the Earth, but also from space.  However, our knowledge over the past decades in this area is not very enriched.  In addition, deeper secrets of the moon were revealed. </p><p>  At the time when the US Apollo program was completed, they began </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Human flight into space" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10523/24494.jpg" width="556"></div>  other areas of our solar system were explored, and less attention was paid to the <span>Earth's satellite</span> .  However, the moon does not cease to amaze to this day.  So, for example, in 1994, the Clementine automatic probe was launched, which became a joint project of NASA and SOI.  The main mission of the probe was to test advanced technologies, including new ultra-sensitive measuring instruments.  The images obtained by the device, taken at a distance of 400 km from the satellite‚Äôs surface, caused a lot of surprise among scientists: at the bottom of several craters located in the southern part of the moon, there is most likely frozen water.

    <p>  The fact is that until this moment the Moon was considered a dead body, the conditions on which exclude the possibility of ice.  These secrets </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Secrets of the moon" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10523/24493.jpg" width="600"></div>  The moon struck the scientists, because the day on the satellite is 28 times longer than Earth's and during the lunar day the surface heats up to 122 degrees.  Therefore, the logical question arises as to where the ice came from.  This is the second secret of the moon.  Of course, it can be assumed that water hit the satellite‚Äôs surface along with meteorites that have bombarded the celestial body for billions of years.  However, this version has not yet been confirmed, although it has not been refuted.

The most plausible version is the collision of our planet with a certain <span>celestial body,</span> which was close in size to Mars.  The countless fragments that remained in near-Earth orbit gradually gathered and formed the moon.  This theory is confirmed in </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mystery of the moon" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10523/24492.jpg" width="600"></div>  computer calculations: in order for this result to appear, the impact had to happen at a certain angle at a speed not exceeding 15 km / s.

    <p>  Another hypothesis tells us that this celestial body was previously a natural satellite of a large planet of the solar system.  More than 4 billion years ago, when the Earth was very young, ships from another intelligent civilization arrived in our system.  They decided that the third planet from the sun was perfect for protein forms of life.  However, there were several obstacles to the origin of life: it rotated too fast, and there were strong tidal processes.  After these conclusions, they took actions to eliminate these problems, namely: a satellite was ‚Äúattached‚Äù to the Earth.  "Fantasy!"  - you say.  However, until all the secrets of the moon are revealed, these versions also have the right to exist. </p><p>  In addition to these puzzles, NASA experts described the basic secrets of the moon that great scientists are trying to solve: How did the moon really become a satellite of the earth?  What is her story?  How and at what time did the craters appear on the satellite?  What is the story of the lunar atmosphere ... Of course, to answer these and other questions, it will take more than one man‚Äôs flight into space, and probably more than a century will pass before the moon becomes a satellite for us without mysteries and secrets. </p>
