    <h2>  Material selection </h2><p>  Naturalness is in fashion today, and therefore quilted cotton bedspreads are the best solution for any bedroom.  Flax, bamboo or cotton are suitable for such decoration.  If environmental friendliness of fabrics is not a priority, then you can consider mixed and synthetic fabrics, which are characterized by a special gloss.  So, for example, satin materials, as well as any curtain fabrics, are perfect for bedspreads. </p><p>  It is best to choose from the paintings designed for sewing curtains.  They have better density, width, and wear-resistant qualities, in contrast to materials for sewing clothes.  Cotton quilted bedspreads can also be sewn from natural curtains for curtains.  Such fabrics with a width of 220-240 cm allow you to make the product without joining and extra seams. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The lining fabric should also have a good density so that it does not wear out faster than the top of the bedspread.  For this purpose, curtain width fabrics are also suitable. </p>

    <p>  In addition to the main and <span>lining fabric,</span> a synthetic winterizer is needed.  Its thickness is also of great importance.  So, for example, a beautiful air cover will come out when using a thick synthetic winterizer.  Under it, you will not see possible folds from an unreflected blanket if the quilted cover was thrown onto the bed in a hurry.  In addition, when using a sintepon cloth with a large thickness, a stitched pattern will be more pronounced.  But this has its minus, because working with a thick canvas is more difficult. </p><h2>  Measurement and fabric calculation </h2><p>  In order for the bedspread to lie well on the bed, you should take measurements from it: the length of the bed and the width, the height of the mattress or the height of the bed with the mattress to the floor, if you plan to make bedspreads that cover the bed completely.  When measuring, you do not need to make any allowances, all the necessary centimeters for processing are laid during cutting. </p><h2>  Cut fabric </h2><p>  A quilted bedspread can be made in different versions.  It can be just a big rectangle that pounces on the bed, or bedspreads with ruffles and frills hanging on the border of the mattress.  Cutting and calculation of materials depend on the embodiment.  Each of them is good in its own way. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Option one: one-piece canvas </h2><p>  How to sew a quilted blanket duplicated by synthetic winterizer throughout the canvas?  For this, the fabric is cut in the form of a regular rectangle with sides equal: the length of the mattress + its height and the width of the mattress + 2 of its height.  At the same time, the corners on the opposite side of the head should be rounded so that the cover develops with beautiful forks.  When cutting, add 2 cm around the perimeter to process the edges.  In the same way, lining fabric should also be carved, but when cutting a synthetic winterizer, allowances are not made. </p><h2>  Work with the canvas </h2><p>  After cutting, the main fabric and the filler should be folded and swept first along the perimeter, and then along the patterned lines.  To do this, it is best to lay the canvas on the floor so that the layers do not move during operation.  If sewn-in additional decorative elements are planned, then it is better to stitch them before combining them with synthetic winterizer.  Also, before alignment, it is necessary to make markings on the front side of the product with chalk or a tailor's pencil.  When working with a thin synthetic winterizer, you can not use a basting, but chop the parts with tailor's needles. </p>

    <h2>  Design Ideas for One-Piece Bedspreads </h2><p>  They will help to beautifully design the quilted coverlet of the photo of the finished work.  It all depends on the selected canvas for the front side.  If this is a striped fabric, then it is best to quilt the product along their borders, if these are some kind of zigzags or waves, then, of course, the main lines of the pattern should be repeated.  This will give the picture volume and make it more expressive. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In the case of a monophonic fabric, it is better to use the method of stitching the repetition of cuts around the perimeter, in some quilted seams you can add fringe, braid with beads or simple frills made of fabric.  It can be a contrasting addition or executed in the same color.  There are absolutely no restrictions, it all depends on the imagination.  Here is the place for satin and organza ribbons, lace, stitches, ribbons and even sewn stones. </p>

    <p>  It should be noted that such a blanket will visually increase the bed, and therefore if there is not so much space in the room, then it is better to use the following option. </p><h2>  Option Two: Quilted Bedspread with Sewn Frill </h2><p>  This version is slightly different from the previous one.  Here, a slightly different calculation of the fabric will be required, since the product consists of two parts: warp and frills.  For the first element, you need a cut equal to the width and length of the bed + 2-3 cm, for the second - a strip of fabric equal to the height of the bed from the top of the mattress to the floor and the length of the perimeter multiplied by three.  This frill can be composite, sewn from separate segments. </p><p>  The manufacturing process is similar to the first option: the front sheet is combined with a synthetic winterizer, flushed and trimmed on a machine.  After they proceed to work with the frill.  At the edge of the top of the strip, the fabric is collected with folds (plain or bow).  The bottom of the frill can be overlaid, bent and stitched, giving the appropriate allowance for cutting, or processed with a <span>slanting inlay.</span> </p>

    <p>  After the finished element is sewn around the perimeter of the finished blankets blankets, leaving the cut at the head of the head free. </p><p>  Such products should not be overloaded with additional finishing elements, especially if the fabric is textured or has a pronounced pattern.  Quilts on the main canvas and dense folds along the sides will be enough.  If the fabric is very simple, then at the junction of the connection you can sew a braid with beads to match the fabric. </p><h2>  Work with lining </h2><p>  Sewing a lining is one of the easiest steps.  This item is sewn the same in both versions.  Lining fabric cuts out the same size as the main.  It is folded with the base face to face, tucked in all the folds, if any, and sew along the perimeter, leaving open about 30 cm in the middle of the side of the head.  After the product is turned out and slightly steamed with a minimum temperature of heating the iron.  At the final stage of work, the open hole should be stitched or sewn up manually.  To stabilize the edge, you can lay a line around the perimeter, departing from it 2-3 cm. </p><p>  A chic quilted bedspread, the masterclass of which is described above, can be easily created at home using a household sewing machine.  Fantasy, diligence and attentiveness are the best assistants in this matter. </p><h2>  Textiles in the interior of the bedroom and decorative elements </h2><p>  The bedspread in the bedroom interior is one of the key elements that sets the mood for the whole room.  Therefore, it is very important to choose the right color that will be combined with the color of furniture and interior decoration. </p>

    <p>  <span>Cotton</span> quilted <span>bedspreads</span> in ensemble with curtains made of identical material look great.  And in this case, it is better to leave all the decorations in the form of a fringe, braid and other decorative elements for the decoration of the bed.  At the same time, the cover itself can be done in a calm style, and the pillows will be used as decor.  Round, square, rectangular, large and small - they will give a special charm, make the bed even more attractive and comfortable. </p><h2>  Practical Tips for Working with Tissues </h2><p>  If a satin fabric or cotton is used in the work, then they should be sewn with a thin needle and a small step.  This will avoid ugly assemblies at the seams.  At the same time, the sheets can not be pulled so that the needle does not break.  It should also be noted that atlas and cotton do not like steaming, as a result of which spots may remain on them that will not pass even after washing.  Also, during processing, accuracy must be observed, since even from the thinnest needle on the canvas there are holes. </p><p>  But linen and bamboo fabric are not so moody.  Here you can take the needle with the number 85 or 90, and sew at the maximum step, which simplifies the work. </p>
