Where should the functional antenna outlet be located? </p><p>  To get the best quality signal, experts recommend using a modern effective cable, such as SAT 703. The use of PK-75 cables and their analogs is now not at all relevant.  Causes: </p><ol><li>  Poor signal quality. </li><li>  The cable is highly susceptible to waves from electrical appliances. </li></ol><p>  Therefore, it is wise to lay modern cables.  If in the apartment the cables go to the TVs, a special wiring is used, then it is better to arrange the wires at least 10 cm apart. Although many modern TVs have special filters.  They protect against interference in the household electrical network.  And household appliances with radiation are becoming less and less.  If the house has such a technique, then the specified criterion can not be observed and the <span>wires are mounted</span> more tightly. </p><h2>  Mounting schemes for television outlets </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.ableis.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mounting schemes for television outlets" class="if uuid-2676856" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100377/2676856.jpg"></div><p>  If the apartment has at least two televisions, and there is only one aperture for the antenna cable to enter, competent wiring is necessary.  For this, a special splitter is used - a splitter.  It has one input and 2-4 outputs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Connecting an antenna outlet can be done in several ways.  The choice of a particular scheme is determined by the specifics of the apartment and the conditions of work. </p><p>  There are such schemes for these operations: </p><ol><li>  "Star". </li><li>  Passing through. </li></ol><h2>  Scheme "Star" </h2><div class="photo" data-original="srnr.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="star antenna connection diagram" class="if uuid-2676892" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100377/2676892.jpg"></div><p>  When an antenna signal or a signal in a cable system is characterized by good power, a special signal amplifier is not required.  The signal is simply routed to the desired number of TV outlets.  Otherwise, such an amplifier is necessary.  And for him, you need to provide a place with a power adapter in the distributor.  The input of this device is connected to the antenna, and the output should be on a TV, splitter.  In the above diagram, it is located to the adder. </p><p>  Installation of antenna sockets according to this scheme is very popular.  The reasons for this are as follows: </p><ol><li>  Cable output is obtained from one section.  This greatly facilitates the installation of the distribution box. </li><li>  Signals practically do not fade. </li><li>  If any antenna outlet is faulty, this does not affect other such elements in the network. </li></ol><p>  The main disadvantage of this scheme is associated with a solid waste of antenna cable.  But if the owners make repairs for many years, then saving on cable is not logical here. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Pass-through circuit </h2><div class="photo" data-original="domvpavlino.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="loop-through antenna connection" class="if uuid-2676915" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100377/2676915.jpg"></div><p>  Installation of antenna sockets according to this scheme sequentially connects them into a group.  The number of outlets depends on their models and brands.  For example, for Schneider models from the Uniqua category, the maximum number of power outlets is 3. The reason is that in each such outlet the signal attenuates in a certain way. </p><p>  The final outlet in this regard is the terminal.  The combined image is reflected in the presented image.  Here the sockets are connected using a single and pass-through method.  Where the splitter comes out, on the left side there is a standard single antenna socket (TV1- in the diagram).  On the right side there are through sockets, three pieces (TV2-TV4).  Also at the end of the circuit there is another outlet - terminal (TV5). </p><p>  If the signal from the provider is very powerful, you can arrange a circuit of 10 outlets (maximum). </p><p>  This connection method allows you to seriously save on the purchase of an antenna cable.  There are also its weaknesses: </p><ol><li>  A contact may break in the initial outlet, or it may be of poor quality.  As a result, subsequent outlets remain without a signal. </li><li>  High price tags. </li></ol><h2>  Varieties of television outlets </h2><p>  An outlet with an antenna has three varieties, namely: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  Terminal.  They close the passing wiring. </li><li>  Walkthroughs.  Designed for loopback circuitry.  In it, they are assigned the following positions: the very beginning and the middle. </li><li>  Single or standard.  Usually involved in the "Star" scheme.  Their connection goes directly to the splitter. </li></ol><h2>  The nuances of choosing a TV outlet </h2><p>  When choosing a suitable outlet, it is important to consider such factors: </p><ol><li>  Type of wires.  They should not degrade the interior, they must be suitable for flush mounting. </li><li>  The number of working TVs and how to connect them.  Both walk-through and single outlets may be required.  For example, in order to effectively connect three receivers, you need to mount three sockets: two pass-through, one terminal. </li><li>  Their appearance.  It should be characterized by accuracy and attractiveness. </li><li>  Materials must be very durable. </li><li>  Convenience for installation work and subsequent operation. </li></ol><h2>  Top TV Positions </h2><p>  Today, very often the TV is mounted on the wall.  This requires calculations of its optimal positions.  The positions of the screen are determined by the location of the furniture and the place from which it is mainly planned to watch TV programs.  Experts do not recommend placing the receiver in front of the window. </p><p>  Be sure to hide the outlet block.  For the final decision on the height of the TV, the preferred viewing position is used. </p><div class="photo" data-original="normdom.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Receiver height" class="if uuid-2676922" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100377/2676922.jpg"></div><p>  Thanks to the correct calculations in this matter: </p><ol><li>  Sockets, contacts, wires will completely hide behind the TV. </li><li>  The TV is pressed against the wall as tightly as possible, will become part of the design. </li><li>  Difficulties with the bracket for the receiver will disappear. </li><li>  It will be easy to connect: twisted pairs, HDMI cable, hard drive and other communications. </li></ol><p>  Installation of an antenna outlet in living rooms is usually done at a height of 1.3-1.4 m from the floor to the middle of the outlet. </p><p>  The calculation of the position of the outlet in other places should take into account the height of the TV mount.  Half the height of this receiver is added to it.  Next, the height of the outlet frame is subtracted. </p><p>  Example. </p><p>  The TV has a height of 50 cm (half - 25).  The height of its fasteners is 135 cm, and the frames are 9 cm. The arithmetic is simple: 135 + 25 - 9 = 153 cm. This is the optimal height for the outlet block.  According to these results, sockets usually do not reach the top edge of the TV 4-5 cm (minimum). </p><h2>  TV cable preparation </h2><p>  The antenna outlet is connected to the receiver using a piece of cable and two adapters (for a TV and an outlet).  The length is calculated, a part is cut off from the cable.  For adapters, both ends are prepared. </p><p>  A circular incision is made from the edge at a distance of 1.2-1.5 cm along the outer insulation.  It is important not to damage the braid.  PVC insulation remains.  The uninsulated braid needs to be twisted, folded up and carefully cut. </p><p>  A second similar incision follows the dielectric at a distance of 1-2 cm from the edge.  The dielectric itself is eliminated, the core is exposed (it is made of copper).  Screw the F-connector onto the cable.  Then you can screw the plug having a tip.  The same operations are performed with the other end of the cable. </p><p>  The cable is prepared.  With it, the outlet interacts with the TV.  Next, you can install the outlet, strictly following the correct algorithm of actions. </p><h2>  Criteria for proper installation of a TV outlet </h2><p>  For example, a single Schneider product is used.  Its name is MGU5.462.18ZD. </p><div class="photo" data-original="stroyers.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="antenna socket Schneider MGU5.462.18ZD" class="if uuid-2678158" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100377/2678158.jpg"></div><p>  The following is a step-by-step instruction on how to connect such an antenna outlet </p><p>  <span>1. The</span> body is removed <span>from the</span> outlet.  Cut out the space for the sock - mounting box.  From the cable coming out of it, you need to save 15 cm. </p><p>  2. Eliminate part of its outer insulation.  Only the shielding braid and the main core remain.  How many centimeters should remain is indicated in the image below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="radiolubitel.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Millimeters when cutting cable" class="if uuid-2676956" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100377/2676956.jpg"></div><p>  3. The front panel is removed.  The clamping screw loosens.  So the cable will freely penetrate the hole provided for it. </p><p>  For a better view, an image of the outlet is proposed below the cable entry </p><p>  A hole is circled in the photo through which you can visually control the connections of the main cable core. </p><p>  The second hole is for the screen.  These are the contact areas for connecting the outlet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="radiolubitel.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Desired holes" class="if uuid-2676995" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100377/2676995.jpg"></div><p>  4. The cable is placed in the hole according to the arrow to the limit and clamped.  A clamping mechanism is used for clamping.  The screw turns.  Excessive efforts are not needed here.  The main thing is that the cable should not hang.  Otherwise, the incoming signal may contain interference. </p><p>  5. Before placing the outlet in the installation box, you need to ring it.  For this, a tester is used.  The task is to identify a short circuit of the braid with the main core.  If there is no short circuit and other shortcomings, you can put a power outlet. </p><p>  6. Without cable bends, the socket is neatly placed in the mounting box and secured with screws.  The front console of the outlet is put on and snaps into place.  Before final fixing of the screws and placement of the frame, the socket is aligned.  A mini level is used. </p><p>  7. The decorative frame is fixed.  This is the culmination of the installation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="stroyers.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Culmination of work" class="if uuid-2677008" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100377/2677008.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The operation of self-mounting a television outlet is not difficult.  It is important to correctly position the TV, the position of the outlet and follow the steps of the designated algorithm. </p>
