    <h2>  How to choose earphones? </h2><p>  First of all, experts recommend paying attention to the shape of the seal.  In some cases, manufacturers greatly save on the lining material.  Good devices are usually made of silicone.  Also on the market are many foam models.  The rated power of the vacuum headphones fluctuates around 50 watts. </p><p>  Many devices use a wave overload protection system.  Micro drivers are used both operational and pulse type.  Cords are most often used with a copper braid.  Inserts are installed polyurethane type.  Special attention should be paid to the quality of the diffuser.  The output frequency must be at least 20 Hz.  In order for the bass to be heard well, an amplifier is needed.  In this regard, membrane vacuum headphones are very good.  However, the advantage of connector devices lies in excellent sound insulation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Dolby Sounds technology is not supported on all devices.  Professionals prefer fixed coil models.  Their nominal pressure is 4 N. The ultimate resistance in this case is at 60 Ohms.  For reproducing <span>low frequencies</span> this is very good.  <span>Active noise reduction systems</span> are rare.  In-ear headphones (photos are presented in the article) of this type are more suitable for audio engineers. </p><h2>  Membrane Models </h2><p>  Membrane in-ear headphones are needed to smooth frequencies.  Membrane models are used in various thicknesses.  In order to choose a high-quality device, special attention should be paid to the power parameter.  It averages 40 watts.  Systems of protection against frequency vibrations are used in the first and second class.  In terms of tightness, membrane modifications are very different. </p><p>  Their output impedance is 30 ohms.  Acoustic shutters are used both unipolar and bipolar type.  They differ in signal conductivity.  Inserts are most often made from rubber.  These headphones can last about 5 years.  In this case, a lot depends on the type of cord.  In many models, it is used with a polyurethane braid.  You can buy good membrane headphones at a price of 10 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Connector Devices </h2><p>  Connector in-ear headphones - what is it?  These devices are manufactured with fixed coils.  The connector on the models allows you to cope well with low frequencies.  The nominal power of the headphones is 35 watts.  The average overload indicator is 2.7 A. The nozzle in devices is most often installed with a round cross section. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The sound insulation parameter lies in the region of 60%.  The tightness of the connector devices is very different.  Microdrivers are used only pulse type.  Amplifier devices are rare.  The main problem with this type of headphone is low impedance.  The bass of the models is hard to hear.  You can buy high-quality headphone jacks at a price of 8 thousand rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Single nozzle models </h2><p>  Want to buy single in-ear headphones?  Which to choose?  First of all, it is important to evaluate the power of the modification, as well as the permissible overload.  As a rule, experts recommend choosing 20 W models.  Their overload parameter is on average 2.6 A. The system of protection against frequency interference is rarely used.  The output impedance of the models is at 55 ohms.  Connectors are often used with adapters.  Overlapping of the ear canal depends on the shape of the lining.  Inserts on the market are the most diverse.  The most popular are considered silicone devices.  However, it is important to note that they are quite expensive.  They wash without problems.  In this case, alcoholic cleaners must not be used. </p><p>  If we consider membrane devices of this type, then the power must be at least 22 watts.  Overload in this case is about 2.6 A. Devices with acoustic shutters are rare.  Coils are most often used fixed type.  The heads in this case can vary greatly in shape.  Modifications with long nozzles are rare.  The output impedance of a vacuum headphone must be at least 50 ohms.  There is a good model in the region of 9 thousand rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Double nozzle devices </h2><p>  Are you going to buy in-ear headphones?  "Which one to choose?"  - important question.  Models of this type must have rubber pads.  Membrane devices are selected with a power of 12 V. The system of protection against frequency vibrations is not used in all devices.  Microdrivers, many experts recommend using a pulse type.  Comfort fit in the ear is checked separately.  The output frequency must be at least 30 Hz.  The output resistance in this case is welcomed at the level of 25 m. Modern modifications are made with high-quality seals.  On average, headphones of this type cost about 12 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Triple nozzle models </h2><p>  Triple in-ear headphones - what is it?  Devices of this type are manufactured with moving heads.  Nozzles are installed on the seals.  For voicing high frequencies models are ideal.  The maximum pressure in them does not exceed 4.6 N. Coils are most often used with adapters.  Models do a good job with bass. </p><p>  Many modifications use a smoothing system.  The frequency of the device is different.  Output power, as a rule, does not exceed 22 watts.  Inserts are made of both rubber and silicone.  The latter option is more preferred.  The headphone nozzle is used only with a circular cross section.  You can buy a good model in the store at a price of 10 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Ear shape earphones </h2><p>  Ear- <span>shaped</span> in <span>-ear</span> headphones are very comfortable.  Membrane modifications are mainly represented on the market.  Coils are used with moving heads.  Many models use a frequency smoothing system.  They withstand a nominal resistance of 45 ohms.  Cords are used with both rubber and copper braids. </p><p>  The output frequency is at least 23 Hz.  Good models use the Dolby Sounds system.  Diffusers are rarely used.  The conductivity parameter of the vacuum headphones fluctuates around 5.6 microns.  The ultimate tightness parameter, as a rule, is not more than 85%.  You can buy high-quality headphones of this type at a price of 13 thousand rubles. </p>
