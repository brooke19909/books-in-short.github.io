    <h2>  Location and Territory </h2><p>  Hotel "Alexandria" (Vityazevo) is not directly on the beach.  Its location can be called, rather, the second line from the sea.  Nevertheless, it is located in the coastal zone.  The hotel offers excellent views of the sea and the fine sand of the beaches.  On the territory of the complex there are two beautifully decorated green areas intended for recreation, as well as arbors.  The main building of Alexandria has a column in order to wash sand off its feet.  All this is being watched, guarded, it is very clean here.  Given that in almost all Anapa hotels, even the most modern, the territory is a stone or concrete site, this is a big plus.  There is a bazaar between the sea and the hotel, which is very convenient if you want to buy food.  Not far from the hotel there are an aquapark and a dolphinarium, which Vityazevo is famous for.  Alexandria Hotel is located between the Greek-style Paralia Embankment and Svetlaya Street, so you can choose several roads to the sea if you wish.  In addition, the territory is not very noisy, thanks again to a good location. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  There are 88 rooms in all eight buildings of the Alexandria-Akhtuba complex (Vityazevo).  Hotels are not very large, rather, homely.  23 rooms are classified as standard, 8 are luxury.  There are also improved rooms, studios of different comforts and apartments.  Five buildings belong to the Alexandria Hotel, and three to Akhtuba.  The hotel also offers small budget rooms with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãten square meters.  Almost all guest rooms have bathrooms with good doors, not curtains, refrigerators and televisions.  Everywhere there are air conditioners with split systems, towel dryers.  We can say that "suites" from "economists" differ only in area.  Baby cots in rooms are free of charge.  On the windows - mosquito nets.  Most rooms have kettles, but some guests suggest that plastic cups should be requested from the administration.  If you wish, put a table and chairs on the balcony.  They do the cleaning when you order it and at a time convenient for you. </p>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  As a rule, tourists go for tanning and sea bathing in Vityazevo.  Hotel "Alexandria" in this case is a very good choice.  The hotel building is located one hundred meters from the sea.  The beach here is sandy, good.  The entrance to the water is very gentle.  You need to walk a few tens of meters, so that the depth is chest.  Therefore, it is suitable for children, and parents have nothing to worry about.  In addition, the beach is very wide, and there is always a place, even by the water.  There are many kinds of entertainment here - bananas, boating, "pills", sea excursions.  The beach is equipped - there are sunbeds, toilets.  But all these services are paid.  In addition, the hotel Alexandria (Vityazevo) has four more pools.  One of them is children's.  They are clean, but with cool water, without heating.  Vacationers write that it‚Äôs nice to swim in them. </p><h2>  Vityazevo, Alexandria: reviews </h2><p>  The guests of this hotel complex like its location, views, the presence of several pools at once, which avoids crowding in case of bad weather or sea unrest.  For a vacation in Russia, this is one of those opportunities that is very well balanced in the price-quality category.
