    <h2>  Decorate booties from mastic </h2><p>  To decorate booties, it will be possible to additionally make laces, flowers, muzzles of animals, bows.  Everything is up to you. </p><p>  To make shoes, we need a pattern of booties from mastic, for the manufacture of which we need thick paper.

    <h2>  Booties size </h2><p>  <span>Pattern of booties</span> from mastic is done in a short period of time.  The process will take you no more than half an hour.  Culinary paste booties for cake can be of different sizes.  The full-sized booties pattern from mastic has the following approximate measurements. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Foot: </p><ol><li>  Length - 100 mm. </li><li>  Width in its widest part is 45 mm. </li><li>  Width in its narrowest part (heel) - 35 mm. </li></ol><p>  Front of booties: </p><ol><li>  Width in the widest part - 100 mm; </li><li>  Toe part (with tongue) - 65 mm. </li></ol><p>  The back of the booties has a length of 14 cm. Make all roundings smooth. </p><p>  Booties from mastic (patterns, photos of which are provided in this article) should not be too large.  It all depends on the size of the cake itself. </p><p>  You can make booties from mastic for a girl (a pattern for children of both sexes is provided above) or a boy.  You can dream up and decorate shoes for a cake intended for a girl with beads, bows or lace.  All this can also be done from mastic. </p><h2>  What is necessary for future booties? </h2><ol><li>  Tools for working with culinary paste (if any). </li><li>  About 100 g of mastic, prepared independently or purchased. </li><li>  Food coloring (if necessary) - approximately 0.5 ml. </li><li>  Starch, powdered sugar - 2 tbsp each </li><li>  Pattern of 3 patterns. </li></ol><h2>  Making booties on a pattern </h2><p>  So, we already have a pattern, and now we begin to manufacture the booties themselves from mastic.  Take a pre-bought or cooked pasta yourself.  It is generally accepted that booties intended for a boy are blue and pink for a girl.  But you can make them in any color. </p><p>  If our mastic still has a white color, then it must be painted using food coloring.  To do this, take 2/3 of the total mass of white, add one drop of dye and mix thoroughly for dyeing in a plain color. </p><p>  We roll the colored mastic with a rolling pin on a special board or table to a thickness of 1-5 mm.  Before working with mastic, the working surface must be crushed with starch and powdered sugar, after mixing them, otherwise it may stick to the table or pulp. </p><p>  You can make booties with or without a picture.  If you have a special rolling pin with a relief, use it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mastic booties for girls pattern" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32960/1415779.jpg"></div>

    <p>  We apply our templates alternately on the rolled mastic sheet and cut out 2 pieces (for 2 booties).  Thus, we should get 6 parts: 2 feet, 2 front and 2 back.  Now we will collect our booties.  First we make 2 holes on the backs of the booties in the upper corners. </p><p>  Using a roller or kitchen knife (spoon), it is necessary to make the edges of the sole as thin as possible.  We perform the same procedure with the front of the booties.  Now you need to process a small amount of water with a brush, the edges of the sole and the front of the inside for better bonding.  We glue together the sole and the front so that we get slippers that look like a room slipper without a backdrop.  In order for our shoe not to lose shape during the production process due to sagging, it is necessary to put a paper towel inside, which will subsequently need to be removed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="booties from mastic pattern master class" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32960/1415778.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Roll out a thin sheet from the rest of the white mastic.  Using recesses or plungers, we cut out flowers for our future booties.  We decorate the upper part of the shoes with them.  We wet the back of our slipper with a small amount of water and glue the back to it. </p><p>  We roll out not very thick sausages from white mastic.  These will be shoe laces.  Carefully put them into booties into pre-cut holes and tie them. </p><p>  Now we leave our booties until the mastic completely hardens on a dry, powdered mixture of starch and powdered sugar, on the surface.  After our booties are completely dry, we take out napkins from them. </p><p>  Mastic booties may look different.  Patterns can be completely different sizes, types.  But do not forget that the foundation should always consist of 3 parts: the foot, front and back parts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="full size mastic booties pattern" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32960/1415781.jpg"></div>
