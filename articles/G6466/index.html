There are many visitors here.  These are not only Muscovites, but also residents of villages and towns near Moscow.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe construction market could not satisfy the needs of all citizens, and it was decided to open new trading floors.  So the market ‚ÄúKashirsky Yard-1‚Äù saw the light;  and then 2nd and 3rd. </p>

    <p>  The Kashirsky Dvor-1 market was established in 1994 and has been pleasing customers for 20 years.  However, so that the excitement of new acquisitions is not overshadowed, you need to check the purchase, as they say, without departing from the cash register.  After all, the enterprise is a wholesale one.  When a lot of goods is purchased, there may be inconsistencies.  So that, having arrived at the cottage, not to find that the seller of Kashirsky Dvor gave 29 instead of thirty paving slabs, it is necessary to count and check everything is still in place.  There have been cases when the poor fellow buyer, having come to his senses after a few hours, began to call and demand his own, but in this case it is difficult to prove the case. </p><h3>  How to get to the market and where is it located? </h3><p>  By car, reaching the cherished goal is not at all difficult.  Building materials are located on the Moscow Ring Road.  Those who live in the southern district of Moscow will arrive here in a few minutes.  Of course, it is important to consider traffic jams, as they significantly extend the travel time.  If snowfall began in the capital, as always unexpectedly, then it is better not to take trips that day.  It is also undesirable to visit the markets of the Kashira courtyard from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m., since at this time the traffic in this section may stall.  The rest of the time, traveling here is much easier. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
