  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The most luxurious seven-star hotels in the world: review, description, rating</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  From our article you will learn about seven-star hotels.  Officially, the hotel rating system ends with five stars.  But in the world there are several hotels that are usually called seven-star.  Why is that?  Often this is either a beautiful description made by journalists or the marketing move of the hotel itself.  Although when looking at the rooms it is sometimes very difficult to disagree with the title ‚Äúseven-star hotel‚Äù, as the level of luxury in them is just off scale.  So, let's figure out where such hotels are located, why they are good, why they are so valued.  In addition, we will consider the cost of accommodation for the night. </p><h2>  Hotel Burj Al Arab.  First place in the ranking </h2><p>  So what are the seven star hotels in Dubai?  Where can you relax luxuriously?  These include Burj Al Arab.  For one night a person will need to pay about 112 thousand rubles. </p><p>  ‚ÄúBurj al-Arab‚Äù is the very first hotel in the world about which the phrase ‚Äúseven-star‚Äù was spoken.  The name of the hotel translates as "Arab Tower."  This hotel was built in 1994.  Its opening took place in December 1999.  Already at that time, each number was assigned its own butler. </p><p>  Note that the building of this now seven-star hotel stands on an artificial island in the sea, which is connected to land by a bridge.  The hotel has its own helipad.  Located on one of the upper floors of the restaurant "El Muntaha."  Its name translates as "Supreme." </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tablethotels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="burj al arab in dubai" class="if uuid-3209807" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/3209807.jpg"></div><p>  In the lobby of the hotel, each guest will notice all signs of luxury, namely: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  huge aquariums in the walls; </li><li>  unique mosaic on the floor; </li><li>  illuminated step fountain. </li></ul><p>  The atrium lobby of the hotel is considered the highest in the whole world.  At a height of 80 m there is a ceiling.  About 8 thousand square meters of 22-carat gold leaf were used in the interiors. </p><p>  This hotel has no ordinary rooms at all.  Each consists of two floors.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe largest is 780 m2, and the smallest is 170 m2.  These rooms are well located.  Moreover, they are all equipped with modern technology.  The design in the rooms is expensive and exclusive.  Their distinctive feature is the huge-sized windows on the entire wall, from which the view opens directly to the sea. </p><p>  On the official website of Burj Al-Arab, it is indicated that this is a five-star deluxe hotel.  But unofficially, he is given exactly seven stars. </p><h2>  Emirates Palace Hotel.  Description of hotel and rooms </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.aroundtheworldl.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Emirates Palace in the UAE" class="if uuid-3209811" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/3209811.jpg"></div><p>  The next hotel in the ranking, which you will learn about, is located in the United Arab Emirates, namely in Abu Dhabi.  For one night a person needs to pay about 35 thousand rubles for accommodation. </p><p>  This seven-star hotel is positioning itself as a "palace".  It opened in 2005 to show the world the luxury and richness of Arab culture. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The hotel is located on the beach, surrounded by 85 hectares of lawns and greenery.  In the main building, a large patterned dome is lined with real gold from the inside. </p><p>  In total, the hotel has 394 rooms, of which 92 are luxury, and the rest are ordinary.  Although they can‚Äôt be called econom or standard.  The level of comfort in them is many times higher.  The suites are all decorated with marble and gold.  Note that 6 suites are reserved for senior guests. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.aroundtheworldl.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Emirates Palace in Abu Dhabi" class="if uuid-3209809" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/3209809.jpg"></div><p>  The Emirates Palace Hotel in Abu Dhabi has everything you need for a comfortable stay for guests.  There are necessary sites for sports recreation, namely: </p><ul><li>  tennis courts; </li><li>  beach club with a running and cycling (6 km) track; </li><li>  rugby fields; </li><li>  pools; </li><li>  football fields. </li></ul><h2>  Townhouse galleria </h2><p>  Describing the seven-star hotels of the world, one cannot help but recall what is in Milan (third place in the ranking).  It is called ‚ÄúTownhouse Gallery‚Äù.  The cost of living per day per person starts from 27.5 thousand rubles. </p><p>  The hotel is located in the center of Milan opposite the main cathedral.  It is located in the famous gallery Vittorio Emmanuele II.  The hotel was opened in 2007, and a year later announced that it received seven stars from SGS Italy.  Note that SGC Italy is not an official travel agency, and their rating is limited to only five stars.  But each guest of the establishment will agree that the service in the ‚ÄúTown House Gallery‚Äù is at the highest level. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="galleria.townhousehotels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="townhouse galleria hotel" class="if uuid-3209819" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/3209819.jpg"></div><p>  The hotel offers both standard and luxury rooms of the presidential class.  In total, the hotel has 46 rooms, of which three are the most expensive.  The windows from them go directly to the gallery.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãone studio is about 70 m2.  There are two more rooms with separate living rooms.  I would also like to say about large marble rooms and huge beds.  The rooms have the highest class interior, and for greater comfort guests have made high-quality soundproofing. </p><h2>  Pangu 7 Star Hotel (Morgan Plaza).  Chic hotel, chic rooms </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.kiwicollection.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel pangu 7 star hotel" class="if uuid-3209821" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/3209821.jpg"></div><p>  The next seven-star hotel is in Beijing.  The cost of living per person per night here starts from 20 thousand rubles.  The hotel is called "Pangu Plaza", it is made in the shape of a dragon, located in the Olympic Village.  This hotel is considered the most luxurious not only in the city, but also in the country.  About seven stars of the hotel is already mentioned in the title so that guests do not have doubts about the high class.  Those who are already checking into the hotel immediately realize that they are in a really luxurious place.  The hall in the hotel is very beautiful: it is decorated with wood and marble carvings. </p><p>  In all 234 rooms you can see a combination of European comfort and Chinese culture.  The walls here are covered with silk wallpaper.  The furniture in the rooms is clearly arranged according to Feng Shui, and Chinese-style paintings hang above the beds.  All rooms have a DVD player, digital fireplace and 2 flat-screen TVs.  All rooms are spacious, bright, with a wonderful view of the stadium, the city. </p><p>  Standard rooms are relatively inexpensive in this hotel.  But there is a special one that gives each guest the opportunity to experience seven stars.  It is called Sky Courtyard.  This huge (720 m2) room is located on the 23rd floor.  At the same time, there is a separate elevator for lifting.  This room also has its own rooftop garden and pool.  But the cost of these apartments is sky-high. </p><h2>  TheMarkHotel.  Wonderful stay </h2><p>  The next hotel, which we will consider, is also officially equated to five stars, but has a prefix "deluxe".  Therefore, it is often called seven-star.  The hotel has a lot of regalia.  The cost of living per day is from 31 thousand per person. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cntraveler.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel the mark hotel" class="if uuid-3209822" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/3209822.jpg"></div><p>  The hotel is housed in a 1927 building on the Upper East Side.  Relatively recently (in 2009) the interior was completely updated.  French designer Jacques Grange took part in its creation. </p><p>  This hotel has 156 rooms, of which 56 are suites, and the rest are ordinary.  And in 2015, they opened a chic penthouse suite (two-story) on the 16th and 17th floors.  The luxury here is just off scale.  The penthouse has 6 bathrooms, 4 fireplaces, a dining room, 5 bedrooms, a library, a large hall.  There is also a terrace with views of Central Park and the city. </p><p>  More recently, 2 large suites (with three and five bedrooms) with terraces appeared on the 14th floor of the hotel. </p><h2>  Signiel Seoul.  A brief description of the hotel in South Korea </h2><p>  Accommodation per day costs from 25 thousand per person.  The hotel was opened recently - in April 2017.  It is located in a 123-story building on 76-101 floors.  In total, the hotel has 235 extra-class rooms.  In addition to the usual, there are suites, including the royal (the most expensive in South Korea).  The royal area - 353 m2, is located on the 100th floor, and a night in it will cost about one million rubles. </p><p>  The hotel has several restaurants with award-winning chefs. </p><h2>  Taj Falaknuma Palace in Hyderabad (India) </h2><p>  For accommodation per day you need to pay from 42 thousand rubles per person.  The building of a seven-star hotel in 1884 was built.  Previously, it belonged to the ruler of the Principality of Hyderabad, who was the richest man in the world at that time.  That is, the word ‚Äúpalace‚Äù in the title can be considered justified. </p><p>  In the fifties of the last century, this building was abandoned, and it has already been bought back in the two thousandth.  Restoration work began in 2010 under the leadership of Princess Ezra, the first wife of VIII Nizam Hyderabad.  It was thanks to her that the palace was recreated in all its splendor. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amoma.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.amoma.com/hotel-taj-falaknuma-palace-337128/ru"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel taj falaknuma palace" class="if uuid-3209823" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/3209823.jpg"></div><p>  Note that in this hotel, in addition to ordinary rooms, there are royal suites and historical rooms.  Of particular note is the Nizam Suite.  This chic room features a large marble bath, private pool and exclusive spa access. </p><h2>  Little conclusion </h2><p>  Our article discusses the world's most famous seven-star hotels.
