Yes, because a good Turkish hotel offers a wonderful family vacation, which will be interesting to absolutely all family members.  We want to talk about one of these institutions in our article.  The Royal Wings Hotel (Turkey) is a five-star complex on the <span>coast of Antalya</span> , offering excellent food and good service. </p><h2>  A bit about the hotel </h2><p>  The Royal Wings Hotel (Turkey) was built in 2005, so it can be attributed to relatively young institutions.  It has a very vast territory, about 72,000 square meters.  The complex is located in the village of Lana, 15 kilometers from the airport and 17 kilometers from Antalya.  Such close proximity to the airport makes it possible to quickly reach the hotel after the flight and not languish on the bus. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Royal Wings Hotel Turkey" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1949662.jpg" width="600"></div>

In addition, the hotel has four √† la carte restaurants: fish, Far Eastern, Italian and Turkish.  Each of them can be visited only with prior reservation.  The concept of "all inclusive" involves one free visit to any of the institutions once a week. </p><p>  There are also nine bars throughout the complex. </p><h2>  Complex infrastructure </h2><p>  The description of the Royal Wings Hotel (Turkey) would be incomplete if not to mention its sufficiently developed infrastructure.  In fact, the hotel complex is a mini-city in which there is everything necessary for vacationers, from food to entertainment.  It is for the good organization of leisure that our holidaymakers appreciate Turkish resorts. </p><p>  The Royal Wings Hotel (Turkey), as we have already mentioned, has a fairly large territory, which is well equipped and thought out to the smallest detail.  The reception desk serves guests around the clock.  On the territory there is parking for the transport of guests, as well as Fantastic Park - a large water park with slides for adults and 3 for children.  In addition, hotel guests have the opportunity to visit the amusement park, which has all kinds of swings and even a ferris wheel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="royal wings turkey" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1949664.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The hotel has its own spa, dry cleaning and laundry services.  Currency exchange and car rental are available in the lobby.  The hotel has several shops that sell all kinds of little things for tourists.  The business center of the complex has three large rooms for business events. </p><h2>  Children's services </h2><p>  The Royal Wings Hotel (Turkey) is focused on family vacations, so a significant part of the infrastructure is designed specifically for young guests of the resort. </p><p>  The complex has a good kids club that accepts children from four to twelve years old.  Here, the animators are organizing leisure activities for kids.  The hotel also has a children's playground and a pool with slides for children. </p><p>  In the main restaurant, on request, children's chairs are provided for feeding.  The range of establishments has a special children's menu.  If necessary, babysitting services can be ordered at the reception. </p><p>  Children's events are organized not only in the daytime, but also in the evening. </p><h2>  Sports and Entertainment </h2><p>  Royal Wings (Turkey) offers a fairly wide range of entertainment for its guests, so that the rest becomes not only comfortable, but also interesting.  Tourists have the opportunity to visit the spa, visit the solarium, Turkish bath and indoor pool.  It offers a good water park with all kinds of attractions.  In season, the hotel employs a group of animators of thirty people, most of them speak Russian, so entertainment is understandable to our tourists.  During the day, activites offer to do water aerobics, archery, play basketball and volleyball, billiards, table tennis and darts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel royal wings turkey food" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1949665.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel has tennis courts and its own bowling club.  And on the coast, vacationers have the opportunity to do water sports, ride a banana scooter, do parasailing. </p><p>  In the evenings, an evening entertainment show is organized for tourists, artists are invited several times a week. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  The Royal Wings Hotel (Turkey, Antalya) has its own large beach.  The complex is built on the coast, from the hotel to the sea you need to walk a couple of minutes.  The wide beach has a sand cover.  There are many canopies, umbrellas and sunbeds on the coast.  There is always enough space for all tourists. </p><h2>  A bit about the resort </h2><p>  Lara is considered a popular and prestigious resort of Turkey on the Mediterranean coast.  The village is located near Antalya.  Lara hotel complexes mainly have a five-star status, and therefore belong to respectable establishments.  In general, the resort area is built along the coast in three lines, respectively, the cost of living on the second and third lines is lower than on the first.  Therefore, if you wish, you can find a more budget hotel. </p><p>  A huge advantage of the resort is its proximity to the airport and Antalya itself.  It is not difficult to get to Lara, especially since the mass of charters arrives at the international airport every day not only from Moscow, but also from other cities of Russia.  From any hotel to Antalya and Lara can be reached by dolmushes and buses.  Transport links are well established here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel royal wings turkey rooms" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1949666.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The resort's beach line stretches along the coast for twelve kilometers.  Sand cover made the resort so popular.  International recognition of Lara‚Äôs status is confirmed by the regularly awarded Blue Flag.  So, the coast is clean and safe for relaxation.  The resort has free city beaches and private hotel ownership.  All are equipped with awnings and sun loungers. </p><p>  The resort is characterized by a Mediterranean climate with dry summers and rainy, mild winters.  July is considered the hottest month, at this time the air temperature rises to an average of + 29 degrees.  In Lara, the humidity is quite high, so the heat is a little harder than in other regions. </p><h2>  Attractions Lara </h2><p>  On the east coast of Lara, a river flows into the sea, forming the Lower Duden Waterfall.  A large and noisy stream of water flows into the Mediterranean Sea from a very high cliff.  You can admire the stunning beauty for hours.  A little upstream in the park area, vacationers can see a second waterfall of a more modest size called Upper Duden.  Next to it there is a cafe, sitting in which you can relax and have a good time under the sound of water. </p><p>  Not so long ago, a new tradition appeared at the resort.  An international sand sculpture contest was held here annually.  Material for the competition is brought from different parts of the country.  An interesting sight attracts many tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel royal wings turkey rating" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1949667.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Immediately after the Lara Beach, a park zone begins, in which you can comfortably walk in the shade of trees in hot weather.  The highlight of the resort is a restaurant on the very top of the Tyuntekel hill, which is located at an altitude of 800 meters, on a rotating platform.  Since the institution rotates all the time, then resting in it, you can admire the sea and mountains in turn. </p><p>  The advantage of Lara is, of course, her location.  Antalya is just a stone's throw away, which means that all its attractions and attractions are quite accessible to vacationers from Lara.  Aqualand is a famous water park, and the floating night club Meds are places that are worth a visit. </p><h2>  Royal Wings Hotel (Turkey): traveler reviews </h2><p>  Continuing the review of the hotel, I would like to refer to the reviews of tourists who managed to visit it and can share their impressions of their stay in it.  The rating of the Royal Wings Hotel (Turkey) according to the Bucking version is 8 points.  And this means that vacationers highly appreciated the level of the institution. </p><p>  According to tourists, the hotel has a very good location.  Firstly, the road from the airport takes no more than twenty minutes, and if you call a taxi, even less;  secondly, next to the hotel there is a bus stop and a large shopping center in which all vacationers buy gold, leather and other goods typical of Turkey.  The proximity to Antalya makes it possible to visit the resort and see its attractions.  In general, guests have the opportunity not only to soak up the pool and the beach, but also to see the region. </p><p>  The photos of the Royal Wings Hotel (Turkey) given in the article make it possible to some extent evaluate the size of the complex.  The hotel is located in a park area.  By and large, we can say that the whole territory is permeated by a network of pools that connect to each other.  Own water complex and water park are very beautiful and competently decorated.  The blue expanse of pools surrounded by palm trees is the Royal Wings Hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Royal Wings Hotel Turkey Description" class="if" height="428" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1949670.jpg" width="570"></div>

    <p>  The hotel building itself is no less interesting.  The original glass building is designed in such a way that most of all apartments have at least partial sea views.  The hotel rooms are spacious and well designed.  Standards have a more modest area, and apartments of higher categories have not only several bedrooms, but even two-story rooms are also found.  In general, the choice of housing is very decent, so there is the opportunity to choose something suitable. </p><p>  As for cleaning, tourists are satisfied with its quality.  Of course, there are minor flaws, but this is not so important.  The rooms have all the necessary detergents, good bedding.  The superior apartments, in addition to the standard shower, have a jacuzzi and bathtub.  All equipment in the rooms works. </p><h2>  Hotel catering reviews </h2><p>  Food, as you know, causes the hottest discussions between tourists.  However, positive reviews about the Royal Wings Hotel (Turkey) give reason to assert that the catering is set at a high level.  Very impressive is the large main restaurant, a place in which there is always for all guests.  The buffet is represented by a wide variety of dishes, among which you can find food for every taste. </p><p>  Four themed √† la carte restaurants offer a pleasant evening.  According to tourists, the institutions are worthy of attention, so for a change they are worth a visit. </p><p>  The hotel has many bars, each of which offers refreshing drinks and snacks.  The only drawback, according to vacationers, are the synthetic drinks of the ‚ÄúYupi‚Äù type offered by them.  But freshly squeezed juices are not included in the all-inclusive concept, like imported alcoholic beverages, although the latter can be dispensed with.  Local bartenders prepare delicious cocktails based on Turkish alcohol. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="royal wings hotel turkey reviews" class="if" height="307" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1949671.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In general, the food is very tasty and of high quality.  Especially great variety is observed during the high season, when the hotel is literally crowded with vacationers. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel complex </h2><p>  Positive reviews and photos about the Royal Wings Hotel (Turkey) give reason to recommend the hotel as one of the best Lara complexes.  The pleasant and helpful staff of the institution speaks Russian, which helps to avoid the language barrier.  Although in the evening there is staff on reception who understands only Turkish, it is therefore difficult to resolve issues that arose at that time.  But in general, this moment is not too burdensome, since in many Turkish institutions of a lower level sometimes there is not a single Russian-speaking person at all.  But every day a large team of animators is happy, which conducts entertainment programs in several languages, including Russian.  Therefore, children and adults are actively involved in entertainment. </p><p>  On site there is a good kids club with many entertainments and a playground.  It is worth noting that the hotel has a pronounced family direction.  The entire territory and entertainment are organized in such a way as to make the leisure of children and adults as comfortable as possible.  The presence of a water park and Luna Park is the best solution for a beach hotel, since the problem of leisure of vacationers is largely solved.  Of course, the local slides are more modest than in the water park of Antalya, but nevertheless, not every hotel can boast so many water attractions and pools. </p><p>  The beach of the complex deserves special attention.  Its vast and spacious territory is well equipped and has a sandy pebbled surface.  A comfortable gentle slope makes the coast convenient for kids.  There are sunbeds and sun loungers on the beach, as well as a bar serving snacks and drinks.  According to vacationers, the complex is very convenient for families with children.  Everything is here to organize the leisure of the kids, and meanwhile the parents were able to pay a little attention to themselves, going to the spa or gym.  Tourists leave the most positive reviews about the evening shows of animators, the programs offered by invited artists are especially interesting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey Antalya Royal Wings Hotel" class="if" height="307" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1949674.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the hotel lobby, vacationers can order excursions, however, the convenient location and proximity of the stop makes it possible to visit Antalya on your own and see all the most interesting places. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Royal Wings can be safely called one of the best family hotels in Lara.  Good staff, decent service and quality food, as well as a large amount of entertainment, makes the place attractive for couples with children, which is the best characteristic of the place. </p>
