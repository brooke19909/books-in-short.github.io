    <h2>  A little about St. Petersburg </h2><p>  This is the former Leningrad (Petrograd) - a city founded by Peter I and a symbol of the Russian state, imperial power and military glory.  What the city and its inhabitants did not survive during their existence: several revolutions, a long-term blockade, the deaths of residents.  But he did not give up, he became even more beautiful.  Today, more than seven million people live in it.  But only a small number of them were lucky enough to get into the "Sea Terraces" - a cottage village, spread out of town directly on the bay. </p><h2>  The location of the village </h2><p>  Only sixty-seven kilometers are separated by St. Petersburg and Sea Terraces.  The village is located at around 25 km along the Primorsky highway.  There is the village of Sands in the Vyborg district.  To get to it, you do not need to turn anywhere.  Right in the city, take the direction on this highway and move all the way to the village of Sands.  There, on the Great Coastal Driveway, almost at the very edge of the water, there are ‚ÄúSea Terraces‚Äù, the name of which was invented because of such proximity to the water. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Cottage village: description and device </h2>

    <p>  How to reliably describe the "Sea Terraces"?  This cottage village is designed for year-round living in high comfort.  Such conditions are possible, since the developer has provided for the full laying of engineering infrastructure and roads rolled into asphalt.  Security is the responsibility of the security service.  And all communications are serviced by an operational service. </p><p>  The territory of the village stretches along the coast for six hundred and fifty meters and occupies sixty-five hectares of land.  In total, two hundred and fifty-seven land plots are provided according to the documentation.  Each of them on average takes fifteen hundred parts.  But there are lots suitable for the construction of almost estates.  Their area reaches seventy hundredths. </p><p>  In addition, almost seven hectares of land will be occupied by public and administrative-technical zones.  Four hectares are also reserved for a walking park area with a lake, a stream, children's and sports grounds.  And all this along the coast of the Gulf of Finland, where you can make a leisurely promenade. </p>

    <h2>  Ecological situation </h2><p>  Probably, no other <span>cottage village of St. Petersburg</span> and the Leningrad Region will be able to offer its owners and residents a more favorable ecological environment, as the Sea Terraces offer.  The cottage village, the photo of which can be seen in the article, actually meets all the requirements for living in the fresh air. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  No other cottage village can boast of a location right on the shores of the Gulf of Finland.  Yes, equipped walking areas, where you can walk and listen to the sound of the surf.  Only the "Sea Terraces", so named according to their location, provide such comfort. </p><h2>  Internal infrastructure </h2><p>  The developer does not just sell land.  He equipped the whole cottage village and adapted it for a comfortable life.  Asphalted all roads that lead to the "Sea Terraces", the village.  Which area boasts similar?  In addition, all roads are lit, as well as driveways with pedestrian zones. </p>

    <p>  The security of the residents of the village is ensured by three checkpoints with an organized round-the-clock duty service.  Also in the village is the administrative and children's centers, playgrounds and sports grounds.  For owners of their own cars and guests arriving by car, guest parking has been built.  The developer even designed an <span>artificial lake</span> in the center of the Sea Terraces village, so that its residents had an additional place to relax. </p><p>  If we talk about engineering communications, then they are available.  This is electricity up to ten kilowatts per house, and main gas, and central water supply. </p><h2>  Land </h2><p>  All <span>plots of land</span> represented in the cottage village are diverse in their shape and area.  There is a strict rectangular shape.  There are irregular, cone-shaped.  Also, the sites differ in their location: off the coast of the Gulf of Finland or closer to the Primorsky highway.  There are also land plots in a pine forest.  For those who want to immediately take up construction, flat plots are offered.  In the center of the village you can buy plots near an artificial lake. </p><p>  Land after their acquisition is transferred to the property.  And today they are almost all already implemented.  All <span>engineering communications</span> are included in the price of the plots. </p><h2>  The cost of land </h2>

    <p>  The land plots that the Sea Terraces complex (village) proposes to purchase, reviews already bought excellent, cost from two hundred ninety-eight thousand rubles per one hundred square meters.  Thus, the most inexpensive area of ‚Äã‚Äãfifteen hundred square meters will cost about four and a half million rubles.  Naturally, the most expensive areas in the center of the village, near the lake, their cost per hundred square meters reaches almost a million rubles. </p><p>  Currently, no more than ten land plots have remained vacant.  Moreover, the developer proposed by May 31, 2017 the action - the acquisition of land at a discount of ten percent, subject to 100% payment. </p><h2>  The benefits of living in the village </h2><p>  St. Petersburg is the second largest city in Russia.  It is almost as huge as the capital.  Living in a modern metropolis is not easy.  As in the main city of our country, residents of St. Petersburg strive to improve their living conditions, move from a stuffy city closer to nature. </p><p>  One of the options for choosing a place of residence is cottage villages located around the city.  Unfortunately, the <span>nature of the Leningrad region</span> does not always allow us to choose the most suitable place for the location of private houses.  Too many swamps, lakes.  From this point of view, the most successful choice is for the developer to choose a place for ‚ÄúSea Terraces‚Äù - in a village called Sands, right on the shores of the Gulf of Finland. </p>
