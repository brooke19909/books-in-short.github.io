  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pension insurance is necessary for everyone</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The <span>reform of the pension</span> system, which was launched in the Russian Federation, has existed in developed foreign countries for a long time and has proved its effectiveness.  In our country, much is being done to improve the demographic situation.  The measures taken by the state are already yielding positive results.  This is what makes pension insurance relevant for every citizen of our country.  An increase in the population, coupled with an increase in living standards, will inevitably lead to a large number of people surviving to old age, when everyone will need a pension.  This encouraging fact also brings with it the problem of material support for this category of people.  And therefore, pension insurance is one of the most important issues that must be addressed today. </p><p>  Today, there are state <span>compulsory pension insurance</span> and non-state supplementary pension insurance.  The first type of pension is controlled by the state and clearly regulated by existing legislation.  And the second type of pension is quite variable, it depends on various nuances inscribed in various <span>types of contracts,</span> and therefore does not cause much trust among citizens.  But over time, legal ignorance will be overcome and additional insurance will also have its supporters. </p><p>  Obligatory pension insurance is the prerogative of the <span>Pension Fund of the</span> Russian Federation, which is the responsibility of the insurer.  Policyholders can be organizations and citizens who hire citizens and make contributions and transfer them to the employee‚Äôs account in the Pension Fund.  All persons who regularly contribute part of their salary to the mandatory pension insurance fund are considered insured and are entitled to a labor pension consisting of three parts: basic, insurance and funded.  If the basic part is formed from the <span>state budget of the</span> Russian Federation, then the insurance and funded parts are funded by the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Additional pension insurance is provided by non-state pension funds.  Its mechanism is similar to accumulative insurance, only a citizen who has signed an agreement on supplementary pension insurance transfers his funds to a company that has the right to invest them in order to make a profit in his favor.  These contributions can be one-time, can be made monthly, quarterly or 1 time per year.  In exactly the same way, a payment is made, about which an agreement is signed with a pensioner.  The contract is long-term and can be extended to 99 years.  Today, a special Federal Law has been adopted on non-state pension funds, which stimulated pension insurance in large companies, and also provided an opportunity for citizens who want to accumulate additional funds for old age to use separate programs.  Payments at will can be requested by a person earlier than the retirement age and receive the entire amount due to him once. </p><p>  Since pension insurance refers to the guarantees that the state is obliged to give to every person living in its territory.  Therefore, there is also the category of persons who are entitled to receive state pensions.  These include federal civil servants, military personnel, persons who for some reason are unable to work, veterans of the Great Patriotic War, as well as citizens who have suffered damage to their health as a result of industrial accidents or radiation exposure. </p>
