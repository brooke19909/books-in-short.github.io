Attempts to find the most rational way to solve them were made back in Soviet times, but for many reasons, sometimes quite objective, they were constantly put off for an indefinite future.  The question of when the Solntsevo metro station will appear has been relevant for many Muscovites for a long time.  Regions such as Solntsevo and Novo-Peredelkino remained largely cut off and isolated from metropolitan life due to their remoteness.  And this gave rise to many social problems for their residents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metro solntsevo" class="if" height="318" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/273079.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Metro station "Solntsevo" on the map of Moscow</strong> </p><p>  Things started from the freezing point only a few years ago.  Previously existing metro-construction projects have been largely revised and largely edited.  And the new project has already been accepted for execution.  The Solntsevskaya line of the Moscow Metro is being built at an accelerated pace.  And Solntsevo metro station should appear in the Moscow district of the same name in about 2016.  According to a new design decision, the line under construction will pass from the Yugo-Zapadnaya station (this is the Sokolniki direction) to Novoperedelkino. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metro station solntsevo" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/273080.jpg" width="492"></div>  According to technical and design solutions, this will be the so-called ‚Äúlight subway‚Äù of shallow laying.  The launch site of the Solntsevskaya line includes six stations and five hauls between them.  Among the new ones there will be the Solntsevo metro station, the issue of opening of which excites more than one generation of local residents.  It should be noted that the choice of a quick-build option does not mean neglecting the architectural appearance of the new line, which was practiced in the Moscow Metro at the beginning of the second half of the twentieth century, during the period of struggle against excesses.  However, this should not happen with the Solntsevo metro station. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Solntsevo metro on a map of Moscow" class="if" height="306" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/273081.jpg" width="408"></div>  Many stations of the Solntsevskaya line look very modern and expressive when looking at the illustrations for the project.  The only thing now is the worthy implementation of design decisions.  And if everything goes according to the planned <span>construction schedule,</span> the Solntsevo metro station will receive the first passengers in three years.  We'll have to go to the station "South-West", which will become a junction.  Plans for further extension of the light metro line beyond its borders are still being discussed, and there are several development options. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metro solntsevo station" class="if" height="224" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/273078.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Plans and prospects</strong> </p><p>  The administrative <span>expansion of Moscow</span> in the south-west direction that took place in 2011 implies the provision of vehicles for new territories and residential areas of the capital.  The famous Moscow suburbs of Solntsevo and Novo-Peredelkino cease to be such in the newly opened administrative circumstances.  All this makes the extension of the branch not only for South-West, but also in the opposite direction, towards the new Moscow, very relevant.  However, the complex of issues associated with this is still only under discussion, and so far it has not reached concrete project plans. </p>
