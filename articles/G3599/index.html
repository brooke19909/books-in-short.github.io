Lenin, preparing the highest command for the ranks of the Soviet army.</span></span> </p><p>  <span><span>Teachers immediately drew attention to a capable and focused young man who studied with great desire and desire.</span></span>  <span><span>Salyukov was distinguished from fellow students by his sincere desire to serve and, if necessary, defend his homeland, and he devoted himself to his studies and devoted all his free time to her.</span></span> </p><p>  <span><span>The efforts of the young man were not left without attention, in 1977 he graduated from college with a medal.</span></span>  <span><span>The future general Salyukov Oleg Leonidovich did not calm down on this, and, not stopping there, in 1982 he entered the Academy of Armored Forces named after</span></span>  <span><span>R.
