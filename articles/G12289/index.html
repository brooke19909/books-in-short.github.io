The natives of this rich family ruled Florence for a long time and made it the cultural and scientific <span>center of Europe.</span> </p><h2>  Origin of the dynasty </h2><p>  There are several versions of the origin of this genus.  A common urban legend attributed the relationship of the Medici to the physician Charles the Great - the founder of the Frankish Empire.  The family itself held the view that their roots go back to one of the knights who served at the court of this emperor. </p><p>  In the XII century, the Medici dynasty moved to Florence.  <span>Members of the family</span> engaged in usury and quickly became wealthy.  Wealthy bankers soon infiltrated the managerial staff of the city and began to occupy elected positions in Florence.  The family had ups and downs.  In the XII century, bankers tried to take part in the political life of the city, supporting one of the local parties.  The main conflict of interest in Florence then lay between the rich nobility and the poor.  Salvestro de Medici supported the tramps who organized a riot against the aristocracy.  When they were defeated, the financier was expelled from the city. </p><p>  The Medici dynasty did not stay in exile for long, but even during that time it achieved notable successes in usury.  The first bank branches were opened in Venice and Rome. </p>

    <h2>  Elevation </h2><p>  The first head of the Florentine Republic in the Medici family was Cosimo Old.  He held this position from 1434 to 1464.  He managed to come to power, taking advantage of his money, influence and dissatisfaction of the people with the past government, which introduced intolerable taxes and arranged useless wars.  It was Cosimo who became the founder of the tradition of patronizing art and other areas of the Renaissance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Medici dynasty successfully invested money.  The fact is that in the 15th century, Italy became the center of culture and art in Europe.  Many Greeks fled here, who were left without a homeland after the capture of Constantinople by the Turks in <span>1453.</span>  Many of them brought unique books to Italy (including Florence) and arranged lectures unknown to Europeans.  This spurred interest in the history of antiquity.  From it a whole school of humanism arose.  All these phenomena were financed and stimulated by the Medici dynasty.  The story remained grateful to her, even despite the many political intrigues that were the norm at that time. </p>

    <h2>  Lorenzo the Magnificent </h2><p>  Even after the death of Cosimo, the Medici dynasty continued to rule in Florence.  Lorenzo the Magnificent (his grandson) became the most famous member of the family.  He was born in 1448, and became the head of the republic in 1469. </p><p>  At this time, a conspiracy took place in Florence, as a result of which the Medici dynasty was supposed to fall.  <span>The family tree</span> almost broke off, but Lorenzo revealed the plan of the enemies.  He was even supported by Pope Sixtus IV.  But even this did not save Brother Lorenzo Giuliano, who died at the hands of the conspirators. </p><p>  Then Florence declared war on several neighboring principalities, which were supported by the Roman throne.  Lorenzo managed to successfully resist this coalition.  In addition, he found an ally in the person of the French king.  This frightened Rome, in which they did not want to fight with Paris, and the conflict subsided. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Florence - the center of the Renaissance </h2><p>  The Medici dynasty and their influence on the development of Italian culture at this time reach their peak.  Lorenzo funded numerous educational institutions.  One of them was the famous Kareji Academy, which became the pan-European center of the new school of neoplatonism.  The Florentine court hired art geniuses such as Sandro Botticelli and Michelangelo.  Lorenzo was also an expert on books.  He collected and enriched his own library, which became a city attraction.  The head of the republic died in 1492.  His vibrant life aggravated rumors around the Medici family.  The secrets of the dynasty excited gossip and lovers of conspiracy theories. </p><p>  Lorenzo's attitude towards the Renaissance soon spread to neighboring cities.  At exactly the same pace, Venice, Rome, Naples and Milan began to settle down.  The Renaissance resembled the heyday of the era of Antiquity, due to which it got its name. </p><h2>  Pope and Dukes of Tuscany </h2><p>  The most famous representatives of the Medici dynasty became not only the rulers of Florence, but also the popes.  In 1513, it turned out to be Piero Medici, who took the name of Leo X and remained on the throne until 1521.  Although the high priests were not supposed to engage in worldly affairs, he supported the interests of his family in Florence. </p><p>  The rule of Clement VII (1523-1534) passed in a similar manner.  In the world, his name was Giulio Medici.  Under him, the family was once again expelled from Florence.  As a result, the pope entered into an alliance with the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V of Habsburg, "in whose domain the sun never set."  The coalition defeated the enemies, and the Medici returned to Florence.  In addition, they received the title of Dukes of Tuscany. </p><p>  The rulers of Florence of this period continued to patronize art.  Under Cosimo I (1537-1574) the famous Uffizi Gallery was built.  Today it attracts millions of tourists to Florence.  It contains numerous masterpieces of painting, for example, the work of the legendary Leonardo da Vinci (The Annunciation and The Adoration of the Magi). </p>

    <h2>  Queens of france </h2><p>  Influential rulers of Florence paid attention to dynastic marriages.  So, two women of this kind became spouses of French kings.  This was the wife of Henry II Catherine (1547-1559) and the wife of Henry IV Maria (1600-1610).  The first of them was even a regent and generally had great political influence.  Catherine is known to millions of fans of the talent of Alexander Dumas, in whose novels she was the main character.  She also went down in history after the bloody <span>Bartholomew night</span> and the massacre of many Huguenots. </p><p>  The French dynasty from Catherine de Medici was stopped by her two children - Charles IX and Henry III.  On the father they belonged to Valois.  After them, the Bourbons came to power in 1589.  However, it is difficult to underestimate the influence that the Medici family had on all of Europe.  The dynasty became the personification of the Renaissance with all its vivid and controversial events. </p>

    <h2>  The decline of Florence </h2><p>  Despite the influence on other countries, the main area of ‚Äã‚Äãinterest of the Medici has always been Florence - their main domain and real homeland.  The decline of the Tuscan duchy began under Cosimo II (1609-1621).  He spent a lot of money on wars and conflicts with neighbors.  The duke was distinguished by crazy plans to subjugate his enemies, including the Spanish crown.  At the same time, he was known for his support of Galileo, which continued the glorious traditions of Lorenzo the Magnificent. </p><p>  Under his son Ferdinand II (1621-1670), a pan-European <span>Thirty Years War broke out</span> between Catholics and Protestants.  At this time, the decline of Florence continued, which was no longer dependent on the Medici.  The discovery of America and other promising markets made Italy a provincial country, rather than the economic center of Europe.  Financial flows went to the markets of Spain, England and other colonial powers. </p>

    <h2>  End of the dynasty </h2><p>  At the same time, the Medici dynasty itself was suppressed.  Her last representative, Giovanni Gasto (reigned 1723-1737), was painful and childless.  After his death, the Duchy of Tuscany passed to the Holy Roman Emperor Franz I Stephen, who in Florence began to be titled Francesco II.  So the city of Medici for a long time passed to the Habsburgs. </p>
