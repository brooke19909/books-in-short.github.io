  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Classification of teaching methods.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The classification <span>of</span> literacy or any school discipline does not fit into a well-defined framework.  A lot of efforts have already been made in domestic and world practice to compile it.  A method is a multidimensional and universal category, therefore different authors use not the same grounds in order to compose their classification.  They cite arguments in favor of a particular classification model. </p><p>  E.Ya.  Golant and E.I.  Perovsky offers to classify methods according to the nature of the perception of information and the source of its transmission.  That is, there is passive perception when students watch and listen ‚Äî a lecture, a story, an explanation, a demonstration, and so on.  And active perception is the use of visual aids, books, work with them, as well as the laboratory method. </p><p>  The classification of teaching methods by various sources of information transfer, as well as the acquisition of knowledge was proposed by N.M. Verzilin, I.T. Ogorodnikov and others.  The following methods fit into the framework of this classification: verbal - work with a book, the word of the teacher;  and practical - experiment, observation, exercises, that is, studying the reality that surrounds each of us. </p><p>  Classification of teaching methods proposed by B.P.  Yesipov and M.A.  Danilov is based on didactic tasks.  That is, the sequence of students acquiring knowledge in a particular lesson is of great importance.  First comes the acquisition of knowledge, then the formation of skills and abilities, then the application of these acquired knowledge, followed by <span>creative activity,</span> then consolidation, testing of skills, knowledge and skills. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There is a classification of teaching methods according to the <span>nature (type) of</span> cognitive activity.  It was proposed by I.Ya.  Lerner and M.N. Skatkin.  They said that the level of independent activity is reflected in the nature of cognitive activity of students.  This classification is characterized by such <span>methods: reproductive</span> (the boundaries of creativity and skill), explanatory and illustrative, it is also called information-reproductive, partially search, problem statement of knowledge and research. </p><p>  The German didactor L. Klinberg also proposed his classification of teaching methods in combination with forms of cooperation.  The first group is monological methods - a demonstration, a story, a lecture.  The second group - forms of cooperation - group, individual, frontal and collective.  The third group - dialogue methods - conversation. </p><p>  Classification of teaching methods proposed by Yu.K.  Babansky, compiled on the basis of the organization and implementation of educational and cognitive activities, methods of stimulation, motivation, as well as methods of self-control and control.  This classification is represented by the following groups of methods: the first - methods of organization, as well as the implementation of educational and cognitive activities.  These include verbal (lecture, story, conversation, seminar), visual (demonstration, illustration), practical (laboratory experiments, exercises).  The same group includes problem-searching and reproductive methods, methods of work under the guidance of a teacher and independently.  The second group of this classification is the methods of stimulating and motivating students.  And the third group - methods of self-monitoring and control of educational and cognitive activity in order to increase its effectiveness. </p><p>  Thus, there are several dozen classifications of teaching methods, which have their own shortcomings and their advantages.  But it is important to understand that the educational process is a dynamic design.  Therefore, the choice of teaching methods depends on many factors. </p>
