An example of climate technology is most indicative in this sense.  So, recently the market has been actively filled with <span>mobile air conditioners,</span> which are designed for indoor use.  The features of such systems include the complete exclusion of dirty installation operations, which attracts a considerable audience of consumers.  But with all the convenience of installation and further maintenance, such models are not able to get closer to the performance characteristics that the external air conditioner unit as part of the split system provides.  Another thing is that the owners of outdoor installations have to deal with troublesome tasks, but of a different kind. </p>

    <h2>  What is an external unit? </h2><p>  The outer segment, which is part of the split system, includes a <span>compressor unit, a</span> condenser, isolation of valves, pipes, filter driers and a fan.  Depending on the modification and structural design, the internal "filling" may vary, but the traditional air conditioner kit with a remote unit has just such a set of elements.  By the way, the most noticeable differences are observed in the so-called winter systems, which provide for the presence of special controllers for controlling the fan.  Modern air conditioners also use multifunctional power switching relays.  Such devices are designed for non-standard compressor operation in conditions of high or low temperatures.  Unlike the internal segment, the outdoor unit does not have electronic modules - its operation is completely subordinate to the mechanical function. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Block sizes </h2><p>  The outdoor unit is marketed in various configurations and shapes.  And although manufacturers, in order to simplify segmentation, seek to unify model lines, the choice of sizes is still quite wide.  If we talk about average parameters, then the <span>standard model</span> has a width of 770 mm, a height of 450 mm and a thickness of 245 mm.  Moreover, the radius of the fan on average varies from 200 to 250 mm.  Of course, there are also units whose sizes deviate from these indicators.  So, in the Mitsubishi lineup, the air conditioner external unit is almost square in shape, which is 880 mm wide and 840 mm high.  As for the parameters of the inner segment, they are not so impressive.  Usually these are long, narrow, medium-sized modules - 700 x 200 x 200 mm. </p>

    <h2>  Choosing a place to install the unit </h2><p>  Usually, when choosing the optimal point for installing air conditioners outside, users encounter problems combining ease of use and protection of the module.  For example, the location of the unit at a height is the best option from the point of view of its safety, but in this case access to the air conditioner is also complicated for the purpose of care.  A good solution could be to place the module on the wall near a window opening or a loggia.  At the same time, other nuances must be taken into account, among which the absence of direct sunlight and installation permission from the neighbors, since a noisy unit can cause inconvenience to people living at the same level of the building. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition, the <span>external unit of the air conditioner</span> generates condensate, which will drip down in drops.  Accordingly, it is necessary to negotiate with the neighbors on the lower floors.  In case of successful coordination of the installation location of the unit with other residents, you can proceed with the direct installation operations.  By the way, another condition for installing the outdoor unit is the ability to lay communications in the wall. </p>

    <h2>  Installation of an external air conditioning unit </h2><p>  When installing air conditioners, special installation kits are used, which include pipes with flex, brackets with sets of fixing hardware, drainage communications, etc. The physical installation of the segment is carried out using load-bearing components that are embedded into the walls using anchor elements.  At the same stage, brackets are used, the power potential of which is oriented to the mass of a particular module.  Also, the installation of an external air conditioning unit provides for its communication connection with the internal segment.  To do this, a hole of the desired diameter is made in the wall, which will make it possible to organize, in addition to the main wiring, also the laying of the vacuum pump and pressure gauge.  At the final stage, the communications between the two units are directly connected. </p><h2>  Features of installing the indoor unit </h2><p>  When installing the evaporative, that is, the internal module of the air conditioning system, it is especially important to observe the correct position of the unit.  Usually this unit is mounted directly under the ceiling surface with a slight indentation.  Mechanical locking is also carried out using suitable brackets.  True, in this case, the mass of equipment is not so large that it simplifies the workflow.  After marking, the master installs the anchor elements and, if necessary, fastens the bearing profiles.  Next, the indoor unit of the air conditioner is installed with strict observance of the horizontal position.  Also, some models of such segments according to the instructions should have a slight bias towards the passage of drainage. </p>

    <h2>  Maintenance and care </h2><p>  In standard operation, the air conditioner must be serviced every six months.  Most of the work is carried out with the external unit, which is most susceptible to pollution.  Specialists usually check the condition of the filters, the level of the refrigerant, the working pressure of the module path, etc. The most difficult operation is to replace the working fluid.  The refrigerant is a chemically unsafe substance, so it is better to trust its refueling to experienced craftsmen.  But care for the remaining components is quite accessible to ordinary users.  For example, the answer to the question about how to clean the external unit of the air conditioner is quite simple.  First of all, it should be disassembled, and then with the help of a rag or vacuum cleaner to rid the internal surfaces of the module from dust and dirt deposits.  In the process of such care, the external filters and heat transfer radiators are cleaned, which extends the life of the air conditioner. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to clean the external air conditioning unit" class="if" height="462" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/1319675.jpg" width="332"></div>

    <h2>  External unit in multi-systems </h2><p>  The concept of the technical implementation of the split system provides for the possibility of using several indoor modules in one complex, which are serviced by one outdoor unit.  Unlike standard configurations, the external module of such a system has engineering differences.  For integration into a multi-system, it is equipped with an additional thermostat, which allows you to more effectively manage the settings of the fan and compressor.  In turn, the indoor unit of the air conditioner acts as a source of information signals that determine the control of the outdoor unit.  That is, the user, using the remote control, accesses the panel of the indoor unit, and that, in turn, regulates the bypass communication system on the freon highway via a digital channel. </p><h2>  Price issue </h2><p>  In modern versions, air conditioners such as split systems are not cheap, which is largely due to the complexity of the design.  Even in the initial segment, the cost of an air conditioner with a remote unit is rarely less than 20 thousand rubles.  Of course, you can find options for 15 thousand rubles.  from little-known brands, but their quality is in doubt both among specialists and users themselves, who often complain about malfunctions. </p><p>  Decent quality models are offered by Fujitsu, Daikin, Mitsubishi, etc. The average cost of an air conditioner from the assortment of these companies varies in the range of 30-40 thousand rubles.  Moreover, the most technologically advanced and productive sets can be estimated at 70-80 thousand rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The use of air conditioners with a design that involves the installation of a remote unit, causes a lot of problems during installation and further maintenance.  And this is without taking into account the difficulties in transporting equipment.  These factors allow us to talk about such units as morally obsolete.  Especially against the backdrop of the proliferation of mobile devices with modest sizes.  Nevertheless, the external unit of the air conditioner remains relevant in the market.  This is explained by its high performance, functionality and safety during operation, since the main work units are located outside the living room.  And if for domestic use you can find a low-power replacement for the split-system in the form of a monoblock, then in the context of servicing office premises, public buildings and institutions, multifunctional complexes are still unparalleled. </p>
