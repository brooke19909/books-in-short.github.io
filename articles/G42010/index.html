This is not surprising, because it was always peculiar to a person to decorate himself, his clothes and his home. </p><p>  The history of embroidery begins in the ancient world, although the question of which country it first appeared in is still a matter of controversy among archaeologists.  According to some, the first embroidered patterns appeared in ancient Asia, according to others - in ancient Greece. </p><p>  In favor of the fact that richly embroidered clothes and various household items appeared precisely in Asia, the records of ancient historians about the wars of Alexander the Great with the Persians testify.  It was at them that the young conqueror first saw tents embroidered with gold and ordered his masters to make the same for him.  In ancient centuries, embroidery testified to the social status of the family.  The richer and brighter the pattern, the more expensive the materials of clothing and thread for embroidery, the higher the position of a person in society.  As patterns, mainly stylized plant and animal ornaments or religious symbols adopted by one or another people were used. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Embroidery History" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11391/34729.jpg" width="537"></div>

    <p>  The history of embroidery has evolved and continues to evolve today.  Over hundreds of years of its existence, depending on peoples, beliefs, fashion for depicting threads on a fabric or other materials, many seams and <span>types of embroidery</span> have arisen <span>.</span>  The pattern can be embroidered in one style, or depending on the skills and artistic taste of the master, it can be created using various textured threads and various embroidery techniques.  This combination gives the embroidery originality and charm. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The most popular stitch embroidery.  It can also be different: embroidering a picture in one color most often goes as an addition to embroidery using the Richelieu technique, it is usually done in white and is called white stitch.  The smooth surface with color transitions is very beautiful and quite difficult to execute.  Counting surface - the number of stitches is counted, and the stitch length, as a rule, is equal to the distance between the parallel sides of the pattern.  Counting surface is usually used when embroidering stylized ornaments that have medium-sized elements in their motif. </p><p>  The history of stitch embroidery originates somewhere in the III century <span>BC.</span>  The surface was considered embroidery to decorate the nobility and their houses, as well as for temple paintings with religious images.  For this, <span>silk threads,</span> gold and silver were used.  The rest of the population was more attracted to ornamental patterns and simpler techniques, such as cross-stitch, half-cross, stitch- <span>seam, chain stitch</span> , etc. The history of embroidery knows a lot of interesting facts in its development.  For example, among the Slavic peoples in Russia there was a belief: if you start embroidery with sunrise and finish before sunset, then a thing with this pattern would become a talisman or a talisman for the person to whom it was intended. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the story of embroidery stitch" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11391/34734.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <p>  In the last century, embroidery with ribbons or braid came into fashion.  It is not very difficult to perform, but it requires certain skills and abilities, accuracy and patience from the craftswoman.  But to think that this is a new round in the development of embroidery techniques is wrong.  The history of <span>ribbon embroidery</span> begins in the 14th century in France.  Hats and dresses of noble ladies were decorated with ribbons, then such patterns became so fashionable that several hundred meters of silk or satin ribbons were spent on embroidery of one dress. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="history of ribbon embroidery" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11391/34735.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The history of embroidery does not stand still.  Talented needlewomen add rhinestones, beads, beads, pendants and other elements to the patterns, which help to add a product of originality and elegance, and fashionistas are forced to look around. </p>
