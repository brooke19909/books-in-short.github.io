    <p>  Volcano is a natural phenomenon that delights with its power and mystery.  In ancient times, people worshiped them, attributing divine meaning.  Today, volcanoes are being studied by scientists all over the world.  They are trying to solve the mystery of their life and predict possible eruptions.  <span>Active volcanoes of</span> Russia are also of great interest.  Among them are many beautiful, attracting the attention of lovers of these natural sites. </p><p>  So what is a volcano?  This is a cone-shaped elevation.  Usually they are located above cracks in the earth's crust or by explosion tubes.  It is through them that the eruption of lava, gases and ash occurs. </p><p>  The active volcanoes of Russia are located mainly on <span>the Kamchatka Peninsula.</span>  Among them, Tolbachik, Shishel, Kronotskaya, Klyuchevskaya, Koryaksky, Karymsky hills, Ichinsky, Avachinsky hills and Shiveluch are distinguished.  In total there are about 129, and they form a whole volcanic belt.  Only some of them are dormant volcanoes, while the rest are active. </p><p>  Almost every island or simply a hill in Kamchatka is a volcano.  The largest of them is <span>Klyuchevskaya Sopka</span> (4900 meters).  It is also one of the largest on the planet. </p><p>  All active volcanoes of Russia are distinguished by individuality and originality.  Each eruption has its own character.  In the north of the volcanic chain of Kamchatka, Sheveluch volcano is located.  It has a viscous lava and emits a large amount of gases and vapors.  When this volcano erupts, the lava is slowly squeezed out of its crater, forming a dome, which consists of solidified rock.  In 1945, it was accompanied by explosions.  Further, the ridge is decorated with numerous volcanoes.  The <span>Avachinsky Sopka,</span> which is located near the city of Petropavlovsk, closes this group.  The extinct Ksudach volcano is also located there, which has been in this state for several decades.  Once it was one of the largest fire mountains in Kamchatka. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Active volcanoes of Russia, located in Kamchatka, are part of the "ring of fire".  It is located on the Pacific coast and consists of hundreds of volcanoes.  Earthquakes very often occur in this area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Earth.  As a result, deep cracks form in the <span>earth's crust,</span> through which lava breaks through.  In those places where it gets access to the surface, volcanic catastrophes occur. </p><p>  Among the volcanoes of Russia there are sleeping representatives.  These include Kazbek and Elbrus, located in the Caucasus.  These are young but extinct volcanoes.  Elbrus has a height of more than 5.5 thousand meters.  However, its diameter is approximately 18 thousand kilometers, and this is not much.  As a volcano, Elbrus is spoken of in the past tense, despite its young age.  However, in world practice, there were cases when dormant volcanoes came to life.  There were eruptions that had disastrous consequences. </p><p>  For example, the famous Vesuvius for a long time was not considered a volcano.  But now it is the most active fiery mountain.  Its eruptions occur every hundred years. </p><p>  There are numerous hot springs around Elbrus.  It has two peaks, between which there is an emission of hot gases.  All this indicates that it is a sleeping volcano.  Therefore, scientists are constantly monitoring it.  In addition, it is the only and highest volcano in Europe. </p><p>  Volcanoes in Russia are a formidable and powerful natural phenomenon.  On the Kamchatka Peninsula to this day eruptions occur.  These formidable giants amaze with their beauty, forming beautiful landscapes.  Despite all the danger posed by volcanoes, they are an integral part of this region and its <span>natural complex.</span> </p>
