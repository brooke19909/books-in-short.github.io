    <p>  You can talk a lot about the capital of Russia for a long time, it attracts not only residents of the Far East who use the Moscow-Chita route, but also all other Russians.  This city is considered a great place for self-realization, earning, and also to satisfy their own ambitions. </p><p>  <span>Residents of Chita,</span> arriving in Moscow, are initially lost, because they are used to the strict rectangular grid of streets that exists in their hometown.  Residents of the Far East can easily move to Moscow, since they are somehow related to the manufacturing sectors and are in demand in the capital's labor market. </p><h2>  Chita </h2>

    <p>  Why do residents of the capital use the Moscow-Chita route?  Many fly through the capital of the Trans-Baikal Territory to other regions of Russia and the eastern countries located in the neighborhood, it is in Chita that the international airport is convenient for transfers.  The settlement, which later became this city, Carnival, was founded in 1653-1655. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now there are practically no traces of those times in Chita, but here you can find later monuments of architecture and art.  In 1827, the Decembrists appeared here, who spent a long time here and left a lot of reminders about themselves.  In 1897, the Trans-Siberian Railway passed a year later, since then its active development has not stopped for a minute. </p><h2>  Is it far? </h2>

    <p>  If you are going to take the Moscow-Chita route, the distance and travel time can be completely different.  Everything will depend on the chosen transport.  For example, when traveling by car you will need to overcome almost 6300 kilometers.  At the same time, the further you move away from the capital, the higher the likelihood that the highways along which you will go will be of poor quality. </p><p>  When traveling by train, the distance between the two cities will be slightly less and will be 6208 kilometers.  Most of the Trans-Siberian Railway is electrified, which means that there will be no problems with heat and charging mobile devices on the road.  When traveling by plane, the mileage will be much less and will be about 4700 kilometers, this is due to the use of direct air corridors. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  We are going by train </h2>

    <p>  For those who like to travel for a long time, to watch Russian nature from the window, a train is suitable.  ‚ÄúMoscow-Chita‚Äù is not a very popular destination; only five trains run on it.  The travel time on them can fluctuate, everything will depend on the class of the train.  For example, <span>branded train</span> No. 002 with the Moscow-Vladivostok message will allow you to cover this distance in 3 days and 20 hours, and passenger train No. 100 with the same message will have to travel 4 days and 11 hours. </p><p>  The fastest and most expensive are fast trains No. 001/002 and No. 019/020, the second is international.  The cost of a reserved seat on this route is from 8.5 to 10 thousand rubles, coupe - from 13 to 20 thousand.  Trains No. 069/070, 043/044 and 099/100 are cheaper in this regard, a reserved seat costs 7, and a compartment - 11.5 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Trains ‚Ññ069 / 070 </h2><p>  There is also a direct train 69 ‚ÄúChita-Moscow‚Äù, reviews of which are very mixed.  On the one hand, it is cheaper than others, and on the other, it lasts almost a day longer, which is very inconvenient for those who value their time.  As for the level of comfort, here it is practically no different from the usual fast train. </p><p>  The train is already returning under a different number - No. 70 (in some documents - No. 070), the return journey along the Moscow-Chita route takes a similar amount of time.  All trains running along the route are equipped with <span>dining cars</span> , there are no luxury <span>cars</span> , so if you want to go with increased comfort, you will still need to think about traveling on other trains. </p><h2>  We fly by plane! </h2>

    <p>  Another tool that you can use to travel on the Chita-Moscow route is an airplane.  Direct flights between the two cities are served by two airlines - S7 - Siberia and Ural Airlines; the average ticket price is from 16 to 48 thousand rubles, depending on the class selected. </p><p>  You can also fly with transfers, but for this you will have to use the services of eight different airlines.  In addition, it will cost a little more than taking a direct flight.  The total fare can be from 17 to 80 thousand rubles, the only cheap option can be offered by Ural Airlines: an economy class ticket can be purchased for 14-15 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  You can go by car </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the Moscow-Chita route is very long, some motorists still decide to travel along it.  According to avid motorists, if you drive almost non-stop, you can overcome this route in just 85-87 hours.  With a quiet ride with stops and overnight stays you can get in 115-120 hours.  Experienced motorists recommend staying only in hotels or campsites, organized most often near the traffic police posts. </p><p>  Of course, such a long journey is not suitable for everyone, so if you still decide on it, you need to prepare the car for the trip in advance, as well as stock up on additional tool kits.  Also, it does not hurt to have extra savings with you, which can be useful in the event that an accident occurs on the road. </p><h2>  What to choose? </h2>

    <p>  The main resource that passengers of the Moscow-Chita route want to save is time, which is why most often they are ready to fly only by plane.  But do not discard other options, as they can be more economical than a flight.  However, money is another aspect that must be taken into account when choosing a vehicle. </p><p>  There are alternative travel options.  In particular, services that allow several travelers to get their hands on and go on a trip in one car are gaining immense popularity.  Of course, there are risks here, since the methodology of such travels in Russia has not yet taken root, many are afraid to use it.  However, the decision is made only by you. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In addition to Chita, in the Far East there are a large number of other equally interesting cities: Khabarovsk, Vladivostok, Komsomolsk-on-Amur, etc.  Each of them has its own rich history, and all of them, one way or another, played a huge role in the life of Russia.  At one time, some of them were closed for visiting, since strategically important factories and military units were located there, today the situation has changed, and the Far Eastern region is actively developing, annually attracting specialists from different regions and countries to work. </p><p>  If you, on the contrary, are heading to the European part of Russia, then, in addition to Moscow itself, you must definitely visit the nearby cities that are part of the Golden Ring.  Both in the capital and in Chita, you can find a large number of organizations that conduct tours for guests of the city at reasonable prices.  Have a nice, comfortable and safe trip! </p>
