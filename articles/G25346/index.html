  <section class="page js-page"><h1>And again, the oleophobic coating saves electronics from "obesity"</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The great achievements in the field of microelectronics, which have been particularly intensive in the last decade, have begun to awaken in people an ever greater thirst for comfortable surroundings with amazing things.  Aesthetics and power intertwined in the ephemeral manifestation of the human mind - the world was shown a multifunctional phone with a touch control panel, the screen of which received an oleophobic coating.  The amazing substance and the ingenious simplicity of the invention will be discussed in the framework of this article. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Oleophobic coating" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/430822.jpg" width="500"></div></h2><h2>  A little biology and a little bit about physics </h2><p>  It is one of the features of human physiology that served as a kind of impetus to apply a substance whose properties would prevent the appearance of fatty traces on the surface of the touchscreen.  After all, it is no secret to anyone that a smooth foundation, and even having certain mirror properties, is an incredibly easily soiled material.  The oleophobic coating solved all the problems.  The touch screen has acquired a fairly serious defender, who is easily able to preserve the aesthetic beauty and effective practicality of the color rendering of the display. </p><h2>  "The heroine" of the story - "Mrs. Chemistry" </h2><p>  So, what is an oleophobic coating and what are the components of a ‚Äúmiraculous‚Äù substance?  In order not to be introduced into the terminology, we will only say that it is a certain substance, which is based on: alkylsilane (organic hydrotrioxide), silicone - polyorganosiloxane polymers (organosilicon) and solvent (as a binder). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What is an oleophobic coating?" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/430825.jpg" width="600"></div>  However, a film only a few nanometers thick can effectively repel multiple ‚Äútactile attacks‚Äù of the fingers of our hands.  That is, the above spraying serves as a natural obstacle to fat in any of its manifestations.  By the way, the chemical composition of the human footprint is nothing more than an aggressive medium, which has a fairly serious arsenal of various substances in its composition: several types of acids, ammonia, salt and phosphates.  So sweating hands are ‚Äústress‚Äù for an oleophobic coating.  However, everything has its limits, and the protective properties of the spraying are no exception to the rule.  However, about this in the next paragraph.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What "kills" the oleophobic coating? </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Oleophobic screen coating" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/430821.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  The main culprit in the destruction of the protective layer, of course, is considered mechanical impact.  And the intensity of using a device that has anti-grease spraying is far from a creative force.  Nevertheless, all the above reasons are ‚Äúnothing‚Äù compared to aggressive environments, which often become ‚Äúsaviors‚Äù in the hands of a person who is thoughtlessly trying to wipe an ink spot from the touch screen of an expensive device.  Practice shows that at first glance, ‚Äúinnocent substances‚Äù sold under the guise of ‚Äúsuperfood‚Äù effectively clean the oleophobic coating of the screen from any contamination, in fact, dangerous liquids that contain alcohol or its derivatives or various solvents.  Only after some time, the owner of the phone or tablet will pay attention to the fact that fingerprints have become ‚Äúwith progressive strength‚Äù to be fixed on the touch screen of your favorite device.  Nevertheless, for those whose experience was ‚Äúunsweetened‚Äù, there is a way out. </p><h2>  Non-productive spraying, or Fool yourself (Chinese reducing agent) </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY oleophobic coating" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/430824.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  There is more than enough information on the network on a given topic.  An immense amount of substances imitating the protective layer is present on the market today.  For your information, even an expensive spray can not guarantee factory quality (often promised in the annotation of the product), and even more so the durability of the layer obtained by spraying, rubbing or digging.  In the best case, you will get frosted fog on the glass or you will get grease-repellent protection with a daily life.  Common sense should make you doubt the ‚Äúmiracle recipes‚Äù, and life experience should require a detailed study of the essence of the issue: oleophobic coating - what is it?  Dear readers, do not be fooled, because the technology of applying a protective layer is a complex chemical process of a production type.  By the way, not every patent is made public (this refers to an improved type of spraying from Apple).  Agree - this example is worth considering.  However, as promised, an effective way still exists. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Simple, fast, reliable and cheap. </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Oleophobic coating, what is it?" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/430823.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  A protective film, of course, will not save your device from "signs of individuality" (fingerprints), but its use, of course, will positively affect the presentable state of the front of the device.  In any case, you can wipe the display without fear of damaging the oleophobic coating.  A high-quality film will protect your touchscreen from scratches and scuffs, and the small price of the accessory will not become an obstacle in order to re-replace the element that protects against damage.  It should be noted that many manufacturers have long mastered the technology of applying a grease-repellent composition to polymer products.  So for owners who have lost their factory protective layer, and for those people whose electronic components were not originally ‚Äúoleophobes,‚Äù such an alternative is really an ideal option to significantly affect the degree of protection of the device, as well as increase the level of comfort when using it. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  As you understand, an oleophobic coating with your own hands can be unknowingly destroyed, but now you know that there are some possibilities for restoring the protective layer.  So do not be discouraged if in the past tense you made an operational mistake ... Alas, this is how a person was created, although learning from other people's flaws is much more painless.  Be wise and protect your device from obesity. </p>
