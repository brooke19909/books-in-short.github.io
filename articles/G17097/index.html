In particular, these are developers of secure devices.  Just about one of these we will talk in this article. </p><p>  Moreover, we will talk about the national manufacturer - the company Senseit.  It represents a wide range of electronic products, which includes mobile devices.  What are the differences between Senseit phones, reviews of the most popular models, as well as other useful information about the developer, we will present in this review. </p><h2>  Positioning </h2>

    <p>  About the companies that make secure smartphones, we mentioned not in vain.  In fact, Senseit is just the representative of one of those.  At least the entire line of its devices available today consists exclusively of such phones.  In particular, as indicated on the main website of the developer, it is these smartphones that are best suited for users who in everyday life are faced with difficult working conditions.  For example, a builder, traveler, athlete, etc. will no longer be forced to worry about the safety of their device.  Now they just need to purchase a Senseit phone, which is not afraid of temperature extremes, shock and drops, moisture and dust. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  And that's not it... </h2><p>  In addition, Senseit <span>rugged phones</span> also have wide functionality, stylish design, convenient ergonomics. </p><p>  In general, in order to know more about the described models, we offer a comparison and give a brief overview of some of them. </p><h2>  Device Rulers </h2>

    <p>  All products of the company are divided into two groups.  The first is called Adventure, which means ‚Äúadventure‚Äù.  Already by name, it is easy to guess that we are talking about more secure smartphones with an increased threshold for confrontation and, accordingly, a higher degree of protection.  So it is - these are the models that really can not be afraid of moisture, dust, exposure to physical force.  This line includes R390 +, P3, P4, P7, as well as the P101 model.  It is noteworthy that some of the above modifications are presented in several colors (usually black, yellow and green). </p><p>  The second direction is a group of Life models (‚Äúlife‚Äù).  This line is represented by devices E400, E500, L100, L108, as well as L301.  There are phones that are designed for use in everyday life.  Outwardly they look the same as many other devices familiar to us (there is no rubberized coating, rough plugs, thickened glass of the screen on the case). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  ‚ÄúProtected‚Äù device group </h2>

    <p>  For example, a line consisting of ‚Äúsecure devices‚Äù is represented by two smartphones with a touch screen and two keyboard devices.  The most expensive and at the same time the most functional here is the R390 +.  Its cost is 11 thousand rubles.  According to reviews, this is the most functional device that can withstand adverse weather conditions.  A powerful camera with 8 megapixels, an MT6572 processor for budget smartphones, and an operating system 4.2.2 are installed here. </p><p>  Second in the ranking is the next model - the Senseit P4 phone.  Her camera will be weaker (only 5 megapixels), the operating system is older (2.3.6), the processor is even older.  But this model will cost only 10 thousand rubles.  True, reviews about it are not the most flattering due to poor performance. </p><p>  Two more devices included in the ‚Äúprotected‚Äù group are the <span>Senseit P3</span> and P101 mobile phones.  Their cost is an order of magnitude lower - about 4-5 thousand rubles, but their level of reliability exceeds what any smartphone can please.  These devices can be called a ‚Äúdialer‚Äù with a minimum set of additional functions.  Judging by the reviews, these phones perform their task admirably;  at least hold the battery much longer than smartphones.  Such a Senseit phone will become an indispensable thing when hiking or when engaging in extreme sports. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Ruler ‚ÄúFor Life‚Äù </h2>

    <p>  Another group of devices is the so-called Life-devices.  It includes three smartphones (with a large touch screen), as well as two keyboard devices (typical ‚Äúdialers‚Äù).  Of course, these devices have a greater margin of functionality than the ‚Äúprotected‚Äù devices described above, but they are not able to withstand the destructive factors that they can meet even in everyday life. </p><p>  The most advanced here is the Senseit E500 mobile phone.  It has a 13 megapixel camera, a powerful 4000 mAh battery, and an MTK 6582M processor.  Indeed, this model can be called the most advanced of all, although its cost is only 10 thousand rubles. </p><p>  It is followed by the E400, a Senseit cell phone with a weaker camera and smaller screen.  However, the technical component here is the same (most likely, the model is the predecessor of the E500, therefore its cost is lower) - only 9 thousand rubles. </p><p>  The third smartphone - L301, - is equipped with an even simpler processor, a 5 megapixel camera and costs only 5 thousand. </p><p>  The second ‚Äúwing‚Äù of this line is the L100 and L108 keyboard devices.  The first is different in that it has a very large (in volume) 2100 mAh battery, with which a similar device can easily work for several weeks.  The second is simply equipped with support for two SIM cards. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Of course, describing any device and its technical characteristics, it would be advisable to refer to the recommendations left by the buyers of these devices.  Which we did in the process of preparing this review. </p><p>  And we managed to find out that in general the Senseit phone has a lot of advantages - low price, good assembly, well-selected components.  However, he also has some serious drawbacks.  In particular, it is not characterized by the most stable operation.  Judging by some reports, the device may suddenly lose the network, turn off or reboot at the time of the call.  Users also caution that Senseit smartphones sometimes ‚Äúlose‚Äù some of the modules: for example, the camera or GPS system turns off and stops functioning.  There are many such examples, and they all talk about the instability of the phone. </p><p>  I would like to pay special attention to support.  Mobile phones that periodically lose the network signal and turn off for no reason need to be fixed - this is an obvious fact.  At the same time, as the reviews describe, with any attempts to contact the supplier company, buyers do not get anything.  All contact information indicated on the site is irrelevant due to the fact that absolutely no information is received for any requests. </p>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãlaunching a domestic smartphone manufacturer is not new (in fact, all the accessories for the phone come from the Middle Kingdom).  Here, the ‚Äúpluses‚Äù include the low cost and availability of such devices. </p><p>  On the other hand, there is a question of stability and reliability.  No matter how interesting the development company is, the Senseit mobile phone (reviews confirm this) remains unstable.  Because of this, working with him is uncomfortable and better - contact a more reliable supplier (of which there are many today). </p><p>  The same goes for support.  If you find factory defects in the form of unstable or poor-quality operation of a smartphone (especially developed by a Russian company), you will have an obvious desire to contact her and somehow solve the problem.  But this, judging by the comments, is impossible to do. </p><h2>  A bit about reviews </h2><p>  Finally, I would like to give one more clarification regarding the recommendations.  In the process of searching for reviews, we found this pattern: many users often purchase a gadget, focusing on good reviews about it.  It turns out that buyers get into an unpleasant situation purely because of untrue comments.  A rhetorical question arises: "Who needs such false reviews?" </p>

    <p>  Therefore, while searching for information about the device, check the mass of sources.  If you see that the site has either very good or bad comments - be on your guard.  Perhaps the former will turn out to be custom-made and untruthful, and the latter - what will really wait for you. </p>
