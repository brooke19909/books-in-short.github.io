  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make a hare from balls</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Twisting is the technology for creating various figures from balloons.  Such a useful skill is especially useful for parents of young children, and it will be interesting for other categories of people to learn how to do something unusual.  In the end, such an extraordinary craft can be a wonderful surprise for a holiday that will delight everyone around. </p><p>  The article will discuss how to make a hare of balloons. </p><h2>  What you need for work </h2><p>  Before you try your hand at creating an interesting gift, you need to stock up on the following materials: </p><ul><li>  a large ball of the selected color; </li><li>  two long balls; </li><li>  five small size; </li><li>  colored paper; </li><li>  double-sided adhesive tape or rubber glue. </li></ul><h2>  Step-by-step instruction </h2><p>  It is necessary to inflate the balls, those that are small in size, do not need to be filled completely with air.  Then, using adhesive tape or glue, you must connect the three balls.  Two of them will serve as paws, and one more - tail. </p><p>  A large ball - the body - is attached from above.  Two more balls are glued on both sides of the body, the upper legs of the bunny. </p><p>  The next step is to tackle the ears.  Here you will need a long ball, in the middle of which a loop is made, and the rest of the tail is pushed into the loop, making another loop, then simply twist the ball. </p><p>  Now ears are glued to the hare <span>from balloons</span> - to the head of the craft. </p><p>  What is colored paper for?  She will need to make eyes, nose and mouth for a hare from balls.  With the help of scissors, the necessary details are cut out, which, after manufacturing, are simply attached to the muzzle. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="balloon hare" class="if uuid-2508988" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2508988.jpg"></div><h2>  What else is the option of crafts </h2><p>  You can make an original decoration for a child‚Äôs birthday using another technology.  In this case, you need to get balls for modeling.  If for someone this term is unfamiliar, it is worth explaining that this is the name of special balloons that have an elongated shape and are intended directly for the manufacture of any crafts.  Models come in different sizes, thicknesses, not to mention colors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="100kupon.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself hare of balls" class="if uuid-2509008" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2509008.jpg"></div><h2>  Necessary fixtures </h2><p>  For this work you need to stock up: </p><ul><li>  a pump; </li><li>  small weight; </li><li>  balls for modeling. </li></ul><p>  The necessary cargo is done very simply, in a five-inch ball you need to pour water and tie a knot so that it does not pour out. </p><h2>  How to do </h2><ol><li>  You need to inflate 10 balls of the selected color, which are marked in 10 inches.  They should be filled with air to the full volume, then tie everything together. </li><li>  The load necessary for the stability of the figure is attached to the already obtained bundle.  You will also need to snap a deflated ball.  It is necessary to bind the parts of the bunny. </li><li>  5 more balls of similar marking are inflated, only they are filled with air a little less.  Then they need to be applied over the first ten. </li><li>  With the help of a tied ball without air, both parts of the craft are attached. </li><li>  The third part of the hare is formed in a similar way. </li><li>  In the next row you will need to add a ball of white color to indicate the breast. </li><li>  The fifth row is formed of 2 white and 3 balls of the main color, the latter are located at the bottom, the first on top. </li><li>  In the same way, you need to make another row. </li><li>  In the event that the ball for tying suddenly ends, you just need to attach another one of the same. </li><li>  It remains to fill the ball with air, which will act as the head of a hare.  By the way, you can buy a special ball for this case. </li><li>  At this stage, the paws will be formed, here we use SDMs with tails.  Each ball takes 3 balls. </li></ol><p>  As soon as these parts for the hare are made of balls, you need to attach a ball to them and attach crafts to the body.  Thanks to this technique, it will be easy to determine how long the SDM will be needed to connect a pair of paws. </p><p>  For each next row, the balls are inflated smaller. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tulsaballoons.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hare with carrot" class="if uuid-2509572" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/2509572.jpg"></div><h2>  Useful advice </h2><p>  If the head of the hare from the balls will lean forward, and this happens, then an error occurs with the size of the balls on the chest.  You can solve the difficulty by simply inflating a five-inch modular ball, which is placed under the chin of the craft. </p><p>  As you can see from the article, making a hare from balls with your own hands is quite simple. </p>
