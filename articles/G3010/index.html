It was developed by the Russian company Vobis, which is gradually entering the technological leaders of the global mobile device market.  One of the most notable attributes of the device is a powerful 13 megapixel camera with a very bright flash.  Smartphone Highscreen Alpha Ice is equipped with an FM radio module, like many other models of this class.  Experts praise this modern phone for the highest performance, not only in comparison with devices of its class, but also in comparison with devices of the premium segment. </p>

    <p>  It is interesting that many experts note the similarity of the design elements (as well as the level of performance) of the Highscreen Alpha Ice smartphone not so much with devices of the same class and one platform, but with the device from the camp of "ideological" opponents of Android smartphones - with the fifth version iPhone itself.  What exactly caused such amazing associations among experts? </p><h2>  Box contents </h2><p>  The device comes with a brief user manual, a unit for recharging the battery, a cable for connecting via a <span>USB connector, headphones with a</span> simple configuration and a spare white back panel.  There are no other devices and components in the box.  The owners of Highscreen Alpha Ice will not have problems with the acquisition of additional accessories - a cover, more advanced headphones, spare wires - all this can be bought in any communication salon.  Experts note the successful design and manufacturing material of the package itself: it is made in blue and black shades and is made of high-quality cardboard with a rather dense structure. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  iPhone in Russian? </h2><p>  According to many experts, the proximity of the device to the iPhone 5 can be traced already at the design level.  Some experts allow themselves some irony, saying that it would be more appropriate to talk not so much about the similarities between the Russian and the "apple" concepts, but about their differences. </p><p>  Highscreen Alpha Ice, reviews of which are mostly positive and are found not only in the Russian-language segment of the Internet, but also on Western resources, is seen by experts and users as Apple's worthy competitor to the device.  Owners involuntarily notice that in fact there are few differences.  Of those that are clearly striking, except that the lack of a <span>Russian smartphone</span> branded Home key, which is the iPhone 5, as well as dimensions.  Even the edging on the body brings together the design solutions of the two devices.  True, experts say, the back panel of the smartphone from Vobis looks even too "budget".  If you open the phone‚Äôs housing cover, you will immediately see several slots: for SIM-cards (regular and mini), as well as for MicroSD flash memory.  By the way, there are two covers in the kit - black (with a matte surface) and white (smooth).  They can be changed to suit the style of clothing. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Originality of the concept </h2><p>  The main part of the smartphone controls is located on the right side of the case.  This configuration is rather unusual for such devices, but experts consider its use a good find.  So, on the right there is a key for adjusting the sound level, a power button (and simultaneously activating the display).  There are no keys or connectors on the left side of the case.  The smartphone is equipped with only two external connectors - for micro-USB and headphones.  Under the screen there are three typical touch buttons: "Back", "Menu", "Home".  All of them have an elegant backlight in blue and white. </p><p>  The housing also houses an LED that signals various events (missed signal, discharged battery, etc.) in different colors.  The build quality of the case (although it is plastic, like most budget smartphones) is estimated by experts as very high. </p><h2>  Screen </h2>

    <p>  The display of the Highscreen Alpha Ice is quite large - 4.7 inches.  Its resolution is 720 x 1280 pixels.  Matrix Technology - IPS.  The screen is covered with a durable layer of glass.  All these technological features predetermine the highest image quality, regardless of the angle at which the user looks at the Highscreen Alpha Ice screen.  The display, experts believe, should be a special reason for the pride of the owners of the device.  Even in this parameter, the Russian smartphone is comparable to the iPhone, the level of screen technology of which is beyond doubt.  The touchscreen Highscreen Alpha Ice, like most similar devices, supports multi-touch.  You can watch movies in the modern 16: 9 format on the screen.  Experts note that there is no layer of air between the protective glass and the display matrix.  According to experts, largely thanks to this solution, high image quality and fairly large viewing angles are achieved.  Of course, the IPS matrix plays a role here, which is more technologically advanced than its predecessors (we are talking about TN, TFT, although even these <span>types of matrices</span> have their own advantages). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  "Iron" </h2>

    <p>  The chipset installed in the phone is MT 6589. The processor is Cortex version A7.  The video subsystem is regulated by the SGX 544MP module.  The phone RAM is 1 GB.  Available internal flash memory is 1.4 GB (additional modules up to 32 GB are supported).  Testing the performance of the smartphone proved that this modern device is quite able to cope with the technical tasks assigned to it. </p><p>  The phone, as the studies of specialists have proved, easily launches applications, provides the necessary smoothness of movement between different windows, copes well with games, including those that are considered to be ‚Äúheavy‚Äù.  Many users, having read the review made by experts on the fact of testing Highscreen Alpha Ice, say that the obtained indicators are true.  Owners of the smartphone run games and applications without problems.  The phone works unusually stable even in conditions of increased loads on the "iron". </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The battery capacity of the device is quite modest - only 2 thousand mAh.  With an average intensity of use, the autonomous operation of the smartphone is about a day.  Some users say that if you use the device sparingly, you can use recharging no more than once every two days.  Users who leave Highscreen Alpha Ice reviews after the operation tend to evaluate the smartphone‚Äôs battery resources as sufficient for themselves.  Most owners of the device do not see the need to recharge the battery more than once a day. </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  The Highscreen Alpha Ice camera has a decent resolution of 13 megapixels.  This component works very soundly.  Some experts have questions about the contrast and overall speed, but there are no complaints about the quality of the picture.  The camera‚Äôs capabilities are perfectly combined with an amazing screen quality: after making magnificent shots, the owner of the device can immediately enjoy plenty of them. </p><p>  Of course, on a computer, tablet and other devices where the screen is larger, the pictures look no worse (just like when printing on a color printer).  It is possible to record videos in FullHD format and 30-frame stream speed.  The quality of this type of multimedia, as well as in the case of the photo, is very high.  The clips look great both on the regular screen of the smartphone, and on larger displays of external devices. </p><p>  <span>The front camera is</span> also not bad - 3 megapixels.  There is a powerful flash based on LEDs (and again we recall that a very similar one is installed on the iPhone 5).  The main camera of the smartphone is equipped with an autofocus function.  The program for the camera has a very comfortable interface: all the necessary elements are in sight, there is nothing superfluous.  The flash, by the way, can also work in the mode of a sufficiently bright flashlight. </p>

    <h2>  Software </h2><p>  The smartphone is controlled by Android OS in version 4.2.1.  A branded shell, unlike many competing solutions, is not installed here (at the same time, the standard interface is very easy to personify, so experts attribute this aspect to the positive aspects of the software filling of the Highscreen Alpha Ice phone).  The firmware of the device is factory.  If you look for untwisted solutions in software, you can note a shell containing a number of technical indicators that clearly demonstrate to the user the degree of processor utilization, memory, battery level and operator signal quality.  As a rule, in the interfaces of most other smartphones only the last two components are displayed - and this is some kind of originality of the shell from Vobis. </p><p>  Among the most useful pre-installed applications are an office program, a video player, a phone book.  There is a browser.  If something is missing - everything can be found and downloaded on Google Play.  Thanks to the high performance of the phone, application installation is very fast.  Running programs and using them takes place without crashes and freezes.  Unless, of course, the application itself is made with high quality. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  Among the wireless interfaces supported by the smartphone are Wi-Fi, Bluetooth.  There is <span>a GPS module.</span>  Two SIM cards are supported (though one of them is micro and the other of a standard format).  Experts who decided to make a review based on the Highscreen Alpha Ice study did not raise significant complaints about the quality of the communication modules. </p><h2>  Expert Summary </h2><p>  Among the unique advantages of the device, which are noted by users and experts, are its excellent design, high quality materials, solid assembly, excellent HD display, and the availability of a spare panel.  The minuses of the device are experts not the most modern OS and not very convenient latch of a spare panel.  For some, the sound quality from the main speaker is criticized, but the overall impression of the device is very positive. </p><p>  In a particularly positive way, experts respond to the performance of the phone.  In their opinion, the ‚Äúhardware‚Äù installed in the device is comparable in its level with the ‚Äústuffing‚Äù of the top models of the world's leading phone brands.  At the same time, the Russian smartphone seriously outperforms foreign competitors in price. </p><h2>  User reviews </h2><p>  Users praise the device.  Many of them call the device universal, believing that the device is quite comparable in its functionality with a smartphone.  Among the arguments brought forward by supporters of this thesis are the device‚Äôs large screen, powerful hardware, and the convenience of using the necessary slots.  Of course, the number one factor for many Highscreen Alpha Ice users is the price, and it‚Äôs quite reasonable. </p>

    <p>  In Russian communication stores, the device can be bought for 10-12 thousand rubles.  (and in online stores you can really find even more profitable options).  Experts call the ratio of cost, functionality and performance of the device one of the most optimal in the segment of mid-range smartphones. </p>
