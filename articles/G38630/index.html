    <p>  In general, Marmaris is very famous among young people, since the fame of a dance resort has entrenched in him.  Marmaris consists of four villages - Armutalan, Sarigerme, Turunch and Icmeler.  Each of them has its own characteristics and advantages. </p><p>  The beaches of the resort are not a very wide strip, which is separated from the hotels and restaurants by the roadway.

    <p>  In fairness, it is worth saying that the hotel is quite small, and therefore there is practically no territory around the building.  The complex can most likely be called an urban type institution.  At his disposal a little more than 50 rooms.  The hotel building has five floors and is equipped with an elevator.  The hotel does not have a wide variety of apartments, all of them are represented by standards.  According to visitors, the rooms have a good design and equipment, they are functional and suitable for a comfortable stay.  Of course, the apartments cannot be called fashionable, but they have absolutely everything that tourists may need.  Cleaning is carried out daily, efficiently and without delay.  Sheets and towels are changed every three days.  In general, tourists praise the hotel's room stock. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  According to reviews, Marmaris Sea Center Hotel 3 * (Marmaris) operates on an all-inclusive basis.  The main restaurant offers a fairly varied buffet with tasty and fresh dishes.  For example, for breakfast guests are served eggs, jam, honey, cereal, granola, cookies and other standard dishes.  But for lunch there are many salads of fresh vegetables, soups, meat, side dishes, sweets, stewed vegetables.  For dinner, the assortment of dishes is about the same.  Of fruit, the restaurant usually serves melons and watermelons. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="marmaris sea center hotel 3 marmaris reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2124454.jpg"></div>

    <p>  As for drinks, wine, tea, coffee, beer are available to guests without any restrictions, thanks to the all-inclusive concept.  Many tourists praise food very much.  Of course, the assortment of food is not as great as, for example, in five-star establishments, but everything is prepared very tasty.  And nobody will remain hungry here. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  Numerous enthusiastic reviews from tourists are the best recommendation for the establishment.  Guests are noted by friendly staff who are attentive to all vacationers.  Of course, only one person speaks Russian at the reception.  But this does not stop our tourists from relaxing at all.  There is practically no language barrier; one can always explain. </p><p>  The hotel grounds are incredibly small.  Or rather, it simply does not exist.  Behind the building there is only a small pool with a small seating area and several sun loungers.  The hotel is a standard city institution.  And the whole complex has an incredibly convenient location.  Located in the center of Marmaris, it gives all guests the opportunity at any time to walk through the local streets and walk to the market and the pedestrian street with bars and restaurants. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the hotel is located on the second line, the distance from it to the beach does not exceed hundreds of meters.  As mentioned, only the carriageway separates the hotel from the coastline.  A special underpass allows you to safely cross the road.  Of course, the nearest municipal beach is quite dirty and crowded, so not all guests want to relax on it. </p><p>  Every day at nine in the morning a bus leaves the hotel, which takes tourists free of charge to Nirvana Beach.  In the evening he returns.  Everyone can visit the beautiful coast.  The road to the beach takes only about ten minutes.  Tourists will definitely recommend visiting Nirvana Beach.  Firstly, this is a very beautiful place, and secondly, there are much fewer people, and the coast and water are incredibly clean.  Stunningly beautiful photographs can be taken on Nirvana Beach.  Even if you do not want to go to this beach every day, then at least once you need to visit it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="marmaris sea center hotel 3 pics" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2124470.jpg"></div>

According to tourists, the institution can be safely called one of the best in its category in all of Marmaris.  The hotel is perfect for young people, since the main party street of the resort with bars and restaurants is located very close by.  In general, the hotel can have a good rest with children.  Of course, there is no animation and playgrounds, but with such a close location of the sea hardly something else is needed.  In general, tourists from Russia highly recommend this institution from the best side.  Therefore, when planning a vacation in Marmaris, you can pay attention to it. </p>
