When choosing a place to spend it, many carefully study the Internet in search of a better place.  Thailand is considered one of the most popular resorts.  Where to relax in <span>Thailand with children?</span>  What to bring with you?  How to visit the sights?  How to choose a hotel.  About all this - in the article. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="15.870032" data-lng="100.99254100000007" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="5"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/2/8/5/17285.png"></div><h2>  Direction selection </h2><p>  Before you go to Thailand with a child, you need to carefully study the offers of travel companies.  More often than not, they always have at their disposal convenient tours for families with children of different ages.  When flying with children under the age of 3, it is important to choose direct non-stop flights.  This is primarily due to the convenience for the baby.  In this case, the choice of destinations is small - Pattaya or Phuket.  With older children, you can afford a choice of flights with transfers and get to Krabi, Phangan, Samui. </p><h2>  Phuket Holidays </h2><p>  This destination can be called ideal for a holiday in Thailand with children.  Where to go on the island?  Phuket boasts a clear sea and beautiful beaches, so it is ideal for family vacations.  Despite the fact that the average room rate in hotels is slightly higher than similar accommodation in another part of the country, Phuket is most oriented for families.  The following hotels have the most positive reviews: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Swissotel Resort Phuket; </li><li>  Hilton Phuket Arcadia Resort. </li></ul><p>  Young children will be interested in visiting the Phuket FantaSea park, where the Fantasy show is taking place, and there is also the opportunity to ride elephants.  Older children are invited to visit the Phuket Go-Kart Speedway &amp; Offroad Fun Park karting park or Splash Jungle water park.  Children, as well as adults, will be interested in visiting the Museum of Optical Illusions, the garden of exotic butterflies, bird park, oceanarium, as well as the zoo.  In addition, for everyone there are diving and windsurfing classes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kuoni.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful phuket" class="if uuid-3212678" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53896/3212678.jpg"></div><p>  Among the attractions of Phuket, it should be noted the park of King Rama IX, a statue of the Big Buddha, a pearl farm and a museum of sea shells. </p><h2>  Koh Samui </h2><p>  Where in Thailand with children can I go?  Like Phuket, Koh Samui has a well-developed infrastructure, clean beaches and a large number of local attractions.  The disadvantages include only greater remoteness and flight with transfers. </p><p>  Children of all ages may be interested in sea rides, boat trips, as well as numerous excursions.  Samui also has a tropical park with unusual nature, two small water parks - Pink Elephant and Coco Splash, a large zoo with a terrarium, snake, crocodile and sheep farms, and the center of the monkeys. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You can stay in hotels such as: </p><ul><li>  Sheraton 5 *; </li><li>  Regent Beach Resort 4 *; </li><li>  The Fair House Beach Resort &amp; Hotel Samui 3 *. </li></ul><p>  They have a different level of comfort, but are equally well adapted for European tourists with children. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kohplanner.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays with children in Koh Samui" class="if uuid-3212679" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53896/3212679.jpg"></div><h2>  Hua Hin City </h2><p>  Where is better to go to Thailand with children?  If you plan a passive vacation with sunbathing on the beach, then a better place than the city of Hua Hin can not be found.  It is located near the capital of Bangkok and is famous for its abundance of clean sandy beaches. </p><p>  In Thailand, the child will be interested in visiting one of the many amusement parks, the city zoo, a sheep farm, as well as join the local nature in the national park. </p><p>  The following are recognized as the best hotels in the city: </p><ul><li>  Hilton Hua Hin Resort &amp; Spa; </li><li>  Sunvillas Hua Hin Blue Lagoon; </li><li>  Amari 4 *. </li></ul><p>  In these hotels, everything is provided, up to three meals a day and the presence in the daily menu of dishes for young children. </p><h2>  Krabi </h2><p>  This province is notable for its small size, the lack of classic attractions in the form of amusement parks, but remains popular due to its unique nature and magnificent beaches.  Where to go to Thailand with a child in order to fully enjoy the warm waves of the sea and hot sand?  Of course, to the province of Krabi. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Tourists with children can go diving and windsurfing, as well as visit the oceanarium, where you can observe various representatives of the local aquatic life, as well as feed large catfish. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.shoreexcursions.asia" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crab aquarium" class="if uuid-3212660" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53896/3212660.jpg"></div><p>  Recommended to stay in the following hotels: </p><ul><li>  Sheraton Krabi Beach Resort 5 *; </li><li>  Centara Anda Dhevi Resort &amp; Spa Krabi 4 *. </li></ul><p>  One of the main advantages of Krabi is the low prices for hotel accommodation, as well as entertainment.  This feature is due to the large remoteness of the province from the capital of the country. </p><h2>  Features of rest </h2><p>  Should I go to Thailand with a child?  Before giving a definite answer to this question, one should study not only the positive aspects of relaxing on golden beaches, but also its negative aspects.  Experienced tourists note the following disadvantages of family vacations with children: </p><ol><li>  In some places, such as Bangkok, Phuket, right next to the hotels, you can notice local girls with reduced social responsibility who earn their living by selling their own bodies.  In order to avoid this unpleasant moment, you should carefully select the hotel, focusing on the reviews of couples with children. </li><li>  Children often do not tolerate acclimatization.  On average, a fragile organism gets used to the new area within 5-7 days, so it makes no sense to go on holiday to Thailand with a small child for less than 2-3 weeks. </li><li>  In many cities of the country, narrow and broken roads, so before you go with a small child in a stroller, you need to carefully weigh the pros and cons. </li><li>  Despite the fact that there are enough entertainments for children of any age in Thailand, there are not so many hotels in the territory of which there is a playground.  If this matters, then the choice of hotel should be treated more carefully and find out this moment at the stage of booking a room. </li><li>  There are also quite a few hotels that have an all-inclusive system, so you need to take care of the nutrition of the child in advance. </li></ol><p>  In order to organize the best vacation with children in Thailand, all these factors should be considered. </p><h2>  When to go? </h2><p>  An important question about when it is better to go to Thailand with children worries a large number of tourists.  High season in a warm country is winter and the beginning of spring.  This is a great moment to escape from the cold and winter depression.  It is in December that a special influx of tourists is observed, so tickets to the desired hotel and plane must be booked in advance. </p><p>  In May, the rainy season begins, so most tourists return home.  However, this does not mean at all that the weather is going badly.  As a rule, tropical rains are short-term, therefore they do not interfere with beach vacations.  It is also worth noting that during this period, hotel prices and flights are significantly reduced.  Ideal for a summer vacation in Thailand are considered the province of Krabi and Pattaya.  The sea at Phuket and Samui at this time becomes muddy, as well as turbulent. </p><p>  The good news is that fresh local fruits can be purchased regardless of the time of year.  Winter is considered the harvesting season of citrus and watermelons, in spring pineapples, lychees, mangoes, mangosteen ripen, in summer - durians, and in autumn you can enjoy fresh coconuts and pitaya.  Bananas and guavas are available year-round. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thailandforvisitors.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="thailand fruit" class="if uuid-3212668" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53896/3212668.jpg"></div><h2>  Necessary things </h2><p>  What is better to go with a child in Thailand?  When choosing a place and hotel, do not forget about important things that you should take with you on a trip.  In order for nothing to slip out of sight, it is recommended that you make a list.  The most important things to do on a trip are: </p><ol><li>  Passport for all family members, including children. </li><li>  Visa, which is issued at the consulate of Thailand in Moscow.  It is especially necessary if the duration of the trip exceeds the period of 30 days. </li><li>  Return flights. <div class="photo" data-original="aeropaxholidays.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="passport and visa" class="if uuid-3212672" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53896/3212672.jpg"></div></li><li>  Vacations if you purchased a hot tour at the agency. </li><li>  Travel insurance.  Although this paragraph may seem optional, it is not.  In an emergency, medical assistance may be needed, and it is insanely expensive without insurance. </li><li>  Cash.  It is necessary to give preference to dollars or euros, since the exchange rate for them is stable, and you can exchange for local currency in any bank branch. </li><li>  An international driver‚Äôs license for a car or motorcycle, if you plan to travel on these modes of transport as a driver.  The fine for driving without a license is about 500 euros. </li></ol><p>  Going on a trip needs to be slow and thoughtful so as not to accidentally forget any of the necessary things at home. </p><h2>  First aid kit </h2><p>  What to take a child to Thailand?  Despite the fact that the issued medical insurance can cover all the costs of visiting doctors, it will not be superfluous to take some medications with you.  Thus, it will be possible to urgently provide assistance without wasting time looking for a pharmacy.  The following drugs should be included in a travel kit for a family with a child of any age: </p><ol><li>  Antipyretic drugs, such as Paracetamol, Nimesil.  You need to take medicines with different active ingredients in case one of them turns out to be ineffective. </li><li>  Remedies for diarrhea, such as Smecta or Chloramphenicol.  They are necessary in case of poisoning by local food or indigestion caused by exotic foods. </li><li>  Painkillers - No-Shpa, Ketanov, Pentalgin.  Their need is due to the fact that strong painkillers in Thailand are not freely available. </li><li>  Antiseptic agents such as iodine, brilliant green or hydrogen peroxide. </li><li>  Bandages, plasters, and cotton swabs can come in handy for small abrasions, cuts, scratches. </li><li>  Antihistamines in case of an allergic reaction, such as Cetrin, Fenistil. </li></ol><p>  It also makes sense to take with you the specific drugs that a child or adults need to use regularly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.unhaggle.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="travel kit" class="if uuid-3212675" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53896/3212675.jpg"></div><h2>  Hygiene products </h2><p>  When traveling with a child you need to take care of convenience.  To do this, it is recommended to take the following hygiene products with you on a trip, which are problematic to purchase locally: </p><ol><li>  Familiar diapers that do not cause allergies. </li><li>  Tampons and other feminine hygiene products that are common to use. </li><li>  Comb, hairdryer, as it may not be in the hotel room. </li><li>  Razor, because in Thailand it is quite expensive. </li></ol><p>  It also makes sense to take care of the nutrition of the child.  The fact is that the usual cereals and mixtures in Thailand can not be found, so it is recommended to stock them in advance.  It will also be useful for children to take a sunblock with them so that the baby‚Äôs delicate skin does not burn under the scorching sun.  Hygiene items such as toothpaste, brush, washing products, as well as shampoos and shower gels can be easily purchased at local stores, so it makes no sense to bring them with you. </p><h2>  Unnecessary things </h2><p>  In Thailand hotels for families with children, bed linen and towels are provided, so it is not necessary to take them with you.  Also, when renting an apartment or condominium, all the necessary bedding is provided by the landlord. </p><p>  Also unnecessary can be called festive clothes and shoes.  In most cases, she will remain untouched at the bottom of the suitcase.  The exception is when visits to expensive restaurants are planned, for example, Lebuois in Bangkok, where a special dress code is applied. </p><p>  Also, do not take with you the usual remedies for mosquitoes and other insects.  Unfortunately, they have no effect on local mosquitoes, so it is recommended to purchase such funds at a local store. </p><h2>  Clothes for baby </h2><p>  When flying to a warm country, you should make sure that the child has the necessary clothes in sufficient quantities.  This is due to the fact that children often get dirty, and sometimes it is not possible to wash things.  The following clothes are useful for a child: </p><ul><li>  some simple t-shirts; </li><li>  several pairs of shorts; </li><li>  light dresses or sundresses for girls; </li><li>  sufficient removable underwear; </li><li>  a sweater or windbreaker in case of a cool evening; </li><li>  jeans or trousers; </li><li>  hats of any kind, since Thailand is a sunny country where you can easily get heat stroke; </li><li>  comfortable sandals; </li><li>  beach flip flops; </li><li>  sneakers for walking tours; </li><li>  clothes for sleeping. </li></ul><p>  Girls may also need long skirts and shoes with a closed heel in case you plan to visit Buddhist shrines and temples. </p><div class="photo" data-original="eltakeiteasy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pack your suitcase" class="if uuid-3212677" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53896/3212677.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Traveling to Thailand with a small child is a great and exciting event for the whole family.  It is important to choose the right hotel so that it has all the necessary conditions, as well as make a list of necessary things that you might definitely need.  In this case, do not load yourself with excess baggage.  With the right approach to choosing a place, season and entertainment, you can have a great time with the whole family. </p>
