    <p>  The ancient Greek hero stole a divine fire in order to make life easier for people.  It was Eagle Rocks that became the place of his punishment.  A bird came here to hatch the liver and tear Prometheus‚Äôs chest with its claws.  The people who lived here sympathized, but were afraid to help.  And only the girl Agura climbed the Eagle Rocks and brought the hero food and water.  Then the visits began to be repeated, accompanied by conversations. </p><p>  When the bird of prey saw the helper, she clutched at her with her claws and dropped into the mouth of the gorge.  In the fall, a young woman became a river.  Now they could speak with Prometheus around the clock.  When Hercules was walking nearby, he heard their conversation and freed the hero, killing the bird and breaking the chain that bound the titan. </p><h2>  What to arm </h2><p>  If you are going to Eagle Rocks (Sochi), be sure to bring a camera, water and food with you to refresh yourself after an active walk.  Of course, there are shops there, but the price may slightly exceed your expectations.  It‚Äôs better to put on sneakers, because you‚Äôll have to go through the mountain landscape.  Slippers and heels are unlikely to help in this matter.  But the swimsuit will be very handy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

Despite the fact that the spectacle is amazing, all the best is still waiting for you ahead. </p><p>  Very soon you will arrive at Eagle Rocks.

    <h2>  Attractions and views </h2><p>  As you continue, you will come across a statue of Prometheus.  A photograph with this attraction will please you for a long time if you want to remember everything experienced. </p><p>  The pedestal rises at an altitude of 380 meters above the sea.  It's time to explore <span>Mount Akhun,</span> a seascape.  Also here is the "ITC Sputnik", not distinguished by such picturesqueness.  Wonderful mountains and the current Agura river below are clearly visible.  It‚Äôs very nice to look at all this, and the photos in the end are wonderful. </p>

    <h2>  The way back </h2><p>  Then you can relax a bit, because the descent begins.  You need to spend no more than 20 minutes on it.  You will come across a point where a small tributary Agurchik merges with his mother Agura.  This is the end of the Eagle Rocks.  After you have reached the confluence of the rivers, you can choose one of three ways: go through the water and go along the path along the forest or turn right, step on the path and go to Akhun.  You don‚Äôt even have to cross the reservoir, but turn right and follow the stream near the rocks. </p><p>  As for the forest, it is very nice and pleasant.  The air is clean, it is light here, there are a couple of water arteries.  This is where a swimsuit comes in handy.  After a long walk, take a good swim.  The road to Akhun will suit you if you are a true adventure lover, because it is characterized by a long length and steepness.  So it is better to splash in the gentle waters and relax. </p><p>  There are also waterfalls, the very first of which is called the Devil's Font.  Here you can see small lakes that are also suitable for swimming.  Once on Agura, you can enjoy the view of Eagle Rocks from the bottom of your heart.  From above, a beautiful panorama opens in Sochi, and from below you can feel the scale of the rock itself.  At the end of the path you will find the restaurant complex "Caucasian Aul", where you can restore strength. </p><h2>  Another variant </h2><p>  In addition, you can go in the opposite direction and get no less fun.  If you do not want to get lost and wander alone - at your service an excursion.  Eagle Rock is a wonderful and picturesque place that can leave amazing impressions in your soul.  Usually, guides advise you to move in that direction, because when climbing, you will follow a better road than when descending, which is important for your convenience.  In addition, in the opposite direction, the entrance will cost more than twice. </p>
