    <h2>  Baltic Beach (hotel, Jurmala) </h2><p>  One of the best hotels in the city is Baltic Beach.  I must say that among all vacationers the most popular complexes near the coast.  And in this sense, Jurmala is no exception.  Hotels by the sea - the most popular and expensive.  What could be better than living on the coast and constantly hearing the rustling waves?  Baltic Beach has access to a beautiful sandy beach.  It is located in the very center of the city. </p><p>  Central Jomas Street is just two hundred meters away.  For visitors there is always open a pool with real sea water, a park, free parking and a children's playground.  I must say that Jurmala hotels with a swimming pool are always in demand, since the water of the Gulf of Riga does not always please with an optimum temperature. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

But not all tourists are satisfied with the rooms.  According to them, the apartments do not correspond to those photos that are presented when booking online.  Many people are puzzled by the request to use rubber caps in the pool and the strong smell of chlorinated water.  But in general, everyone is happy with the service and infrastructure. </p><h2>  Hotel "Jurmala SPA" </h2><p>  It is located in the very center of the city.  The beach is just a few minutes walk.

    <p>  The Jurmala SPA Hotel organizes entertaining evenings with live music at its dance floor.  In the restaurant of the hotel guests are served dishes of Latvian and European cuisines. </p><h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  Vacationers note an acceptable price-quality ratio.  The cheapest room per day will cost from three thousand rubles per person.  The price of accommodation varies from the number of days (for stays of more than seven to ten days there is a discount).  The restaurant "Jurmala" operates on the territory of the complex, which since 2012 has revived the best traditions of the Cabaret show programs within its walls.  This concert is really worthy of attention. </p><p>  Visitors are especially pleased with the spa facilities.  Many tourists stay here not for the first time, preferring this complex to other hotels due to the presence of spa treatments here.  According to tourists, it is in this hotel that you can relax and enjoy your vacation. </p><p>  But as for the friendliness of the staff, the guests respond extremely negatively to their competence and desire to solve problems when they arise, characterizing this style of behavior as unworthy for an institution of this level.  Not everyone is satisfied with the food in the hotel complex. </p><h2>  Villa Joma (Jurmala) </h2><p>  Hotels on the shore are the most popular among tourists and guests of the city.  These include Villa Joma.  The hotel is located in a building built in the early twentieth century in the historical center of Jurmala, on the waterfront itself.  The beach is just a five-minute walk away.  Just a few minutes from the complex is the famous Dzintari Concert Hall. </p>

However, according to visitors' reviews, the standard rooms are very small, they are very crowded.  In addition, all apartments are air-conditioned. </p><p>  The hotel will appeal to those who are not looking for fuss, but rather want silence and solitude.  The food in the restaurant of the complex is quite decent.  According to some tourists, the price is too high if you do not visit the spa regularly.  But the friendliness of the staff pleasantly surprises. </p><h2>  Hotel Parus </h2><p>  Hotel Parus is located in a quiet location, a hundred meters from the beach.  The hotel is notable for the fact that the building was built in 1920 and is a rare piece of architecture in Jurmala. </p>
