So, the settlement of newly staying tourists is carried out starting from 14:00.  However, this does not mean that if you arrived at the hotel much earlier than the specified time, you will have to wait several hours in the lobby.  So, the administration is always trying to do everything possible for the comfort of the guests, so if in case of your early arrival the room you have booked is ready, then you will be settled into it right away.  Unfortunately, this is not always possible during the so-called ‚Äúhigh season‚Äù, when the hotel is almost 100% full.  In this case, you will be asked to leave heavy bags in the luggage storage room and begin to relax, going to the pool or the beach, lunch or a walk around the hotel.  As for the day of departure, in accordance with the internal rules of Mirador 4 * you must release the number and hand over the keys before noon.  Then you should pay the amount for the entire period of stay at the hotel.  You can pay here both in cash and with plastic cards of the popular payment systems <span>"Visa" and "Mastercard".</span> </p>
