Its main advantages and disadvantages</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Fishing unit "carrot" is considered one of the most reliable for connecting braids with monoleska.  This method is effective and easy to bind fishing line and cord, which are distinguished by a rigid and slippery surface.  If you tie such materials with ordinary knots, then the cord often slips.  As a rule, this occurs at the very height of fishing and can lead to loss of catch.  It is in such cases that professional fishermen use the carrot node. </p><p>  This mount is strong and compact enough, the unit easily passes through the rings of feeder and carp rods.  Its durability is increased due to the thickened site of the node.  That is why it is so popular among fishermen.  However, it is necessary to understand in detail what constitutes and how to knit a carrot knot. </p>

    <h2>  Site Benefits </h2><p>  No wonder this type of connection is so in demand among fishermen.  There are a number of advantages that distinguish carrots from other nodes: </p><ul><li>  Simplicity.  This mount does not require special skills.  Even a novice fisherman can easily figure out how to knit a carrot knot (a photo and step-by-step instructions will be enough). </li><li>  The knot freely passes through the fishing rod rings. </li><li>  This type of connection does not break, with no slipping. </li><li>  Reliability.  Numerous reviews and demand among fishermen are the main evidence of the high strength of the site. </li></ul><p>  However, it is necessary to take into account the fact that all of the above advantages are manifested only if you know how to knit a carrot knot correctly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  In addition to numerous advantages, carrots have certain disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  According to the rules, this type of fastening requires dressing through several fishing trips, otherwise the assembly may wear out. </li><li>  "Carrot" requires careful and long knitting, otherwise it will quickly spread. </li><li>  In the correct sequence, the turns fit quite problematically, and this in turn also affects the strength of the node. </li></ul><h2>  How to knit a carrot knot: scheme </h2><p>  Tie this secure mount is quite simple.  There are several ways to accomplish it, however, in practice, only one is most often used.  So, we knit the carrot knot slowly, without rushing and adhering to the basic rules and sequence of actions: </p><ol><li>  First of all, a loop of about 5-7 cm in size is made of wicker, while it does not need to be tightened. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knot carrot how to knit pattern" class="if" height="358" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44175/1895377.jpg" width="500"></div></li><li>  The main fishing line is threaded into the resulting loop and pulled out by 15-20 cm for further manipulations. </li><li>  Further, in accordance with the illustration, the monolesk perform 8-10 revolutions around the loop.  In this case, the loops should lie flat and go one after another. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knot carrot how to knit photo" class="if" height="358" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44175/1895376.jpg" width="500"></div></li><li>  Finishing the last turn, the fishing line is turned over and they begin to perform revolutions in the opposite direction.  Having completed 10 revolutions, the fishing line is pulled into the main loop from the braid (in the end, it must be tightened). <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="we knit a carrot knot" class="if" height="358" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44175/1895375.jpg" width="500"></div></li></ol><p>  As a result, with proper execution, a reliable assembly should be obtained that increases the strength of the fishing line by more than 70%.  At the same time, the basic rule should be remembered: before performing the assembly, all used materials must be moistened. It depends on how much the carrot assembly will be durable and practical.  Moreover, such a fastener may burn out due to improper execution. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Knot tightening </h2><p>  In order for the resulting knot to last as long as possible, it is important not only to know how to knit the ‚Äúcarrot‚Äù knot correctly, it must also be correctly tightened.  Adhering to some rules, it will not be difficult to do this. </p><ol><li>  It is necessary to understand that the knot begins to tighten only when all the turns in both directions are completed. </li><li>  Take both ends and pull them evenly. </li><li>  Compounds tighten with all accuracy, moving the coils with the index and thumb.  In this case, the unit definitely needs to be lubricated with water. </li><li>  After completion of the work, two free ends remain.  The tip of the fishing line must be cut off at the base, and the end of the braid should look no more than 3 mm due to the tendency to fluff. </li><li>  If desired, for greater strength, the knot can be greased with glue - so it will become smoother.  In this case, the second end should be cut off at the very base, but it must be done carefully so as not to damage the villi of the knot. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Important Nuances </h2><p>  In order to ensure maximum strength for this mount, it is necessary to adhere to certain rules - they affect the strength and strength of the assembly: </p><ul><li>  To prevent the knot from deforming, it is imperative to wrap the main line with a pigtail around the shock leader. </li><li>  To avoid burnout from severe friction, the line and cord are moistened with water. </li><li>  It is necessary to ensure that the first loop is not delayed until 10 revolutions are made in the opposite direction and a monofilament is not threaded into it. </li><li>  In order for the knot to tighten well, and the coils fit snugly on the loop, it is necessary to ensure that the coils tighten.  To do this, you need to make certain movements with your hands. </li></ul><p>  If you understand how to knit a carrot knot, you can make a strong mount that will pass through the fishing rings.  It is it that is so popular among fishermen due to its simplicity and good stability. </p>
