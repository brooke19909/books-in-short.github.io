That is why many people prefer a trip abroad.  The recreation center “Laguna Yug” is radically different from the rest.  Here a bet has been made on the most comfortable rest of the guests, the menu and the entertainment program are well thought out.  The only negative is the price, rest is not at all cheap. </p>

    <h2>  What is a recreation center? </h2><p>  This is a fairly large and very cozy village.  “Laguna South” covers an area of ​​about six hectares.  A truly Russian landscape adds special charm: on the one hand, a mixed forest surrounds the base, where it is pleasant to stroll on a sunny day, and on the other, a huge water area, the mouth of the South River. </p><p>  The territory is well equipped, every corner is thought out and landscaped.  There are special paths for walking, rollerblading, bicycles.  In addition, there are many specialized platforms for active games, sports and other entertainment.  In winter and summer you will truly enjoy your stay at the Laguna South base. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Holiday Accommodation </h2><p>  Despite the large territory, the management of the base "Laguna South" is not chasing the number of tourists.  The maximum number of guests is 120 people.  All people are different, and therefore vacationers are provided with several cottages to choose from.  For those who come with their family, there are three cottages with double rooms.  They are called the elements: "Water", "Earth", "Air".  All rooms are made of wood, so they provide comfort and warmth at any time of the year.  The delicate woody aroma blends wonderfully with the natural environment.  Each of the cottages has its own unique design: so, for newlyweds and couples in love, they often offer "Air".  Round four-poster beds and pastel-colored décor create a special, romantic atmosphere. </p>

    <p>  The service in the dining room is excellent, the staff is friendly and welcoming, always ready to help with a choice, answer questions, replace a dish if something is not pleasant.  Since Laguna Yug (Nizhny Novgorod Region) is located close to the city, you can go for dinner outside the base for a change, but since excellent food is already included in the price, this is not very necessary. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  The bath complex is presented here in all kinds of variations.  <span>A Japanese bath</span> made in folk traditions helps to carry out a whole ritual of relaxation and rest.  There is also a steam room with fragrant brooms, and a phytobarrel with medicinal herbs.  Local experts will tell you the traditional subtleties: ofuro - these are oak boxes with heated sawdust and sea stones, furaco - oak barrels on an open veranda with hot and icy water. </p><p>  The Laguna Yug base (Nizhny Novgorod region) is located almost in the center of Russia, so a vacation without a Russian steam bath with an ice bath, a relaxation room and a massage room would be unthinkable! </p><h2>  Communication with animals </h2><p>  You will be pleased with your own stable “Laguna Yug” - a recreation center, where handsome horses live, with shiny hair and a luxurious mane.  They are looked after by professional instructors who know everything about horses and are completely in love with their job.  They will tell you about the character traits of pets, different breeds, teach you the basics of equestrian sports and give you the opportunity to organize your own horseback riding. </p><p>  The Laguna Yug recreation complex contains a small living area where your children get to know rabbits and help feed a goat, burro, ferrets, raccoon, ground squirrels, badger, fox and other interesting animals.  On the river live domestic geese, who will gladly accept a gift in the form of bread crumbs. </p>

    <h2>  Summer rest </h2><p>  The ideal way to get rid of the worldly bustle is to take a walk in the forest, pick mushrooms and berries, breathe fresh air and listen to birds.  The local forest is light and clean, consists of conifers and birches.  In addition, the “Laguna South” on the Gorky Sea will give you unforgettable water adventures, starting from swimming and visiting the water park, and ending with a walk along the reservoir on a yacht. </p><p>  On the surface of the water you will find many more entertainments.  Skiing, bananas and scooters will make your holiday bright and unforgettable.  There is a hanging town all year round, which attracts children and adults.  It is a climbing wall and a whole maze of suspension bridges.  A safety net is pulled down from below for safety, which gently catches the one that has broken off. </p><p>  The territory is stylized as a Russian village with mills, bridges, small backwaters and lush flower beds, so evening walks will bring a lot of pleasure. </p><h2>  Winter holidays </h2><p>  In winter, an ice circuit runs on <span>the South River</span> .  Want to take extreme driving courses?  There is a great opportunity to try!  Instructors will show you the basics of ice fishing, ride a snowmobile and a winter banana.  Snow slopes are ideal for skiing, and the flooded skating rink opens the door to those who wish to go ice skating.  On cold days, a hot bath and a pool are very relevant. </p>
