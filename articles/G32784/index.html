  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Grand Palace, Paris: creation history, architecture and reviews of tourists with photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Paris is the most romantic city in Europe, the architectural appearance of which was formed several centuries ago, is the largest metropolis in the world.  This is a real treasury that stores priceless monuments of history and culture, immerses in a special atmosphere. </p><p>  To visit the capital of France and not get to know one of its main attractions is a real crime.  The Grand Palace in Paris has long turned into a favorite place for leisure activities for both locals and tourists. </p><h2>  Original architectural project </h2><p>  The majestic structure is located on the banks of the River Seine, next to the Champs Elysees.  The construction of the Grand Palace in Paris (Grand Palais) was timed to coincide with the World Exhibition of 1900, dedicated to the meeting full of new discoveries of the XX century. </p><p>  When the authorities announced a competition for the best architectural project, many applications were received.  It was not possible to come to a consensus, and four architects began to engage in construction at once.  The future building was divided into zones, and each of the architects was responsible for a specific area of ‚Äã‚Äãwork.  Thanks to this decision, the project was struck by its originality and novelty. </p><div class="photo" data-original="miraculousladybug.fandom.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Architectural project" class="if uuid-3142880" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3142880.jpg"></div><p>  Albert Louve, Charles Giraud, Henri Deglan and Albert Thoma zealously took up the matter in 1897.  According to their idea, the future exhibition center was to become the most recognizable building in Paris.  And so it happened.  Indeed, the architecture of the Grand Palace in Paris, the history of which is considered in the article, is very unusual. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  A real work of architectural art </h2><p>  The combination of several architectural trends later received the name Beauz-ar from the French word beaux-arts, which translates as fine arts.  According to the project, the 240-meter facade is made in a simple classical style, and the building structure is in the Art Nouveau style.  And such a sharp contrast, distinguishing the complex from thousands of others, immediately attracts attention. </p><p>  Construction work progressed very slowly: the soil could not withstand the weight of the structure, so I had to drive in about three thousand oak piles.  Both special equipment and working hands were required.  However, the end result exceeded all expectations.  The architectural pearl with a steel frame, a glass roof, a large number of sculptures and bas-reliefs on the facade impressed even many lovers of the beautiful who had seen it. </p><p>  On the pediment of the Grand Palace in <span>Paris, the description of</span> which allows us to judge it as the largest exhibition center in the world, an inscription appeared indicating that the gigantic complex is dedicated to the art of different eras and peoples. </p><p>  Copper quadriga (antique two-wheeled horse-drawn carriage) was created by the famous sculptor Georges Recipon.  They adorn the northeast and southeast entrances of the palace.  From the side of the Seine stands a sculptural composition entitled "Harmony triumphing over contention", and from the side of the Champs Elysees - "Immortality Ahead of Time". </p><h2>  The largest exhibition center in the world </h2><p>  On May 1, 1900, the magnificent building opened its doors, and the exposition of the World Exhibition, which was visited by several million people, was located inside it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After the end of its work, the building was used for art exhibitions and important city events.  Despite the fact that skeptics prophesied a short fate for the architectural ensemble, he soon gained fame as one of the most significant cultural centers of the city. </p><p>  During the First World War, a military hospital was located within the walls of the gigantic complex.  In 1944, during the liberation of Paris from the Nazis, the nave of the building was seriously damaged by a strong fire.  The flame almost destroyed the glass roof, and only after laborious restoration work was it possible to restore its original appearance. </p><p>  The Paris Grand Palace to this day is considered the largest exhibition center in the world, despite the fact that more than a hundred years have passed since its construction.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãall its halls is 72 thousand m <sup>2</sup> . </p><h2>  The glass dome, which is the main highlight of the complex </h2><p>  The Grand Palace on the Champs Elysees in Paris is eclectic in style, and the architects assigned great importance to light-transmitting material.  One of the most famous sights of the French capital is the most recognizable thanks to its glass roof, reminiscent of the shape of a huge dome. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.studiodap.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The glass dome of the palace" class="if uuid-3142848" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3142848.jpg"></div><p>  The magnificent structure is a combination of a classic stone facade, iron and glass.  The main nave, which is 240 meters long, is crowned with a high glass roof resting on a strong steel frame.  The construction of the structure took about six thousand tons of metal, and the design of the canopy weighs more than eight thousand tons. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In 1993, one of the ceiling cells collapsed, after which reconstruction began in the building, which lasted 10 years.  The metal frame and glass roof were repaired.  In addition, vivid mosaics, sculptures, bas-reliefs underwent restoration. </p><h2>  Landmark Landmark </h2><p>  To this day, the Grand Palais in Paris is the largest building in the world made of iron and glass.  The largest exhibition center in Paris, which has been given the status of a historical monument, is visited annually by about two million people. </p><p>  Two museums are located in one of the most famous cultural monuments in France, each of which has a separate entrance.  Their expositions tell about a colorful country in all colors.  The Museum of Inventions and Innovative Findings is located on the one hand, and the Art Gallery on the other. </p><p>  For many years, the Grand Palace in Paris has been a public exhibition center, whose main gallery is dedicated to contemporary art.  Many interesting exhibitions are held here telling about the rich culture of France, live concerts, historical expositions and events of a high international level. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.grandpalais.fr" data-author=": Mirco Magliocca, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Equestrian competitions" class="if uuid-3142864" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3142864.jpg"></div><p>  Numerous presentations are related to history, art, science, fashion and even animals.  Here they launch balloons, airships, hold equestrian competitions, auto shows, book fairs and the annual Chanel fashion shows. </p><h2>  Petit Palais - Small Palace </h2><p>  Almost simultaneously, the Big and Small Palaces were erected in Paris.  The lesser known fellow of the main building has a very interesting story.  Initially, Petit Palais was planned as a temporary building for the exhibition.  However, the Parisians liked the building so much that they asked not to demolish it.  And now Petit Palais is a curious attraction of the capital of France.  The palaces are divided by Piazza Clemenceau, named after the French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau. </p><div class="photo" data-original="trademarkvacations.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Small Palace (Paris)" class="if uuid-3142895" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3142895.jpg"></div><p>  It is worth visiting another architectural landmark for the sake of a unique design.  After all, the facade of the Small Palace looks very original.  In its architecture, you can see Greek and Roman features with many decorative elements. </p><h2>  Mini Louvre </h2><p>  There are no permanent exhibitions at Petit Palais, but there is something to see.  And it is no coincidence that visitors call this palace a mini-Louvre.  After all, it houses a rich collection of works of art from ancient times to the 20th century.  About 12 thousand paintings and sculptures, rare icons and ancient books are exhibited in the halls of the Small Palace. </p><p>  Before visiting a magnificent building, it is worth checking the opening hours on its official website, since the palace is often closed.  Access to the collections is free, and to visit temporary exhibitions you will have to buy a ticket. </p><h2>  Indoor ice arena </h2><p>  At the end of December, the largest indoor ice rink in the world with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 3 thousand m <sup>2</sup> begins its work.  Pipes were laid under the ice, through which a special substance circulates, freezing water on the surface. </p><p>  Everyone can skate under the glass dome, and from 9 pm the ice rink in the Grand Palace in Paris turns into a dance floor.  Unique ice and acrobatic shows await visitors to the ice arena daily. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vogue.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Indoor ice rink in the palace" class="if uuid-3142839" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3142839.jpg"></div><p>  Entrance fee is 12 euros for adults, 6 euros - for children. </p><h2>  Reconstruction of an architectural masterpiece </h2><p>  The French Ministry of Culture announced a massive reconstruction of the Grand Palace in Paris at the end of 2020.  Changes will affect all parts of the complex.  In addition, a new pedestrian street, Rue des Palais, will appear, which will combine the museum and the gallery of the architectural monument, where the main exhibitions are held.  And also on the roof of the building will be built a spacious terrace with panoramic views.  It is estimated that the capacity of the palace will increase to 22 thousand people. </p><p>  For the reconstruction, which will last four years, 466 million euros are allocated.  Its exclusive sponsor will be the fashion house Chanel.  Indeed, it is within the walls of the Grand Palais that theatrical performances of Karl Lagerfeld, the creative director of a well-known company, take place.  And the main entrance to the palace will be named in honor of the founder of the legendary brand Coco Chanel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.relais-saint-charles.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fashion shows" class="if uuid-3142881" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3142881.jpg"></div><p>  Specialists from the architectural bureau LAN Architecture formulated their task: </p><blockquote><p>  Our role is to preserve the story that has already been written, adding careful touches to bring to the sound of this architectural symphony - strength and modern notes. </p></blockquote><h2>  Opening hours and ticket prices </h2><p>  All exhibitions accept visitors daily except Tuesday.  They are open from 10:00 to 20:00, on Wednesday - until 22:00.  However, during new exhibitions, the schedules often change, and then you should clarify the opening hours in advance by visiting the official website.  It contains information about which presentations will be held in the near future. </p><p>  Depending on the exhibition, the price of tickets varies.  The standard price is 11 euros (for reference: 1 euro ‚âà 75 rubles).  Children under 16 years old, as well as people with disabilities and the people accompanying them, admission is free.  Discounts are also valid for groups of 4 people, of which two are young people under 25 years old. </p><h2>  What do tourists say? </h2><p>  Visitors who have visited the Grand Palace in Paris, the photo of which is presented in our article, admit that its size is respected.  The architectural gem is so huge that you can even get lost in it.  And many, keen on numerous exhibitions, do not even notice how it begins to get dark.  Therefore, it is best to devote several days to acquaintance with a cultural monument, since one will not be enough. </p><p>  Tourists say that it is worth visiting the indoor ice rink - a truly magical place where you can rent skates.  The ice rink is beautifully designed and you can admire the magnificent glass dome from a new angle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="unisci24.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Presentations taking place in the building" class="if uuid-3142859" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3142859.jpg"></div><p>  A real work of art has not lost its former glory.  On the contrary, its popularity is growing every year, and each creator wants to open an exhibition of his own works in the Grand Palais, which means that the artist or sculptor has reached the highest level of his skill. </p>
