Believers go to the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe village of Okovtsy to plunge into the waters of the miraculous key and receive healing from diseases and enlightenment from delusions.  In the middle of the 16th century, the Holy Okovetsky spring was discovered in the dense spring forest, the healing power of which has only grown stronger over the centuries.  The faces of the Blessed Virgin Mary with a baby, suddenly opened in the forest, pointed to a wonderful place, and subsequently the temple was erected there. </p>

    <h2>  Deep horizon spring </h2><p>  The water of a miraculous spring beats from the depths of the earth with a fountain.  Since the key originates in the deep underground spring, the water in it is crystal clear and very cold.  Laboratory studies have proved that the St. Okovets spring is one of the most healing of all existing.  With the blessing of the Holy Fathers a few years ago, healthy life-giving moisture became available to a wide range of consumers, thanks to the streamlined production of bottled water ‚ÄúOkovetsky source‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="okovetsky sources" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31713/731729.jpg" width="333"></div>

For several centuries, the fame of miraculous healings from various ailments and ailments was spread not only in the Tver province, but throughout the Russian land.  In the twentieth century, the flow of people who wanted to take holy baths somewhat decreased, but from the beginning of the 21st century, the restoration of temples, the construction of baths from wood, the foundation of the courtyard began.  At the same time, a day was celebrated to celebrate the acquisition of wonderful icons in the Okovets Forest. </p><p>  Since then, every year on July 24, the Holy Okovetsky spring becomes especially crowded: clergy conduct a special service, after which all those present (both adults and children) are immersed in clean healing waters. </p><p>  You need to dive at least three times, always with your head.

The path to the holy spring goes along a beautiful and mysterious coniferous forest, along the path there are lanterns that illuminate the path to the baths, while the road is made in the form of a wooden flooring bridge.  This contributes to the maximum convenience and comfort of travel to the place of pilgrimage, as well as the preservation of ancient nature. </p><p>  Bathhouses themselves are located on the banks of the river, there is also a chapel.  The beautiful chamber church amazes with the magnificence of the murals, the clergy are ready for a conversation, answers to questions, and help in spiritual instructions.  On the other side of the river, a <span>pine forest</span> is clearly visible <span>.</span>  Thanks to this surrounding landscape, everyone plunging into an ice font feels a sense of unity with nature, with its healing powers and unsolved mysteries. </p>
