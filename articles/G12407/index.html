  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tapestry seam - secrets of thread painting</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Refined art that does not leave people's minds is not the first millennium, tapestry <strong> </strong>  embroidery transforms homes and offices, organically blending into any interior style.  Those who at least once saw the final picture embroidered in this technique will never forget the feeling of painting with threads on fabric. </p><p>  <strong>Tapestry and half cross</strong> . </p><p>  In the lover's opinion, tapestry embroidery is nothing complicated, different from embroidering with a cross with just one stitch in a certain direction.  But this is not so.  The semi-cross technique involves the following pattern: the canvas or embroidery fabric cell intersects from the front side diagonally from left to right, and from the inside from the upper right to the lower right. </p><p>  Unlike half-cross, tapestry stitch provides for the use of two cells at once for one stitch.  In order to embroider one stitch using the tapestry technique, it is necessary to bring the needle to the front side from the upper right corner and introduce it to the wrong side in the lower left corner.  The next stitch is executed with a broach from the wrong side of the thread to the upper right corner of the next square.  This is a modern version of the design, called in the manuals for embroidery “ <em>canvas suture</em> ”, or <em>oblique tapestry seam</em> . </p><p>  <strong>Types of tapestry stitch</strong> . </p><p>  If the embroiderer only gets acquainted with the art of tapestry, then she should pay her attention to ready-made sets for embroidery.  In them, an instruction is attached to the pattern, canvas and threads, which describes in detail the tapestry seam used.  The technique of its execution can be different: both the “canvas seam” type described above and others presented in the needlework textbooks are used. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The proposed manuals on the basics of tapestry embroidery describe an additional 3 types of stitches: straight tapestry, elongated and Romanian. </p><p>  <em>Straight tapestry</em> <em><strong> </strong></em>  <em>seam</em> . <strong> </strong>  Equipment <strong> </strong>  its execution is simple: the needle is removed from the upper part of the cell to the front side and inserted into the wrong side in the lower part of the cell.  Not one stitch fills one square of the canvas, but two at once.  In this case, the first stitch exceeds the second one by exactly half, and the second “captures” half the height of the lower cage.  Such a seam creates a sense of three-dimensionality of the picture. </p><p>  <em>Extra long tapestry seam</em> .  Unlike the “straight” one, when embroidering the “elongated” stitch, it takes up not one, but two cells at once.  When using such a <span>seam, the tapestry</span> fills a large area of ​​the fabric.  In addition, in some paintings, it is recommended to combine straight and elongated tapestry seams to create the effect of painting with paints. </p><p>  <em>Romanian tapestry seam</em> : it is distinguished by “canvas” in that, before laying a series of stitches, a horizontal line is drawn through a certain number of cells with a thread, which will sew a fragment.  Further, “canvas” stitches are superimposed on this thread. </p><p>  <strong>Tapestry seam - creating beautiful.</strong> </p><p>  The standard use of tapestry seam, as a rule, is associated with the embroidery of paintings and icons.  This direction is especially popular among needle and thread masters.  Using a tapestry seam, copies of paintings by famous artists are created (Romanian and Bulgarian tapestries are very popular among embroiderers) and their own creations. </p><p>  But the tapestry seam can be used for other purposes.  When creating new types of arts and crafts, the technique of creating a tapestry, for example, in carpet embroidery, is widely introduced.  True, it is worth mentioning that in this type of needlework, the tapestry stitch is used only as an auxiliary element. </p><p>  Tapestry techniques are also widely used in European forms of applied art, for example: in Richelieu, Florentine embroidery and the “bargello”, which combines the Florentine and Hungarian schools.  These species use tapestry seam due to its increased wear resistance.  This is due to the fact that the last three types of needlework are perfect for creating interior items - decorative pillows, stuffing on chairs, wraps on chairs and sofas. </p>
