  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Age periodization according to D. B. Elkonin</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For modern psychology, it is no longer a secret that a person in the process of his development and formation goes through a series of stages that differ from each other in levels: </p><ul><li>  physical; </li><li>  mental; </li><li>  spiritual; </li><li>  and intellectual development. </li></ul><p>  In other words, the process of growth and development is accompanied by certain changes in the functioning of the body, which makes it possible to distinguish one stage from another.  And these changes have a strong connection with age.  This concept is called <em>age-related periodization.</em> </p><p>  In their works, many scientists and figures from psychology considered the stages of age-related periodization: Z. Freud, L. S. Vygotsky, D. B. Elkonin.  In this article, it will be examined in more detail precisely the age periodization of D. B. Elkonin - as the most popular in the framework of modern Russian psychology. </p><p>  The theory of the domestic scientist was based on the fact that a certain stage of development (this means age, mental and physical level of development) corresponds to a certain type of <em>leading activity (VD).</em> <em> </em>  Where the <span>leading activity</span> is understood as the type of activity within which the acquisition of mental tumors takes place. </p><p>  The periodization of age development, proposed by D. B. Elkonin, as a representative of the cultural and historical concept of L. S. Vygotsky, has a number of features and key concepts.  <span>The development of personality,</span> its formation are continuous and due to social interaction.  Only through <span>social interaction</span> and practical activities does the child develop mentally.  Socially conditioned communication between an adult and a child (even when it comes to teaching the baby to interact with objects, such as in the second stage, called "early childhood") allows the latter to indirectly assimilate social boundaries, morality, roles, stereotypes of actions, etc. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, age periodization in the framework of the theory of D. B. Elkonin is divided into 6 stages: </p><ol><li>  Infant  Up to 1 year.  The leading activity (hereinafter - VD) of children of this age is communication with adults.  The child learns to interact with others, primarily with his mother using gestures, facial expressions and sounds.  Close emotional communication allows the child‚Äôs personal sphere to develop: through the mother, he learns himself and the world around him, learns to react and communicate. </li><li>  Early childhood.  Up to 3 years.  In the life of a child objects appear.  You can touch, bite, break, etc.  Thus, the child understands that he can influence the world around him, influence, in particular, those objects that are available for impact.  During this period, visual-effective thinking develops due to manipulations with objects. </li><li>  <span>Preschool age.</span>  Up to 7 years.  VD of this period is a role-playing game in which children learn to interact with each other, learn to obey and adhere to the rules.  During this period, there is also a need for socially significant activities, a desire to be useful, to collaborate. </li><li>  <span>Junior school age.</span>  Up to 11 years.  VD-teaching, a child-student learns to control his behavior in accordance with the requirements and accepted rules.  He develops randomness (sitting at a desk for 30 minutes, listening to the teacher and not being distracted), self-control (to postpone the game and do homework) and an internal plan of action (to build the order for homework). </li><li>  <span>Teenage years.</span>  Up to 15 years.  VD-communication with peers.  The desire to find yourself, your place in the team.  Self-esteem appears - the way a teenager sees himself against the background of his friends, class, company, compares himself with others.  The basic need is to be part of the group, to receive its support, to feel unity. </li><li>  <span>Youthful age.</span>  Under 17 years old.  During this period, the attention of boys and girls is aimed at comprehending further activities, the choice of their path in life is being updated.  The possible options for the development of events after school are conceptualized.  Guys often ask themselves: ‚ÄúWhat do I want to become? What do I want to do? What profession is suitable for me?‚Äù  VD - educational and professional.  Responsibility for the future appears. </li></ol><p>  The age periodization developed by D. B. Elkonin makes it possible to better understand the motives of a child of each age, helping parents and educators provide him with everything necessary for full development. </p>
