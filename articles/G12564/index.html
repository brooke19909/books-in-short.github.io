Unfortunately, sometimes money starts disappearing from people's SIM cards.  It is unclear what they are being written off for.  And in this case, it is better not to hesitate to clarify the situation.  Next, we will talk about how to find out why the money was withdrawn at Megafon.  This information is actually not so difficult to obtain.  The main thing is to know how to act in a particular case. </p><h2>  Reason for writing off </h2><p>  How to find out why they are withdrawing money from Megafon?  First you‚Äôll have to understand why this happens at all.  The reasons for this situation are different.  The main thing is not to get lost and act decisively. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.iphones.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to find out why money was written off at Megafon" class="if uuid-3241212" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3241212.jpg"></div><p>  They can withdraw money from SIM cards: </p><ul><li>  when a smartphone or computer is infected with viruses; </li><li>  for calling people; </li><li>  when using tariff plans with a monthly fee; </li><li>  when sending messages (including multimedia); </li><li>  in connection with the connection and use of paid subscriptions; </li><li>  for changing the tariff plan or connecting new options; </li><li>  for using mobile Internet; </li><li>  due to the formation of some mobile queries. </li></ul><p>  Just because the money from the balance of the SIM-card is not debited from anyone.  Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the situation as soon as possible. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  USSD request </h2><p>  How to find out why the money was withdrawn at Megafon?  Usually, invoice detailing is used for this.  You can do it in different ways. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gsmwiki.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bill details" class="if uuid-3241208" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3241208.jpg"></div><p>  The first solution to this problem is the formation of a USSD request.  It is being sent from a mobile device.  This will require: </p><ol><li>  Put your smartphone or tablet in the "Dial" mode. </li><li>  Dial the command * 512 #. </li><li>  Press the button responsible for the start of the call. </li></ol><p>  After the actions taken, the person will receive a message in which the last expenses on the account will be written.  It also prescribes the time and date of incurring certain expenses.  Very comfortably! </p><h2>  Help application </h2><p>  How to find out why money was withdrawn at Megafon in a particular case?  Each client of the company should know where to start checking the invoice and ordering details on it.  Not everyone likes a USSD request. </p><p>  In this case, you can use the special proprietary application "Megaphone" for mobile devices.  It is a convenient analogue of the organization‚Äôs website. </p><div class="photo" data-original="telecomspec.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Megafon application for bill details" class="if uuid-3241210" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3241210.jpg"></div><p>  To request bill details, you will need: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Initialize the application from Megafon to a mobile device.  Usually this happens automatically when you first insert the SIM into the phone. </li><li>  Enter the application using your username and password.  Data from the ‚ÄúMy Account‚Äù on the MTS website are implied.  It is better to register in advance. </li><li>  Open the "Account Management" section. </li><li>  Select the option "Detail".  It can be signed as a "Report" or "View recent activity." </li><li>  Examine the list of recent paid actions.  On it you will be able to understand what is the matter. </li></ol><p>  That's all.  Usually the whole process takes a few minutes.  Quick, easy, and most importantly - very convenient.  You can resort to this technique at any time! </p><h2>  Through the site </h2><p>  Does Megafon withdraw money just like that?  This cannot be - everything has a reason.  Maybe a person simply switched to a tariff with a monthly fee or connected himself to some paid service.  You just need to understand the situation. </p><p>  The official website of the company is able to help with this.  Here with the help of "My Account" you can quickly see where the client‚Äôs money went. </p><p>  Instructions for the implementation of the task are as follows: </p><ol><li>  Open the Megafon website through any browser. </li><li>  In the authorization block indicate the phone number (login) and password.  It is better to get an account for the client in advance.  Without it, achieving the necessary goal will be problematic. </li><li>  Go to the account management section. </li><li>  Click on the "Detail" or "Order Report" command. </li><li>  Look at the information displayed or confirm the formation of a report on paid actions. </li></ol><p>  This technique almost completely coincides with the previous one.  As already mentioned, the Megafon mobile application works exactly the same as the Personal Account on the company's website. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pikabu.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="&quot;My Account&quot; on the site of &quot;Megaphone&quot;" class="if uuid-3241214" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3241214.jpg"></div><h2>  In support of </h2><p>  Mobile portal "Megaphone" withdraws money?  It‚Äôs not clear what‚Äôs the matter?  It is necessary not to refuse the services of this operator, but to find out what the problem of lost money is.  And this can be done, as has already been said, in different ways. </p><p>  Another solution is to contact the technical support of the mobile operator.  In the people it is called a "call to the call center" or "call to the operator."  They don‚Äôt take money for such a call. </p><p>  I wonder how to find out why the money was withdrawn at Megafon.  Then it is recommended to do the following: </p><ol><li>  Put a mobile device with a SIM card in dialing mode. </li><li>  Call 0500. </li><li>  Wait for operator response. </li><li>  Report your problem.  It is advisable to describe in detail the circumstances under which the loss of money was discovered. </li><li>  Call a phone that requires verification, and then ask for details. </li></ol><p>  A call center employee can either say the requested information out loud or send a report in the form of a message.  In the first case, you can immediately abandon unnecessary services and subscriptions.  But the money will not be returned in any way. </p><div class="photo" data-original="prooperatorov.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Call Center" class="if uuid-3241213" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3241213.jpg"></div><h2>  Services connected to the number </h2><p>  Did the megaphone withdraw money for the Internet or any other service?  How to understand what exactly?  And abandon paid options? </p><p>  All this is very successfully done on the Megafon website or through their special application.  But you can do otherwise.  Each operator‚Äôs client is able to request a list of paid services connected to the number.  A special request is used for this. </p><p>  A citizen will simply need to dial * 105 # on the ‚Äúproblem‚Äù phone, and then ‚Äúring‚Äù it.  After some time, it will be possible to study the list of all active paid services.  If necessary, you can immediately abandon them. </p><h2>  To the office </h2><p>  How to find out why the money was withdrawn at Megafon?  Best of all, if the self-service tools did not help, do not hesitate and contact the office of the telecom operator.  They will definitely help clarify the situation. </p><p>  To get information about what the money was withdrawn for, it is recommended to do the following: </p><ol><li>  Take a phone with a SIM card that is having problems. </li><li>  Prepare a passport or other identification card. </li><li>  Go to any Megafon office.  The registration of the client does not affect the place of contact. </li><li>  Tell about the problem by handing over the phone with SIM-card to the staff of Megafon. </li><li>  Wait a while. </li></ol><p>  After a couple of minutes, the company‚Äôs employees will tell you where the money from Simka went.  More precisely, what a person paid for.  Suspicious transactions can also be found out in this way. </p><p>  If the problem lies in the paid services of Megafon, you can refuse them immediately at the organization‚Äôs office.  Very comfortably! </p><div class="photo" data-original="liganews.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Visit to the office of &quot;Megaphone&quot;" class="if uuid-3241211" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3241211.jpg"></div><p>  Problems in the process of contacting the Megafon office may occur if the owner of the number has changed personal data or the owner of the SIM card is not the one who uses it.  In the first case, it is enough to prove the fact of data correction.  In the second, either provide written consent of the SIM owner to a third party to the Megafon office, or ask the owner of the number to independently clarify the situation. </p><h2>  If the problem is viruses </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear why money is being withdrawn from the phone.  Megafon is a company that will not deceive its customers.  But what if the problem is viruses? </p><p>  You can detect them using mobile anti-virus programs or by eliminating the previously mentioned reasons for debiting money from SIM cards.  To treat a smartphone or tablet, they usually use either antiviruses or contact service centers. </p><p>  Important: if the debit began after installing the suspicious program, you will have to uninstall it immediately. </p>
