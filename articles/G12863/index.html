Like to do complex hairstyles?  Then you hardly like what they sell in stores.  The same type of hairpins and elastic bands look too simple.  But this is easy to fix.  Make hair clips with your own hands.  Look for tips and ideas for decor below. </p><h2>  Kanzashi </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY hair clips" class="if uuid-2423818" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2423818.jpg"></div><p>  <span>DIY hair pins</span> can be made from ribbons or from any unnecessary cut of fabric.  You can choose the shade you need to make a decorative element that fits perfectly into the image.  Make a light and effective hair clip with your own hands.  Kanzashi are flowers made of fabric that can decorate any metal or wooden frame.  All you need to make the jewelry is ribbons or a fabric of the right color, a soldering iron and glue.  Let's start making flowers.  Take the material in white or any other color and cut it into small rectangles 3 x 4 cm. Collect the petals.  We sew the bottom edge with thread, collecting it in an accordion.  We fix the petal in this position with the help of a lighter.  Now you need to make the leaves.  Cut a square from the green ribbon and fold it diagonally, and then horizontally.  In this position, we fix the tips with a lighter.  We take all the blanks and begin to collect flowers from them, and then the overall composition.  You can glue the petals to each other on the "Moment", or you can on a hot gun.  When the flowers are collected, they will need to decorate the frame fastener. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Bows </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself hair clips from ribbons" class="if uuid-2423820" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2423820.jpg"></div><p>  Even a child can make such a hair clip with his own hands.  To make it, you will need a tape or any piece of fabric that holds its shape well.  Take two strips with a length of 14 cm and 18 cm. Ring the workpieces.  This can be done using a lighter or a sewing machine.  When the blanks are made, you can begin to manufacture a decorative middle.  Take a small plastic or metal ring and large beads.  Instead of beads you can use beads, rhinestones, ribbons, shells or something like that.  Glue a small ring around the entire perimeter, leaving only the fastener space empty.  Attach the decor.  When this part of the work has come to an end, glue should cover the inside of the ring.  Glue a smaller ring from the tape to its front wall, and a larger one to the inside.  Naturally, you need to fix the tape in the middle.  It remains to glue the fastener directly, and the hair clip made of ribbons, made with your own hands, will be ready. </p><h2>  Feathers </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY hair clips and hair bands" class="if uuid-2423824" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2423824.jpg"></div><p>  These unusual hair clips and elastic bands for hair with your own hands can be made of various materials: fur, cotton wool or fabric.  Of course, to make the feathers look more natural and feel softer to the touch, you should use fur or cotton wool.  <span>How to make a hairpin-feather?</span>  Take a wide metal frame and stick cotton on it.  Glue the material in layers and do not crumple the cotton so that it does not roll.  When this is done, take a piece of gauze.  Paint the material in any pastel colors.  Now cover the finished cotton blank with gauze.  It remains to do a difficult but interesting job.  You need to create a feather relief.  Make separate villi and fluffs.  For greater effect, the lower part of the pen can not be tightened with gauze.  Create a streak in the middle of the bead feather and attach various decorative elements. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hedgehog </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hairpin hedgehog" class="if uuid-2423826" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2423826.jpg"></div><p>  Do you know how to embroider with beads?  Then to create such a hair clip with your own hands will be easy for you.  To get a beautiful picture, you need to draw a sketch before starting work.  You can portray an animal, bird or something vegetable.  Now draw the arrangement of the beads on the workpiece.  Immediately consider its length, width and volume.  You may need a bugle, chopping, or large beads for your work.  When the preparatory work is finished, you can begin to create a decor.  Cut the blank from felt, and then draw the main parts of your image with soap.  Armed with a needle and thread, you can start embroidering.  Beads should be placed close to each other so that the base itself is not striking.  If necessary, you can create some decorative details from any tools at hand.  For example, from a wire, a spring, a metal bead, etc. When the work on the front part is completed, it will be necessary to cut another base and cover it with the wrong side of the embroidered product. </p><h2>  Simple hairpin </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="simple hairpin" class="if uuid-2423827" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2423827.jpg"></div><p>  Want to make a DIY hair clip from a satin ribbon?  Then implement this idea.  Very simple in execution, but at the same time a very effective hairpin is obtained from satin ribbon and beads.  Tie a beautiful large bow on a ribbon.  Now make a brooch.  Cut a circle from felt.  Decorate it with large beads in the color of the ribbon or decorate the dense base with rhinestones.  Now you need to connect the two parts of the product.  Glue the blank to the hairpin and the decoration will be ready. </p><p>  Based on this idea, you can create various variations of the accessory.  For example, make the center part of the bow on a contrasting tape.  You can embroider the bow canvas with beads or decorate it with embroidery or perforation. </p><h2>  Barrette for children </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Barrette for children" class="if uuid-2423828" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2423828.jpg"></div><p>  A child who goes to kindergarten often manages to lose or forget things there.  Especially often, girls lose hairpins if they decide to dissolve their hair during a quiet hour.  Buying hair accessories is an overhead pleasure.  Therefore, you can make beautiful hair clips with your own hands.  As a basis, you can take the usual metal "crocodile".  Find the right fabric.  Dense satin ribbons, tulle, nets or guipure will do.  Cut a rectangle from the prepared fabric.  Using a needle, assemble the workpiece into an accordion and fasten it in the middle.  Hide the threads with something decorative.  For example, you can tighten a thin satin ribbon in the center or make a couple of turns of metal wire.  Now you need to decorate the resulting bow.  You can use various accessories for creativity: beads, rhinestones, sparkles, sequins.  It is advisable to sew accessories to the material, and not to glue.  But the bow itself will be attached to the crocodile base by a hot gun. </p><h2>  Butterflies </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hairpin butterfly" class="if uuid-2423829" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2423829.jpg"></div><p>  How to make a hair clip with your own hands?  Decorate the existing, but already peeling base.  To transform it beyond recognition, you will need acrylic paint and felt.  Degrease the base and then apply two coats of paint to it.  So that the hairpin is not monochrome, you can decorate it with contrasting dots.  While the workpiece will dry, you can make a decorative part.  Draw an arbitrary butterfly shape.  But do not try to portray something complicated.  Felt is coarse material, you won‚Äôt be able to cut out something especially bizarre from it.  It is possible to do with a primitive form.  Now cut out the pattern and transfer it to the fabric.  You can make all butterflies monochrome or create a gradient in a nuance.  In the second case, you will need to choose a material that differs by several tones.  Cut out the butterflies and sew them in the middle.  It remains to glue the decorative element to the hairpin. </p><h2>  Flowers </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hairpin with flowers" class="if uuid-2423831" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2423831.jpg"></div><p>  From foamiran you can make very beautiful hair clips with your own hands.  A photo of the product sample is attached above.  How to repeat this beauty?  You need to purchase sheets of material in four colors: pink, white and two shades of green.  Before you begin, you need to draw a pattern of flower petals and leaves.  Cut the patterns and translate them onto the material.  Now you need to cut the workpiece.  Stretch the leaves of the rose so that they become wavy, and then, alternately heating each detail on the iron, collect half-opened buds.  According to a similar scheme, you need to create white flowers.  When these blanks are created, you can start decorating the scallop.  Degrease the workpiece and then use the glue gun to attach the leaves to it.  We arrange the greens so that the two shades of green harmoniously complement each other, rather than creating separate islands.  When the leaves have taken their place, place the flowers.  They can be glued to greens, preheating on an iron. </p><h2>  Stylized flowers </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stylized flowers" class="if uuid-2423832" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2423832.jpg"></div><p>  A beautiful hair ornament can be made of wire and large beads.  If you have any natural stones in your arsenal, you can use them.  Before you begin, you need to consider the concept of creating jewelry.  Draw a sketch.  Place several flowers side by side, and fill the space between them with pebbles placed at different heights.  If you wish, you can form twigs out of them.  When the sketch is ready, you will need to make a foundation.  Bend a piece of wire in half and twist on top.  Repeat this procedure 5 times.  As a result, you will have 6 teeth hairpins.  They should be soldered to any metal plate.  It is advisable to use something decorative, for example, with engraving.  But if there is nothing suitable, you can just roll the wire with a spring.  We fasten the teeth with the frame.  Now proceed to the decorative part.  We create a drawing according to a previously drawn sketch.  You can string the beads on one long wire or create elements in parts.  We collect decorative details into a single whole and attach to the base.  If necessary, the wire can be soldered. </p>
