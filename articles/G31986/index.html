Well, how can one come to such an event without an original costume?  And although these days children are more and more passionate about supermen, betman, transformers and other new-fashioned cartoon characters, why not try to turn back the clock and dress the child in a wolf costume, mentally returning to the New Year's celebrations of the past decades, when they drove around the Christmas trees with Santa Claus Dances such clear bears, bunnies, foxes, cats and snowflakes?  And if it is also right to present this outfit to a baby, then he will be completely satisfied with his image.  Moreover, to make, say, a do-it-yourself wolf costume for a boy is quite real.  And if you involve a child in the creative process, then the work and result will be doubly interesting. </p>

    <h2>  What to make a wolf costume </h2><p>  Children's costume must be colorful and vibrant, but how to do it if the character we have chosen is of neutral color?  The answer to this question is quite simple: the main thing is to choose the right materials. <br>  To make a wolf costume with your own hands for a boy, stock up on the following things and tools: <br>  ‚Ä¢ fabric for the base of the outfit; <br>  ‚Ä¢ fur for the tail, legs and ears; <br>  ‚Ä¢ elastic; <br>  ‚Ä¢ threads in tone of fabric; <br>  ‚Ä¢ scissors for cutting; <br>  ‚Ä¢ tape measure; <br>  ‚Ä¢ pattern of shorts; <br>  ‚Ä¢ vest pattern; <br>  ‚Ä¢ synthetic winterizer, white, black and red felt for the face of the wolf. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Which fabric is better to choose </h2><p>  The easiest way to work with knitwear.  Of course, in order to lay <span>machine seams</span> on it <span>, you</span> need a special needle, but in terms of processing the edges of the product, such material practically does not cause problems.  Firstly, it does not crumble, which allows not to cut the slices, and secondly, a small error in the patterns is compensated by the ability of the material to stretch. </p>

    <p>  The winning option is velor or velvet, which shimmers beautifully due to its fine shiny pile.  It is this fabric that will look gorgeous in combination with fur.  By the way, the latter must be long-haired, because such a tail will be the most realistic.  In addition to the tail, fur will be needed to complete the wolf‚Äôs face and to design beautiful legs. </p><h2>  Costume Elements </h2><p>  What should be the New Year's costume of the wolf?  What elements should it consist of?  Mandatory accessories in such an outfit are the tail and the wolf face on the hat or mask, so that no one has any doubts about which character appeared to the eye.  A formidable muzzle with a grin and a fierce look perfectly emphasizes the importance of an important guest at the carnival, which will surely appeal to any boy. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition to the accessories mentioned, a New Year‚Äôs wolf costume usually consists of gray shorts or panties and a sleeveless jacket, under which a white shirt or golf will simply look great. </p><h2>  Where to get a pattern </h2><p>  How to make a wolf costume and where to get a pattern is the main question that arises only at the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsewing an outfit with your own hands.  It is clear that not everyone is skilled in cutting and sewing and not everyone is able to develop a drawing and a pattern for sewing clothes based on taken measurements.  But the lack of such skills cannot be an obstacle. </p>

    <p>  How to draw a pattern on your own, according to which you can sew a wolf costume?  Children's template panties and vests is simple enough to do.  It will take the child‚Äôs things, namely trousers or sportswear and a T-shirt.  These elements of the wardrobe will serve as the basis for the development of drawings. </p><h2>  How to make a trouser pattern </h2><p>  We take the pants, turn them inside out and put one leg in the other, after we put the thing in this form directly on the wrong side of the fabric for cutting and first circle the back step and middle seams, and then the side and front step seams, while gradually unwrapping the thing so that it lay on a plane without folds.  If this procedure seems unbearable, then you can take out of service pants and cut them along the front, back and step seams.  After that, lay out the pants panel stitched along the side line and circle on the fabric with a shallow or remnant. </p>

    <p>  Parts should be cut 1.5 cm from the contour so that after stitching they are not small.  You can‚Äôt save on allowances; a wolf costume for a boy will look attractive with wide pants, and it will be easy for a child in this outfit to move around. </p><h2>  How to make a vest pattern </h2><p>  To draw a <span>pattern of a vest,</span> use a child‚Äôs t-shirt.  It is laid out on the fabric and outlined along the shoulder and side seams, note the width of the sleeve at the base, along which the armhole is then drawn.  Also, directly on the flap of matter, the neckline and the front section are being finalized. </p><p>  After pants and a T-shirt are circled on the fabric and shaped lines are drawn, we can assume that the pattern of the wolf costume with your own hands is ready.  It remains only to collect all the elements, which we now do. </p><h2>  How to sew a wolf costume with your own hands </h2><p>  For a boy, in principle, it is not so important how long the panties will be.  Looks good and full pants, and shorts, and breeches.  Here the material is more important, which we, in fact, have already written about above.  Sometimes from knees to ankles, pants are completely made of fur fabric, which gives the image a special charm.  If this is not possible (fur is now a little expensive), shaggy wolf paws will help out. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wolf costume for boy" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/625268.jpg" width="399"></div>  Such details should be considered when cutting.  Once all the elements are ready, you can proceed with the assembly.  Panties are sewn in this order:

The clasp in such a product is optional, especially if the image is complemented by a white shirt, tie or bow-tie.  If your child is just a toddler, it is perfectly acceptable to mask the unprofessionally crafted edges with a silver rain. </p><h2>  Wolf muzzle and tail are essential parts of a costume </h2><p>  How to make a scary wolf costume with your own hands?  It is very important for the boy that the hero evokes at least admiration, and even better if he looks intimidating.  For this outfit, the face of the wolf is mandatory - on a hat or hood. </p><p>  So, first with a <span>centimeter tape</span> measure the circumference of the child‚Äôs head and the depth of the future cap - from the back of the head to the middle of the forehead.  After they cut out the rectangle, sew it together, folding the smaller sides, and on the top of the cap make tucks like a six-link. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a wolf costume" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/625274.jpg" width="340"></div>

    <p>  The wolf costume for the boy is almost ready.  It remains to think about how the hat will hold on, because our children are such fidgets!  And if you take into account outdoor games with Santa Claus and competitions ... By the way, the muzzle can be attached not only to the cap.  An elastic bandage or hood is suitable for this purpose. </p><p>  Then proceed to the design of the wolf face.  In order to sew the mouth, four long semi-ovals are cut out, laying in the seam cutting triangles of felt, which will play the role of teeth.  After these details are turned out and stuffed with synthetic winterizer.  They are sewn together at the base, putting between them a half-felt of red felt, which will serve as a tongue.  Further, one semicircle is cut out of fur and velor, having previously prepared triangular ears embedded in the seam.  The part is turned out and stuffed with a synthetic winterizer, after which they sew a <span>wolf's mouth</span> to it <span>.</span> <br>  Eyes are cut out of white felt, and pupils and nose are cut out of black.  These elements are glued with hot glue or sewn with a <span>blind seam.</span>  When the wolf‚Äôs head is ready, it is attached to a hat or hood. </p><p>  A New Year's wolf costume is unthinkable without a tail.  To complete this detail, you will need a rectangular section of fur 7-8 cm wide and length from the waist to the knees of the child.  The tail can be sewn, or you can attach it to the button.  The advantage of the second option is obvious - when the baby gets tired of this element, it can simply be unfastened. </p>
