How to restore correspondence</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When using a mobile device, various malfunctions can occur as a result of which a complete reset may be required.  As a result, all programs installed by gadget users are deleted.  At such moments, the question arises, how to restore Vatsap and is it possible to return deleted correspondence?  It is quite possible to do this on Android. </p><div class="photo" data-original="f1comp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vatsap installation" class="if uuid-2947775" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45958/2947775.jpg"></div><h2>  Program recovery </h2><p>  To start the WhatsApp recovery procedure, download the program itself.  After installing it, run.  In the window that appears, enter the phone number.  It must be valid, as it will receive an SMS message with an activation code.  Next, enter the username.  It will be displayed on all devices in which the user is not included in the contacts.  The name can be edited at any time. </p><p>  But how to restore Vatsap on the device on which it previously stood?  To do this, the same actions are performed as described above.  The only difference is that the program can find backups.  When reinstalling, they can be restored or not restored.  In any case, the latest chats will be displayed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kak-na-android.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Installing Vatsap on the phone" class="if uuid-2947779" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45958/2947779.jpg"></div><h2>  Correspondence recovery </h2><p>  And how to restore the old correspondence at Vatsap?  The program provides an opportunity to return correspondence during reinstallation of "Vatsap".  To do this, during the activation process, the user must choose whether to restore the backup or not.  When you select "Restore backup", all chats will be restored in Vatsap. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Restore old chats </h2><p>  Sometimes, during accidental deletion, the necessary information that was received earlier is lost.  At such moments, the question arises: "How to restore Vatsap with correspondence from an earlier period?" </p><p>  In order to take care of your messages and always be able to restore them, you must follow these rules. </p><ul><li>  Create a backup.  Usually the program backs up all correspondence for a month, then the information is lost. </li><li>  When starting the program, old backups are used. </li><li>  Manually start saving the transfer of data and media files.  To do this, the user needs to go into the program settings, select the item ‚ÄúChats and calls‚Äù, then ‚ÄúBackup‚Äù. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="qurtewosom.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Restore from backup" class="if uuid-2947781" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45958/2947781.jpg"></div><h2>  Restore from backup </h2><p>  And how to restore correspondence in Vatsap manually from a backup?  Make it easy.  First you need to activate data backup.  In order to open the desired copy, you must perform the following steps. </p><ol><li>  Open the folder where the backups are stored.  Most likely, this folder is located on the phone‚Äôs internal memory or can be stored on a memory card.  It is called WhatsApp.  If the reset program has deleted Vatsap, how to restore it is described above. </li><li>  Next, the folder with the files where the backups are stored opens.  It is called Databases. </li><li>  A list of backups with their creation dates appears on the screen.  It remains to choose the one that is needed. </li><li>  Having selected the base, it remains only to rename it.  To do this, the msgstore.db.crypt7 file is highlighted, the ‚ÄúRename‚Äù item is selected in the drop-down menu.  Instead of the existing name, any other fits here. </li><li>  The desired backup is renamed.  All of them have a letter designation and a date in their name.  In order for the program to activate this particular database, it is necessary to remove the date from the name, leaving all other characters.  For example, the file was called msgstore-2018-10-10.db.crypt, it should turn into a file called msgstore.db.crypt. </li></ol><p>  After this procedure, it remains to reinstall Vatsap.  It is easier to erase all stored information from the phone‚Äôs memory and clear the cache.  This will allow you not to reinstall the program completely.  About how to recover a deleted Vatsap is described above.  You just have to go through the activation of the account, indicating the restoration of the program from the backup.  After the installation is completed, all the information stored in the backup will appear on the screen. </p><div class="photo" data-original="whatsapp-web.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Backup" class="if uuid-2947776" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45958/2947776.jpg"></div><h2>  Recommendations </h2><p>  In order not to lose your messages, you should enable data backup.  This will help in the future to avoid their unwanted loss, if suddenly your gadget fails or you need to transfer the program to a new smartphone.  In the latter case, the backup copies of the databases are transferred with the memory card to the new device, from where they are activated in the newly installed program. </p>
