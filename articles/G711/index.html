Without ceasing, the number of both incoming and outgoing calls is growing.  At the same time, the risk of losing a potential buyer increases, because instead of answering he will hear short beeps, indicating that the number is busy.  Just for such situations multichannel phone numbers serve.  They make it possible to simultaneously answer a large number of calls. </p>

    <h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  Surely every person at least once in a life called a customer support service and has an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow this service works.  First, the company number is dialed, after which the voice menu is launched.  When choosing the right team, the operator himself is connected to the conversation.  Such a system is created using multichannel communication with the participation of an automatic telephone exchange.  The principle of operation is very simple: all calls to one number are redirected to the phones of operators that are currently free.  If all lines are busy, then the subscriber is queued, and the first free operator answers him. </p><p>  Companies very quickly realize that there is a need for such a solution.  After all, at first the telephone line supports only one channel for communication.  And if there are more customers, and they call at the same time?  Often faced with a busy number, the buyer can irrevocably go to the company whose telephone service is better organized.  To prevent this, you just need to create more channels for receiving calls. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Analog connection </h2><p>  A multi-channel phone number can be connected using either a regular telephone exchange or virtual.  The first case entails significant costs for equipment, setup and its further maintenance.  A big problem can also be the limit number of lines, since PBXs have their own set device limit.  Connecting an additional phone within the capabilities of the station costs a lot.  Another disadvantage of analog communication is the limited territory. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="multichannel phone number" class="if" height="436" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/1407970.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Virtual connection </h2><p>  A virtual station makes things much easier.  And it also saves money, since all the equipment is on the side of the provider.  The customer company, however, receives all its capabilities and uses it to its needs.  No need to have any special knowledge.  You just need to choose the phones on which calls will be distributed.  Operators can be in the same room or in different places on the planet, and calls will be received from the same number.  The number of calls processed simultaneously can reach several hundred.  The costs here are quite small: payment for the multi-channel number itself and a monthly subscription fee. </p>

    <h2>  Which number to choose </h2><p>  There are three types of multichannel phone numbers that are convenient and popular: direct city and federal with codes 8-800 and 8-804.  Each of them has its own characteristics: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  A direct city number is connected to those companies that want to gain the trust of customers.  Even when the company has just appeared, and it still does not have an office, and there are only a couple of people in the staff, such a number will help create the image of a good company.  The main plus is cost-effectiveness, since connecting a phone with such a code is cheaper than with a federal one, and incoming calls are completely free for the company.  This is also a drawback: customers from another region, as well as those who call from mobiles, can stay away from companies with city numbers because of their reluctance to pay for the call. </li><li>  Number with the code 8-800 is the most popular option for all inter-regional firms and call-centers, as well as for organizing hotlines.  Just a couple of years ago, such a number was considered something new for buyers.  But today they are already perceived as well as city numbers.  This is proven by practice.  The main advantage is the convenience for the client, since he does not need to pay for calls to such numbers.  And it does not depend on which region these calls are made from.  The disadvantage is the higher price for connection and maintenance.  But if you use a virtual station, then the costs are significantly reduced. </li><li>  The multi-channel number with the code 8-804 is for the most part similar to the previous version.  There is only one difference: with an incoming call, the number of the subscriber is displayed.  This is a plus for a large number of organizations.  But some still want to remain anonymous.  Connecting this number is cheaper than 8-800. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Connecting a multi-channel virtual number </h2><p>  In order to organize a multi-channel communication line, it is necessary: </p><ul><li>  Choose a provider.  This is necessary, since the quality of communication and comfort when using a virtual station will depend on it. </li><li>  Decide on the equipment.  As was said, sophisticated technical equipment is not needed here.  A computer or mobile device with Internet access at an average speed (enough for 512 kilobits per second), an ordinary phone or SIP device, and also a VoIP adapter is suitable. </li><li>  Choose a tariff and a single multi-channel number.  This is done with an eye to the scale of the company and its needs.  A provider can often provide a range of different options for both small firms and large ones. </li><li>  Register with your service provider. </li><li>  Set up the equipment, as well as the cloud telephone exchange.  It also does not require the possession of specific skills.  An application is installed on the computer, and an internal number or several numbers are created on the provider's website.  Then, forwarding rules and other necessary parameters are configured. </li></ul><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  After all this company, a virtual multi-channel phone number is available.  Customers will not go anywhere now because of a busy telephone line. </p>

    <p>  In the event that the company already has a number that you don‚Äôt want to refuse, and because of its advantages you still want to connect the virtual PBX, you just need to connect your <span>line to the</span> VoIP <span>adapter</span> and then sign an agreement with the provider company.  After that, the already familiar number will turn into a multi-channel.  In Russia, all major mobile operators provide such a service.  Therefore, you can easily contact them and connect a multi-channel number.  "Megaphone", "MTS", "Beeline" allow you to serve many customers with a single phone number. </p>
