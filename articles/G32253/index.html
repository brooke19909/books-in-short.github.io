    <h2>  Hotel rooms </h2><p>  Many tourists dream of getting to the UAE.  Hilton Fujairah Resort 5 * offers its guests some excellent accommodation options: </p><ul><li>  Hilton Room with a double bed.  There is also a modification of these apartments with a larger area and, accordingly, capacity.  Guests are very fond of these rooms because their windows offer incredibly beautiful views of the sea coast. </li><li>  The hotel has several family suites that are designed to accommodate four guests.  There are two bedrooms, each of which is combined with its own bathroom. </li><li>  King Hilton Apartments are for two guests.  There is also the possibility of checking into a room with a child who is provided with an extra bed. </li><li>  Twin rooms are small in size and have a double bed.  This is perhaps the best option for a romantic getaway, so these apartments are often booked by the newlyweds for a honeymoon. </li><li>  The chalets are located near the beach and can offer accommodation in double or single beds.  The standard capacity is two guests, but depending on the size of the apartment, you can set another 2 or 3 extra beds.  Each chalet also has its own access to the sea and private car parking. </li></ul>
