Moreover, it is advisable to do this long before the expected date of departure abroad.  This approach will minimize the difficulties and problems that may arise during your vacation.  Experienced tourists are advised to pay special attention to choosing a hotel.  After all, the quality of your vacation, and, accordingly, the impressions that remain from it, will largely depend on it.  And even if you consider yourself to be a modest traveler, anyway you would like to return to a cozy cleanly furnished room every day, sleep on fresh sheets, and be able to quickly get from the hotel to the main local tourist attractions and sites.  An indispensable source of information, according to many, is considered to be the study of the reviews of those who have already happened to visit this or that hotel.  After all, former guests are trying to tell not only about the pros, but also about the minuses that you run the risk of while living here.  This will help you make the right choice, which you will not have to regret about later.  In order to save your time and energy, we bring to your attention the already generalized comments of tourists from Russia regarding their vacation at Welcome Marina Hotel 2 * (Pattaya, Thailand).  Immediately, we note that most of our compatriots were satisfied with this hotel and are glad that their choice fell on it.  But we learn about everything in more detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="welcome marina hotel 2 reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1081779.jpg" width="600"></div>

So, some even note that the apartments here were even better than they expected from a two-star hotel category.  In their reviews, tourists mention the features of each type of room.  So, according to them, deluxe apartments differ from standard ones in that they are located in a different building (not where the reception is located).  They also have a balcony, and drinking water is replenished every day.  In standard rooms, you can draw water in coolers located on each floor.  Plus, deluxe apartment guests considered the presence of large balconies with magnificent sea views.  As a minus, some tourists note the fact that there are rooms on the fourth and fifth floors, and they have to climb stairs, since the building does not have an elevator. </p><p>  In general, all the apartments of the Welcome Marina Hotel 2 * hotel, of which we are reviewing, our compatriots found quite spacious, pleasantly decorated and equipped with comfortable furniture and properly functioning appliances.  It has everything that guests need - beds, armchairs, wardrobes, air conditioning, safe, refrigerator, bathroom.  According to tourists, there are no hairdryers in the rooms.  Therefore, if necessary, it is better to take it with you from home.  Also, if you need, you can take an electric kettle at the reception and make tea or coffee directly in the room.  Another advantage of the hotel guests considered the availability of clothes dryers in the apartments.  Therefore, you will not have any problems with where to put wet bathing accessories. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="welcome marina hotel 2 pattaya thailand" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1081780.jpg" width="600"></div>

However, in fact, as many guests note, the maids almost every day washed the floors, wiped the dust, made the beds.  This can be called a rarity for hotels of 2-star category.  The maids also changed towels several times a week and updated bed sheets.  In addition, if you need something, then you can inform the manager at the reception about this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel welcome marina hotel 2" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1081781.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  One of the main advantages of the Welcome Marina Hotel 2 *, photos of which can be seen in this article, travelers considered its location.  So, according to them, you can eat and buy everything you need right on the street where the hotel is located.  So, in the vicinity of ‚ÄúVelcom Marina‚Äù there are several shops, souvenir shops, a 24-hour supermarket, a market, a lot of cafes, massage parlors, excursion bureaus, currency exchange points, car rental companies and much more.  In addition, you can quickly get to Pattaya's main tourist attraction, the famous Walking Street.  On a tuk-tuk, you can get to it in just a quarter of an hour. </p><p>  In addition, all hotel guests appreciated the fact that it is literally on the beach, just 100 meters from Jomtien Beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="welcome marina hotel 2 pattaya" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1081782.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Since Velkom Marina is a small hotel, you will not find much entertainment here.  So, on its territory there is no pool, no sports fields, no Internet cafes and a sports hall.  However, the hotel has its own parking.  The reception here is open around the clock.  So at any time, day or night, if necessary, you can contact the duty administrator.  In addition, guests can use the laundry and dry cleaning services and leave things for storage in the luggage room. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The cost of living at the Velcom Marina Hotel does not include meals.  However, for an additional fee, you can have breakfast as well as lunch and dinner in the hotel restaurant.  Here you will be offered dishes of both Thai, Russian and international cuisine.  Cooking in a restaurant, according to our compatriots, is very good.  In addition, you can always order something to your taste, and not choose from the available options, as in institutions working in the buffet format. </p><p>  However, despite the fact that the Welcome Marina Hotel 2 * hotel (Pattaya) has its own restaurant, many guests preferred to eat mainly in cafes located in its vicinity, as well as in the city center.  According to them, they cook very tasty almost everywhere, and the prices are more than affordable.  Also, experienced travelers are advised not to ignore the so-called macaques (mobile food stalls).  Here you can taste a variety of local dishes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="welcome marina hotel 2 pics" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1081783.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  This item, judging by the comments of our compatriots, aroused extremely positive emotions among all the guests of the Velcom Marina Hotel.  So, the indisputable advantage of the hotel is the fact that it is located just 100 meters from Jomtien Beach.  So you can reach the sea in just a couple of minutes with an unhurried step.  According to tourists, the beach and the sea here are not the cleanest in Thailand, however, they are quite suitable for a comfortable stay.  Here you can rent a sunbed and umbrella.  However, keep in mind that the sun loungers here are sedentary and wooden, which may not seem convenient to everyone.  Alternatively, you can always buy a mat in the nearest store and sit on it right on the sand.  In this case, you save money on renting sunbeds.  Near the beach there are lots of cafes and bars where you can both have a bite to eat and refresh yourself with a soft or alcoholic drink. </p><p>  Many experienced tourists are also advised to travel to other beaches.  You can do this either in a tuk-tuk or taxi, or by renting a motobike. </p>
