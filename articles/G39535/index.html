But this did not happen, because the emphasis in the provision of high-quality services is made by television people on the city.  But people want to have access to a wide range of channels and beyond.  And then an antenna for digital TV comes to their aid.  It is with her help that you can ensure yourself a pleasant weekend in the country, and the most remarkable is that there are several types of such devices for various purposes. </p><p>  <strong>Indoor antenna</strong> </p><p>  These devices are distinguished by their small size - they can be put on a table or cabinet, and at the same time they will not bother you at all.  But at the same time, such an ethereal antenna allows you to perfectly catch a <span>digital</span> television <span>signal</span> and broadcast it to a TV. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ether antenna" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14342/168205.jpg" width="390"></div>  Room options are currently being produced in various forms and designs, as the emphasis is not only on data transmission, but also on aesthetics and beauty.  Modern companies manufacturing such products focus on manufacturability, so their units are made in this style, that is, harmoniously fit into the environment of computers, tablets and smartphones.  A small drawback of indoor samples is that their reception range is not too large, so in the country such an antenna will be useless - it is better to use it in the city.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Outdoor option</strong> </p><p>  But it is not necessary to acquire exclusively a room sample, since there is also an outdoor broadcast antenna, which in its characteristics is usually much better than the options used indoors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="antenna for digital tv" class="if" height="209" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14342/168203.jpg" width="497"></div>  If the previous models are recommended to be used in the immediate vicinity of the station that produces digital frequencies, then the outdoor can be floated and outside the city.  Typically, such devices broadcast from 20 to 60 channels and are placed in cottages or cottages, which are located near broadcasting points, that is, within 10-20 kilometers.

    <p>  <strong>If you need more help</strong> </p><p>  However, most often the ethereal antenna is needed precisely for those people who have their sites at a great distance from the broadcast points.  How to be the one whose cottage is located 50 kilometers or more from the city?  For such cases, there is also a solution - it consists in the purchase and installation of an outdoor model equipped with an amplifier. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ether antenna" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14342/168204.jpg" width="525"></div>  Such options are offered everywhere and guarantee perfect high-quality digital broadcasting within 60 kilometers of the nearest city with a television tower.  At a greater distance, the quality is already beginning to decline, and it may take you time to tune to the desired frequency.  But also you can search for a more suitable option.  A special terrestrial antenna with a powerful amplifier will cost a little more, but it will allow you to enjoy the joys of digital TV at any distance from the broadcast point.  True, a range of more than 100 kilometers is usually unprofitable, since there is hardly any settlement that would be so far from any television tower.
