The icon over time has been finalized and modified.  Losing it was considered a terrible and unforgivable affair. </p><h2>  The appearance of the first pioneer badges </h2><p>  The first pioneer badges appeared in 1923.  On them was the inscription "Be ready!".  It was she who equipped the pioneer <span>badges of the USSR</span> in those days.  In its original form, a flame, a bonfire, a sickle, a hammer, and, of course, the unchanging motto of the pioneers were depicted.  However, in this form, the symbol lasted only five years, then it began to be modified. </p><p>  The next step was that pioneer badges began to be released in the form of clips that were fixed on a tie.  Has changed and the motto.  Now it sounded like "Always ready!".  In this form, the icon existed until the start of World War II, when their production was discontinued.  The pioneers themselves made their symbol from available materials at hand. </p><h2>  Post-War Pioneer Badge Changes </h2><p>  By the end of the war, the production of pioneering paraphernalia was resumed again.  Pioneer badges again underwent changes.  Sickle and hammer took the place of the fire in the center, and three tongues of flame glowed above the star.  Also, the badges were now divided into three degrees depending on the age group. </p><p>  Final modifications affected the symbolism in 1962.  It was during this period that in the central part of the pioneer sign it was possible to contemplate the profile of leader V.I.  Lenin, and underneath the slogan ‚ÄúAlways ready!‚Äù  Invariably, three tongues of fire fluttered in the upper part of the star.  According to user reviews, it was the latest design that appealed to people the most. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In addition to the well-known form, pioneer badges were also award-winning.  What distinguished them from ordinary ones was that instead of the <span>pioneer motto the</span> inscription ‚ÄúFor active work‚Äù flaunted. </p><h2>  Pioneer badge before the end of the existence of a pioneer organization </h2><p>  By the mid-80s, another kind of pioneer badges appeared - for older pioneers.  They differed from the simple one except for their large size.  However, along with this, a significant defect appeared in this attribute: a very unreliable fastening.  The pin kept breaking and failing, and it was not possible to replace or acquire a new badge.  As a result, these "accessories" were not doomed to widespread distribution and soon ceased to exist. </p>

    <p>  Badges, like <span>pioneer ties,</span> were not practical and inconvenient for everyday use.  There were significant flaws in their design.  Nobody was going to deal with this issue, so the authority of pioneering symbols among schoolchildren was significantly reduced. </p><h2>  The historical significance of the pioneer badges </h2><p>  To date, the history of the pioneer icon has been around for almost a century.  Now no one uses this attribute, but in due time without it, the life of a schoolboy turned into a real test.  A child who was not accepted into pioneers and did not have pioneering attributes was considered almost inferior.  They didn‚Äôt want to communicate with him, he always got the last turn, and from the side of his peers he constantly heard ridicule and mockery.  If the pioneer badge was lost, then this was considered the greatest shame. </p>

    <p>  Although the traditions associated with the pioneer badge are not entirely fair, and sometimes even go beyond democracy, they educated the younger generation of discipline and deep respect for their symbolism and their country.  It was not just a distinctive badge of a schoolboy, it was the honorary title of a pioneer, which everyone sought to wear with pride and honor and in no case to stain and not discredit. </p>
