This is especially true for countries such as America and Italy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="American gangsters" class="if" height="248" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11391/216996.jpg" width="400"></div>  Moreover, many American gangsters who left a significant mark in the history of the underworld of the United States arrived there at the end of the 19th century, escaping from the fascist regime of Mussolini.  This was facilitated by the relative freedom of public order, and the imperfection of the legislation.  And indeed, America was a country in which immigrants from various classes and states flocked, having trouble with the law and society in their homeland.  For example, the American gangsters of the 30s developed their activities and expanded their controlled territories thanks to the ‚Äúprohibition‚Äù prohibiting the sale of alcoholic beverages.

    <p>  Since the culture was formed under the influence of people who have very serious problems with the rule of law, some ‚Äúgodfathers‚Äù of mafia structures were shrouded in a kind of halo of fame and are well known in all walks of life.  But at the same time, the American gangsters included in the Cosa Nostra were particularly cruel.  By the way, they all had Italian or American-Italian roots of origin.  Although, of course, not only the <span>Italian mafia</span> flourished in the United States <span>.</span>  All criminal organizations and gang groups position themselves as ‚Äúfighters for freedom and equality,‚Äù who are only engaged in self-defense against public injustice. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Famous american gangster" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11391/217003.jpg" width="594"></div>

He was born in a family of Italian immigrants in Brooklyn, in 1919 he moved to Chicago due to problems with the law and began working for Johnny Torrio.  This mafia should also not be ignored - it was he who laid the foundation for the Syndicate.  So called the commission on the distribution of territories of influence and conflict resolution.  It included the American gangsters of the Italian mafia families.  After Johnny Torrio retired, Al Capone took his place.  He was very fond of attention, was intellectually developed, but he was particularly cruel.  He received his income from control of prostitution, betting counter and from bootlegging.  The smuggling of alcohol brought him the greatest income during the Prohibition.  It was Capone who unleashed a bloody war of gangsters in 1925.  But they arrested him for <span>tax evasion.</span>  It was not possible to prove the involvement of the mafiosi in the illicit trade in alcohol or murders - witnesses were absent or simply silent. </p>

After leaving prison, he was taken to a famous American gangster Charlie Luciano.  Costello was subsequently bound to him by a strong bond of friendship.  If Capone controlled with controlled brutality, then this mafia had a slightly different method.  He was a kind of link in the relations of politicians and criminals.  Many American gangsters turned to Don Costello to communicate with members of the government.  And thanks to his close acquaintance with politicians, Frank avoided police harassment.
