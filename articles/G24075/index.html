The formula for this substance is CuSO4.  It is a strong electrolyte and is a white small crystals, soluble in water, without taste and odor.  The substance is non-combustible and is fireproof, with its use the possibility of spontaneous combustion is completely excluded.  Copper sulfate, when exposed to even the smallest amount of moisture from the air, acquires a characteristic blue color with bright blueness.  In this case, copper sulfate is converted to the blue pentahydrate CuSO4 ¬∑ 5H2O, known as copper sulfate. </p><p>  In industry, copper sulfate can be obtained in several ways.  One of the most common is the dissolution of copper waste in dilute <span>hydrochloric acid.</span>  Under laboratory conditions, <span>copper</span> sulfate is obtained using the neutralization reaction <span>of copper hydroxide with</span> sulfuric acid.  The formula of the process is as follows: Cu (OH) 2 + H2SO4 ‚Üí CuSO4 + H2O. </p><p>  The color changing property of copper sulfate is used to detect the presence of moisture in organic liquids.  With its help, in the laboratory, dehydration of ethanol and other substances is carried out. </p><p>  Widely used in agricultural industries, copper sulfate or in another way copper sulfate.
