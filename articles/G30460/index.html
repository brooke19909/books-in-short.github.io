    <h2>  About booking and policies </h2><p>  Before proceeding to the reviews of Kassandra Palace Hotel 5 *, it is worth noting the attention of several nuances that must be taken into account for each person planning to go here to relax. </p><p>  So, this hotel has a loyal policy towards guests who come with children.  For children under the age of 2 years, separate small beds are provided, in addition, accommodation is free for them.  But before the trip it is necessary to inform the administration of the age of the children (this information can be indicated in the application for reservation of apartments). </p><p>  People making remote reservations will have to enter their credit card details.  The property is hosted by American Express, Visa, Master Card, Diners Club and Maestro.  You need to use a personal card, because when you check in you will need to present it. </p><h2>  What else should you know? </h2><p>  Going to Greece, at the Kassandra Palace Hotel 5 *, it is better to order only breakfast.  In the immediate vicinity of the hotel there are several good taverns with a large assortment of dishes and affordable prices.  Many people prefer to have lunch and dinner there, each time trying something new. </p><p>  If you need to buy something, then you won‚Äôt have to go far - the prices in the hotel‚Äôs store are slightly higher than in the village.  But you can walk to it, the distance is small - about one and a half kilometers along a wonderful forest road.  But you can drive.  At the reception they give out a schedule of buses running from the hotel to the center of Kriopigi.  Shuttle taxis run regularly and are rarely crowded with people, so you don‚Äôt have to go broke in a taxi. </p><p>  There are also minor disadvantages that you can learn about by looking at the hotel reviews.  Kassandra Palace Hotel 5 * has excellent territory, but in the evening it is not lit.  This is especially worrying guests coming with children. </p><p>  Also, many say that the building would not hurt the reconstruction.  Not a particularly significant drawback, because the hotel is not new, but cosmetic repairs are carried out regularly. </p><p>  In addition, guests in their reviews complain about insects.  But such is the specificity of the territory and climate - mosquitoes here feel favorable.  And the problem is easily solved by the acquisition of fumigants and protective sprays.  By the way, it will not be superfluous to bring bathing slippers with you on vacation.  Sea urchins are found near the coast - if you are inattentive, you can accidentally step on them.  Better safe than sorry. </p>

This is true, and here is what the guests say: </p><ul><li>  Despite the fact that registration starts at 15:00, arrivals before guests can check in early.  But only on condition that available rooms of the reserved category will be available. </li><li>  The rooms are comfortable and cozy, recently renovated to the same.  The reality is fully consistent with the photographs. </li><li>  The staff is polite and responsive, many are fluent in the Russian language - no one had problems with overcoming the linguistic barrier. </li><li>  The hotel‚Äôs establishments serve very quickly - there are no queues, dirty dishes are cleaned quickly, if something ends at the buffet, then the portions are replenished. </li><li>  Since the beach is accessible only to guests, it is always spacious and has free sun loungers. </li><li>  Children's animation is at a decent level - the kids do not want to leave the mini-club and return there the next day with joy. </li><li>  The territory is large, well-groomed and clean, a lot of greenery and flowers. </li></ul><p>  Based on the reviews of the Kassandra Palace Hotel 5 *, we can conclude that this is a great place for people who dream of a comfortable and carefree vacation, located also on the shores of the cleanest sea, which is within easy reach. </p>
