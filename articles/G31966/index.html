    <h2>  Where is Land Royal Residence 4 * located </h2><p>  Pattaya (Thailand) is a very simple city in terms of layout.  The main avenues run parallel to the sea coast and are called unpretentiously: Beach Road, First, Second, Third.  Promising the vibrant nightly adventures of Woking Street begins at Bali Hai Pier.  The entrance to it is symbolized by an arch.  This street stretches along the <span>Gulf of Thailand</span> and abuts against the southern edge of Beach Road.  The hotel described here is located at South Pattaya Rd.  But the term "South Pattaya" does not mean a suburb at all.  Walking Street can be reached on foot in twenty minutes.  Away?  You can always take a tuk-tuk, a songteo or a motorcycle taxi.  But the area is very quiet, which is suitable for lovers of a relaxing holiday.  They also go to Pattaya with their children.  Land Royal Residence is located near the Underwater Ward Pattaya Aquarium.  The hotel is surrounded by various signs of urban civilization.  There is a currency exchange office directly in front of the hotel.  Nearby are supermarkets like Seven-Ileven or Family Markt, including European products. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Land Royal Residence 4 Pattaya" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1482934.jpg" width="600"></div>

It occupies a six-story building with an elevator.  Beautiful entrance with a bright sign.  Foyer with leather sofas and armchairs.  In front of the entrance is a terrace with tables and chairs.  On the second floor there is an indoor pool.  Next to him are couches for relaxation.  On the ground floor there is a restaurant.  The windows and balconies of the rooms face the street or the neighboring houses.  Recently, the hotel was renovated, and now everything is shining with novelty.  When checking in require a deposit of a thousand butts.  You can exchange the currency for national currency in the opposite paragraph.  But tourists say that they simply gave one hundred American dollars, and employees accepted them.  Upon departure returned the same bill.  In general, tourists say that the bank opposite the hotel has a good rate.  The contingent in the hotel is the most calm.  Russian and Chinese groups do not stop there.  This hotel is chosen only by independent travelers.  As such, the hotel has no territory.  But there is equipped parking at the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Land Royal Residence 4 reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1482929.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  In the small city hotel Land Royal Residence 4 * there are only forty-five guest rooms.  All of them belong to the same category - double deluxe suites.  Since the name ‚ÄúResidence‚Äù appears in the name of the hotel, the rooms have something like a kitchen corner.  Of course, stoves and pans with pots are not there.  But there is a refrigerator, an electric kettle, tableware, a sink.  Of the other devices, reviews mention a powerful air conditioning, a brand new flat-screen TV that broadcasts almost a hundred channels (there are also Russians), and a safe that easily accommodates a laptop in its bowels. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The furniture in the rooms is very new, stylish, fits well with the design.  There is a table, a large mirror, a wardrobe.  You can book a room with one wide bed or two separate beds.  There are blackout curtains on the windows so that the light from the street does not interfere with sleep.  Tourists describe balconies as spacious.  They have a table and two rattan chairs.  Bathrooms have showers.  An individual boiler guarantees the supply of hot water at any time of the day.  Every day, the maid puts a bottle of drinking water, two soaps and a shampoo. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Land Royal Residence 4 Thailand" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1482931.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Hotel Land Royal Residence 4 * does not limit its guests in choosing where to eat.  You can pay only for accommodation.  Fortunately, the hotel is full of various eateries, Thai macaques and quite European fast foods (KFS, Burgerking, McDonald's).  You can eat the usual food in a Russian restaurant nearby, or you can try grasshoppers or crickets in the evening market.  Many tourists took breakfast.  They cost about three euros per person.  Breakfast is in mixed format.  Drinks (juices, milk, coffee, tea), sausages, boiled eggs, sliced ‚Äã‚Äãvegetables - all this is on the tables.  You need to take what you want and wait for the arrival of the waiter.  And then order a hot dish: rice, noodles (pattai) or stewed vegetables.  If desired, the hotel can have lunch and dinner.  The on-site restaurant serves gourmet Thai and European dishes.  There is also a bar in the hotel where you can order a variety of drinks and cocktails. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Land Royal Residence 4 Pattaya Thailand" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1482938.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beaches and Pool </h2><p>  Land Royal Residence 4 * hotel is located more than a kilometer from the sea coast.  If you still get to the beach on a tuk-tuk, it is better to choose the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãNorth Pattaya.  There are cleaner and more amenities.  To do this, you should get to the "Dolphin" (this sculpture serves as a guide for local drivers), and from there you can easily reach the Wongamat Beach.  Many tourists went to sunbathe and swim on the islands.  And in this regard, the hotel is very well located.  After all, to the Bali Hai marina, from where boats and boats depart for the islands, it is a stone's throw.  The hotel on the second floor has a swimming pool.  It is unheated and, since it is indoors, without direct access to the rays of the equatorial sun, it is very, very invigorating.  But after a hot day, you can refresh yourself.  And then lie down on the couch and, while drinking a cocktail served by the bartender, relax. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Land Royal Residence 4" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1482932.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel staff and service </h2><p>  Since the Land Royal Residence 4 * is a small hotel, the service staff knows it all.  The owner regularly inquires about how your day went, the general manager - a lady who is fluent in English - tells in detail what to see in Pattaya, where to go in the evening, where to buy, etc. Maids clean surprisingly well and carefully - Dust was not noticed even in hard to reach places.  The waiter in the restaurant is very quick, you do not need to wait long for your order.  Cooks and bartenders know their stuff.  At the reception you can order tickets and excursions, call a taxi.  There is also a left-luggage office - absolutely free for guests.  And what‚Äôs most important (without it now rest is not rest) is access to the Internet.  Weifai catches in all rooms, no matter how far you are from the reception.  Routers are on every floor.  None of the reviews reported a case of missing values ‚Äã‚Äãfrom the room. </p><h2>  Paid hotel services </h2><p>  There is a laundry at the Land Royal Residence 4 * hotel (Pattaya), where you will not only wash your clothes, but also iron them.  At the reception you can use the scanner, photocopy, fax.  The hotel carries out transfer orders to Bangkok International Airport or vice versa.  Many tourists arriving in Thailand late in the evening took advantage of this paid service.  Another such service is bike rental.  Given that the terrain in Pattaya is flat, two-wheeled transport is becoming a convenient means of transportation.  At the reception, which works round the clock, you will book tours, help buy tickets or reserve a table in the restaurant.  There are express check-in, late check-out and 24-hour room service. </p><h2>  Shopping in Pattaya </h2><p>  Many tourists go to Thailand with almost empty suitcases to return from vacation, laden with quality and affordable clothes.  And in terms of shopping, it‚Äôs a sin not to take advantage of the convenient location of the Land Royal Residence 4 * hotel.  Reviews say that nearby supermarkets such as Big Sea and Central Festival are nearby.  A feature of Thai large stores is that in each of them there is a food court where you can eat inexpensively and tasty.  In the South Pattaya area is the Renship Supermarket.  Food is sold on the ground floor of this mall (tourists especially recommended seafood and fruits), and on the second floor, dishes and office equipment.  This store is open until the last customer, that is, until about half past one in the night.  A trip to the Royal Garden Plaza will be both shopping and entertainment.  Indeed, on the third floor of this mall there is a cinema, a hall with slot machines and even a museum.  And at Tesco Lotus you can buy everything from lollipops to the computer.  There are two such stores in Pattaya. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Land Royal Residence 4 (Pattaya) reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1482927.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Excursions from Land Royal Residence Pattaya 4 * </h2><p>  It is not necessary to break away from the beach all day to see interesting places in Pattaya.  It is enough to devote at least an evening to this.  The hallmark of Pattaya is a transvestite show.  There are at least three such cabarets in the city.  The most famous is Alcazar, but the Tiffany and the recently opened Colosseum are no worse.  The reviews claim that in the cabaret, where people who have changed sex, dance and sing, you can go with the children - everything is very decent there.  Of the interesting places in the city, one can mention the Mini-Siam park, where small copies of all the famous buildings in Thailand are exhibited.  You can go to the Temple of Truth or <span>Nong Nooch</span> Tropical Park <span>.</span>  Not far from Pattaya there is a snake farm and Tiger Reserve.  You can combine excursions and beach holidays.  You can get to the coast with snow-white and clean sand if you go to one of the islands near Pattaya - Koh Chang, Samet, Sichang and Lan. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  About the hotel Royal Royal Residence <span>4 * (Pattaya)</span> reviews are generally positive.  As its advantages, they call the location relative to the urban infrastructure, spacious rooms, new furniture, sincere atmosphere and impeccable service.  As a minus - the need to get to the beach through the city.  Overall, the hotel earned its four stars. </p>
