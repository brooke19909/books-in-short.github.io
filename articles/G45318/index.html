This place is located in the southern district of the capital of Russia.  This <span>green zone</span> is surrounded by the Moskva River and borders the Kolomenskoye nature reserve and Andropov Avenue. </p><p>  Ancient people lived in these places, which is confirmed by archaeological excavations.  Where new houses were built, there were once the villages of Nagatino, Kolomenskoye and Novinki.  The Nagatinsky floodplain itself originates from the Dyakovo settlement, and the backwater is the largest in Moscow. </p><div class="photo" data-original="life.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nagatinsky floodplain" class="if uuid-2327914" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2327914.jpg"></div><h2>  Flora and fauna </h2><p>  This area is distinguished by a huge number of green spaces, mainly deciduous trees and shrubs grow here.  For this reason, many birds live in the floodplain.  Nesting birds are listed here, which are listed in the Red Book.  Pike come to spawn in the inflow, and reed grows on the banks.  <span>The park zone</span> is of great environmental importance for the city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.msk.kp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What will be the park" class="if uuid-2327923" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2327923.jpg"></div><h2>  History and Modernity </h2><p>  Up to a certain point, it was possible to walk and breathe fresh air and catch fish in the Nagatinsky floodplain park. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Back in the 30s of the last century, during the construction of the Perervinsky hydroelectric complex in these places, a floodplain appeared, which was very boggy.  In the 60s, they underwent a complete reconstruction, drained the swamp, covered about a million cubic meters of soil, and as a result a peninsula formed, with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã150 hectares, which was divided by a metro bridge. </p><p>  On the 60th anniversary of the October Revolution, a park was laid in the armhole.  And in 1985, the <span>Southern River</span> Station was built.  Admission was always free, but there was no proper maintenance of the park, there were no attractions, the territory was not landscaped.  To this day, on the map "Nagatinsky floodplain" is marked as "a zone of a protected landscape." </p><p>  In the 2000s, they started talking about the construction of the park.  Several projects were put up for public discussion.  One of the plans was the construction of a racing track in this territory, something like ‚ÄúFormula 1‚Äù, it was also proposed to build the highest skyscraper, a leisure and entertainment center. </p><p>  As a result, in 2014, the capital‚Äôs measures announced that in 10 years an analogue of Disneyland will appear on the site of the park in honor of the 60th anniversary of the October Revolution.  The development project was approved in 2015. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.molnet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Park rides" class="if uuid-2327912" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2327912.jpg"></div><h2>  "Island of Dreams" </h2><p>  Design work began back in 2008.  Architects have visited many amusement parks in the world, from Tokyo to America.  The result was a project of the largest indoor entertainment park in the world. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Nagatinskaya floodplain is ideal for development, under which approximately 110 hectares will be involved.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe park is planned 300 thousand square meters. </p><p>  Architects promise that the outwardly entertainment center will resemble a fairytale castle.  It will accommodate not only attractions, but also a concert hall, hotel complex, catering places and shops, a cinema, a school for teaching yachts for children and a landscape park.  There is a multi-level and huge parking. </p><p>  The authorities made sure that every resident and guest of the capital was able to get into the park without the presence of their own automobile transport.  In 2015, a new metro station Technopark was opened.  The construction of a bridge for pedestrians on the "Island of Dreams" should be completed in 2018-2019. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.6933824" data-lng="37.68280519999996" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="13"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/4/9/0/1490.png"></div><h2>  Park structure </h2><p>  Park "Island of Dreams" in the Nagatinskaya floodplain will have 10 thematic zones, which will accommodate about 40 entertainment sectors, where not only children but also adults can relax. </p><p>  Under the landscape park, it is planned to give 31.9 hectares, where there will be not only trees and other vegetation, but also children's, sports grounds.  They also organize a beach and a sector with a pool, several fountains and small ponds. </p><p>  The park will have a stadium under a glass dome.  The central part is intended for promenades.  On the embankment will place a school for young yachtsmen.  All sectors are built on the principle of a <span>barrier-free environment</span> where everyone, including people with limited mobility <span>,</span> will have access. </p><p>  The planned volume of investments is $ 1.5 billion.  According to forecasts, at least 50 million visitors will come here every year.  At the moment, the main stage of construction is completed, and the park itself is assigned to the main urban development facilities of the capital of Russia. </p>
