But not with the MTS service, Everywhere at Home.  Disabling or connecting this package is quite easy and simple.  Especially if you know all the existing options.  Let's try to study this sentence, and then learn how to connect a function and refuse it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pay everywhere at home disconnect" class="if" height="246" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1130082.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  Presented to our attention the tariff "MTS" "Everywhere at home."  Disabling or reconnecting it is very easy.  But what are we dealing with?  It has already been said that this service is roaming.  It allows you to make profitable calls while traveling in Russia. </p><p>  In our case, incoming calls are free.  Outgoing calls within the home region cost 3 rubles on average (costs may vary in different cities).  This rule is relevant for all mobile operators.  In addition, the exact same price tag is set for all calls within Russia.  That is, in roaming you will pay 3 rubles for outgoing calls.  These are quite favorable conditions. </p><h2>  Connection </h2><p>  How to disable the tariff "Everywhere at home" ("MTS")?  Before this, you must connect this option.  Otherwise, the refusal of services simply will not make sense.  How is this done? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For example, by calling the operator on number 0890. You inform the employee about your desire to connect "Everywhere at home" and agree to all the conditions.  Everything is easy and very simple. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable the tariff everywhere at home pay" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1130083.jpg" width="472"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  In any case, you should not pay much time to the connection.  After all, disabling, as a rule, implies the use of similar techniques.  The second scenario is the USSD command.  Dial * 111 * 3333 #.  Click the call button and wait for a response.  Please note that the connection is paid.  You will have to pay 30 rubles.  And for using roaming per day, 3 rubles of a monthly fee are charged. </p><h2>  Personal visit </h2><p>  Now we have a service from MTS Everywhere at Home.  You can disable it, as already mentioned, by calling the operator.  This is the first method.  Not the most popular and beloved by customers.  In second place is a personal visit to the MTS office in order to implement the idea. </p><p>  Let the employee know that you would like to refuse the package ‚ÄúEverywhere at home‚Äù.  Next, transfer your phone and name your personal data.  Sometimes a passport may be required of you.  He is needed for identification.  After that, wait a bit - the operator will fill out a request to refuse the service.  As soon as this happens, within 10 minutes you will receive a message with the result.  Usually it says that you managed to disable the "Everywhere at home" tariff. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Also not the most popular, but quite effective method of solving the problem.  It is relevant if you decide to refuse the service package, and the MTS office is located next to you.  Otherwise, you can use some other methods. </p><h2>  Help Team </h2><p>  Disable "Everywhere at home" ("MTS") using the USSD-command.  Please note: this process is free.  It does not require any cash costs, unlike connecting.  Therefore, if you want to solve the question yourself, this method will suit you perfectly. </p><p>  How to bring it to life?  We dial * 111 * 3333 # on the phone and send a request for processing.  To do this, click "Call".  Nothing more is required.  Unless to wait for the result.  He will come in an SMS message.  Typically, the waiting time is 5-10 minutes.  You should not repeat the request, even if you think the process has failed.

    <p>  By the way, this service, as in all past cases, is free.  Now we can expect a response from the operator.  You will receive a notification in which it will be written about the successful cancellation of the service.  This method is preferred by most subscribers.  But note - processing an SMS request can take about 15-20 minutes.  And you do not need to wait for an instant result. </p><h2>  Internet and website </h2><p>  If you have the option "MTS" "Everywhere at home", you can disable it using the official website of the company.  Or rather, your account and "My Account".  This approach is often used not only to refuse services, but also when connecting a particular package of options. </p><p>  You need to visit the site mts.ru.  There you must be authorized under your username and password.  If you did not have an account before, you will have to register.  The process is extremely simple and does not take more than 5 minutes. </p><p>  As soon as you get to the "My Account", you need to turn to the tab "Services".  In it, you will see all the possibilities that MTS can only offer.  Here you can see what kind of packages you have connected.  If necessary, you can disable them.  Or, on the contrary, connect something. </p>
