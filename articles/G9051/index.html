  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Just2Trade: reviews, account opening procedure, personal account</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Choosing a broker is a very responsible step.  Every newcomer who has decided to become a trader is faced with it.  To understand the degree of reliability of a brokerage company, it is necessary to study the information and get feedback on it.  Many traders describe their trading experience and even post screenshots of transactions on various specialized sites and forums.  In this article, the reader will get acquainted with reviews about Just2trade, based on which one can draw the appropriate conclusions and make a decision about cooperation with this company. </p><h2>  Information about the brokerage company Just2Trade </h2><p>  The broker offers customers a very convenient and functional site, which has an integrated trading platform, as well as a training unit for beginners and analytical data, including the information necessary for trading.  According to reviews, Just2trade provides a relatively inexpensive platform for trading, which attracts a large number of traders and investors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="amarinvestments.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ust2trade finals" class="if uuid-2955796" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41139/2955796.jpg"></div><p>  Organization Development: </p><ol><li>  This brokerage company was founded in 2007 and after 6 years it received a FINRA license from the organization that regulates the provision of services in the financial markets. </li><li>  In 2015, it was sold to WhoTrades, Inc., and if you study the documents thoroughly, you can put an equal sign between WhoTrades, Inc and Just2Trade. </li><li>  The brokerage company is officially registered in Cyprus and is essentially a division of Finam: WhoTrades Ltd.  - Cyprus, insurance 20,000 Euro;  WhoTrades Inc.  - insurance of 500,000 US dollars, operates in the US market.  Exit for trading on exchanges occurs through Just2trade online ltd., According to traders, without any problems. </li><li>  After the purchase of Finam, he became a European broker, as a result of which his address was changed. </li><li>  To date, Just2trade provides services for trading in financial markets around the world, in almost all countries. </li></ol><p>  With a superficial study of the issue, it is completely incomprehensible why Finam acquired Just2Trade.  But in fact, the famous giant has its benefits and advantages from this transaction: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  there is an increase in the customer base; </li><li>  Citizens of the Russian Federation get access to work with valuable assets and securities through Just2Trade.  To make financial transactions with shares in Russia, you must have the status of a qualified investor, and this requires a lot of capital.  But since Just2Trade is not officially registered in the Russian Federation, this condition becomes irrelevant, which means that trading and investment opportunities for broker's clients are significantly expanding. </li></ul><p>  According to statistics, in 2015, over 400,000 accounts were opened in Just2Trade, and he provided his services in more than 40 countries.  To date, indicators have increased. </p><h2>  Access to financial markets </h2><p>  Based on customer reviews of Just2trade and the information provided on the company's website, it can be concluded that the broker offers trading both in the foreign exchange market and on stock exchanges. </p><p>  The minimum threshold for opening an account is $ 200, which can be sent to trade in any direction of trading, that is, you can choose currency pairs, stocks or combine both directions as assets.  The advantage of this brokerage company is the ability to open a single account and engage in trading where it is convenient and convenient for the client. </p><p>  Commodity and stock exchanges: </p><ol><li>  European - XETRA. </li><li>  Moscow Exchange. </li><li>  American - Nasdaq and NYSE and other large resources. </li></ol><h2>  Brokerage Commission Fees </h2><p>  From the reviews of Just2trade online ltd, you can understand that the commissions of this broker have relatively small percentages and depend on the trading asset and exchange conditions.  For clarity, you can consider examples. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On the NYSE <span>(American Exchange), the</span> commission will depend on the monthly trading volume.  If it is more than 500,000, then the commission is 0.0025%, at least 1.5 dollars.  And on the MICEX exchange, amounts are fixed - 0.03%.  Therefore, before starting the opening of a transaction, it is necessary to clarify the information on commission fees in Just2trade. </p><h2>  Additional fees </h2><p>  In addition to the brokerage company interest rates described above, it‚Äôs also possible to understand from Just2trade reviews that additional commissions are withdrawn from traders during transactions, for example, with borrowed funds.  And also in the company there are fees for voice applications.  The amount of the commission is fixed and is 20%. </p><p>  And once a month, Just2trade deducts funds for maintaining a trading account.  The amount of commission fees is 5 dollars or 5 euros.  However, it is not always debited, but only in cases where the broker lacks the usual interest and is withdrawn from the client‚Äôs account only to cover Just2trade costs. </p><h2>  Types and types of trading accounts </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.mepbfinancial.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="just2trade online ltd reviews" class="if uuid-2955300" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41139/2955300.jpg"></div><p>  The broker for its customers and their convenience provides several types of trading accounts.  Each type has its own characteristics and advantages. </p><p>  Types of trading accounts: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  Demo Account - Just2trade demo. </li><li>  A single type of account for trading in different directions on specialized platforms for trading - MMA. </li><li>  "Forex account", which is designed to work with currency pairs. </li><li>  World - a universal type of account, allowing the client to access a large number (more than 10 types) of world markets. </li></ol><h2>  Advantages and features of trading accounts </h2><p>  Forex Trading Account is designed for trading in currency pairs.  The broker for traders provides more than 50 assets.  For trading in financial markets with currency pairs, the MetaTrader 4 platform is excellent, where you can make transactions and produce an analytical overview of changes in market quotes.  Leverage can be chosen at will, the maximum value is 1: 500. </p><p>  The World trading account, as mentioned above, provides customers with access to more than 10 global markets.  Commission fees are different and depend on the conditions of the exchange, minimum - 0.01%.  Leverage is provided with a maximum value of 1:50, with the condition of trading in Transaq. </p><p>  Just2trade MMA is a single account designed for various types of trading.  If the client chooses him, then he has the opportunity to gain access to any world sites.  According to Just2trade, it is completely unlimited and has its significant advantages. </p><p>  For clarity, the cooperation chain looks like this: Just2Trade, then a regional broker, and then providing the client with access rights to the trading platform that the trader has chosen for himself. </p><h2>  Trading account: registration and opening procedure </h2><p>  This procedure is practically no different from similar actions in other brokerage companies.  Registration of a trading account and personal account in Just2trade consists in filling out information about yourself.  But there is one feature: with this broker you can open an account both on the site and through the Finam broker.  This is due to the fact that Just2Trade is his property, since he was bought back by him. </p><p>  Procedure for registration: </p><ol><li>  Go to the main page of the site and click on the "open account" button. </li><li>  In a new window, after clicking on "my accounts", you will need to select the type of trading account mentioned above. </li><li>  Fill in all the fields of the registration form - personal data, phone number and address of registration / registration of residence. </li></ol><p>  Important: information must be provided only reliable, relevant to reality, otherwise in the future there may be problems with the withdrawal of funds. </p><ol><li>  Then you will need to confirm your phone number (the broker will send an SMS message with a code that must be entered on the site). </li><li>  Pass verification - load passport data scans.  They can be made independently, even with the help of a camera phone. </li></ol><p>  Verification is not required to open a trading account, but it will be needed in the future when withdrawing money, and you need to make it from your Just2trade account.  Its capabilities will be written below. </p><h2>  Withdraw funds and deposit funds </h2><div class="photo" data-original="caithness-business.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="just2trade withdrawals reviews" class="if uuid-2955330" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41139/2955330.jpg"></div><p>  To start trading in Finam Just2trade, in the "personal account" you need to select the "replenishment" function and install a special terminal on your computer for trading. </p><p>  For all replenishment of a trading account, you can use the following payment systems: </p><ol><li>  WebMoney. </li><li>  "Yandex money". </li><li>  "Neteller." </li><li>  Skrill. </li><li>  ChinaUnionPay. </li></ol><p>  You can also replenish a trading account with money through the Russian post (it will take up to 72 hours) or by bank transfer.  Although this option is less fast compared to online systems, but, according to Just2trade reviews, the withdrawal of money, as well as replenishment, will be made with lower commissions. </p><p>  All clients have the opportunity to use Finam Bank to replenish and withdraw funds from trading accounts.  If a person has an account with this financial institution, then in this case all financial transfers will be carried out without commission fees. </p><p>  According to reviews of Just2trade, withdrawal of money for the WebMoney or Yandex money system is not available to customers, but they can use alternative methods, including withdrawing money to a bank card.  The time limit for withdrawing funds from a trading account is established by the broker's regulations.  Trader reviews on this subject almost always have positive comments. </p><p>  Many newcomers and new customers do not know how to withdraw money with Just2trade.  To do this, you need to create an application from the "personal account", which indicates the amount of withdrawal and where (bank card or payment system) you want to make a transfer.  After its consideration (the deadlines are set by the rules of the company), it will be processed and the funds will be transferred to the selected wallet, bank account or card number.  With Just2trade, money is withdrawn within 3 days, but in most cases it‚Äôs faster, and delays are quite rare exceptions to the rules.  Such situations can arise almost exclusively due to technical problems that the broker quickly corrects. </p><h2>  Features of the "personal account" </h2><p>  On Just2trade in the "personal account" you can make any financial transactions.  For example, order a withdrawal of funds or replenish your trading account.  In addition to these functions, it gives the client access to all the opportunities that the company provides. </p><p>  The list of functions of your personal account: </p><ol><li>  Replenishment of a trading account. </li><li>  Withdrawal of funds. </li><li>  The history of financial transactions in the account. </li><li>  Access to the installation of trading terminals and trading platforms. </li><li>  Educational materials. </li><li>  Analytical data (economic calendar of events, auto-follow function, reviews, recommendations from experts). </li><li>  Signals for trading based on technical analysis. </li><li>  Investment tools for creating a portfolio. </li><li>  Access to the social network of traders. </li><li>  Contact technical support. </li><li>  Additional features. </li></ol><h2>  Trading platforms for trading in currency pairs </h2><div class="photo" data-original="wheretoinvest.money" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="just2trade online reviews" class="if uuid-2955321" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41139/2955321.jpg"></div><p>  The Finam brokerage company Just2Trade provides all customers with convenient and multifunctional trading floors.  All of them are divided depending on the direction of trading (for working with currency pairs or stocks, as well as a demo version for beginners). </p><p>  MetaTrader is the most popular <span>trading platform</span> for trading in currency pairs.  It is used by traders of varying degrees of preparation, both beginners and professionals.  MetaTrader is excellent not only for trading, but also for analytical forecasting of market movements and therefore it is also widely used among experts. </p><p>  On this platform, you can start trading without investments and use for this purpose a demo version on which any financial risks are completely excluded.  MetaTrader provides traders with a huge selection of a wide variety of tools: technical indicators, building channels, lines, shapes, areas, a strategy tester, trade statistics and much more.  On it, traders install markups, use the crosshair tool, and automated programs (robots and experts) that can be installed on the platform from third-party resources. </p><h2>  Stock Trading Platforms </h2><p>  Any trading platform recommended by a brokerage company can be used for a computer, as well as install the selected option on a laptop, tablet or phone.  As a result, the trader has the opportunity to engage in trade not only when he is at the computer, but also away from him, the main thing is that there is Internet access. </p><p>  In world markets, traders widely use the Rox platform, which has full functionality for trading.  If the client has opened a single trading account, then the version of the MMA application is suitable for him.  Its advantage is that it is also designed not only for computers, but can also be used in mobile trading as a web terminal, providing opportunities for trading through a browser. </p><p>  In addition, for trading with stocks, you can use MetaTrader5, which has several versions and an additional tool - the ‚Äúexchange glass of prices‚Äù, which reflects the positions of traders.  As well as clients of the Just2trade broker, they can trade on Transaq MMA. </p><p>  Although a rather large selection of different platforms is provided for customers, the Just2Trade + web terminal is the broker's main trading platform.  You can trade on it for free, and it has all the necessary tools.  According to reviews in Just2trade, online trading on this terminal meets all the expectations of traders, and the platform works without slipping and freezing price charts.  According to traders, it is best to use it in a Chrome browser. </p><h2>  Demo version </h2><div class="photo" data-original="forexanalytics.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="just2trade customer reviews" class="if uuid-2955381" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41139/2955381.jpg"></div><p>  Absolutely all traders initially use a demo account, and only then replenish the deposit and begin to engage in trading.  Demo version allows you to trade completely in a safe mode without any financial risks.  The fact is that all trading operations on it occur on bonus points, which are not real money.  As a result, in case of unsuccessful trading, the trader cannot receive any losses, however, as well as income. </p><p>  A demo account, unlike any type of Just2trade real, allows beginners to start a trader's career without investments.  To use this version, you just need to register on the site of a brokerage company.  You can practice at the demo and understand how the tools work on this platform, learn about what opportunities are available, test the trading strategy and the work of technical indicators. </p><p>  The demo is widely used not only by new customers, but also by professionals.  They need it to improve performance on trading methods and test new tools. </p><h2>  Opportunities for investors </h2><p>  All Just2trade clients can make not only speculative transactions, doing their own trading, but also be investors.  The most popular function among clients is ‚Äúauto follow-up‚Äù, which is called ‚Äúcopying deals‚Äù in other brokerage companies.  To use it, just replenish your trading account and connect to one of the managers, the rating of which can be seen on the Just2trade website. </p><p>  Advantages of auto-follow: </p><ol><li>  The function is available in automatic mode, that is, transactions are copied without investor participation. </li><li>  The ability to receive passive income. </li><li>  "Auto-follow" is available to all customers without restrictions. </li><li>  Investors have the opportunity to choose a manager using filters (profitability, drawdown percentage, risks, the lifetime of the manager‚Äôs investment account). </li><li>  No need to independently analyze and forecast quotes using various types of analytical data. </li><li>  An investor does not need to have in-depth knowledge of trading on exchanges, its fundamentals and patterns of trading. </li><li>  To obtain profit on transactions from the investor, independent trading is not required, since all operations are carried out by copying the opening and closing positions. </li></ol><p>  According to reviews of the Just2trade broker, the auto-follow function is very popular with both traders and investors. </p><h2>  Personal account: brokerage company analytics </h2><div class="photo" data-original="just2trade.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="just2trade personal account" class="if uuid-2955326" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41139/2955326.jpg"></div><p>  Each Just2trade client can connect the necessary functions for using analytical data from the "personal account".
