    <h2>  Who really needs a mobile? </h2><p>  Many parents sincerely wonder why clutter up the crib with unnecessary accessories.  The older generation, not used to modern diversity, takes such a toy especially sharply.  The problem can be solved if you ask the future granny to make a mobile phone with her own hands.  Having penetrated the task and creating it in a cooperative way, she will immediately change her point of view and take the side of her parents. </p><p>  Of course, first of all, the mother sets the mobile on the bed not for the child, but to a greater extent for herself.  The kid will do fine without him, because he is so small that he does not immediately understand what it is and why different figures flicker before his eyes.  Many generations of children have grown and developed perfectly without such a device, but there is absolutely no harm from it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Useful toy </h2><p>  Let's see if a child needs a mobile?  A little man, having been born, understands absolutely nothing in his environment.  The first few weeks of his life, he was not even able to distinguish between the people present nearby.  However, every day he becomes stronger, his reaction, perception intensifies and becomes more meaningful. </p>

Such options are most often without mechanical filling, they do not rotate, but the cute design, discreet colors, as well as the naturalness of the materials are their big pluses.  Having looked at the favorite toy for the crib in the store, you can make a similar mobile with your own hands. </p><h2>  How to make a mobile? </h2><p>  The device of a toy carousel is a simple and feasible task for everyone.  It consists of two main elements - the frame and movable elements.  Ready-made mobiles are equipped with a special mount, which is fixed to the side of the crib with the help of a clamping bolt or clamp.  It will not work out independently, but this does not mean that you should abandon the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmaking a <span>mobile on a bed</span> with your own hands. </p><p>  Almost all mothers decorate the baby's sleeping place with a canopy, it is suspended on the frame, a home-made mobile can be fixed to it.  Some prudent parents for this purpose hammer a special hook into the ceiling, on which the toy clings.  Such a height will make a unique multi-tier mobile that will attract the attention of a baby for a long time. </p><p>  Independently, the frame-cross or frame for the mobile can be made of wooden or plastic trims, fastening them together with glue or screws.  Toys themselves can be any.  The most important thing is that they are safe, do not contain small elements and toxic materials. </p><p>  It can be different figures, small soft toys, flowers.  You can buy them in advance at the store or make them yourself.  The most suitable material for crafts would be felt. </p>

There are different felt, differing in composition, thickness and color.  It can be made of natural wool and made of artificial material, mainly polyester.  The colors of felt are very diverse.  At the same time, in the palette there are not only primary colors, but also many shades.  To make a mobile phone on a bed with your own hands, or rather toys for it, it is very important to choose the right felt for crafts.  For small parts, it is best to use thin material, this will greatly facilitate the work with it.  Thick felt, more than 2 mm in thickness, is used for large products requiring stiffness. </p><p>  For the manufacture of felt, different compositions are used, often synthetic threads are mixed with natural raw materials to give the material strength.  Woolen and half-woolen species are better not to use in the manufacture of children's toys, because they can cause allergic reactions.  It is best to stay on felt from eco-polyester, experienced needlewomen advise taking Korean-made material, it works very well, pleasant to the touch and safe. </p><h2>  How to make a mobile felt? </h2><p>  Making a mobile home from felt is really very simple.  This material does not require special sewing skills, special equipment and skills.  Felt is absolutely loose, so products from it do not need to be processed in slices. </p>

    <p>  In order to make a mobile phone with your own hands, you need to think about what style the toy will be, develop templates for simple drawings and draw them on paper.  You should not use complex sketches.  The kid can tire of bright and overly artsy crafts.  On the mobile, various geometric shapes, flowers, stars, hearts, clouds will look great. </p><p>  When the patterns are ready, you need to use chalk to transfer them to a double folded fabric and cut along the contour.  It is customary to sew <span>felt crafts</span> on top, with straight stitches, using a contrasting thread for this.  To add volume to the toy, you can put a little cotton or filler from the pillow. </p><p>  When stitching parts, it is important not to forget to insert a thread that will be attached to the base of the mobile.  The length of the thread or cord must be measured and cut to the required number, depending on the height at which the mobile will be attached. </p>
