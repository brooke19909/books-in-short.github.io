    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel itself </h2><p>  On the whole, our compatriots were satisfied with the accommodation at the Park Inn By Radisson 4 * (Sharm El Sheikh).  So, according to them, the rooms here are very spacious, clean and bright.  Of course, they are not furnished as luxuriously as in five-star hotels, but all the furniture and appliances are in good working condition.  If you suddenly find a malfunction, then you should immediately contact the reception, and the problem will be quickly fixed.  As for cleaning, guests note that for Egypt it is quite high quality.  In addition, many guests noted that the cleaners almost every day built swan towels, flowers and other figures on beds from towels.  Especially this fact pleased the kids. </p><p>  Many tourists in their reviews note the huge and well-planned territory of the hotel.  According to them, there is everything you need for a great vacation - and several swimming pools with sun terraces and bars, and a water park with slides, where both children and adults, sports grounds, and a spa are happy to frolic and much more. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="park inn radisson resort 4 reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/980895.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Kitchen </h2><p>  As a rule, travelers rarely come to a consensus about food.  However <span>, the Park</span> Inn By Radisson 4 * <span>hotel</span> in this sense can be called a pleasant exception.  So, most of the guests were satisfied with the quality of food.  According to them, the choice of dishes here is quite diverse, and everything is prepared very tasty.  Many praise the grilled meat that cooks in the evenings on the street.  In addition, our compatriots say that there are dishes for every taste.  So, neither a child, nor a dieter, nor a seasoning lover will remain hungry.  There were no complaints about the quality of drinks either. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="park inn by radisson 4 charm" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/980894.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  According to our compatriots, despite the fact that the Park Inn Radisson Resort 4 * hotel, which we are reviewing, is on the second line, it‚Äôs very close to the sea.  So, walking to the beach can be reached in just 7 minutes.  In addition, a bus runs between the hotel and the sea all day.  A trip on it will take literally one minute.  So even older people and families with small children will be comfortable getting to the beach and then returning to the hotel.  You can enter the sea here either directly from the shore or from the pier.  In the second case, you will immediately find yourself next to a densely populated coral reef.  Therefore, in order to admire the amazing marine life, experienced travelers are advised to get a mask for snorkeling and preferably flippers.  In addition, guests recommend in the morning not to rush to the beach.  The fact is that in the morning there are often waves at sea, so swimming is prohibited.  After lunch, the sea calms down and you can have a great time.  As for the beach itself, despite the fact that it belongs to two hotels, our compatriots found it quite spacious.  According to them, sun loungers are always enough here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel park inn by radisson 4" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/980893.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Comments on entertainment at the hotel complex </h2><p>  According to tourists, you can have a good time not only on the beach, but also in the hotel itself.  So, our compatriots note that in the Park Inn By Radisson Sharm 4 * there are excellent pools.  Guests also liked that there is a rather large water park with a lot of water slides.  Both children and adults came here with pleasure. </p><p>  The whole day a team of animators works at the hotel.  However, as tourists from Russia and other CIS countries note, its representatives could not be called inventive.  So, according to them, the entertainment program was always the same.  This also applies to evening performances.  Here you should not count on the show of invited artists.  In addition, guests complained that the hotel did not have its own club, although there was a room for it.  So, if you want to visit a disco, then you can go to the city, accompanied by animators.  Tourists used this opportunity, however, according to them, it would be nice to organize a club in a hotel complex. </p><h2>  Staff Comments </h2><p>  As for the employees of Park In Bai Radisson, the guests had the most pleasant impression on them.  According to them, the staff here are very professional, friendly, friendly.  Our compatriots also liked the fact that many speak Russian.  So on vacation, you do not have to strain, remembering the English curriculum. </p>
