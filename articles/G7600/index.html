    <h2>  History </h2><p>  Prior to Spanish colonization, there was an Indian culture on the territory of Georgia, which completely disappeared by 1560. The Spaniards dominated here for some time, at the end of the 17th century, wars broke out with the British over the possession of this region. </p><p>  The British in 1724 established their rule over the region, declaring the establishment of a colony here.  Georgia was one of the main centers of loyalists in the War of Independence, and Confederates in the Civil War.  The first settlements here were founded in 1733 by General James Oglethorpe for religiously persecuted and poor English. </p><p>  Oglethorpe was able to defeat the Spanish troops who invaded the state of Florida in 1742. During the War of Independence, the inhabitants of the colony in 1775 seized the arsenal in Savannah, then sending weapons to the US Army.  They conducted partisan actions against the British troops, liberating Augusta twice, and as a result in 1782 forced the British to evacuate from Savannah. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="georgia usa" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23318/554562.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Of course, its highlight is the roller coaster.  In addition, such attractions as Daredevil and Goliath are especially popular, where adrenaline lovers can fully enjoy the feeling of a sharp vertical descent from a height of 95 meters. </p><p>  Of course, in this place there are enough other entertainments, among which one can highlight the Ferris wheel, the railway, a huge number of roundabouts, as well as the famous Monster Mansion, which can scare respectable citizens no less than a bearded gentleman who forgot a heavy suitcase in the subway.  Also interesting is the cable car above the Six Flags park.  It passes over the entire territory and allows you to enjoy its stunning views from above. </p><h2>  Okifinoki swamp </h2><p>  In the southeastern part of the state, on the border with Florida, there is the Okifinoki swamp, which is one of the most deaf and beautiful areas of the whole country.  Peatlands, which are covered with black shallow water, form a very rare ecosystem.  Here, since 1937, a nature reserve was organized, while since 1974 these swamps have become a National Monument of Nature. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alligator on the Ophinoki Swamp" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23318/554568.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Its main attraction is crocodiles.  Namely, the kind of American alligator.  On the Okifinoki swamp, they live in the eastern part of the US coast - from Texas to <span>North Carolina.</span>  Most American alligators live in <span>Louisiana</span> and Florida.  But since the Okifinoki swamp is located on the border between Florida and Georgia, the abundance of crocodiles here is understandable. </p><p>  In addition, the town of Dalonega gold miners, the Little White House in Warm Springs, the Marine Science Center, Fort Pulaski and about a thousand historic buildings, in addition to the Calloway Gardens, deserve attention. </p>
