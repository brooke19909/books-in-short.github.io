    <p>  The nature in this place of the Crimean peninsula is really amazingly beautiful.  The village is surrounded on all sides by mountains covered with evergreen trees and juniper.  In Simeiz itself, vines and palm trees grow everywhere, roses and famous Crimean peonies bloom. </p><h2>  What beaches you can visit in the village of Simeiz: reviews </h2><p>  Almost all vacationers who have ever come here are satisfied with the rest in this village.  Reviews, including about its beaches, are mostly positive.  Many note the fact that the coastline in the Crimea, and, in particular, in Simeiz, is very convenient for recreation.  Compared to Sochi, the beaches in this village are rather narrow and short.  But at the same time, they are much more picturesque. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are no paid beaches in Simeiz.  True, some of them are allowed only with a health record.  Only having this document in hand, for example, you can visit the beach "Simeiz" of the same boarding house.  But, of course, before a trip to the Crimea, running to the doctors is not necessary at all.  In Simeiz there are other places where you can comfortably and at the same time completely free and sunbathe and swim. </p><p>  There are only four public beaches in the village - citywide, Frigate, Coral and located next to the Assol Hotel.  All of them, without exception, are very popular among vacationers.  In addition to the usual, in Simeiz there is also a free, public <span>nudist beach.</span>  But, of course, due to the specifics, not too many tourists visit it. </p>

    <h2>  Citywide beach </h2><p>  The coastal zone in Simeiz is not only picturesque, but also very convenient for relaxation.  And almost everywhere.  However, most vacationers, of course, prefer to visit the village-wide beach.  Simeiz - the settlement is not too big.  Therefore, you can quickly get to the shared beach from almost anywhere.  The latter is located almost opposite the central part of the village, not far from Mount Diva. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The common beach of Simeiz has a crescent shape, as it is located in a small natural cove.  His area is quite large.  Rest here is very convenient.  True, the beach is covered not with soft sand, but with small pebbles.  However, there are practically no boulders on the coastline.  Going into the sea is also quite convenient. </p><p>  The common village beach is very well equipped.  If you wish, you can rent an umbrella and a sunbed.  A lot of sellers usually walk along the shore, offering drinks, corn, fruits, whites, etc. If you wish, you can also visit attractions on this beach.  Their set is quite standard: "pill", "banana", etc. </p>

    <p>  This beach could be called the best in Simeiz.  If not for one ‚Äúbut.‚Äù  Unfortunately, just a huge number of people visit it.  And especially at the peak of the season.  Long-coming vacationers in Simeiz advise newcomers to come here only in September, when the main influx of vacationers subsides. </p><h2>  Frigate Beach </h2><p>  Vacationers who prefer space should visit another place for swimming in Simeiz.  In the same bay as the common one, but at the other end of the ‚Äúsickle‚Äù, right at the foot of Mount Diva, is another very convenient village beach.  Simeiz (Crimea) is a rather confused town.  But if you want to find this beach, called "Frigate", it will be easy.  You can get to it along the Cypress Alley.  A path descends right from the middle of this picturesque street to the beach.  In one place it branches.  You need to go to the sea past the rotunda along the stairs through a pine-juniper park.  Near the pier, turn right. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In contrast to the general, the beach "Frigate" has a very small area.  During a storm, it is even completely flooded.  However, vacationers are much smaller, and the entrance to the water is somewhat more convenient.  With all this, the sea on the Fregat beach is simply amazing emerald color.  Even during a storm, there is no turbidity in the water in this part of the coastal zone of the village. </p>

    <p>  As in citywide, you can rent a deck chair and umbrella on Fregat Beach.  Buying corn or white meat is also not difficult.  In general, due to the relative desertedness and due to the availability of certain amenities, the majority of holidaymakers consider ‚ÄúFrigate‚Äù the best in Simeiz.  Often tourists (by location) call this beach "Diva".  Many people visit Simeiz precisely in order to spend their days on the beach in this beautiful place. </p><h2>  "Coral" </h2><p>  On the other (western) side of Mount Diva, also in a small bay in the village, is another picturesque beach.  Simeiz is a relatively inexpensive resort town.  And most of the beaches, as already mentioned, are available for visiting here, and at the same time are absolutely free.  However, this was not always the case.  Coral Beach has long been illegally privately owned.  And, therefore, the entrance of the "mere mortals" here was closed.  This place became available for visiting only in 2014. </p>

    <p>  You can get to the Coral beach from the farthest end of the <span>Cypress Alley</span> , which abuts Cat Mountain <span>.</span>  First you need to go along the building of the sanatorium to the gate, and then go down the stone narrow road to the sea. </p><p>  The length and width of the beach "Coral" is very small.  In the middle it is covered with small pebbles, and along the edges - large boulders (between which, fortunately, there are large gaps for passage).  The water here is as clear and emerald-clear as on Frigate Beach.  However, corn sellers do not go here.  It will not work and rent a deck chair here.  There is also no fresh water nearby.  So, going to the Coral beach, you should definitely take a plastic bottle with mineral water with you. </p><h2>  Nudist beach </h2><p>  This place in the village is also publicly available.  But, of course, only people deprived of any complexes should visit a <span>nudist beach</span> in Simeiz.  It is located directly under <span>the Cat Mountain.</span>  To get to him, you need to move along the road from Simeiz towards Katsiveli.  Having reached Lebedinki (approximately in the middle of Mount Cat), you should go down the path to the sea. </p><p>  It is a nudist beach, mostly a picturesque pile of boulders.  The coastal zone in this place does not differ by such a smooth surface as in the village itself. </p><h2>  Place near the Assol Hotel </h2><p>  There is another quite interesting, but at the same time semi-wild beach in the village.  Simeiz stretches along the sea for several kilometers.  All the above beaches are located in its western part.  In the east, for a more or less comfortable stay, only the coastline is located opposite the Assol Hotel.  Among vacationers vacationing in Simeiz, this beach is popular mainly for its low population.  You can stay here with relative convenience (on pebbles between large stones) at any time.  Sun loungers on this beach are not rented out, but merchants with food go along the shore. </p>

    <h2>  Rest in Simeiz: sights </h2><p>  Of course, in Simeiz, as in any other Black Sea resort, you can not only sunbathe and swim in the sea, but also attend various excursions.  Of the historical attractions in this village, vacationers will certainly be interested in the burial ground of the Taurus period, the ruins of the Limen-Isar fortress, as well as places of worship of the Hellenic period on Mount Diva. </p><p>  Near the village in the Blue Bay operates a water park.  In Simeiz itself, there is an old Soviet observatory, which once carried out observations of the moon.  In the evening, in the village you can go to a restaurant or visit the dance floor. </p>
