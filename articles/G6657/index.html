How to reset Samsung?  What are the ways?  First things first. </p><h2>  Tricky situation, or Again something with memory <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reset Samsung" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/331039.jpg" width="500"></div></h2><p>  From this place you should read carefully.  After all, the headline alerted you?  However, while your phone is reset in the standard way, the threatening consequences of ingenious methods are not scary for you.  But probably, such a phenomenon known to you as “glitches”, which you may have repeatedly noticed in the operation of your device, somehow you should have been alerted.  Therefore, information about the existing options for returning a “lost” phone will not be superfluous for you.  So, how to reset Samsung so that the phone does not suffer, and the “sound mind” in the device becomes clear?  You won’t believe it, but it’s elementary simple, and very little time will be spent. </p><h2>  Why does the phone start to “fail”? </h2><p>  With the compact size of the mobile device, the internal filling of the device is allocated extremely limited space.  The motherboard of the electronic device is literally “studded” with a variety of microcircuits, modules and parts.  Microelectronics is a rather complicated applied part of science.  Magnetic fields, potential differences, and many other factors of an electrical nature can be “causative agents” of symptoms of a phone malfunction.  Resetting Samsung is able to partially solve the problem situation associated with the partial inoperability of an individual means of communication.  More serious preventive actions can only be done by specialized centers, private workshops or self-taught with incredibly practical experience.  So what becomes the main reason for the sometimes protracted “fits” of our indispensable friends of communication? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung Reset Code" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/331053.jpg" width="200"></div>  Four main culprits of electronic “insanity” </h2><ul><li>  The first reason.  Mechanical damage resulting in the displacement of microcircuits and the breakdown of parts from the place of soldering. </li><li>  Probability number two.  Oxidation of motherboard components after exposure to liquid or condensate. </li><li>  Option Three.  Systematic overloading of the phone’s flash memory and extremely intensive operation of the device: frequent battery juggling (SIM card replacement), incorrect disconnection with service programs. </li><li>  The most dirty culprit at number four is a virus that infiltrated God knows how! </li></ul><h2>  Universal Samsung Reset Code </h2><p>  So, sometimes a certain combination of numbers is quite capable of dealing with temporarily “glitches” of the phone.  But it’s important to understand what characters and numbers you enter and what they are intended for.  Sometimes an incorrectly used service command can completely destroy not only user settings, but also the entire software part of the device.  Therefore, before using the kindly provided code, make sure the source is reliable.  And now about the main thing.  The first service team presented is not always productive, however, your device may fall under a successful percentage of performance, especially if the year of manufacture is not the first, so to speak, freshness.  Type on the keyboard of your “Samsung” - * 2767 * 2878 # and press the “call” key.  The device should reboot.  But a partial or complete loss of information stored in the mobile memory is possible.  Therefore, if technically possible, keep at least the phone book.  Otherwise, if you absolutely need the integrity of subscriber contacts, it would be more advisable to contact a specialized workshop.  There is another code that can tear the electronic organism out of nonexistence, this is * 2767 * 3855 #.  This set of numbers will probably produce a complete reset of the Samsung device, as it is effective in use for most devices of the Korean manufacturer. </p><h2>  What if my Samsung is Android? <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung Galaxy Y Reset" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/331037.jpg" width="216"></div></h2><p>  If the standard functions of the smartphone and the service code * 2767 * 3855 # applied have not taken effect, the settings provided for in the Samsung Galaxy Y system itself can be reset using a fairly effective method. </p><ol><li>  Clamp three keys of the device, and in the described sequence: first, the “volume +” button, then “Home” (central navigation) and close the sequence chain with the “on” button. </li><li>  After the phone opens the “Recovery” menu, select “Reboot system now” and press “Home”.  After a reboot, you can assume that the phone is just from the store. </li></ol><p>  You can be congratulated!  Now you know not only several ways to restore your “prodigal” phone, but also become the owner of valuable information.  Perhaps you will have the opportunity to prove your user competence and help someone at a time of overwhelming difficulties for him. </p>
