A complimentary tea set is provided.  The rooms are equipped with modern appliances and necessary furniture, there is a bathroom and a bath.  The comfort of your stay is achieved through installed air conditioning.  Meals are provided in the dining room.

There, for a relatively small cost, they will receive quite comfortable living and recreation conditions.  As a rule, most small hotels are located in the central part of the city, close to historical and cultural attractions. </p><p>  The hostel accommodation option is suitable only for the most demanding category of tourists.
