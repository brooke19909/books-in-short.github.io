    <h2>  Biography of a businessman </h2><p>  And we will start with the biography of Ismagil Shangareev.  His birthplace is the Orenburg region, the city of Buguruslan.  Date of birth - November 30, 1956.  After some time, the family moved to Rostov-on-Don.  The father of the hero of our material served as an imam.  Perm became the next city where the Shangareyev found themselves.  After graduating from school, Ismagil Kalyamovich Shangareev entered the technical school of Soviet trade.  He subsequently graduated from three higher education institutions.  Then there was military service.  After returning to Buguruslan in 1978, he created a private recording studio.  This turned out to be the first business opened by Shangareyev.  In the 90s, he took up construction.  In the 2000s, the family moved to Moscow. </p><h2>  Ismagil Shangareyev and moving to OJSC </h2><p>  2006 year.  A law was published in OAO, based on which foreigners had the right to purchase real estate in this state.  Real estate agency - a <span>successful businessman</span> was the first to open a <span>business</span> here.  Later, Ismagil Shangareev began to implement the project of the restaurant "Kazan".  According to the businessman‚Äôs initial idea, this establishment should have become a place where you can negotiate with business partners in a convenient and comfortable environment.  Over time, the restaurant became popular.  Both tourists and locals fell in love with him.  Gradually, the institution has become a successfully functioning network.  Here you can taste Russian and Tatar cuisine.  Visitors will be fed with the famous Russian borsch, Tatar noodle soup (it is cooked on chicken broth), dumplings and meatballs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Why was this state chosen to be the place of residence?  The long-standing dream of Ismagil Shangareev has always been to move to the state with the right device, a warm climate and a comfortable life in every way.  It was the Emirates that became such a place for him.  Moscow and Kazan, as before, he relates to his beloved cities, life in which is associated with its nuances and difficulties.  The advantages of living in the UAE are the businessman's warm climatic conditions, the presence of security and the absence of a tax system.  At the same time, you can get from Dubai to Moscow in four hours by plane, you can also fly to Kazan without any problems.  And these are important points for any successful businessman. </p>

    <p>  Of course, living in another country is fraught with some difficulties, such as finding a job, applying for a visa.  The hero of our material also went through them.  But with a patient and persistent attitude to all the differences from Russian reality, one can become happy here, as Ismagil Kalyamovich believes. </p><h2>  Secrets of success according to Shangareev </h2><p>  The first component of any success is the appeal to the help of the Almighty.  Moreover, doubts about his power should never arise.  The second point is the love of one's own business.  Since only thanks to this the dream will become a clear goal, and nothing will prevent the opening of roads to it.  The third is the support of family and friends. </p><h2>  Family and Children </h2><p>  Ismagil Shangareev is married.  He and his wife have eleven children and seven grandchildren, so the businessman is always surrounded by a large and friendly family.  Those chores that children bring, Shangareev perceives with joy.  Indeed, in his opinion, for any parent, especially if he is rich and successful, the most important thing is to take care of the education of future heirs. </p>
