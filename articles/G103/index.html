The definition of this phenomenon and its designating concept gives sociology, as well as social science.  The last science in this matter has the most significant weight, since it is society that is the subject of its study.  Unlike all other sciences, it purposefully considers all possible aspects of society.  Other sciences distinguish only one specific side of the phenomenon. </p><p>  However, we will focus on the idea that sociology gives us, since in our article we are going to consider the question: "What are the main features of society?"  - as well as some related aspects.  They will help us to more consciously operate with this concept and in general will be useful for expanding knowledge in this area. </p>

    <h2>  A look at the concept of society </h2><p>  Here are some data from sociology that reflect the essence of society.  So, this science considers the concept from two main sides, respectively, presenting diverse meanings.  We will talk about each separately, while touching upon the distinguishing features of society. </p><h2>  Historical and economic aspect </h2><p>  The first side of the study is the consideration of society, taking into account historical, economic, geographical and political factors.  In accordance with this aspect of society, they are identified as structures larger than just groups of people or communities. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Most often, such very specific species as primitive, slaveholding, feudal, and others stand out in such a way.  They differ in common <span>cultural values, the</span> level of technological development, and <span>moral values.</span> </p>

    <p>  When considering the same, historical and economic aspect, the societies formed on the territory of a certain country or continent are distinguished.  This is the Russian, and the American, and the western world as a whole, and the eastern. </p><p>  Based on the above facts, we summarize this block of information by the definition: society is a system limited in time and territory.  Any era with its values ‚Äã‚Äãand level of technological development is such a society. </p><h2>  Key features </h2><p>  The scientist E. Shills gives us a number of signs by which society stands out on the basis of their considered forming factors: </p><p>  - as an integrated functioning <span>structure (society is</span> not included in any major systems); </p><p>  - has its own clearly defined territory; </p><p>  - has a name, a history of education and development; </p><p>  - the replenishment and growth of society occurs at the expense of human resources, which are its representatives (with rare exceptions); </p><p>  - as a sign, complementary to the previous one, - representatives of one association enter into marriage; </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  - there is a functioning own management system; </p><p>  - characterized by the presence of common <span>values</span> for the representatives of the <span>system of values,</span> norms, traditions that form the culture; </p><p>  - the existence of society is necessarily longer than the life expectancy of an individual representative. </p>

    <p>  Features of society, according to authoritative domestic sociologists, are as follows: </p><ul><li>  territory - it also plays the role of the main material base for the existence and development of social relations; </li><li>  autonomy - self-sufficiency, allowing to exist without economic and other ties with other societies; </li><li>  integrativity - the unification of all individuals in the process of social life, the maintenance and reproduction of generations; </li><li>  universality - the all-encompassing <span>nature of the structure</span> (for participating individuals). </li></ul><p>  We proceed further to the next concept of society, presented in sociological research. </p>

    <h2>  Sociological and philosophical aspect </h2><p>  So, we have already learned what are the main features of society in accordance with the economic and geographical aspect of the study.  It is time to consider the second aspect of the study of this topic in sociology. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The second meaning of society is purely sociological and philosophical, if we consider it as a whole.  In studies of this direction, sociology relies on the results of practical observations and experiments on smaller structures - small communities (families, clans, peoples).  A peculiar hierarchy of structures is being built, from the smallest to the largest.  As a result, we obtain a functional unity of communities. </p>

    <p>  Considering the various institutions of society from this practical point of view, sociology touches on the problems of the universe - the origin of society, the common goal of its existence.  Each society has its own such story.  So, the American theory of "beginning of beginnings" takes some of the founding fathers as a basis.  Reflections on this topic by sociologists from the time of the Soviet Union revolve around the October Revolution of 1917. </p><p>  We summarize briefly what was said in the framework of the sociological aspect: society is the largest <span>social group that</span> embraces all the others, making them part of it.  We continue to consider the question of what are the main features of society. </p><h2>  <span>Signs of society</span> in a sociological context </h2><p>  Sociological researcher R. K√∂nig attributes the following attributes to society: </p><ul><li>  a specific lifestyle of individuals; </li><li>  economic and ideological associations formed on the basis of agreements; </li><li>  the presence of social unity (various peoples); </li><li>  the integrity of social unity, i.e.  smaller structures; </li><li>  historical background of the formation and development of this particular concrete society; </li><li>  social reality - processes in which the relationships of individuals are tied. </li></ul><h2>  Some fundamental properties </h2><p>  Prior to this, we have already examined two aspects of the study of sociology, and mentioned some forms of society as examples.  We also learned about the signs inherent in society when studying from the economic and sociological sides.  Now we consider it expedient to dwell on some of its most important properties.  To those in sociology are attributed autonomy and self-sufficiency. </p>

    <h2>  Autonomy and self-sufficiency as properties </h2><p>  Earlier we only briefly mentioned the property of the autonomy of the structure of society.  Now more about this. </p><p>  The ability of society to exist separately from others, to support the functioning of smaller structures that are part of its structure, is autonomy.  This property, at first glance, somewhat fades into the background in the conditions of total globalization of absolutely all world processes at the moment.  However, this is a misleading impression: the strengthening of international contacts has some signs that autonomy is not becoming so obvious, but this process is of a completely different kind. </p><p>  A vivid confirmation of the autonomy of societies, which include the population of the countries of the world, is the presence of their own systems of power in them.  Within countries, there are smaller communities of people who, according to the principle of hierarchy, enter society as a whole. </p><p>  Studying further the institutions of society, let us say a few words about self-sufficiency.  Self-sufficiency is a property inherent in the people of a particular country, providing the opportunity to exist completely in isolation from all other societies.  After the division of labor (production specialization) took place between the territories of the world, no country is self-sufficient.  Modern societies have a new inalienable quality - complementarity for economic reasons. </p>

    <h2>  Other properties </h2><p>  An important part of any society is its cultural mass.  This concept includes many phenomena; there is no need to consider them within the framework of our topic.  We will only say that on the basis of common traditions, self-awareness, and moral values ‚Äã‚Äãof individuals, a cultural society is being formed.  Its formation is preceded by a rich history. </p><p>  Smaller communities are capable of fulfilling their functions in a single system of the country's society independently.  This is the main manifestation of the self-regulatory property. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  As a conclusion, we conclude: society and its features are considered in sociology in various aspects.  This takes into account economic, geographical, historical, cultural and other factors.  Modern societies appear mainly in the form of countries and their populations.  Their most important properties are autonomy and self-sufficiency. </p><p>  Thus, we figured out the question of what are the main features of society that shape it as a phenomenon.  We hope that the information received will be useful for a conscious look at modern society. </p>
