  <section class="page js-page"><h1>History of Gagarin Square in Moscow</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Leninsky Prospekt leads into the center of Moscow to the Kremlin from Vnukovo Airport, it was here in April 1961 that the happy Muscovites welcomed the first Soviet cosmonaut.  The first manned space flight rejoiced throughout Moscow.  Gagarin Square appeared on Leninsky Prospekt in memory of this event in April 1968.  Later, the titanium monument to the astronaut became the main dominant on it. </p><h2>  Square named after the first cosmonaut </h2><p>  On the modern Gagarin Square, Leninsky Prospekt, 60th Anniversary Avenue (formerly Cheryomushkinsky) and Kosygina Street (formerly Vorobyevskoye Shosse) merge on the way to the center of Moscow.  The architecture of the square was formed in the late fifties and early sixties of the twentieth century, when the "Stalinist" houses surrounding it were built.  From Gagarin Square begins and goes far to the south of South-Western Administrative Okrug of Moscow, its northern part belongs to the Don region of Southern Administrative Okrug. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.inmoskau.de" data-author=": georgepro, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to Yu. A. Gagarin" class="if uuid-2573235" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94033/2573235.jpg"></div><p>  In 1980, the square acquired its main symbol - a monument to the first cosmonaut by sculptor Bondarenko.  A titanium alloy was chosen as the material, the development of which was attended by specialists from the Institute of Aviation Materials.  The monument became the first large titanium monument in the world, its height together with the pedestal - more than forty meters, weight - 12 tons.  The monument was inaugurated in July 1980, on the eve of the Moscow Summer Olympics. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Road junction </h2><p>  Even during the construction of Leninsky Prospekt, the ways of the <span>small ring of the Moscow</span> Railway were removed underground, but for almost fifty years only rare trains ran under the area.  In 2001, the tunnel of the third ring of Moscow under Gagarin Square was put into operation, connecting Leninsky Prospekt with the TTK.  Later, the interchanges were reconstructed with Kosygina Street and the avenue of the 60th anniversary of the October Revolution. </p><div class="photo" data-original="misterburton.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Metro &quot;Leninsky Prospekt&quot;" class="if uuid-2573287" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94033/2573287.jpg"></div><p>  The metro station "Leninsky Prospekt", at that time the last along the highway (the line went towards Profsoyuznaya street), was opened in 1962.  During the construction of the station, it was possible to organize a transition to another metro line, the project of which was not implemented.  The main transport on Gagarin Square for decades were trolleybuses and buses. </p><p>  In 2016, after the construction of the MCC was completed, the metro station of the same name was opened near the square.  "Gagarin Square" is the only central ring station located underground.  The transition between the ‚ÄúGagarin Square‚Äù MCC and the ‚ÄúLeninsky Prospekt‚Äù of the orange branch is one of the most convenient city electric trains on the entire ring, with an average of fifty thousand citizens using it per day. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Academy of Sciences </h2><p>  In 1990, after almost twenty years of construction, the complex of the Presidium <span>of the USSR Academy of Sciences</span> firmly fit into the appearance of the square and the surrounding space <span>.</span>  The construction near the slopes of the Sparrow (then Lenin) mountains, prone to landslides, required additional time and the development of new technical solutions. </p><p>  Logically constructed in the area where a large number of academic institutions are located, the building attracts attention primarily with its architecture.  The construction in the upper part of the building, which beautifully reflects the sun's rays, was called by the Muscovites ‚Äúgolden brains‚Äù. </p><div class="photo" data-original="oliverlins.com" data-author=": Oliver Lins, "><img itemprop="image" alt="The building of the Academy of Sciences" class="if uuid-2573052" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94033/2573052.jpg"></div><p>  An observation deck near the building is popular with fans to watch fireworks.  It offers a beautiful view of the Luzhniki Stadium and into the distance - the Moscow City complex.  The restaurant with panoramic views also works in the building itself, on the 22nd floor.  From its viewing platform, the whole of Moscow is visible: Gagarin Square, Leninsky Prospekt, City, the Kremlin, the city‚Äôs waterway - the Moscow River, the greenery of the Sparrow Hills, the lights of highways. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  In the days of the USSR, famous shops were located along the perimeter of Gagarin Square - Fabric and shoe houses, a shop for household and related products "1000 little things", and a Sputnik deli.  At present, trade enterprises have become less large-scale, but the sale of food, fabrics and accessories, household goods and other necessary trifles in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãGagarin Square in Moscow is still developed. </p>
