It is located near the Don capital.  This is a beautiful place, located in the village of Samara, Rostov region, - Blue Lake. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="47.19520000000001" data-lng="39.769999900000016" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/2/4/8/3/2483.png"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Blue Samara Lake in the Rostov Region is one of the favorite vacation spots of citizens.  Amazingly beautiful nature attracts here: flowers, greenery, golden sand and clear blue water. </p><p>  The lake itself was formed in a rather deep sand quarry.  It is filled with the waters of numerous cold springs, therefore, the water in it is transparent and quite cool even in the hottest summer months.  Its visibility is about 5 m in depth. </p><p>  The shores of the reservoir are quite steep in places.  From the side of the village there is a shallow entrance to the lake, a sandy beach;  from the direction of Rostov-on-Don - steep and steep, and the soil surface is unstable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yanval.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Picturesque landscapes of the Blue Lake" class="if uuid-2412642" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2412642.jpg"></div><h2>  Pros and cons </h2><p>  Very beautiful surrounding landscapes, clear water and golden sand - all this can be attributed to the advantages of relaxing on the lake.  It should be noted that, unlike many other bodies of water, there have been no complaints about this lake and the sanitary and epidemiological surveillance in recent years.  So, you can safely spend time on it with families with children. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Proximity to settlements can be attributed to both pluses and minuses.  Residents of the entire Rostov <span>region</span> come here <span>.</span>  <span>Samara Lake is</span> sometimes filled with people so much that it is impossible to drive to its shore by car.  Therefore, all beach equipment (water, food, umbrellas, rugs, pools for babies, etc.) must be carried in hands.  The disadvantages include the fact that there is practically no shadow on the beach.  If you are going to relax on a free beach, you should definitely bring along a sunscreen and an umbrella. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yanval.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Deep waters of the lake" class="if uuid-2412647" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2412647.jpg"></div><h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  Lake Samara, Rostov region has two beaches, on each of which there are almost always a lot of people.  But vacationers love the free beach more, although it does not have any conditions for protection from the sun.  There are no trees there either.  The banks are steep in places, rather high and unreliable.  And it‚Äôs dangerous to stand on them, and you should not swim to them in boats.  On machines for the same reason, it is better not to drive close to the edge of the cliffs - this is very dangerous. </p><p>  Paid beach of Samara Lake in the Rostov Region is well-maintained and fenced in places.  It is equipped with sun loungers, deck chairs and parasols.  On its territory there is a cafe with soft drinks, a platform for playing beach volleyball and several inflatable slides.  Garbage is regularly collected on the beach. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.podslushano-goroda.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Blue Lake" class="if uuid-2412620" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2412620.jpg"></div><h2>  Fishing </h2><p>  A huge number of vacationers on the lake does not allow fishermen to enjoy their favorite pastime.  Nevertheless, the pond is quite popular among fishing enthusiasts.  Outside the beach season, fishermen are often seen here throughout the year.  It is advisable to do this from a boat, because from the shore the fish is not very well caught.  Locals say that only large carp can be caught from large fish.  The main catch is perch. </p><p>  Carp weighing up to 1 kg and rudd are well caught on a fishing rod with a float.  The best time for fishing on the Blue Samara Lake in the Rostov Region is the period autumn - spring, when there are no swimmers. </p><p>  There are tales among local residents about a giant perch allegedly caught on this lake, whose length was more than 50 cm. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.podslushano-goroda.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The steep shore of the Blue Lake" class="if uuid-2412623" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2412623.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get there? </h2><p>  Samara Lake in the Rostov Region is located only 40 km from the regional city.  From Rostov-on-Don you need to go in the direction of Krasnodar on the M4 highway.  From the traffic police post you need to turn right and continue along the asphalt road to the first intersection.
