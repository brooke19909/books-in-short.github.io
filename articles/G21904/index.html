    <h2>  Pimrada Hotel: traveler reviews </h2><p>  Even if you consider yourself an unassuming person and do not plan to spend a lot of time while traveling abroad at a hotel, you will surely still want to live in a comfortable room with comfortable furniture.  Not to be mistaken in choosing a hotel will help you study the reviews of those people who have already stayed in the place you are interested in.  After all, they can share their opinions on the real advantages and disadvantages of a particular hotel, based on their own experience.  Today we invite you to find out what impressions our compatriots had on their stay at Pimrada Hotel in Phuket.  Immediately, we note that the vast majority of tourists in their choice were not disappointed.  A confirmation of this is the rating of the hotel, based on the ratings of its guests.  So, it is 4.5 of the maximum possible five points. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pimrada hotel phuket" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1239616.jpg" width="600"></div>

So, according to tourists, the hotel is really far from the sea.  On the way to the nearest Patong Beach, guests take about 15-20 minutes.  However, the path passes by the Jung Ceylon shopping center and Bangla Road, where you can buy something, have a snack, have a look at a bar, etc. There is also a market not far from the hotel where you can buy fresh fruits and seafood.  In the vicinity of Pimrada there are also massage parlors, supermarkets, souvenir shops, scooter and car rental points and much more.  As our compatriots note, if you are accustomed to outdoor activities, then this hotel is perfect for you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pimrada hotel reviews" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1239614.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Housing stock </h2><p>  Most of the guests in general were satisfied with the 3 * rooms offered by Pimrada Hotel.  However, many tourists pay attention to the fact that the standard type apartments do not have windows.  For some, this may be a plus (no noise from the street is heard, saving), but for someone this situation is not at all suitable.  Therefore, consider this fact in advance so as not to experience disappointment during your vacation.  Moreover, you are unlikely to be able to change the standard deluxe room even with a surcharge already in place, since the hotel is in great demand among tourists, and there are almost never any free apartments here. </p><p>  In general, according to vacationers, the rooms in Pimrada are quite spacious, bright, with fresh repairs, new furniture and modern appliances.  Everything works without interruption.  And if some kind of breakdown happens, then after a message at the reception, hotel staff will quickly fix all the malfunctions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pimrada hotel patong 3" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1239617.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  When booking a room in the hotel in question, you can immediately pay for breakfast for the entire stay.  However, judging by the reviews, many tourists prefer the option that does not provide any food.  If you still chose breakfast, then they will be held in the hotel cafe in the buffet format.  The choice of dishes here, of course, cannot be called very diverse, but in order to eat in the morning this is quite enough.  So, for breakfast you will be offered fried eggs, stewed vegetables, pasta, rice, bacon, sausages, nuggets, fresh fruits and vegetables, cereals, toasts, tea and coffee. </p><p>  During the day, you can also eat in the hotel's cafe for an additional fee or in the many cafes in the neighborhood.  According to our compatriots, here they cook very tasty almost everywhere, and the prices are quite reasonable.  Also, many enjoy visiting the local market, where you can buy fresh seafood, which you will immediately cook for a very small surcharge.  Experienced tourists are advised not to bypass the shingles (mobile food stalls). </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  As already noted, at least a quarter of an hour will have to walk to the nearest Patong Beach from Pimrada Hotel (Phuket).  Moreover, the sea in this part of Phuket, according to many travelers, is not very clean.  Therefore, most tourists prefer to visit other beaches of the island (Kata, Karon, Paradise and others).  You can get to them by taxi or tuk-tuk.  However, this is not cheap.  Therefore, many vacationers prefer to rent a motobike.  In this case, you will receive complete freedom of movement in Phuket and will be able to independently visit all its beaches and attractions, while saving a lot of money. </p>
