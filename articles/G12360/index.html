  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Denizli in Turkey: mountains or the sea?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There are a lot of attractions in Denizli; they are somehow connected with the history of the city and the whole of Turkey.  In total there are about forty excursion routes.  Below will be highlighted the ten most popular and interesting, where it is better to go with a child in Turkey (Denizli). </p><h2>  Gate of Domitian </h2><p>  The first thing tourists are offered to visit in the Turkish city is the gates of Domitian.  They are named after the emperor, who ruled in the distant 82-83 years.  They were erected under the leadership of Sextis Frontin, he once served as an Asian proconsul.  These gates were central, and through them all high-ranking officials entered ancient Hierapolis.  They are decorated in the best traditions of antiquity: words praising the emperor were carved from stone blocks and on the walls by hand, they can be read now.  This gate opens onto a beautiful street named after the proconsul.  Once this kilometer-long street was richly lined with curly slabs, and majestic columns stood along its entire length. </p><h2>  Carpet factory </h2><p>  Many tourists are very interested to see the local production of the Turkish city.  To do this, it is proposed to visit the carpet factory.  It is not necessary to go there in order to purchase a product, just the process of creating a real Turkish carpet is fascinating.  Wool and natural silk are the main components of production.  The process of creating a carpet is shown to everyone.  Here you can see the yarn, and learn how to dye the threads correctly, and how to distinguish original Turkish carpets from fakes in the future.  For example, a Turkish carpet will never be with a floral print, only geometric patterns are respected.  Other ornaments make a replica of Iranian traditional carpets from the product. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.covingtontravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey Denizli Attractions" class="if uuid-2561511" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87864/2561511.jpg"></div><p>  For those who still think about buying already on an excursion, there are also several subtleties.  Firstly, the quality of the pile.  On the carpet should not be bald spots, bumps and other imperfections.  Secondly, you need to grab wet wipes.  If you wipe the dried carpet with a napkin, there should be no stains on it. </p><h2>  Northern baths </h2><p>  Another popular <span>attraction of Turkey</span> (Denizli) is the Northern Baths.  This oldest complex was built in the interval between the second and third centuries of our era.  From time to time, most of the buildings, of course, collapsed, but there is still something to see.  They are located closer to the Necropolis.  Outside, the building still pleases with its endurance, but inside most of the partitions simply fell apart.  By the fifth century, the baths were replaced by a church building, which also suffered from time.  For hundreds of tourists who come to this place, it is interesting to live, reflecting the ancient foundations of Turkey. </p><h2>  University of Pamukkale </h2><p>  The next architectural value of Denizli (Turkey) is the University of Pamukkale.  This educational institution is not as old as the rest of the buildings.  It was built in 1992, allotting for this purpose a large area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe southern outskirts of the city of Denizli.  He is active, and about 45 thousand students study there.  There is a wide variety of faculties, such as the school of design, engineering, sports, modern technology and other things, there are also six schools with a narrow focus. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="walkingthetext.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="turkish cities" class="if uuid-2561509" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87864/2561509.jpg"></div><h2>  Mosque named after Abu Bakr al-Siddik </h2><p>  Turkey (Denizli) simply does not appear without numerous mosques.  In Denizli there is a mosque Abu Bakr al-Siddik.  It is decorated in Persian style.  Unfortunately, it is not known exactly when the building was erected, but historians claim that nothing has changed in its construction since the moment of construction.  Also, finishing work was not carried out, so everyone can enjoy the pristine beauty. </p><p>  Abu Bakr was famous for his intellectual abilities, and after the adoption of Islam, his position only strengthened.  Therefore, in honor of him, this small mosque was built with one minaret. </p><h2>  Martyr St. Philip </h2><p>  A lesser-known but interesting building is the martyrdom of St. Philip.  It was erected in memory of people who fell for faith and freedom.  It is named after the follower of Christ, the apostle Philip, who was crucified back in 87 AD in the same place.  This is a historical Christian building that is revered even today.  A steep ravine, dilapidated steps are not the easiest terrain to travel.  But after passing these obstacles, a view of the beautiful domes of the church and the fifth-century building opens. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Denizli mountain slopes" class="if uuid-2561514" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87864/2561514.jpg"></div><h2>  Kirishkhan Mosque </h2><p>  Another popular shrine of a small but religious city is the Kirishkhan mosque.  It can be considered a relatively new architectural structure, because it was built in 1975.  National motifs, white marble and numerous ornaments - all this indicates belonging to the Turkish style.  Arched windows and bunk domes perfectly emphasize the exquisite facade.  Inside, everything is no less attractive.  The octagonal chapel is especially beautiful.  Here are floral ornaments, a generously decorated large chandelier and painting with sayings from the Koran.  The second floor contains numerous Muslim literature and valuable religious relics. </p><h2>  Salda Lake </h2><p>  One of the natural monuments is Lake Salda.  It is located near Mount Esler.  Its area is about 45 km <sup>2</sup> .  It belongs to the deepest lakes of all Turkey - 185 meters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="traveladdicts.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where in Turkey it is better to go with a child" class="if uuid-2561513" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87864/2561513.jpg"></div><p>  Here you can once again enjoy the primitive beauty of ancient places, since there was no human intervention in nature.  These black pines and an animal-rich forest are created by nature itself.  The most interesting thing here is not only beauty, but also the natural characteristics that have indicators similar to the planet Mars.  Therefore, since 1989, the natural monument has been protected. </p><h2>  Frontina Street </h2><p>  Frontina Street was mentioned above, but it is worth paying special attention to it, analyzing its historical value separately from the gates of Domitian.  All guests of Hierapolis once passed and passed on it.  It can rightly be called a prospect because of its impressive size: more than a kilometer long and 14 meters wide.  Throughout its length, it is covered with plates and monuments of architecture.  Now they are not so pronounced, most are dilapidated, but their facades still remind of ancient Turkey. </p><p>  Tourists will be interested to visit the open exhibition located on the Denizli - Pamukkale highway.  It is a place behind the fence, covered with a white awning.  A stone workshop is located on site.  A variety of works, of any complexity and style, are made of stone there.  Therefore, you can not only enjoy contemporary art, but also purchase any product. </p>
