Having mastered this technique, you can please yourself and your loved ones with stylish and fashionable things.  In the article, we will consider what sizes of knitting needles are. </p><h2>  Classification </h2><p>  Much of the type of knitting needles depends on which knitting will result and how the process of making things will go.  Tools can be divided into four main types: </p><ol><li>  Straight knitting needles are best suited for making even webs.  They are always sold in pairs and are equipped with stops at the ends. </li><li>  Circular devices are used for knitting in a circle or for the manufacture of cloth.  They are two straight small-sized knitting needles connected by a flexible cord. </li><li>  Hosiery is a few (usually 4-5) short, straight knitting needles of the same length and thickness.  They are designed for knitting socks and stockings. </li><li>  Auxiliary knitting needles - used to knit individual parts, for example, pockets, fingers on gloves or complex decorative ornaments.  They look like short, curly tools. </li></ol><h2>  How to choose? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="circular knitting needles" class="if uuid-3170435" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3170435.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, you can try to knit everything in one single pair of knitting needles.  However, this will require many times more time, effort and patience and certainly will not bring pleasure.  Therefore, having decided on the product that you want to make, you need to choose the right size for knitting needles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For beginner needlewomen, it is recommended to try to knit the simplest things, for example, a scarf or snood.  Having mastered the technique of needlework, proceed to more complex products: hat, socks, cardigan or sweater.  Thus, it will be possible to work with all kinds of knitting needles. </p><p>  If you plan to knit a scarf or snood, it is important to decide on a specific model.  For a regular straight product, ordinary straight knitting needles are suitable.  If you want to master the technique of circular knitting, it is better to choose the appropriate knitting needles with a fishing line length of at least 80 cm. By the way, the same devices are also best suited for the cap, while the cord should be shorter - from 40-60 cm. </p><p>  For knitting socks, it is definitely worth buying stocking knitting needles, most often they need five.  Although they perform such products in different ways. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.imoda.gr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="four-knitting" class="if uuid-3170418" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3170418.jpg"></div><p>  And finally, the manufacture of bulk products such as a sweater, skirts and dresses, as well as knitting with large-sized knitting needles, will require a whole set of knitting needles.  It all depends on the style and complexity of the ornament.  A straight skirt without pockets can also be knitted with two knitting needles, circular fittings will be needed to trim the sleeves and neck of the dress, and auxiliary tools cannot be dispensed to knit decorative elements. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Choose size </h2><p>  Having decided on the type of knitting needles, it is equally important to choose their correct size for the yarn used.  If this is not done, you can simply ruin the product.  If the devices are too thick, then the knitting pattern will turn out to be loose and almost imperceptible.  Very thin knitting needles will make the fabric stiff and tight.  In both cases, the product will turn out ugly, and time wasted.  This can be avoided by selecting a tool by number. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tr.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting needles" class="if uuid-3170446" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3170446.jpg"></div><p>  This parameter is determined by thickness.  For example, if the size is indicated by the number "2", then the thickness of the spoke is 2 mm.  In order to choose the right fixtures for a particular type of yarn, it is important to consider both of these numbers.  The best option for determining the size of knitting needles is one when the number of the tool is one more than the corresponding parameter of the yarn.  For example, a knitting thread has a marking equal to 3 mm.  Therefore, the spoke must have a thickness of 4 mm. </p><p>  There is one more important nuance.  If you use an unusual type of yarn (down, with pile, sequins), then the knitting needles should be 2-3 mm more than the thickness of the thread.  Such a trick will allow you to get a more elegant product. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Spokes length </h2><p>  This parameter is also of great importance.  The most requested knitting lengths: </p><ul><li>  straight lines - 25, 36 cm; </li><li>  double-edged - 18, 25 cm; </li><li>  circular with a cord length of 40, 60, 80, 90 cm; </li><li>  flexible - 45 cm. </li></ul><p>  Among the spokes of non-standard length distinguish: </p><div class="photo" data-original="knitfreedom.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting for large sizes" class="if uuid-3170441" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3170441.jpg"></div><ul><li>  straight lines - 18 cm; </li><li>  double-edged - 36 cm; </li><li>  circular - 29 cm. </li></ul><p>  The length of the tool is selected depending on the product to be manufactured.  The more voluminous it is, for example, knitting for large women with knitting needles is performed, the longer the device should be. </p><h2>  Material Selection </h2><p>  Looking at a wide range of knitting needles, beginners in needlework are interested in what they should be made of, whether this affects the knitting process.  The answer to this question is the information that the material for the manufacture of tools is selected based on the texture and composition of the yarn used: </p><div class="photo" data-original="designersophisticate.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="yarn count" class="if uuid-3170427" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3170427.jpg"></div><ol><li>  Metal knitting needles are best for knitting products made of natural wool or acrylic.  They are very slippery and the porous thread moves easily without complicating the process.  If they are treated with care and not bent, they will last more than a dozen years. </li><li>  Wooden or bamboo knitting needles are lightweight.  Due to their texture, they are ideal for knitting from slippery yarn, for example, viscose or silk.  For beginner needlewomen it is recommended to use just them, they are tightly held in the hand and it is easy to dial loops with them. </li><li>  Plastic knitting needles are very flexible and light, do not leave marks on the product.  However, they also have disadvantages.  Threads easily slide off them, so such devices are suitable for working with certain types of yarn.  In addition, they are not used for knitting with needles for women of size 50 and above, that is, for the manufacture of large products. </li></ol><h2>  Knitting needles for unusual threads </h2><p>  Yarn is called fancy if it has: </p><ul><li>  thickness changing thread; </li><li>  decorative or volume inserts; </li><li>  sewn beads or sequins. </li></ul><p>  When buying such threads, you need to study the label.  As a rule, foreign manufacturers indicate the appropriate size of knitting needles and hooks for working with them.  If such information is not available, the following recommendations should be followed: </p><ol><li>  For brushed yarn (mohair, angora), knitting needles are chosen two units more than the thickness of the thread.  As a result, the product will fluff up and turn out light, airy and does not roll when worn. </li><li>  For fancy yarn, knitting needles are selected taking into account the thickest section of the thread and one more.  If there are few decorative details and they are woven through large gaps, you should focus on the prevailing thickness of the thread in the skein.  Knitting for 48 clothing sizes, for example, is done with tool number 5. </li><li>  For yarn with a long pile and synthetic component, the best option would be knitting needles 5 and 6. </li><li>  For stretch thread, knitting needles are selected according to the standard principle.  In the process of knitting, the correct tension of the thread is observed, it should go freely.  Lycra in the composition of the yarn will not allow the fabric to become loose.  If you knit too tightly, the effect of ‚Äústretch‚Äù will not be present in the finished product. </li></ol><h2>  Knitting density </h2><p>  Often, not having enough experience, beginners knit a cloth quite tightly.  In this regard, it is better to take knitting needles half or one size larger than suitable, that is, 1.5-2 mm thicker than yarn.  However, over time, it is still better to learn how to control the density of mating. </p><p>  If the work is done too tight, then the hands are in constant tension, quickly get tired and the craftswoman does not enjoy the needlework.  As a result, this affects the appearance of the product, it turns out to be coarse, and the yarn does not reveal its potential.  Very tight knitting is not recommended even in the manufacture of products such as socks.  The size of the knitting needles for these items of clothing is selected less than the number of yarn, one or two sizes, and the density of the fabric is selected average. </p><p>  If knitted with a weak viscous, nothing good will come out either.  After all, even changing the size of the needles, it will be impossible to get an acceptable result.  The product will look loose and stretched, and in the process of wearing it will be deformed even more.  With proper tension, the threads of the loop are held tightly to the spoke, do not sag, and move freely.  If the process is easy, without unnecessary efforts, the spoke does not slip out, which means that the result will be excellent. </p><h2>  Useful Tips </h2><p>  To be sure of the correct choice of knitting needles and threads, some experts suggest knitting a small sample before starting the main work.  You need to do it yourself, since the technique of work is different for everyone.  It is enough to knit five rows of ten loops.  Then, according to this sample, the density of the canvas is analyzed and the number of loops for work is calculated. </p><div class="photo" data-original="xenoz.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="loop count" class="if uuid-3170415" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3170415.jpg"></div><p>  If the product has a pattern with crossed loops and braids, you need to choose knitting needles 1.5 mm wider than the thickness of the yarn, so knitting will be freer. </p><p>  If the pattern is openwork, with numerous crochets, elongated or deflated loops, the needles are taken 0.5 mm less. </p><p>  To make gum on the bottom of the product and cuffs, finish the neck and other things, they choose 1 mm less knitting needles for knitting than those used to make the product itself.  Due to this, its edges do not stretch. </p><h2>  Determine the consumption of yarn </h2><p>  Having experience, it will not be difficult to calculate how many threads are needed, for example, for knitting a vest for women and the size of knitting needles.  And for beginners, we give the following recommendations: </p><div class="photo" data-original="yenilikmodasi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting vest" class="if uuid-3170432" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3170432.jpg"></div><ol><li>  On a sheet of paper write down the number of knitting needles and the thickness of the yarn to be used. </li><li>  It is necessary to tie a small sample.  Usually this is a canvas measuring 30 by 30 cm. </li><li>  Then count the number of rows, loops in each of them and write on a piece of paper. </li><li>  By multiplying both indicators, the number of loops in the entire sample is obtained.  The resulting number is recorded. </li><li>  According to the size of the pattern, an approximate number of loops in the entire product is calculated.  The finished sample is dissolved and the length of the resulting thread is recorded. </li><li>  Now the total number of loops is divided by the number of them in the sample, the result is multiplied by the length of the thread.  This will be the required volume of yarn. </li></ol><p>  It is clear that these calculations are approximate and must be taken into account when buying material for work.  It is purchased at about 10% in excess of the calculated depending on the pattern on the product.  The more magnificent it is, the larger the supply is needed.  The size of the needles also plays a role.  The thinner they are and the denser the knitting, the more yarn you may need. </p>
