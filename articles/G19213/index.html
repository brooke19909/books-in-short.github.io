List</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For ten years now, the famous financial and economic journal Forbes (USA) has been published in Russian.  This publication won great popularity around the world thanks to the published ratings of the "very-most": wealthy, successful, expensive, etc. In 2013, according to information published in Forbes, Russia reached the first honorary number of billionaires (in dollars). a place.  In August last year, the magazine compiled a list of <span>the richest people in Russia.</span>  For two years now, he has been led by the same person - Alisher Usmanov. </p>

In addition, in some domestic publications the title "richest man in Russia" is not Usmanov, but Vladimir Lisin.  There are also publications in which Oleg Deripaska is called this "lucky man".  But according to Forbes, Lisin is in eighth position, and Deripaska is not in the top ten at all.  Most likely, this discrepancy arises due to the fact that different publications evaluate the capital of a billionaire according to different criteria.  In addition, the fortune of the rich is sometimes recorded on their family members and other relatives, so there is practically no exact information on the size of the capital of a businessman.  Nevertheless, we present to your attention a list of the richest people in Russia, published in the Forbes magazine.

    <p>  As you can see, according to both lists, the richest businessman in Russia is Alisher Usmanov.  He owns the Metalloinvest metallurgical holding, is a co-owner (29.9% of the shares) of the British legendary FC Arsenal and the mobile communications operator Megafon and others. The richest man in Russia was born in Uzbekistan in a family of a prosecutor.  He was educated at MGIMO.  After the collapse of the USSR, he moved to Russia, where he founded his own business - the production of plastic bags, and also began to import tobacco into Russia.  At the same time, he studied at the Financial Academy and received a diploma in banking.  Once in the banking sector, he made incredible success: one position was replaced by another, higher.  He later became CEO of Gazprominvestholding, a limited liability company that he owns to this day.  Then Usmanov bought a major stake in the Internet holding DST, which in 2010 changed its name to Mile.ru Group.  It included Mail.ru, Vkontakte, Odnoklassniki, 10% of Facebook, and others. Alisher Usmanov‚Äôs fortune decreased by $ 0.5 billion compared to last year: from 18.1 billion to 17.6.  Despite this, he, according to Forbes and other reputable publications, is the richest man in Russia. </p>
