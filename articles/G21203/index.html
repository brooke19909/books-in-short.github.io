    <h2>  Where is it located? </h2><p>  You will forever love the Golden Bay holiday home (Anapa).  The hotel is located directly in the city, almost on the coastline, just 5 meters from the beach.  It has an extremely favorable location, only 60 meters from the seaport of Anapa. </p><p>  The airport is located quite close, only 18 km from a stunning holiday destination called Golden Bay (Anapa).  The hotel attracts tourists with stunning sea views, excellent equipment and excellent cuisine. </p><p>  If you are planning a trip by rail, then from the station to the place - 9 km.  If you book in advance, a shuttle service will be provided.  This also applies to meeting guests using air transport. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The main differences from other holiday homes of the Black Sea coast </h2><p>  If you have not yet decided on a place of rest, then you will find Golden Bay (Anapa) - a hotel that is a brilliant combination of coziness, luxury and comfort.  This is a real exclusive.  It is favorably distinguished from all other hotels by luxurious bungalows.  This is an attribute of paradise, starry life, into which you will plunge for the whole time of vacation.  Each guest can choose a place to live, as the houses are located in several lines, starting from the shore, where in the evenings you can listen to the sound of the surf.  The Golden Bay beach in Anapa is considered one of the cleanest and most comfortable, and you will have to take only a few steps to meet the world of bliss and solar heat. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="golden bay beach in Anapa" class="if" height="353" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/671548.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  We choose housing </h2><p>  The most popular is the first line of houses right next to the shore.  If you plan to spend the whole vacation sunbathing and swimming, then feel free to choose this option.  You will remember the Golden Bay beach in Anapa for a long time.  Nearby is the resort yacht club, where you can try yourself in the role of a real captain or just watch how beautiful white yachts glide along the waves. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The second line of houses is located very close, only 15 meters from the coast.  But there are other amenities.  Each of the houses is surrounded by its own territory, where you can spend quiet family evenings, play with children or arrange gatherings with a barbecue.  In addition, there is a two-story, comfortable cottage. </p><p>  The third line is 30 meters away from the sea, but a huge freshwater pool has been built here for holidaymakers.  If you do not like salt baths too much, you can swim here.  Not all <span>holiday homes in Anapa</span> offer guests such a large selection of exclusive accommodation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holiday Homes in Anapa" class="if" height="255" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/671543.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Arrangement </h2><p>  Each house is made of high-quality pine logs, the appearance of which fits in the most natural way in the beauty of the local landscape.  Each house is characterized by the highest level of comfort, equipped with satellite TV, a refrigerator, a split system and a plumbing unit.  Pleased with a high level of security, bungalows are equipped with electronic locks.  Some primitive image of the houses is further emphasized by handmade rattan furniture.  It creates additional comfort. </p><p>  But the most comfortable place is the terrace.  In the evening it is so nice to watch the sun go down over the horizon.  It is not for nothing that frequent guests say that this is the best hotel.  The Golden Bay (Anapa) will forever remain in your heart. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="golden bay anapa prices" class="if" height="282" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/671544.jpg" width="491"></div>
