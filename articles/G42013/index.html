  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DIY organizer for knitting needles and hooks: ideas, materials, manufacturing tips</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Those who are just beginning to comprehend the basics of knitting do not yet realize how many tools and skeins of yarn will appear if the mastered type of needlework is to their liking.  What to do with this good?  It is a pity to throw out, but to keep in a box or a large package is also inconvenient.  Perhaps someone will say that you can use a large basket or a box decorated with your own hands to store the remains of knitting threads.  Suppose, but what to do with the tools? </p><p>  Recently, experienced needlewomen use a self-made organizer for this purpose.  The knitting needles and hooks placed in it will be not only safe and sound, but also in a full set is always at hand.  If you liked the idea so much that you also wanted to get such a thing, we offer a detailed and step-by-step master class on its implementation! </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to make an organizer for knitting needles and hooks" class="if uuid-3054787" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3054787.jpg"></div><h2>  Learning Features </h2><p>  In order to please yourself with an interesting and useful product, it is not at all necessary to be a professional seamstress.  Enough to have a desire.  And also carry out competent training.  It implies quite affordable actions. </p><p>  Photos of various options for organizers for needlework show a fabric with pockets in which the existing knitting needles and hooks lie neatly.  However, despite the fact that the principle of operation in most variants is similar, it is not recommended to carry out the intended thing according to someone‚Äôs template. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  We are preparing </h2><p>  Each needlewoman has her own set of tools.  Someone likes to work with long instruments, while others prefer short ones.  Some knitters have large knitting needles, while others have hooks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.postila.io" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY organizer for knitting needles and hooks" class="if uuid-3054790" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3054790.jpg"></div><p>  Also, your tools will differ in size from those used by another craftswoman.  For example, many needlewomen preserved grandmother's needles, which are much longer than those presented in the store today.  Therefore, preparation is an elementary process.  In fact, you just need to spread out all the knitting needles and hooks in front of you. </p><h2>  Choose material </h2><p>  In fact, even experienced needlewomen do not undertake to strictly determine the fabric suitable for the study product.  Largely because it is sewn from what is at hand.  But most often a dense fabric is used.  For example, jeans.  It is better to use it for the outside of the organizer.  But to place a set of crochet hooks and different types of knitting needles, cotton or linen fabric is more suitable.  Although you can also take an unnecessary waffle towel.  The main thing is that the finished craft looked organically. </p><h2>  We distribute hooks and hosiery knitting needles </h2><p>  To make a beautiful and convenient organizer for needlework, you need to draw a sketch of crafts.  To do this, prepare a paper template.  Its dimensions should correspond to our idea.  And to determine its parameters, you should take the longest tool.  The pocket for it should be slightly longer so that the knitting needles or hook do not stick out, fall out and spoil the beauty of the organizer.  So we find out the height of the product, which we plan to cut and sew.  Now you should deal with the width. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Experienced needlewomen advise using a ruler and a simple pencil for these purposes.  Next, just lay out the tools on a piece of paper and draw cells - the pockets of the planned organizer from fabric or other material.  They should be slightly wider so that the knitting needles and hook can be easily reached.  This process is a bit like Tetris, you will also have to assemble the tools, trying to occupy the maximum space and not leave free space. </p><h2>  Preparing a place for ring spokes </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Doll organizer for knitting needles and hooks" class="if uuid-3054778" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3054778.jpg"></div><p>  This type of tool differs from the previous ones not only in size, but also in the presence of a rubber tube, fishing line or metal cable.  Therefore, no one stores it in the expanded state.  So, such knitting needles should be placed in a pocket of a different shape. </p><p>  Experienced needlewomen advise, when performing an organizer for knitting needles and hooks, to differentiate the common space with their own hands.  It is most convenient to take the right side with long tools, and on the left place the folded ring spokes.  However, it is again worth noting that the creation of the product under study is a creative process that you must manage yourself.  This is why we recommend starting the work by preparing a sketch.  This will allow you to think through all the details, organize the place and put together the tools. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  We work with a pattern </h2><p>  Having finished the paper version of the organizer for storing knitting needles and hooks to perfection, you can begin to transfer the pattern to the fabric.  This requires a simple pencil or piece of soap, a convenient ruler and large scissors for cutting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="beads-for-rabbit-liza.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Organizer for knitting needles and hooks ideas" class="if uuid-3054784" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3054784.jpg"></div><p>  Having prepared everything you need, lay out the fabric in front of you and outline the resulting template.  Add one centimeter on each side - allowances for the seams, and on the one hand - 10-15 cm to make a valve that will prevent the tools from falling out.  Then proceed to the next step in the implementation of the organizer for knitting needles and hooks with your own hands. </p><p>  Cut out the base of the product and set it aside for now.  Now you should cut the template into components, which are previously important to number.  Shorten pockets designed for long hooks and hosiery needles.  After all, the tools should be visible, and also convenient to get.  Then we mark new details on the fabric, placing them as close as possible to each other.  If they are the same in size, you can not bother with unnecessary actions, but immediately cut out a large fragment and make demarcating notches on it by hand. </p><p>  Pockets for ring needles in most cases are squares of the same size.  Therefore, then prepare the right amount of these parts. </p><p>  This completes the process of cutting the organizer for knitting needles and hooks with your own hands. </p><h2>  Getting started assembly </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Technology organizer for knitting needles and hooks" class="if uuid-3054788" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3054788.jpg"></div><p>  To collect all the elements into a single thing, you should use a sewing machine or a needle and thread.  The principle of operation is quite simple.  First take the base and fold the protruding part - the valve in half.  Iron well.  Fold the top edge of the pockets intended for the set of crochet hooks and hosiery knitting needles, iron them with an iron.  Arrange the parts on the base and sew along the dividing lines.  Moreover, it is important to make 2 seams at a small distance from each other. </p><p>  Do not touch the sides of the organizer yet!  This is the final stage of work.  Instead, take pockets for annular knitting needles, fold the hem, iron and sew, starting from the one on top. </p><p>  Now we just have to process the edges of our product.  They can be bent, ironed, and then stitched.  Or decorate with a satin ribbon or fabric of a different color.  The desired option should be chosen independently. </p><p>  In addition to the craft, we recommend making a doll organizer for knitting needles and hooks.  Such a product is convenient, interesting and beautiful. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Doll Organizer" class="if uuid-3056223" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3056223.jpg"></div><h2>  Plywood organizer </h2><p>  A man can prepare the next interesting and useful thing for his beloved. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Needlework organizer" class="if uuid-3054780" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3054780.jpg"></div><p>  Its execution technology is also entirely up to the artist.  The main thing, when preparing to take into account the size of the products for which the craft is intended.  For the rest, you can rely on your own imagination and taste.  However, we still recommend planning the appearance of the idea on paper.  And then you can make a really spectacular organizer for knitting needles and hooks from plywood. </p><p>  In addition, it is important to note that such a product can be made by the whole family.  For example, dad will prepare the frame and assemble the base, and mom and children will sew a fabric cover or glue the craft with material or paper, and come up with an interesting decor. </p><h2>  Organizer basket </h2><p>  We recommend that you consider another very simple, but no less creative version of the product.  The only thing for its implementation will require any packaging.  It can be a bucket of sour cream, an unnecessary tub and even an empty can of paint.  The size should be selected based on the length of the tools and the amount of yarn residue. </p><p>  To stitch this organizer, you need to outline the bottom circumference, measure the height of the prepared container.  Focusing on the obtained parameters, it is necessary to outline a strip on the fabric, the length of which is equal to the dimensions of the side of the base, and the width to its two heights.  After that, we prepare the pockets of the desired length and width.  We cut out from the fabric the side of the container and two bottoms.  On the first we sew the pockets, placing them on the bottom of the fabric.  Then we fold the base in half and sew on the bottom from the inside.  We put a little glue on the bottom of the container and gently press the fabric frame.  Then manually sew the second bottom, trying to make the seam as invisible as possible. </p><p>  It is important to note that with a large number of tools, pockets can be made not only outside but also inside.  But it is necessary to solve this before starting work.  Otherwise, the revision will come out messy and spoil the beauty of the product. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Organizer basket for knitting needles and hooks" class="if uuid-3054777" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3054777.jpg"></div><p>  That's the whole instruction on how to sew an organizer basket for knitting needles and hooks.  However, it is important to note that this product is more convenient than the previous ones in that it stores not only tools, but also material.  Novice craftsmen, who do not yet have a large amount of yarn residue, can put a ball into it during knitting so that it does not roll around the room. </p>
