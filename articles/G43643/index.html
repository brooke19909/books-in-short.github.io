The fact is that it is located across the road from the sea and at the same time close to the city center.  Namely, the combination of these two elements is considered by tourists vacationing in Marmaris to be just perfect.  Therefore, ‚ÄúGray Deluxe‚Äù is often presented by operators as an excellent ratio of convenience and cheapness, or, as they say, price and quality.  Until the recent repair, he had three stars on his sign, and now four.  Since then, the word "Deluxe" has been added to its name.  We will try to find out below by analyzing the reviews of guests, whether this hotel is really so good. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Seray Deluxe Hotel 4 (Marmaris) reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12024/2019259.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Marmaris - the center of the country's most European resort </h2><p>  This is one of the most beautiful cities in Turkey.  It is located on the shore of a picturesque bay with rugged beaches and dozens of islands, and surrounded by pine-covered mountains.  In addition, Marmaris is rightfully considered the most fun city in Turkey.  No wonder it is often compared with Turkey.  But the rest here is somewhat unusual for Russians and even immigrants from the former Soviet Union. </p><p>  The tone here is set by the British, Germans, French and Danes.  And they used to rest differently.  The ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù system for most travelers from these countries, as well as a completely closed territory, are unnecessary excesses that cause inconvenience and imprisonment.  And huge palaces with five stars on the signboard and staff guessing your wishes are just a waste of money. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But beautiful views, parties, dances until the morning, endless parties and boiling life - this is the style of Marmaris.  Therefore, hotels located closer to the center meet these European criteria - their territory is small, the animation is practically absent, but the location is excellent relative to the sea and the center with its narrow streets and nightclubs. </p><h2>  How to get to the hotel, its location, which is located nearby </h2><p>  As a rule, guests at the Seray Deluxe Hotel 4 * (Marmaris) arrive at <span>Dalaman Airport.</span>  It is currently under reconstruction.  The airport is located ninety kilometers from the city.  As a rule, most hotels accepting tourists have agreements with operators on the transfer of guests.  But some use taxi services or get to the Marmaris bus station using the Hawash buses. </p><p>  There is a convenience store near the hotel.  And if you go out onto the main street, then you will immediately get to two Migros-type supermarkets.  There is a good selection of products and things.  Migros are also known for the fact that you can pay in dollars there, and they will give change in Turkish lira, moreover, at a very good rate.  Many other boutiques and shops are plentiful and within walking distance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Seray Deluxe Hotel 4 (Marmaris)" class="if" height="307" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2019152.jpg" width="600"></div>

It was built in 1998.  Nevertheless, now it looks very modern.  Its area is a little over two square kilometers.  Nevertheless, the territory is very well-groomed, planted with flowers, palm trees, covered with soft lawn grass. </p><p>  The hotel consists of one building with an elevator.  The hotel has a post office.  The reception, lobby and restaurant are almost combined, and tables on the terrace are already almost at the edge of the pool.  Since the reviews claim that the hotel is intended for lovers of "hanging out", then a large area here is not needed.  You will reach the center on foot in twenty to thirty minutes, but while you walk along the beautiful promenade with its craftsmen, you will not even notice this.  Near the hotel there is a bus stop, from where you can literally go to any place in the resort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Seray Deluxe Hotel 4 Standard Marmaris" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2019176.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Rooms and accommodation for tourists </h2><p>  Reviews Seray Deluxe Hotel 4 * in Marmaris are described as small but cozy.  And in fact, there are only 44 rooms.  They are quite spacious - 25 square meters in area, and can accommodate a maximum of three guests.  But most of them are designed for two guests.  Occupy guests quickly and without problems. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Room occupancy is usual for the ‚Äúfour‚Äù in Marmaris - a bathroom with a shower, a hairdryer, air conditioning with a split system (but it is turned on in the evening, and it works until morning).  Many guestrooms have refrigerators (minibars).  The rooms are made in white, everything is clean.  On TV, in addition to the usual set of Turkish satellite channels, you can also watch English and Russian.  All rooms have balconies. </p><p>  Thus, the hotel has one type of room for guests - Seray Deluxe Hotel 4 * Standard.  For Marmaris, reviews of which often compare it with Spanish resorts, this is quite typical.  Change linen and towels in the rooms twice a week.  Plumbing works well, there is always hot water after dinner.  The beds are comfortable, in the closets there are many shelves and hangers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Seray Deluxe Hotel 4 (Marmaris).

    <h2>  Service </h2><p>  As for the hotel services, the hotel can hand over clothes to the laundry room and call a doctor.  All this, of course, is not included in the accommodation and the price of the ticket.  These are paid services, just like using a safe at the reception and room service.  For children there is a small playground. </p><p>  ‚ÄúWi-Fi‚Äù is on the ground floor, near the reception.  In those rooms that are near the lobby, the Internet pulls fine, so you can watch the video.  But near the pool and in the rooms away, he no longer catches.  But in the lobby there are many cozy sofas where you can sit on the Internet.  A free shuttle runs from the hotel to the equipped Nirvana Beach, in the village of Icmeler. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  About how to spend time at the Seray Deluxe Hotel 4 * (Turkey, Marmaris), reviews say different things.  Those who are accustomed to the constant animation, shows and competitions of Kemer or Antalya feel that the hotel is boring.  And indeed, animation happens here in the evenings, and even then once a week.  Then the restaurant plays live music and hosts "Turkish Night." </p><p>  There is a small fitness room, sauna and jacuzzi.  But the main entertainment is a trip to Bar Street.  She settles at eleven in the evening, and then most of the guests leave there.  At the same time, all guests, including young people, behave decently, and no one bothers anyone to relax. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Seray Deluxe Hotel 4 (Marmaris) Reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2019151.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Staff </h2><p>  The staff at the Seray Deluxe Hotel 4 * in Marmaris speak good English.  However, they also know Russian.  At least one of the daytime employees and a young man working at night will always understand and answer you. </p><p>  All the hotel staff are friendly, good-natured.  If you need help, they are always trying to do their best.  Everyone does their job - waiters monitor the order and number of dishes, bartenders pour drinks, wash the area every day.  Chefs are trying hard. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Hotel Seray Deluxe Hotel 4 * (Marmaris) has two restaurants.  In one of them, tourists are fed according to the all inclusive system.  The second refers to the type of "a la carte".  One of them is designed for 250 people, and the second - for 150. There are also two bars.  But the all-inclusive system ends at ten in the evening. </p><p>  Of the meat dishes, mainly chicken and Turkish kufte cutlets.  A lot of greens, salads with cucumbers and tomatoes that you can season yourself - oil, mayonnaise or yogurt.  Of the side dishes - stewed vegetables, potatoes, pasta.  Cold appetizers - mainly olives, cheeses, sausages.  Of the fruits, apples and watermelon are mainly given.  Lots of sweet trays of different kinds. </p><p>  The bars offer tourists red and white wine, beer, gin, <span>vodka, crayfish,</span> carbonated drinks and soft drinks.  There are devices where you can order coffee or juices.  Sometimes they can give liver and fish. </p><p>  The food is not very varied, although tasty.  And the gozleme cakes that make here are so easy to eat.  But all that you lack, you can buy cheap enough at local bazaars or at Migros. </p><p>  The hotel also has a paid cafe with good music and an excellent playground.  The staff can even look after the children there if you need to leave. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Seray Deluxe Hotel 4 Turkey Marmaris reviews" class="if" height="447" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2019153.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sea and pools </h2><p>  The hotel has no beach.  Tourists go mainly to the public.  Before him about five minutes at a slow pace.  We can say that the hotel is on the second line.  You can swim on a piece of the free beach, but it is not equipped.  And there is also an option - to buy a drink in any bar on the promenade and use the sunbed and umbrella all day. </p><p>  The fact is that not only hotels of the first line, but also all the bars and restaurants by the sea have their own beaches.  They are equipped, and sunbeds and umbrellas are designed for guests. </p><p>  The sea is clean, the beaches are clean.  The water is clear, especially in the mornings and evenings, when there are not many people.  Reviews of Seray Deluxe Hotel 4 * (Marmaris) assure that the outdoor pool, which is located on its territory, is very large - about 80 meters in area.  He works from seven in the morning until six in the evening.  There is also a small "paddling pool" for children.  If you find it too hot on the beach, then in the afternoon you can calmly sit by the pool in the shade of palm trees or sunbathe on a sun lounger, and go swimming in the sea at a more acceptable time. </p><p>  Many here like it even more.  The pool is clean and warm, and the steps for entering the water are very comfortable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Seray Deluxe Hotel 4 (Marmaris) photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2019149.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Many of the guests of the Seray Deluxe Hotel 4 * (Turkey, Marmaris) upload photos of their walks along the promenade to the Internet.  After all, just walking along the promenade to the city center or in the opposite direction, to the resort village of Icmeler, slowly and enjoying beautiful views, is already an excursion.  But to walk along the narrow streets of the old city, climb the Suleiman the Magnificent Fortress, and inspect ancient sculptures?  Isn't this a whole journey? </p><p>  If you all looked in Marmaris and want to ride in the surroundings, and especially take a boat trip to the islands of the Mediterranean and Aegean, it is better not to buy these trips in a hotel.  There you will pay a large amount, but in the travel agency on the street or directly from the owners on the waterfront, all the same can be obtained two or three times cheaper. </p><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  There is a market in the city center on Thursdays where you can buy excellent Turkish products that will simply delight your stomach.  It is often visited by guests of the Seray Deluxe Hotel 4 * (Marmaris).  2017 reviews strongly recommend visiting the bazaar on Thursdays - it is diverse, rich, and just walking there and staring is already a pleasure. </p><p>  With regard to food prices and things, the opinions of tourists were divided.  Some believe that, since there are many Europeans resting, the cost of goods is too high in relation to other resorts in Turkey.  And others, on the contrary, write that the prices in Marmaris are acceptable, and in some stores even cheaper than standard ones. </p><p>  First of all, experienced tourists are advised to bring coffee, tea from Rize province from here.  A good Turkish tray is a good present.  Traditionally decorated teapots and coffee pots, cups, especially with coasters, and original spoons are also very good to buy here.  In general, Marmaris has very good dishes, especially metal and ceramic.  If you want to bring relatives or friends a Turkish cezve for making ground coffee, then this city has a great selection of these products. </p><h2>  Seray Deluxe Hotel 4 * (Marmaris): reviews and overall hotel stay rating </h2><p>  First of all, it should be said that the hotel is designed more for young people than for families with children.  There are no special frills, but very clean, comfortable, sincere, at home.  The staff is trying to please the guests.  Hotel Seray Deluxe Hotel 4 * (Marmaris), a photo of which tourists often attach to their reviews, is not suitable for those who spend most of their time in the hotel, but for travelers who come for a walk and enjoy the local flavor. </p><p>  This is a party city, and often come here who know what kind of resort.  Nevertheless, over time, the hotel is changing for the better, as the responses say.  For example, the rooms at the Seray Deluxe Hotel 4 * Standard (Marmaris) have become very decent in recent years, and new repairs have been made there.  The filling has become simply gorgeous, and the views from the window are amazing.  The hotel's location is one of the best, everything is close - the promenade, center and sea.  All this pleasure is worth a bit, the service is good, and the city itself is amazing. </p>
