    <h2>  Young rake and poet </h2><p>  Antoine de Montcretien was born in 1576 in Normandy.  His father was a simple pharmacist, so the future economist‚Äôs nobility was not generic, granted to him by King Louis XIII.  Orphaned early, and having received a fortune after his parents, the young man began to lead a wide and wild life, often coming into conflict with existing laws, but for the time being he got away with it. </p><p>  At an early age, Antoine showed a poetic gift, and barely celebrating his 20th birthday, he published the tragedy of his own composition, written in an antique plot.  After it was followed by several more poetic and dramatic works, which clearly expressed his loyal feelings for the reigning monarch.  This brought the young author not only widespread fame, but also very tangible fees, which was very helpful with his lifestyle.  Everyone believed that the most promising prospects were opening up before him. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  English Channel Escape </h2><p>  However, at the end of 1605 an unfortunate event occurred that radically changed the life of a fashionable poet.  His manner summed up in imitation of the nobles a little clutch at the sword.  If the previous duels somehow managed to be hushed up, this time it was not possible to hide the enemy‚Äôs death, so I had to drop everything and hurry to flee to England. </p>

    <p>  On the shores of foggy Albion, the fugitive was warmly received by King James I, who read and greatly appreciated his works.  Further publications were expected of him, but, to everyone's surprise, Antoine de Montcretien chose a different field of activity for himself.  Later biographers noted that England struck him with his unprecedented economic development at that time, far superior to the French economy. </p><h2>  New line of business </h2><p>  Devoting years spent in exile to a serious study of the reasons for such successful economic growth, he came to the conclusion that they are due to the support provided by the state to artisans and merchants, that is, representatives of the so-called third estate.  The goods produced in the country, filling the domestic market, were sold abroad, and through taxes paid by their exporters, they brought treasury huge profits, which ultimately reflected in the standard of living of the entire population.  From now on, the economy took possession of all the thoughts of the poet. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  When <span>Louis XIII</span> ascended the French throne in May 1610 <span>, the</span> unlucky duelist was given the opportunity to return to his homeland.  Once in Paris and forever leaving the dramatic work, Antoine de Montcretien declared himself as a staunch defender of the interests of the development of national industry and trade, and he hastened to confirm his words with deed.  Having married a rich widow and taking advantage of her capital, he opened his own workshop for the production of hardware, which he then sold in his shop. </p><h2>  New views on the economy </h2><p>  At the same time, the newly-minted entrepreneur took up the theoretical justification of his views, thoroughly seeding for writing work, which he entitled "A Treatise on Political Economy."  Antoine de Montcretien, turning to the government and, first of all, to the king, tried to convince them with very accessible arguments that they should provide comprehensive assistance to the French merchants and industrialists. </p>

    <p>  Introducing the new term ‚îÄ ‚Äúpolitical economy‚Äù, the author in his writings presented a chain of evidence of the very obvious truth that the wealth of the state is, first of all, the money that foreign trade brings to it, which requires goods produced domestically.  Success directly depends on the state policy pursued in relation to producers and exporters.  Consequently, politics and economics are inextricable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Founder of mercantilism </h2><p>  The contribution of Antoine de Montcretien to the economy as a science consists primarily in the fact that he was the first to indicate its connection with the policy pursued by the state.  By that time, economics had a long way to go.  However, it was based on the erroneous assertion of its founder ‚îÄ the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle, who believed that state power and the economy are things that are not interconnected. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Antoine de Montcretien 1575 1621" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31546/2053783.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Having developed his own concept, Moncretien became the first representative of mercantilism ‚îÄ a system of doctrines that justified the need for assistance provided by state bodies of economic activity of citizens.  It should have been expressed in the so-called protectionism ‚îÄ a policy in which high duties on imported goods were legally established and subsidies were provided to support domestic producers.  Thus, the economy, according to Moncretien, was one of the objects of government. </p><p>  Subsequently, his theory became widespread among economists from around the world.  Among the most famous representatives of mercantilism are such scholars as the Frenchman F. Colbert, the British W. Stafford and T. Men, the Spaniard Serra, the Italian A. Scaruffy and many other outstanding minds of his time.  In Russia, the <span>well-known economists</span> I. Pososhkov and A. Ordyn-Nashchokin became the successors of his business. </p><p>  Moncretien published his ‚ÄúTreatise on Political Economy‚Äù, which brought him no less fame than previous literary experiments, with a dedication written in honor of King Louis XIII (a portrait is given below) and the widowed Queen Mother.  A number of researchers believe that it was this book, filled with an expression of the most loyal feelings, that helped him gain the nobility.  In any case, it was after its publication that the noble particle ‚Äúde‚Äù appeared in his name. </p>

    <h2>  In the ranks of the rebels </h2><p>  However, this time, like many years ago, an unexpected and tragic turn took place on the crest of success in the fate of this person.  The fact is that at that time in France, a religious war escalated between Catholics, on whose side the king was, and Protestants (Huguenots), in whose ranks Antoine de Montcretien also fought. </p><p>  What was the reason for his choice is not exactly known.  Perhaps his own religious views played a role, or maybe, not finding real support for his economic theories from the king, he tried to enforce them with the help of his opponents.  Evil tongues subsequently even claimed that he converted to Protestantism for the sole purpose of marrying a wealthy Huguenot bride.  However, taking the side of the enemies of the king, he fought along with them, not sparing his life. </p><h2>  The death of the poet and scientist </h2><p>  Death overtook him on October 7, 1621, when, as part of a small detachment, he was ambushed by an adversary.  Having become a state criminal, this poet, duelist and at the same time an outstanding economist died from a sword blow in the smoke and the roar of musket shots.  However, such an end was a kind of luck for him, because in the event of captivity, he would inevitably face shameful and painful execution.  Even the dead body of the rebel was first dismembered and then betrayed to public burning. </p>

    <h2>  World History Name </h2><p>  Despite the fact that subsequent scholars in their development relied on concepts developed by Antoine de Montcretien, in France his name for almost three centuries surrendered to curses.  This largely explains the difficulties faced by his later biographers, since the information that reached them came mainly from the enemies of Montretien, who did not disdain slandering him and obvious falsifications of events. </p><p>  In their notes, they often refer to the author of a revolutionary treatise of his time as a greedy lover, a highway robber, and even a counterfeiter.  Nevertheless, the name of Antoine de Montcretien, whose brief biography formed the basis of this article, forever entered the history of world economic science. </p>
