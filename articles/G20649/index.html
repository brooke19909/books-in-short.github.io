    <h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  Royal Mirage Beach Resort 3 * in India (Goa) is a whole complex that can provide you with a huge variety of services.  The hotel has a developed infrastructure.  On its territory there is a beauty salon where every woman can feel like a real goddess.  A wide range of services and procedures for the face, hair and body will help to solve many problems and become truly beautiful.  For lovers of outdoor activities, we recommend the hottest hours in the garden.  Here, shady alleys save from sunlight, and the aroma of flowers gives an excellent mood.

    <h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  It may be too difficult for those who are visiting the Hotel Royal Mirage 3 * (Goa) for the first time.  Candolim (India) is a kingdom of hot sand and hot sun, therefore it is recommended in the first days to limit oneself only to its morning and evening visits.  At other times, it is better to hide from the heat in a shady garden.  By the way, there is an outdoor pool, which for many tourists perfectly replaces the ocean with its inconsistent nature.  The pool for children is great; they spend all their free time with great pleasure.  The hotel does not have its own beach, but only 700 meters separates it from the public. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="royal mirage beach resort 3 hotel in candolim" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1178662.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Service staff </h2><p>  No matter how good the hotel is, it is still its staff who create the complete impression of it.  And this is not surprising.  Living people meet you, they are near you all the time while you live here, they help, provide you with everything you need for a comfortable stay.  Hotel Royal Mirage Beach Resort 3 * in Candolim greatly benefits from its small size.  Judging by the reviews, its employees feel personal responsibility for the common cause and try to serve customers as well as possible.  As a result, guests are greeted very warmly, they are ready to help in any matter.  We analyzed a large number of reviews and in none of them did we find negative assessments of the work of the staff.  The hotel is very comfortable and clean, rooms carry out daily wet cleaning.  Guests note that rooms always have hygiene items and clean towels. </p><h2>  Dissatisfied tourists </h2><p>  Indeed, there are such.  No wonder, we are all different, respectively, and the requirements, as well as the perception of the environment, are different for different people.  Why do some tourists do not like Royal Mirage Beach Resort 3 * (India, Goa)?  First of all, expectations and reality may not initially coincide.  This is a small three-star hotel, and 3 stars by the standards of India can be very different from European resorts.  The building is no longer new, and the humid climate makes itself felt, therefore periodically swollen doors are being repaired, and spots are formed on the ceiling.  Traces of the repair, of course, are noticeable, but in order to enter the shiny and shining room, you need to look for a five-star hotel in this resort. </p><h2>  Exotic outside the window </h2><p>  Indeed, everything is completely unusual for our tourist here, so when you come for the first time, you may feel discomfort.  First of all, these are climatic features, so the first few days it is advisable to make only minor sorties, to undergo adaptation. </p><p>  Secondly, the very exotic nature that beckons us so may shock.  This applies not only to flora (abundance of fruits and unknown plants), but also to fauna.  Namely, a huge number of insects, from which the nets and windows of the old hotel do not save.  If you are afraid of everything crawling and flying, then stock up on repellents. </p><p>  Finally, the third minus that tourists note is breakfast at the hotel.  After European resorts, where breakfast at the hotel is the most hearty meal, here you can be disappointed.  There will be no meat and fish dishes at all, you will find juice and fruits, pancakes and vegetable salads on the table.  However, for a fee during lunch or dinner, you can order any dish of European and national cuisine. </p><p>  Based on the foregoing, we can conclude that the hotel is good enough for its class.  However, before making the final choice, it is necessary to compare several options. </p>
