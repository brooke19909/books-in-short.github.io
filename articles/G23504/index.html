Then we offer an overview of the best helpers in the kitchen by basic characteristics.  An important selection criterion is the power of the device.  What does this indicator influence and how to choose the best model?  We also offer an overview of the functions of appliances that are affected by the power of multicookers. </p><h2>  What is a multicooker and why is it needed? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.towerhousewares.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Possibilities of modern multicookers and their functions" class="if uuid-2826139" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2826139.jpg"></div><p>  The popularity of using multicookers in the kitchen is growing every year.  This is facilitated by the relatively affordable price of the device, depending on the functionality, as well as the ability to prepare tasty dishes without significant time costs.  In addition, this device can easily be taken with you when traveling, and then cooking on vacation does not take much time.  Its advantages are ease of use, compactness, low weight and a diverse set of operations for cooking delicious dishes. </p><p>  A slow cooker is a mix of several household appliances at once: a pressure cooker, a bread machine, a yogurt maker, a cooker, a double boiler and others.  Its options greatly facilitate the cooking process.  Depending on the choice of device, it can have not only different cooking functions, but also power.  Ask what the power of the multicooker influences.  First of all, the speed of cooking, as well as the cost of electricity.  This must be considered before buying.  Let's consider what other functions this device has. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Main characteristics of the multicooker </h2><div class="photo" data-original="travelwellmagazine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Slow cooker and its features" class="if uuid-2826129" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2826129.jpg"></div><p>  Before deciding how much power the multicooker should be, it is worth familiarizing yourself with the other functions that the hostess will need. </p><p>  The main characteristics of the device: </p><ul><li>  The volume of the bowl. </li></ul><p>  It varies from 2.5 liters to 5 liters.  It all depends on the composition of the family, that is, how many people will prepare the food.  For a family of 2-3 people, the smallest bowl size is enough, which will significantly affect the cost of the device.  You can not determine the size of the bowl, then take the average (3.5-4.5 liters).  If guests suddenly arrive, you can cook something quickly. </p><ul><li>  Inner coating. </li></ul><p>  Most often, the internal coating of the device has a non-stick property.  It has several layers, it is convenient to wash them, and food will not burn.  Although conventional coating is also common, which reduces the cost of the product.  It is also easy and convenient to use. </p><ul><li>  Body material. </li></ul><p>  Most often, the case is made of plastic or metal.  Metal multicookers are durable and quality, while plastic counterparts do not heat up during cooking. </p><ul><li>  Power. </li></ul><p>  There is no such thing as a better multicooker power.  It all depends on the needs of the family.  On average, it ranges from 600 to 800 watts, but can be from 200 to 2000 watts.  The more powerful the multicooker, the faster the cooking process.  In this case, the appliance is called a pressure cooker.  This significantly speeds up the cooking process, respectively, and less energy is consumed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Mode of operation. </li></ul><p>  Recently, multicookers began to be manufactured with the functions of a pressure cooker, which greatly simplifies the cooking process.  Also, in many devices there is an option to ‚Äúdelay start‚Äù and other useful little things that may be needed in everyday life. </p><ul><li>  Functional. </li></ul><p>  The device can have a very different number of functions, which determines the cost of the device.  Before buying, you should decide what a particular hostess may need. </p><ul><li>  Size and weight. </li></ul><p>  The more compact and lighter the device, the easier it is to transport if necessary, and also takes up less space in the kitchen.  Its weight and size depends primarily on the volume of the bowl, as well as the availability of functions. </p><ul><li>  Manufacturers </li></ul><p>  It can be a device of both domestic and foreign production.  Russian devices are much cheaper, regardless of functions and other indicators.  For example, the power of the Redmond multicooker produced by the Russian company Technopoisk is 900 watts.  An excellent feature for instant cooking and at an affordable price. </p><ul><li>  Care for the appliance. </li></ul><p>  For the most part, crock-pots are not difficult to maintain.  You just need to properly care for the bowl and choose the right cooking function. </p><h2>  Multicooker Features </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.walmart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to choose a slow cooker" class="if uuid-2826135" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2826135.jpg"></div><p>  You do not know what power a multicooker should be?  Pay attention to the average, not the maximum.  This will speed up the cooking process, but will not affect the price of the goods and other functions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Also, the ‚Äúdelay start‚Äù option will become an important functional of the device.  This means that the hostess will be able to program the process for the time she needs.  There is a timer for this.  It is in almost all devices, regardless of price category. </p><p>  Soaking, for example, legumes or cereals, can also become a necessary option.  And automatic heating, which will keep the temperature of the cooked dish at a certain level.  Even when the multicooker is on and a certain time has passed from the moment of cooking. </p><p>  The main functions that are present in all multicookers: </p><ul><li>  pilaf (this option provides the possibility of not only cooking rice, but also pasta and potatoes); </li><li>  buckwheat (meaning the preparation of any cereals, while they turn out friable); </li><li>  milk porridge (milk will not run away and will not burn); </li><li>  cooking (for cooking first courses); </li><li>  frying (without oil and with it); </li><li>  stewing (stew or other culinary masterpieces); </li><li>  pastries (bakery products); </li><li>  steaming (for those who follow the figure or adhere to a dietary diet). </li></ul><p>  These functions are the main ones for appliances, but there can be up to 50 of them. They also affect the power of multicookers.  The higher it is, the more options can be in the device.  For example, a mini-smokehouse or a fast-cooker for lovers of variety in nutrition. </p><h2>  Additional features of the multicooker </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.crock-pot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pressure cooker multicooker options" class="if uuid-2826144" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2826144.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to the main functions in the device, there may be additional ones.  It all depends on the needs of a particular hostess, her family and the price category of the multicooker.  It is important and very convenient to use a function such as ‚Äúdelayed start."  This means the device can be programmed, and the dish will be ready for breakfast or dinner after work. </p><p>  Mistresses also note that the Redmond multicooker with a capacity of about 900 watts does an excellent job with such an option as heating.  That is, the temperature regime of the dish will be maintained throughout the entire period after preparation, if the device is turned on.  If you take a minimum power device (600 W), the function does not work at all.  It is also important to pay attention to disabling this option, since for some dishes constant heating is not suitable. </p><h2>  Power of multicookers - which one to choose? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.dealsbro.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Slow cooker &quot;Redmond&quot; - features" class="if uuid-2826154" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2826154.jpg"></div><p>  For appliances that help significantly reduce the time spent in the kitchen, power is an important feature.  But to think that the higher this indicator, the faster the cooking process, is not entirely correct. </p><p>  By choosing a device with less power, you can reduce energy consumption, while this will affect the cooking time slightly.  In addition, the cork will not be knocked out, since in most apartments there are too many electrical appliances. </p><p>  The high power consumption of the multicooker can be important for a large family.  Especially when there is no time for cooking.  Also to those who are constantly on the move.  Here the power should be high, and the device itself - with the function of a pressure cooker.  In this case, the porridge will be ready during the time a person takes a shower, which greatly simplifies and speeds up the process.  On average, this indicator varies from 500 watts to 1,500 watts. </p><p>  Experts nevertheless advise choosing medium power devices and using the ‚Äúdelayed start‚Äù or ‚Äúauto-heating‚Äù function. </p><p>  If you compare the power of the multicooker, which is better, you should pay attention to the fact that the higher the indicator, the faster the dish should be cooked.  But appliances with a lower value do better with cereals, frying and stewing processes.  Dishes are more delicious. </p><p>  An ideal option for a family of 3-4 people will be the selected device with power from 700 watts to 900 watts.  Such devices are quite roomy, they can have a sufficient number of programs and the cooking speed is good.  In addition, such a device will not hit the family budget much. </p><h2>  Should I choose a model with touch controls and a pressure cooker function? </h2><p>  The power of multicookers also affects options such as a pressure cooker, as well as touch controls.  This greatly simplifies not only the process of using the device, but also the cooking time.  For example, it takes only an hour and a half to cook jellied meat, and 10 minutes to cook beets.  Often, such devices are above average, but the result is worth it. </p><p>  But it‚Äôs worthwhile to understand: in order for food to cook faster, a slow cooker will need time to warm up, that is, it needs to dial a certain temperature inside.  After cooking, you need to relieve pressure, for this you need a special button. </p><p>  The power of the multicooker-pressure cooker is always above average.  Touch control and the multi-cook option are also important.  Such devices are more difficult to use, cost an order of magnitude higher, but are sensitive to voltage drops.  This is also worth considering when choosing. </p><h2>  Multi Cooker Selection Criteria </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.overstock.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Multi Cooker Selection Criteria" class="if uuid-2826151" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2826151.jpg"></div><p>  Having a little understanding of the functions and the required power of the device, we proceed to its final selection. </p><p>  What to look for when choosing a multicooker? </p><ul><li>  Size - depends on the composition of the family, that is, on how many people will regularly cook food.  Also, this indicator should be considered when eating.  For example, if you prefer to pamper your home with culinary masterpieces, you should choose a larger device with more functions that will affect the price. </li><li>  Manual mode - this allows you to cook even dishes for which the appliance is not designed.  Do you like to experiment with food?  Then this function must be present in the selected device. </li><li>  We pay attention to the components - they must be of high quality.  Not only the quality of the device, but also the service life depends on this.  The spoon and spatula must be made of wood or silicone, so that the surface of the bowl is not damaged. </li><li>  Appearance - a crock-pot can be of a very different design and, if necessary, fit into the overall interior of the kitchen (everything here depends on personal preferences). </li><li>  Safety is an important indicator.  Before buying, inspect the cable, it should not move away from the device. </li></ul><h2>  How to care for the device? </h2><p>  Regardless of how much power the multicooker has, the rules for caring for appliances are almost the same. </p><p>  Basic rules for caring for the device: </p><ul><li>  Do not wash the bowl in the dishwasher.  This can damage the coating, which will affect the quality of the cooking. </li><li>  The first valve must be rinsed regularly. </li><li>  Use only silicone and wooden spoons for the bowl.  They are safe and cannot damage the coating. </li><li>  If there is a need to wipe the dust on the outside of the appliance, use a damp cloth, but make sure that the multicooker is unplugged. </li></ul><h2>  Review of the best models </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.williams-sonoma.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to care for a slow cooker?" class="if uuid-2826149" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2826149.jpg"></div><p>  Consider the most popular models of described kitchen assistants, which are selected by most users, as well as their features, which will help make a choice. </p><p>  The best multicooker models: </p><ul><li>  Redmond RMC-M4502. </li></ul><p>  The device with a bowl volume of 5 liters.  There are 18 manual programs and 16 automatic programs. You can not only cook food, including steamed foods, but also sterilize dishes, which is important for families with babies.  The power of the Redmond multicooker is 860 watts. </p><ul><li>  Philips HD3060 / 03. </li></ul><p>  It is quite compact and weighs only 4 kg.  The volume of the thicket is only 2 liters, which is suitable for a small family.  Power is also small, only 330 watts.  You can cook any dishes, but the function of a double boiler is not provided. </p><ul><li>  Moulinex CE 4000. </li></ul><p>  The model‚Äôs lid is fixed, small in size, and weighs up to seven kilograms.  There are few functions, but the power is high and amounts to 1000 watts. </p><ul><li>  Scarlet SC-413. </li></ul><p>  An economical and budget option for a small family.  The bowl is designed for three liters, the average power is 500 watts, there is a display and a timer.  Great for travelers or a small family. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Summing up, it can be noted that such a device can become an indispensable assistant in the kitchen, especially for an active modern person who is in motion most of the time.  It greatly simplifies the cooking process, allows you to experiment, while not spending a lot of time at the stove.  The advantages of such a device in the kitchen are many.

Knowing the features of the device, it will be much easier to make a choice. </p><p>  Having decided on how much power the multicooker should be, and having familiarized yourself with the functions, it is also worth knowing the disadvantages of the device.  The disadvantages include the fact that in some models it is impossible to interfere with the dish during cooking.  And this is important for some recipes.  Also cons can be attributed to energy consumption, especially in devices with high power.  This also affects the price of the device. </p><p>  In general, we can say that a modern device has more advantages than disadvantages.  That is why the device or "home cook" is gaining more and more popularity among modern housewives.  In addition, it will be possible to cook any complexity dishes or culinary masterpieces.
