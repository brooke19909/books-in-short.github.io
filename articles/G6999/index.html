  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mass media as an integral attribute of human life</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Media communications include magazines, newspapers, and television.  Quite often they are associated with entertainment, which is why many people prefer not to spend their time on them, although this point of view is fundamentally wrong. </p><p>  <span>Mass communication</span> affects almost every aspect of modern life.  For example, all monetary transactions are associated with a certain exchange of information between devices.  A bank account is not a bunch of precious pieces of paper tightly hidden in an armored safe, but a certain sequence of numbers that is printed on the magnetic tape of a card and stored in a database. </p><p>  Television and newspapers also have a significant impact on our <span>worldview.</span>  <span>This</span> happens not only due to the specific impact on our positions, but also because they give access to knowledge, on which public life largely depends. </p><p>  <strong>Newspaper business</strong> </p><p>  Pamphlets and information sheets distributed in the 18th century are considered prototypes of modern newspapers.  After some time, they acquired a significant readership and began to be released daily.  In the history of the development of the media, the newspaper has become a very important achievement, as it offered the most diverse information in a simple and easy to understand form.  It contains not only a chronicle of events, but also entertainment along with advertising. </p><p>  For more than half a century, newspapers have held a dominant position in the matter of fast, and most importantly, effective transmission of information to the general public.  With the advent of cinema, radio and television, the role of newspapers has diminished significantly.  The media have done their job, and if in the 60s in Britain each family bought more than one newspaper daily, now the press has sold half as much. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Television and its impact</strong> </p><p>  The ever-increasing influence of television is one of the most important achievements in the media world in recent years.  Current development trends suggest that after 18 years, each person will spend more time on TV than any other occupation, excluding sleep.  Almost every modern family has a TV.  According to average indicators, people watch various television programs for at least 3 hours per day. </p><p>  The advent of television has had a huge impact on the media and human life in general. </p><p>  <strong>the Internet</strong> </p><p>  A separate niche <span>among the media</span> is the Internet.  All the information contained in the global network is much more accessible compared to newspapers and television.  Moreover, it is constantly updated, not limited by volumes and is accompanied by graphic information. </p><p>  <strong>Non-technical media</strong> </p><p>  There are also interpersonal means of communication.  The most common among them is communication between the speaker and the audience.  Earlier, oratory was considered the main form of mass communication, which allows you to promote something or anyone.  At the moment, this method is closely intertwined with technical means, forming the so-called symbiosis.  The most striking example is the speech of politicians broadcast in abundance on all channels during the election campaign. </p><p>  There are two <span>functions of mass</span> communication - this is personal and informational.  Personal provides interaction between people, and information carries out the process of promoting new information.  Both of these functions are closely related.  The interaction between individuals is ensured through the dissemination of information, but it is not reduced to information processes in full. </p><p>  The science ‚Äúsociology of mass communications‚Äù approaches the study of the issue of communications in more detail and specifically.  She studies their direct influence on a person and on his life as a whole, allowing to fully appreciate the importance of the media for everyday life. </p>
