At the moment, one of the largest new buildings is the Yaroslavsky residential complex (Mytishchi).  PIK is a developer implementing this large-scale project.  The main feature of the complex can be called its concept of ‚Äúcity in a city‚Äù, which means the construction of a large number of residential buildings and all necessary for the convenience and comfort <span>of social facilities.</span>  PIK group of companies builds quickly and reliably.  19 buildings of the Yaroslavsky residential complex have already been commissioned, the first part of the project, microdistrict No. 15, has been completed. In the neighboring microdistrict, No. 16, there are also buildings ready for delivery.  The rest are at different stages of construction.  This article provides detailed information about all the advantages and disadvantages of this complex. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  On the western outskirts of the city, in the immediate vicinity of the Volkovsky highway, the Yaroslavsky residential complex (Mytishchi) is being built.  PIK for the development of two microdistricts acquired 114 hectares of land.  Microdistrict No. 15 was erected on the square between the streets of Sukromka, Yubileinaya, Borisovka and Raspopova Boulevard.  The microdistrict No. 16 currently under construction is allocated a section between Raspopova Boulevard and Mira, Yubileynaya and Borisovka Streets.  On the eastern and northern sides, the complex borders with microdistricts No. 8, 9 and 17, as well as Descartes residential complex.  On the western side there is 650 meters of the exclusion zone, behind which is TPP-27.  About 2 km from the complex is the village of Chelobitevo, and 5 km from the Moscow Ring Road at the point where it intersects with the Ostashkovskoye Shosse. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Yaroslavl Mytishchi PIC" class="if" height="311" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1689333.jpg" width="490"></div>

Mytishchi - a city that has a railway of the same name in its infrastructure  station, about ten bus routes and about the same number of fixed-route taxis.  On the streets of Yubileinaya, Mira and Borisovka, just a hundred meters from the buildings of the Yaroslavsky residential complex, there are stops of about 10 public transport routes.  By bus and minibus, residents of the complex can reach not only Mytishchi station, which takes no more than 7 minutes, but also to the Medvedkovo metro stop (the journey takes up to 20 minutes), as well as other city objects.  Sometimes during rush hours there are problems with transport due to the large number of passengers and traffic jams, so the time to get to the metro and train.  stations may increase.  Some residents of Yaroslavsky, who have already settled in the rented houses, walk to Taininskaya station, which is about 2500 meters from the complex.  From Taininskaya, as well as from Mytishchi station, electric trains go to the Yaroslavl station.  In the future, the construction of the Chelobitnaya metro station is possible, which will significantly improve the transport accessibility of Yaroslavsky. </p><p>  Motorists are conveniently located in the complex, since along the Mira Street passing next to it, you can quickly get to Volkovsky highway or the Moscow Ring Road. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="PIK group of companies" class="if" height="322" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1689342.jpg" width="490"></div>

PIK, choosing a place for the development of the complex, emphasized the remoteness from industrial facilities.  True, just 700 meters from the LCD there is a thermal power station, but it is equipped with the most advanced equipment and is the leader among similar Russian enterprises in environmental safety.  Car exhaust fumes are much more harmful, but Yaroslavsky is being built at a sufficient distance from large transport arteries.  The Pirogovsky forest park can be called a big plus of the complex, to which it is less than 200 meters from buildings 24 and 28, and a little further from the rest.  Another natural object located near the complex is the Sukromka River with man-made dams created on it. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  In the future, all necessary social facilities will be created in the Yaroslavsky residential complex (Mytishchi).  PIK is a developer who pays great attention to the comfortable life of his clients.  The complex is only under construction, but two kindergartens - "Carousel" and "The Scarlet Flower" - and a school have already been built on its territory. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Yaroslavl Mytishchi reviews" class="if" height="323" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1689328.jpg" width="501"></div>  On the first floors of the buildings it is planned to open stores, clinics, consumer services, sports clubs.  A private kindergarten, a beauty salon, a dental clinic are already operating in building No. 16a, a hairdresser, veterinary clinic, grocery store and beer store have been opened in building 16, and a kids club, sushi bar, and a grocery store in building 12a.  On the territory of the LCD there is even a pool.  In those buildings that are ready for commissioning, the first floors are also non-residential.  There will be shops, bank offices and other organizations.  In total, 4 polyclinics, 4 comprehensive schools, 1 sports school, and 8 kindergartens will be built in the complex.

Construction is carried out using two technologies - panel and monolithic-frame.  In many buildings, the apartments are designed with semicircular bay windows, which gives the buildings a spectacular look.  Entrance areas are equipped with high-speed elevators, strollers, spacious halls, a concierge room.  On non-residential floors there is a place for pantries, where residents can place their belongings.
