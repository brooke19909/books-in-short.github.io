  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Attack on Pearl Harbor</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  On December 7, 1941, Japanese aviation, under the command of Chuichi Nagumo, inflicted an unprecedented force on the US naval base Pearl Harbor, located in the <span>Hawaiian Islands.</span>  414 Japanese torpedo bombers, bombers and fighters swept in two waves over the base of the Navy.  As a result, four <span>battleships</span> were sunk (and the same number were badly damaged), three destroyers, three cruisers, a mine-layer, and, according to various sources, from 188 to 272 aircraft were destroyed. </p><p>  In one day, Americans lost 2,403 people, 1,282 were injured.  In the history of the United States, this was their biggest military loss.  The defeat of the linear forces of the Pacific Fleet of America became the reason for its immediate entry into the Second World War.  Prior to this event, the United States since 1939 maintained a position of neutrality in the war and increased military power through the supply of weapons of the <span>anti-Hitler coalition</span> in Europe. </p><p>  <strong>The attack on Pearl Harbor</strong> was prepared by Japan very carefully.  The command of the American army did not expect such a development of events, since Hawaii is located more than 4 thousand miles from Japan.  From their point of view, if an attack was to be expected, then in the South <span>Pacific,</span> on one of the American colonies - Singapore or Indochina.  Therefore <span>, the naval base</span> at the time of the attack was operating normally. </p><p>  Other bases closer to Europe were more secure and secure.  Almost all units of the Pacific Fleet‚Äôs naval equipment were pulled into Pearl Harbor; hundreds of aircraft were located at neighboring airfields.  Japan sought to destroy the entire American Pacific Fleet in one stroke in order to gain a significant advantage in hostilities. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Researchers call this beginning of war in the ocean incredibly refined.  Complete radio silence, sudden first blows and terrible losses - Japan perfectly understood how to unbalance the strongest world power. </p><p>  The first wave of strikes that hit Pearl Harbor came at 8 in the morning, when Japanese planes filled the skies over the American base.  This happened a few minutes before the flag-raising, the traditional daily American ceremony in blessed Hawaii.  Bombs fell from the air onto ships, the first of which hit the battleship Arizona, killing more than a thousand people.  None of the sailors survived from his crew.  Significant damage to the fleet was also caused by small submarines of the Japanese fleet. </p><p>  One of the Japanese pilots who participated in the attack said later that it was a beautiful sight, the American ships shone, ready for the Sunday parade, so the targets were clearly visible and it was easy to attack.  During the attack, the ships did not have time to make a move, they were all motionless and represented ideal targets for the Japanese.  The US Navy has never experienced such a shame before.  Most of the US fleet in the Pacific Ocean in an hour turned into a pile of <span>metal.</span>  <span>Japanese</span> losses in this battle were minimal. </p><p>  Paradoxical as it may sound, Pearl Harbor, whose history of defeat was so bloody and ruthless, benefited the American Navy.  During 1942, all the remnants of the ships that were not completely destroyed were raised, restored, and significantly modernized and improved.  Fortunately for the Americans, in 1941 the shipbuilding potential of the base was not affected. </p><p>  The revenge for Pearl Harbor was taken by the Americans on the night of October 24‚Äì25, 1944 in the Philippines.  US squadron collided with Japanese battleships, destroying targets in pitch darkness according to radar. </p><p>  Today, the United States celebrates Pearl Harbor Memorial Day, which marks a turning point in US history.  This day was no longer considered a ‚Äúshame‚Äù of the American fleet, it was the beginning of the glory of the country's armed forces, which participated in the defeat of Nazi Germany. </p>
