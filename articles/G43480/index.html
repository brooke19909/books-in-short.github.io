"Why?"  - you ask.  The reason for this was the strengths and weaknesses of this gadget, which we still have to figure out. </p><p>  This model was a continuation of the Honor line.  The manufacturer has released two devices with pretty sophisticated features.  Accordingly, their cost was somewhat high, so the company decided to supplement the line with a ‚Äúlightweight‚Äù device.  That is how the Honor 8 Lite came about.  In Russia, its cost varies between 16,000 rubles.  The Lite prefix symbolizes simpler features compared to the Honor 8 and 8 Pro models.  However, this does not mean at all that hardware will not interest advanced users.  The gadget is based on an 8-core processor, has 4 GB of RAM, is equipped with a screen with Full HD-quality and a battery of 3000 milliamps per hour.  Many buyers were delighted with such characteristics, especially when you consider that they are complemented by a stylish and original design that is ideal for all people without exception.  However, is everything so rosy as it might seem at first glance?  Are there any disadvantages of this device?  Deal with this will help owners reviews. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="huawei honor 8 lite 32gb reviews" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2016246.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Design </h2><p>  The first criterion by which the buyer chooses a new smartphone is design.  This confirms a large number of reviews.  Huawei Honor 8 Lite 32Gb Blue looks amazing.  In addition to the blue version, the line also has black, gold and white.  Each user can choose for himself a favorite color.  However, in these moments it is necessary to pay attention to the soiled surfaces.  Why is this question so relevant for many users?  The reason is the lack of <span>oleophobic coating.</span>  Fingerprints and greasy spots are best seen on the Huawei Honor 8 Lite 32Gb Black.  Reviews of the owners of such an instance suggest that the front and back panels must be constantly wiped with a soft cloth or carry a smartphone in a case.  However, in defense of the black specimen, let's say that it looks very stylish and majestic.  Bright options in this matter have a greater advantage, since fingerprints are almost invisible on their surface. </p><p>  In the comments, users often talk about the quality of the materials that the manufacturer used for the case.  Compared to other models of this line, glass located on the front and back panels can be confused with plastic by touch.  Unfortunately, even the rim passing along the ends of the body is not made of metal.  Users worry that when used, severe scuffs will appear.  In order to prevent abrasion of surfaces, you can use special bumper covers.  Speaking about the body material, the owners noticed another drawback - the surface of the phone is very slippery.  Based on this, users are advised to hold the phone in their hands rather tightly. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But according to the assembly criterion, Huawei Honor 8 Lite 32Gb Gold received only praise reviews.  There are no creaks, backlashes, large gaps on the case.  Details fitted as accurately as possible.  Also commendable is the thickness of the gadget, which is only 7.6 mm.  Users also include the mass of the device (147 g). </p><p>  The ergonomics of the device are thought out pretty well, thanks to the rounded corners of the case and the side edges of the smartphone in the hand is quite comfortable. </p><p>  On the front panel, as usual above the screen, there are notifications indicator, earpiece, camera and sensors.  Large touch screen occupies 70% of the area.  Under it flaunts the name of the ruler.  Touch navigation keys are displayed on the screen.  As for the quality of the speakers, in the comments, users talk about loud clear sound.  During a conversation with a subscriber, the speech sounds clearly and clearly.  In this matter, the manufacturer worked wonderfully. </p><p>  The location of the connectors and controls has not been changed.  At the bottom of the case are the speaker holes, a microphone and a USB port.  At the opposite end, the manufacturer placed an additional microphone and a headset jack.  The side faces are occupied on the right by the volume and lock keys, and on the left is the tray with combined slots.  Although not all users are thrilled, but a memory card is installed instead of the second SIM card. </p><p>  The glossy surface of the back panel of the Huawei Honor 8 Lite 32Gb (photo below) is a significant drawback.  If you approach only from the aesthetic side, then it looks quite impressive, but completely impractical.  One has only to pick up the phone, as soon as a large number of spots and fingerprints remain on it.  This moment really does not please owners who do not use covers.  On the back cover at the bottom is the name of the Honor line.  At the top, the manufacturer installed a camera lens and a flash.  Immediately below them is a fingerprint scanner.  The indisputable advantage is that the lens and flash are made flush with the body.  Thanks to this, there is no need to worry about the fact that they will be constantly scratched. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="huawei honor 8 lite 32gb blue reviews" class="if" height="389" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2016247.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  In the review of Huawei Honor 8 Lite 32Gb RAM 4Gb, it is necessary to include a description of the screen, since users on the forums are actively discussing it.  In this model, the manufacturer has implemented an excellent display with high resolution.  Smartphone owners can enjoy Full HD quality.  A pixel density of 424 ppi indicates a high level of image detail.  With this indicator, the human eye is not able to consider pixelation. </p><p>  A screen diagonal of 5.2 inches opens up great opportunities for the user.  Using your phone, it‚Äôs very convenient to watch movies, chat on social networks, play games.  An indisputable advantage, according to users, is the lack of familiar thick frames. </p><p>  The display is based on a matrix made using IPS technology.  Unfortunately, viewing angles cannot be called wide, since when tilted, the color fades slightly.  For example, white, may even acquire a yellowish tint.  However, at right angles, color reproduction is at a high level.  All shades are displayed saturated and realistic.  The brightness range is sufficient for comfortable operation both in bright sun and in complete darkness. </p><p>  Some users have noticed one fact.  The brightness level affects the color gamut in the phone Huawei Honor 8 Lite 32Gb Black (reviews confirm this).  During testing of this deficiency, it was found that a certain color appeared a red dip, due to which the image on the screen was greatly distorted. </p><p>  Often in the comments, the owners talk about useful features that are implemented in this model.  The most interesting ones are vision protection and automatic color correction. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="huawei honor 8 lite 32gb black reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2016248.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Memory </h2><p>  Speaking of memory, you need to know that the line has three versions.  First, Huawei Honor 8 Lite 32Gb RAM 3Gb Blue provides the user with 3 GB of RAM.  The built-in storage, as the name implies, has a capacity of 32 GB.  This version is the weakest, so to speak. </p><p>  The developers also presented two modifications with four gigabytes of RAM, which have 32 and 64 GB of integrated memory. </p><p>  It is worth noting that both versions - 3/32 GB and 4/32 GB - perfectly cope with all tasks.

The maximum permissible amount of external storage is 256 GB. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  In reviews of the Huawei Honor 8 Lite 32Gb RAM 4Gb, you can also find out about the characteristics of the battery.

In their comments, users claim that with an average load, the device will work for about a day.  During this time, you can connect to 4G, go online via Wi-Fi-module, make calls on 3G networks. </p><p>  However, you need to understand: if you constantly keep LTE on, the battery life will be reduced to about 20 hours. For players, this model is not very suitable, since in this mode at maximum brightness the device can last no more than 4-5 hours on a single charge. When watching a video, you can count on 9 hours. Surfing the Internet will put the battery in 5-6 hours. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="huawei honor 8 lite 32gb specifications" class="if" height="495" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2016250.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Interface </h2><p>  On the seventh version of "Android" is based on Huawei Honor 8 Lite 32Gb Blue.  Reviews on the EMUI 5.0 proprietary shell sound mostly laudatory.  Users highlight some of the innovations.  The operating system has become multitasking.  Now the user can open several applications at once in one window.  For example, if you work simultaneously with two programs, you can switch between them in the following way: hold down the open tab for a few seconds, and the screen will split.  In this case, it will be very convenient to choose the program that you need to switch to.  In addition, the manufacturer provided the ability to resize windows, quick access to functions, displaying them directly in the curtain.  Undoubtedly, in this version of the shell, the menu has become as convenient as possible.  Many comment on this in the comments.  The menu button is now accessible from anywhere.  Well, and the main "trick" - according to users - is counting steps.  This option is displayed on a locked screen. </p><h2>  Highlight features </h2><p>  Users in their reviews of the Huawei Honor 8 Lite 32Gb highlighted some features.  First of all, for its price category, the gadget has an excellent sound.  The speakers work very loudly, and most importantly, efficiently.  The reproduced sound is clean, but the bass sounds a little weak. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that this model works with all available networks.  Users especially highlight 4G support.  The transmission speed when connected to a network is 300 Mbps.  According to users, this is enough to watch video in Full HD. </p><p>  An equally useful option is Signal +.  With it, you can significantly improve the quality of the established connection.  Users assure that this function works fine. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="huawei honor 8 lite 32gb description" class="if" height="416" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2016251.jpg" width="584"></div>

    <h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  From the above information, we can conclude that Huawei Honor 8 Lite 32Gb reviews in most cases gets positive.  The owners distinguish the following in them: </p><ul><li>  Excellent quality of photos taken by "native" cameras. </li><li>  Flawless housing assembly. </li><li>  The current version of "OSes." </li><li>  Clear scanner operation even with wet hands. </li><li>  High level of performance. </li><li>  Spectacular and stylish design. </li><li>  Acceptable battery life. </li><li>  Ability to control some functions using a fingerprint scanner. </li></ul><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  As previously mentioned, Huawei Honor 8 Lite 32Gb receives negative reviews.  Unfortunately, at present, even in the middle price category, it is difficult to find a perfect gadget.  This model is no exception.  A high level of marbling of the glass caused a flurry of complaints.  Many users could not understand why in this model the manufacturer refused oleophobic coating, although it is present in other gadgets of this line.  At first glance, the case made of glass, it immediately becomes clear that you can not do without a cover.  For those who absolutely do not like to use it, this model can be a big problem. </p><p>  Some users drew attention to the fact that in the summer at high temperature during games on the phone the case starts to heat up very much, and for this it takes about one hour of operation in this mode. </p><p>  Besides the fact that glass surfaces are easily soiled, they are also very slippery.  Many users have the feeling that the case will not withstand falling on a hard surface, as it looks rather fragile. </p><p>  There are owners who have comments on the gyroscope.  Errors occur when watching a 360-degree video.  Well, if you find fault with a lot of things, then the disadvantages include problems with the color rendering of the screen that occur at different levels of brightness. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="huawei honor 8 lite 32gb ram 3gb blue" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2016252.jpg" width="432"></div>

    <h2>  Finally </h2><p>  So, the review of Huawei Honor 8 Lite 32Gb is completed.  Reviews both negative and positive were considered in full.  Based on them, we can conclude that by and large the phone justifies its price.  However, if the potential disadvantages scare away potential buyers, it is better to abandon this model.  The weakest side of this phone is the lack of oleophobic coating, which leads to the fact that in a few minutes the phone loses its presentable appearance.  It follows that if you purchase a cover, then many of the shortcomings simply disappear by themselves.  As for the technical equipment, it fully complies with modern requirements. </p>
