  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Novgorod Cross: description, history</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, the Novgorod Cross is known to many under a different name and belonging to radical youth movements in Europe.  They call him Celtic, shy and even condemned, not knowing what his real story is.  The cross with the circle at one time assumed the same sacred meaning for Christians, as, for example, the icon.  It is a mistake to believe that he had a pagan influence, however, such a theory may be, since there is no evidence to the contrary.  The article will talk about several of the most famous theories of the origin of the Novgorod Cross, as well as the reasons behind the widespread use of this symbolism. </p><h2>  Primary description </h2><p>  This symbol is one of the variations of the cross of the Order of the Poor Knights of Christ, also known as the Templars.  It represents the intersection of two lines inscribed in a circle.  It has a solar value and pagan origin, which will be discussed later.  It is sometimes presented in the form of a solid circle with small slots between the elements.  It was made both in stone and in wood.  It has similar features with elements of religious significance of the 11th century Irish Catholic Church of our era.  The exact history of the origin and significance of the Novgorod Cross remains hidden from the public today. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemaster.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="image of the Novgorod cross" class="if uuid-2712914" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57634/2712914.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, a simpler and more modern variation of this element is also known, which provides for cruciform formations at each end of the initial cross.  The differences between the individual variants of this emblem are also obscure and not explored. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Possible "progenitor" </h2><p>  The symbolism of the Templars, as well as the influences that influenced it, remain poorly understood.  These or other types of crosses were formed due to a certain, bright and significant event.  An example of such an image formation scenario is crucifixion.  <span>The Templar cross</span> also rests on the history of the Celts, has a similar style and style features. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ancient-origins.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cross with a circle" class="if uuid-2712937" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57634/2712937.jpg"></div><p>  Such sigils were called cinquefoil due to the characteristic shape of the elements.  In addition, the general theory of the formation of crosses claims that such signs were borrowed by Christianity for a more smooth and understandable transition from paganism to a new faith. </p><h2>  The significance of the Templar Cross </h2><p>  First of all, it is worth noting the color scheme of this element.  Almost always, it was executed in a scarlet shade, which symbolized the blood of Christ shed for sinners, or the willingness of the <span>wandering knight</span> to make sacrifices in order to assert his faith.  In addition, the Templar cross was also called the fiery cross.  Analogies come to mind with the light, the throne of the Lord, consisting of fire, purification and incineration. </p><div class="photo" data-original="moralepatchdatabase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Novgorod cross meaning" class="if uuid-2712938" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57634/2712938.jpg"></div><p>  It is quite possible that the same symbol as the Novgorod cross was a kind of personification of the sun, its healing and punishing sides.  However, in addition to this, there are also many other hypotheses, according to which the Templar emblem is just a reference to the crucifixion as such. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The key theory of the meaning of the Novgorod Cross </h2><p>  In this case, it is also appropriate to talk about the "solar" nature of this element.  The Novgorod cross has pagan roots in the form of a "sun wheel", a sigil, in which there was also an emphasis on the rotation of the celestial body with four points of "support" in the form of the winter solstice, the spring equinox, the summer solstice and the autumn equinox.  This form of the original cross was observed in Novgorod almost everywhere until the 15th century, when key symbols underwent a series of changes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.grad-petrov.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Templar Cross" class="if uuid-2712924" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57634/2712924.jpg"></div><p>  In this context, it is appropriate to assert that the Novgorod cross was a direct consequence of the absorption of paganism by the ideas of Christianity with the borrowing of similar sacred elements and their meanings.  It is noteworthy that the hypothesis is supported by the fact that the shrines of Novgorod were also decorated with a "cross placed in a circle", and Christ himself was personified for a long time with sunlight, heat, and healing power. </p><h2>  By analogy with the Celtic cross </h2><p>  The cross of St. Columbus is a kind of personification of Celtic Christianity as such.  This is an extremely popular symbol today.  The reason for this state of affairs is the fact that supporters of the ‚ÄúWhite superiority‚Äù movement use this particular variation of this symbol. </p><div class="photo" data-original="zydog.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="types of crosses" class="if uuid-2712926" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57634/2712926.jpg"></div><p>  Organizations of this kind range from simple proponents of nationalist ideas to armed and dangerous gangs.  Supporters of neo-Nazism are also found in Eastern Europe.  It is somewhat sad that a powerful religious symbol has acquired such significance. </p><h2>  History and Parallels </h2><p>  It is no secret that until the time when the Irish Catholic Church fell under the heel and sword of Rome in 1085, this structure had considerable weight both in its homeland and in Europe.  Including in the east.  Moreover, while in the states close to the papacy, there were noticeable attempts to establish a single faith, as well as a craving for church asceticism, then closer to the Carpathians it is not difficult to note the influence of the Church of Ireland.  According to the legend, St. Patrick erected a cross with a circle on the island in order to combine the sacred symbol of Christ and the emblem of the personified pagan deity of the Sun, thereby strengthening the young belief in the minds of former pagans.  So far are such realities from Novgorod? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.whats-your-sign.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Novgorod cross description" class="if uuid-2712939" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57634/2712939.jpg"></div><p>  In France, for example, a Celtic cross flaunts in the Cathedral of the Holy Cross.  It, like many other similar symbols in shrines, dates from around the 15th century.  It is possible that the ideas embedded in Celtic Christianity were close to the Slavs.  Even taking into account the fact that Novgorod is located a little further from the permanent settlements of the Normans, it is quite possible that the key ideas of a more accessible, idle and understandable Irish Catholic Church were received more softly than the harsh dogmas of another denomination.  Hence the similarity of religious symbolism in two locations far from each other.  Different types of crosses have common features.  It is possible that such a coincidence is by no means accidental. </p><h2>  What should be the attitude? </h2><p>  To say that the description of the Novgorod cross is 100% known, at least incorrect.  However, one cannot help but condemn the fact that he is often confused with the emblem of neo-Nazism and his supporters are attributed to the participants in this radical movement.  Despite the confusion in the origin, as well as some uncertainty in the formation, the Novgorod cross still remains a Christian symbol.  Moreover, this emblem is a historical monument, which is still not worth insulting with a biased attitude.  As for his current position, the Novgorod cross is worthy of preservation, as well as the reverence characteristic of all Orthodox shrines. </p>
