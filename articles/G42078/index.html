    <h2>  Bit of history </h2><p>  Mongolia is a republic where the customs and traditions of the population go back to the most ancient peoples, who once inhabited the territory of Central Asia. </p><p>  Many customs are echoes of ancient Buddhist and shamanistic rites, in which the religious purpose and content was lost over time.  However, some ritual actions are still observed by local residents. </p><p>  There are many beliefs and prohibitions that have common Central Asian roots.  Therefore, they are the same for both Buryans and Mongols. </p><p>  In addition, it should be noted that many Mongols still keep and sacredly honor the ancient customs of nomadic life, and now they live in felt yurts and exist due to the maintenance of ancestral subsistence farming. </p><p>  In general, people in the territories of Mongolia appeared a long time ago, many thousands of years ago.  Since ancient prehistoric times, it has been inhabited by nomads, periodically forming various state confederations.  The Chinese built the famous Great Wall precisely because of those very ancient Mongols. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mongolia (republic): the capital" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/1226303.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How did it all start? </h2><p>  The Mongol leader named Temujin in 1206 acquired the title of Genghis Khan and conquered a number of countries and peoples.  So the <span>Mongol Empire</span> appeared <span>.</span>  After the death of Genghis Khan, it was divided into four khanates.  In those days, the empire was located in the territories from Korea to Poland, and from Vietnam in the south to Siberia in the north. </p><p>  Since the 16th century, Buddhism began to spread in Mongolia after frequent internecine wars for power and the invasion of Chinese troops. </p><p>  Mongolia was controlled by the Chinese Qing Dynasty until 1911. </p><p>  So, is Mongolia a republic or not? </p><p>  MPR, moreover friendly USSR, was formed in 1924. </p><p>  And since 1992, officially the Mongolian People's Republic began to be called Mongolia. </p><h2>  Religion </h2><p>  Mongolia is a republic dominated by Mahayana Buddhism (94%), shamanism in its northern part and Islam (4%) in the western.  Only in the twentieth century, the country had many Buddhist monasteries - several hundred, and about 30% of the male population were monks. </p><p>  Since the thirties of the same century, an anti-religious campaign has been launched in Mongolia, which has practically destroyed the vast system of monasteries.  Many were closed, and some were plundered and destroyed.  However, after certain democratic transformations (90s), religious freedom was declared.  The monasteries began their activity again.  In Ulan Bator today there is even an Orthodox church.  The republic of Mongolia is peculiar in terms of religion. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  In the great ancient Mongolia, a great many unique archaeological and historical-architectural monuments have been preserved.  Near the river  Chultyn-Gol is the oldest Neolithic drawings, which are under the protection of UNESCO. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Republic of Mongolia: Attractions" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/1223945.jpg"></div>

Every July in Mongolia, Naddam is celebrated with traditional Mongolian competitions in horse racing, archery and wrestling;  the end of winter time and the coming of the New Year are celebrated - also with competitions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mongolia - republic or not" class="if" height="392" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/1223943.jpg" width="600"></div>
