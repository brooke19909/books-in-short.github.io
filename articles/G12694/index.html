    <p>  “Princess from Oriental Tales”, “First Beauty of the Muslim World”, “Woman with Gazelle Eyes” - Rania, Queen of Jordan, was awarded such epithets by the grace of the world press.  In addition, journalists do not forget to mention that she broke the prevailing stereotype of a passive, silent and wrapped up Islamic woman in her very eyes.  Who is she - this mysterious Rania, Queen of Jordan, the most beautiful titled person of our time and the most elegant woman in the world according to the magazine “Hello!”? </p><p>  The daughter of a doctor who lost everything that he had - home, work and peaceful life, as a result of the Israeli occupation in 1967 of the so-called West Bank.  Rania's father fled to Kuwait and started there from scratch.  He raised his daughter freely and did not constrain her by customs, which he considered obsolete or violating the <span>rights of women.</span>  Her Kuwaiti classmates were shocked by the mores of a Palestine refugee who refused to wear a hijab and stated that it was everyone’s personal business to wear a headscarf or not.  And when she decided to go to university, the neighbors were horrified.  However, the future Queen of Jordan, Rania believed that the mind and the ability to earn money do not deprive a woman of <span>faith in God,</span> and everything else is prejudice.  That was her <span>life motto.</span>  So he remains. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

She was a very ambitious student and “nibbled on the granite of science” to become a professional.  At the same time, despite the beauty, no one did her marriage proposal.  The surrounding men believed that she was too unusual and independent, and it would not be easy with her.  And, like their European and American counterparts, they preferred someone simpler.  But then the family suffered another blow.  At first, Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait, and then all Palestinians in bulk were declared traitors and expelled.  The family of Rania again lost everything, and the girl was only twenty years old.  I had to leave for Jordan, where the Palestinians were received, but the heroine of our article did not want to leave Cairo.  Moreover, she found a job at Apple.

    <p>  She did not yet know what “Rania, Queen of Jordan” would be called, but even then she was proud.  When the girl thought she was being humiliated at the workplace because of her gender, she left the company.  Then she accepted the offer of the Jordanian Citibank, which was controlled by the daughter of the then king of the country.  Princess Aisha became friends with an independent and intelligent Palestinian, somewhat similar to her, and began to invite her to her place.  There, Rania met her fate.  It was Prince Abdullah.  A handsome man with a military bearing, a European education and respect for women, he also could not find a girlfriend.  Submissive and agreeable to all the "typical Muslims" he did not like.  No matter how trite, they fell in love at first sight.  So she got her title Rania - “Queen of Jordan”. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

Rania, although she liked the offer, was somewhat scared - yet she did not expect such a take-off in her biography.  But since the prince was not an heir then, they decided to live a normal, albeit rich life in love and harmony.  Abdullah's father, King Hassan, was not opposed, and was even glad that his son had finally decided to marry.  The wedding was played in 1993 according to all Eastern customs, although Rania did not put on a scarf even after marriage.  The newlyweds traveled, and then took up the house.  At leisure, which they could not occupy, they rode a motorcycle and a jeep, jumped from a parachute - in general, had fun as they could.

    <p>  When Rania gave birth to a son a year later, the king became interested in her, who appreciated the mind of the young woman, and in everything began to ask her advice.  Then she became a mother again - now girls.  She has four children in total.  In the late 1990s, the king died, but before his death made her husband Rania an heir.  And then a new monarchy appeared before the whole world.  She was barely 29. From now on, she is the Queen of Jordan, Rania, whose photo is now considered an honor to publish any magazine.  She is known for her progressive views, charity, and love for ordinary people.  It was she who owned the idea that the king embodies, as well as his courtiers.  From time to time, pretending to be ordinary citizens, they check how officials work.  Rania stands for women's rights, for education for girls.  You can write about her endlessly - about this amazing oriental princess.  Her fame is well deserved. </p>
