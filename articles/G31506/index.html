    <p>  In this article, the reader is given the opportunity to get acquainted with a wonderful device for finding treasures.  Overview, specifications, settings, diagrams and reviews of owners will help a potential buyer quickly navigate the market of specialized equipment. </p><h2>  Short excursion </h2><p>  In fact, the connection of the metal detector with a fairy-tale character is not connected with hiding the treasure and jewelry, but with the first two letters of the names of the developers Yuri Kolokolov and Andrey Shchedrin.  Two mechanical engineers have been known among radio amateurs for many years.  They, in addition to the production of specialized equipment for the search for metal, have earned credibility in instrumentation. </p><p>  Unlike foreign manufacturers of metal detectors, Russian scientists did not hide the principle of operation of the devices they created and provided customers with the opportunity to change the technical characteristics of electronics.  The detector circuit, a detailed description of the basic structural elements and a complete setup guide are present in the usual instructions that are supplied with the device.  It is this attitude towards the future owner that attracts a large number of potential buyers to the device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Ordinary miracle </h2><p>  To search for metal objects at shallow depths and in the walls of old buildings, an inexpensive impulse device is best.  The Koschey-5I metal detector, worth about 5,000 rubles, is able to interest buyers who acquire such a specific device for the first time. </p>

    <p>  All the functionality of this device is based on the operation of the microcontroller and a small program, and the simplicity of the design allows the owner to make improvements on their own, improving the sensitivity of the device as necessary.  The principle of its operation is quite simple - the coil creates an electromagnetic field that changes its characteristics when passing through metal objects.  The microcontroller analyzes the initial signal with the final value and gives the result to the user. </p><h2>  Convenience and simplicity </h2><p>  Cheap metal detectors have one unpleasant feature - the lack of a liquid crystal display.  Naturally, the owner may have many questions regarding the setup of the device, the software part is especially interesting, which, according to the manufacturer, is easily amenable to change. </p>

    <p>  As practice shows, the problem can be solved in two ways: using the programmer and connecting the unit to a personal computer.  If everything is simple and clear with programming the microcircuit, then there are clearly questions to the second method.  In the instruction manual, the manufacturer not only described in detail the method for connecting the metal detector to the X4 port, but also indicated the model of the adapter that the user would need to solve the problem.  In fact, you can connect to a computer not only a pulsed metal detector, but also any other device that has an appropriate X4 interface. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Universal baby </h2><p>  It is clear that under the concept of ‚Äúmetal‚Äù, in fact, not only <span>noble metals,</span> but also any garbage made of steel or cast iron can be hidden.  Naturally, the treasure hunter will be interested in the possibility of identifying only treasures.  It was for such purposes that the Koschey-20M metal detector was created.  A feature of this device is that the device can operate in <span>the frequency range of</span> 4-10 kHz, and accordingly, the user himself is able to control the power of the <span>electric coil.</span> </p><p>  In addition to the basic characteristics needed to search for treasures, the detector has a lot of useful and useless functions.  Firstly, the device is flashed at the software level, and on the manufacturer‚Äôs official website a selection of ready-made programs is available for its accurate operation in different operating conditions.  The manufacturer did not save on the sound indication either, by setting up a full polyphony.  But the ability to access the device by PIN-code causes only a smile on the face of the treasure hunter. </p><h2>  Light at the end of the tunnel </h2><p>  Do not expect the impossible from the device when buying.  It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs expensive or cheap metal detectors, in any case, the user will have to fine-tune each type of soil.  Experts in this field recommend that beginners use the proven method with three coins (steel, bronze, gold), which must be individually buried to a depth of 20-30 centimeters. </p>

    <p>  Further, everything is simple - driving a contour over the treasures and changing the frequency, you need to find out which sound indication corresponds to each metal to which Koschey (metal detector) will react.  As practice shows, at a frequency of 10 kilohertz, noble metals of gold and silver are perfectly detected, and regardless of depth.  The sound produced by the device is quite melodic, it is easy to remember.  But for the search for metals based on copper, the <span>frequency range is</span> better to shift to a smaller side (6-7 kHz). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Strange modifications </h2><p>  Finds by a metal detector are sometimes so valuable that many device owners get dizzy - they have a desire to buy a more powerful and expensive treasure hunter.  You should not rush to change the manufacturer, developers have something to surprise the buyer.  On the basis of the Koschey-20M instrument there is an improved Professional version with a Goliaf coil. </p><p>  Having retained the appearance of the metal detector, including the control panel and ease of use, the manufacturer managed to create a more powerful and sensitive device.  Firstly, the device is capable of separating precious metals from ferrous metals at great depths, even if they are in close proximity to each other.  The second advantage is the ability to operate the coil in the air, being above the surface of the earth at a distance of 5-10 centimeters. </p><h2>  All inclusive </h2><p>  Naturally, the Russian manufacturer should have at least one modification that can satisfy the wishes of even the most demanding customers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metal detector koschey 5i" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1230035.jpg"></div>  The Koschey-25K metal detector is a peculiar leader among all detector manufacturers.  Better to start with technical specifications that are really able to surprise future owners:

    <ol><li>  The maximum depth for determining an object is 3 meters.  Apparently, under such a layer of earth it is unlikely to be able to find a coin, but the tank will fix the tank from the time of the Second World War or other large metal structures. </li><li>  Adjustable operating frequency ranges - 4-12 kHz and 400 Hz. </li><li>  Support for popular sensors: single-frequency, multi-frequency, pulse. </li><li>  Several search modes (selective, pulse, non-selective). </li></ol><h2>  Needle in a haystack </h2><p>  The richer the device‚Äôs functionality, the greater its effectiveness in finding treasures hidden under a small layer of earth.  Naturally, the Koschey metal detector, whose price is in the range of 15-20 thousand rubles, attracts the attention of buyers.  True, few of the newcomers know that in reality all the functionality will not be used by the user, because the universal device perfectly copes with the task and in one mode of operation (we are talking about impulse search). </p>

    <p>  Therefore, before buying, it is better to consult with experts and decide for yourself what the buyer means by treasures.  Some users need a device to search for lost jewelry near water bodies, while others are interested in finding military graves.  Definitely: there must be a serious approach to buying an expensive device. </p><h2>  Build quality and ergonomics </h2><p>  This is not to say that the manufacturer paid much attention to the appearance of the device.  Rather, on the contrary, carried away by the functionality and efficiency, engineers completely forgot about the build quality.  In the media there are a lot of reviews regarding the cheap appearance that a metal detector has.  Comparing the device with similar foreign devices, a significant difference is noticeable not only in the quality of manufacture, but also in ergonomics. </p>

    <p>  However, during operation, the attitude to the device may completely change with the owner.  The simple design is reliable and practically does not give in to deformations during falling or blows.  Therefore, it is up to the buyer to decide what is more important for him: to find finds with a metal detector that has external beauty, or one that has increased strength. </p><h2>  Decent service </h2><p>  The domestic product is still interesting because in the specialized markets of the Russian Federation the owner can always purchase the necessary accessories and spare parts for his device.  And do not think that the choice is limited to microcircuits and coils.  On the shelves you can see: cases for electronic components, brackets, handles, sensors and even modified circuits of all devices. </p><p>  As practice shows, the electronic circuit of the metal detector and the search coil are the most popular elements of the device.  After all, it is they who determine the effectiveness of the device.  However, before buying spare parts, many experts recommend that the user first try to change the firmware of the metal detector, since often this is the action that allows you to configure the detector more efficiently. </p><h2>  Comparison with analogues </h2><p>  In its price category, the domestic device has virtually no competitors.  In their reviews, enthusiasts often compare the Koschey pulse detector with a similar Fisher-2 device.  It is not surprising that the Russian device wins in all tests, because, in fact, these are two completely different detectors that simply ended up in the same price category. </p>

    <p>  So, Fisher is designed to search for small products from non-ferrous metals and alloys at shallow depths (up to 30 cm).  It has a low sensitive coil and does not work through the air.  And "Koschey" (metal detector), on the contrary, is focused on great depths, large objects and is able to work in different frequency ranges.  Comparison is best done according to the declared technical characteristics, and not in the price category. </p><h2>  Owner reviews </h2><p>  As practice shows, everything directly depends on the requirements of the user that he presents to the device.  Even in the store, he can decide on the search for treasures and choose the right coil for the metal detector (the manufacturer provides this opportunity).  Therefore, it is not surprising that all the negative feedback from the owners is connected with the operation of the detector itself, which does not work with a certain soil. </p><p>  There is another significant drawback that the Koschey metal detector has.  User reviews negatively describe the convenience of setup and operation - mechanical buttons, a separately programmable microcircuit, and difficulties with control for a 21st century device are clearly overkill.  On the other hand, any owner will be able to program the device for himself, which cannot be done with foreign counterparts. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Quite mixed feelings leaves behind "Koschey" (metal detector) during the first meeting.  An obviously underdeveloped outwardly simple device a priori should not have such huge functionality and demonstrate such attractive features.  Therefore, recommendations to future owners will be equally vague.  Need 100% performance, despite the build quality and visual appeal?  The Koschey metal detector will be the best purchase!  But more demanding users need to look at the device in a completely different price category. </p>
