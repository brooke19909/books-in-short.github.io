For people, in principle, development is characteristic.  However, in order to evaluate progress, it is necessary to make a comparison, because everything is known in comparison. </p><h2>  History of creation </h2><p>  Few buildings built in the 16-19th century have survived to our days, and when we look at them, then progress is visible on the face.  However, these buildings can not but arouse admiration, because they are unique and have a certain charm and majesty.  A striking example is the Friedrichsburg Gate, which was built in 1650. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dreamstime.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Type of gate" class="if uuid-2604163" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74177/2604163.jpg"></div><p>  Initially, according to the decree of Friedrich Wilhelm, the Friedrichsburg fortress was built according to the ideas of the mathematician C. Otter.  The historical site was erected in 1657, on the territory of present Kaliningrad to protect the Pregel.  This fortress had a bastion type; its topographic shape had a square appearance with four bastions. </p><h2>  Cognitive facts </h2><p>  It is interesting that Peter I visited this fortress in 1697 with the aim of studying the bombardment business.  Also, the Friedrichsburg fortress was considered a kind of model for the construction of several forts.  The building itself became a fort only in the 19th century, after significant modernization. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  An interesting fact is that the fortress did not participate in hostilities throughout its existence, however, it was intentionally destroyed in 1910, as it was declared obsolete and ceased to be a military target.  The building itself was purchased by the imperial railway.  The ditches were filled up, and the shafts were torn.  Railway tracks were laid on the territory, as well as a railway bridge was created. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Central view" class="if uuid-2604134" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74177/2604134.jpg"></div><p>  Nowadays, you can see only the Friedrichsburg Gate in Kaliningrad, which is the only element preserved from the fortress, in addition to the barracks, which was located on the east side.  The gates themselves were built according to the design of F.A. St√ºler in 1852.  They were made of figured burnt bricks and belong to the neo-Gothic style. </p><h2>  Description of Attraction </h2><p>  A feature of the fortress itself is the bastions.  There are four of them.  The bastions were named: Pearls, Diamond, Emerald and Ruby.  Buildings such as a church, a prison, barns, a Zeighouse, a barracks, a commandant‚Äôs office, and a guardhouse were located in a quadrangular courtyard. </p><p>  The gates were decorated with false windows in the Gothic style, as well as decorations in the form of serrated parapets.  In the center there is an arch, and on the sides you can observe casemates for the garrison.  Round towers are located on both sides of the main aisle. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 1960, the Friedrichsburg Gate was given the status of a monument of urban planning and architecture, despite the fact that before that they were subject to demolition, like the main fortress, due to some damage during the Second World War.  When the Koenigsberg was stormed in 1945, the gates were subjected to some destruction.  The southeastern part of the guard wall was almost destroyed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mapio.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="General view of the coat of arms" class="if uuid-2604142" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74177/2604142.jpg"></div><p>  Initially, the gates were not restored, and they continued to collapse.  However, in the beginning of the 21st century, large-scale work began on the reconstruction and improvement of the historical monument.  After this restoration, the Friedrichsburg Gate became a branch of the Museum of the World Ocean. </p><h2>  Property Location </h2><p>  Address of the Friedrichsburg Gate in Kaliningrad: Portovaya St., 39A.  For those who want to find a point of interest, the map below will help determine the exact location. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="54.704836" data-lng="20.494382900000005" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/5/2/2/8/5228.png"></div><h2>  Kaliningrad Landmark: Friedrichsburg Gate and the Museum of the World Ocean </h2><p>  Around Koenigsberg built new shaft fortifications in the middle of the 19th century.  At this time, the Friedrichsburg fortress was rebuilt into the eponymous fort.  Only by 1852, large-scale gates were built in it.  The very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project was born in the imagination of the court Prussian architect August St√ºler.  In the post-war period, the gate was first a field military printing house, and then a convoy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dreamstime.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Close-up" class="if uuid-2604152" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74177/2604152.jpg"></div><p>  Here are some more events that the building had to endure: </p><ul><li>  In 1960, the Friedrichsburg Gate began to be protected by the state as an architectural monument. </li><li>  In 2002, this object acquired the status of cultural heritage of federal significance. </li><li>  In 2007, the Friedrichsburg Gate became a branch of the Museum of the World Ocean, which, incidentally, also includes a two-tier railway bridge. </li></ul><h2>  Restoration work </h2><p>  For restoration, modern materials and masonry methods were used.  During the war, this attraction was destroyed by 25%.  Today we have a real opportunity to assess the scale of destruction.  Only by 2011, this atypical, one-of-a-kind building, with the presence of emblems on the facade, towers and massive iron gates, acquired the very outlines that were characteristic of it back then, during the construction.  Some of the most talented restorers, originally from Kaliningrad, St. Petersburg and Nizhny Novgorod, have made efforts to recreate the Friedrichsburg Gate in its original form. </p><h2>  Interesting fact </h2><p>  The Friedrichsburg Gate was the only gate of its kind that led to the castle of the same name, which was located on the southern bank of the Pregel River, and not to the city of Koenigsberg itself.  When the Great Russian Embassy was in the city, the Russian Tsar Peter I underwent artillery training under the name of the officer Pyotr Mikhailov in the Friedrichsburg Fortress.  The training itself was conducted by Colonel von Sternfeld, a Brandenburg specialist.  When the tsar returned to Moscow, he received a certificate where it was written: </p><blockquote><p>  "To recognize and honor Pyotr Mikhailov as being a perfect at throwing bombs, careful and skillful firearms artist." </p></blockquote><h2>  Excursions and expositions </h2><p>  At the moment, in the building of the Friedrichsburg Gate there is an amazing museum "Lodeyny Dvor", which is not only an ordinary museum, but also a real shipyard.  There you can see historical ships that were made using unique ancient technologies.  Judging by the reviews, it is simply impossible to tear yourself away from these exhibits. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Excursion ships" class="if uuid-2604154" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74177/2604154.jpg"></div><p>  A special exposition ‚ÄúShip Sunday‚Äù was created for teenagers, children and adults, its purpose is to inform about the Russian Navy.  Great interest in this exhibition is justified by the fact that absolutely everyone can take part in the construction of a historic ship made of wood with launching.  Judging by the reviews, it is especially interesting for those who, as a child, loved to create various models of airplanes and ships. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ship sunday" class="if uuid-2604432" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14550/2604432.jpg"></div><p>  Tourists are strongly advised to visit the exhibition, which is dedicated to traditional marine ships of different nations and eras.  On it you can observe various navigation devices, ship models, and much more.  There is also an atypical exhibition dedicated to the ships that sank, as well as various underwater excavations, so this tour will definitely not leave anyone indifferent. </p><p>  In order to give visitors a more vivid and memorable experience from visiting the Friedrichsburg Gate, at the end of the tour they show a short film on a large screen that will familiarize visitors with information about the Russian fleet on a larger scale.  All visitors to the museum are advised to definitely see it.  Information is presented in an accessible form, and the video sequence is striking in its entertainment. </p><p>  During various holidays on the territory of the sights, various events are held that are dedicated to the sea and shipbuilding, because the spirit of marine traditions that are characteristic of the city in the Baltic Sea "lives here." </p><p>  Leaving this sea place, you can throw a ‚Äúgood luck‚Äù coin to a cat that sits at the exit and then your life will definitely be filled with luck! </p><p>  If you want to visit the object, be sure to remember the address of the Friedrichsburg Gate: Kaliningrad, Portovaya Street, building 39A. </p>
