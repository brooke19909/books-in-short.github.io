Bordered by tombs, catacombs and temples, it was actively used in the Middle Ages.  Connecting the main settlements of the great empire, it was a real miracle of engineering Appian Way in Rome. </p><h2>  The story of the creation of the great way </h2><p>  The Consul of the Roman Republic, Appius Claudius, went down in history precisely as the creator of the most significant highway connecting the Eternal City, Capua and Benevent.  Soon the way was brought to the seaport of Brundisia (Brindisi).  True, some researchers believe that the route has already been laid, and the politician only ordered to pave it in high quality.  The person responsible for the construction of the patricians controlled the process, and as a result the Appian Way appeared in Rome (Italy), capable of withstanding all the loads. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="appieva road in rome how to get" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1739925.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The military leader was criticized for having spent almost the entire state budget, but over time, the economic feasibility of the route was confirmed.  Opponents of Claudius reproached him for using such an expensive project only for their glorification, and were right, because when mentioning the name Appius, the first thing that comes to mind is a 5-kilometer-long road of the same name.  And this despite the fact that the politician made a huge contribution to the development of jurisprudence and even literature. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The construction of a famous landmark, the construction process of which took place in several stages, began in 312 BC, and ended two centuries later.  The Romans installed milestones with useful information for travelers, and two majestic marble columns, marking the end of the road, and one of them can now be seen at the very place where it was erected.  The second was donated to Lecce - the center of the province of the same name in Italy.  After getting rid of the last plague epidemic in the history of the city, residents erected an antique column in the main square. </p><h2>  Reasons for the appearance of Via Appia Antica </h2><p>  Historians believe that the main reason for the construction of a wide highway, paved with huge boulders, was military necessity: Roman legionnaires marched along it, who set off the war against the Samnites.  In addition, it connected the capital with the most remote regions of the state so that the authorities could control them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="appieva road in rome creation story" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1739924.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Over time, the Appian Way in Rome, praised in literary works and imprinted on paintings, acquired great economic importance: its creation improved trade relations between the East and Rome.  And in the Middle Ages, the highway turned into a sacred path for pilgrims.  Soon, magnificent palaces and tombs of noble citizens began to be built along the warpath and the trading artery.  A significant part of the structures after the collapse of the Roman Empire was dismantled, and in the XVIII century a new highway with the same name appeared, the path of which passes from the capital of the state to Lake Albanian.  Therefore, the official name of the ancient highway is the Old Appian Way in Rome. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Strict control and workmanship </h2><p>  The track with a multilayer coating, consisting of stones about a meter thick, has been perfectly preserved, despite its very solid age, and even at present some of its sections are suitable for operation.  One can note the special skill of builders who polished to a shine and carefully fitted basalt slabs to each other, between which there was not a single gap. </p><p>  There is an ancient legend according to which Appius Claudius, who controlled the process, inserted a thin dagger blade between the stones to check the quality of the masonry.  As soon as he managed to do this, the workers paved the road again.  Thanks to this, it turned out to be very smooth, which made it convenient for both travelers on foot and chariots drawn by horses.  The builders leveled the surface, and the stones were laid on previously laid layers of sand and pebbles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="appieva road in rome italy" class="if" height="424" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1739914.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It is curious that the middle part of the route was elevated, and even after heavy rains, water flowed to the side of the road, where workers dug ditches for its removal, and the Appian Way in Rome always remained dry.  Its width, which is about four meters, allowed the chariots to freely disperse. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Archaeological park </h2><p>  Today, the road, the uniqueness of which lies in its durability, has the status of a state, and on its territory there is an archaeological park, formed in the XIX century.  On the track, the sections of which are covered with modern asphalt, you can see the corners with a well-preserved antique coating, where traces of ancient carts are left.  And the canvas, unsuitable for operation, was destroyed not by time, but by the owners of the land located next to the road.  After the <span>Roman Empire</span> fell into decay, stone slabs were uprooted and used in the construction of residential buildings. </p><h2>  The road where the atmosphere of the Eternal City is felt </h2><p>  The Appian Way in Rome, whose history began before our era, is not only a promenade, but also a sports track: in 1960, the Olympians competed here, and now various events are held.  On weekends and holidays, it is closed to vehicles.  A huge number of excursion programs gives tourists a great opportunity to get acquainted with the ancient road and unique structures erected along it along the entire route from the capital of Italy to Brindisi.  It is worth coming here in order to fully experience the atmosphere of the Eternal City. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="appieva road in rome route" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1739916.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Prestigious location along the road </h2><p>  The well-designed Appian Way in Rome, the route of which began from the Kapensky Gates, completely destroyed at the present time, has become a favorite place for burials of wealthy citizens.  The fact is that on the territory of the city during the heyday of the great empire it was forbidden to bury the dead.  And immediately after the appearance of Regina Viarum, which translates from Italian as ‚Äúthe queen of the roads‚Äù, not only funeral constructions, but also luxury villas began to be erected on the adjacent sections, since these places were considered very prestigious.  The Roman nobility built huge family crypts in which they buried their loved ones, columbaria, memorable steles. </p><p>  With the spread of Christianity along the highway, the graves of those who adopted the new religion began to appear.  They were buried in catacombs - underground cemeteries with a whole network of passages and galleries.  Over time, many monuments collapsed, and they were disassembled into building materials.  Most of the ancient and medieval buildings that reached the descendants recalls the former greatness of Ancient Rome and its rich history. </p><h2>  What to see? </h2><p>  The most interesting structure is the stone mausoleum of Cecilia Metella, which is more similar in shape to a fortress.  From the tomb, which eventually turned into a military fortification, the remains of the daughter of the great politician were transferred to another place. </p><p>  The Appian Way in Rome is a famous pilgrimage route where a small temple, Domine Quo Vadis, was rebuilt in the 17th century.  It was erected at the place where Jesus and St. Peter met.  In the legendary church, a relic is stored - a copy of a stone slab with imprints of Christ's footprints.  It beats out the wish of a good journey to the pilgrims who came here to pray and ask for a safe return home. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="appieva road in rome history" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1740205.jpg" width="565"></div>

    <p>  Instead of the huge estate of Kvintiliev, now you can see only picturesque ruins.  Once the Roman ruler treacherously captured a magnificent villa, killing its owners.  So it happened that the emperor found his death in her - he died in a residence during the conspiracy. </p><p>  The tomb of Scipio, in which members of the famous aristocratic family rest, was forgotten by everyone, and only in the XVIII century archaeologists got to it, and the discovered exhibits are in the <span>Vatican Museum.</span> </p><p>  Villa Maxentius is the former residence of the cruel emperor.  Now it remains from the ruins of red brick, and several centuries ago it was a grandiose architectural complex consisting of a magnificent palace, a mausoleum and a circus.  After the death of the ruler, the monument was destroyed, and only 50 years ago, local authorities thought about its reconstruction. </p><h2>  Underground cemeteries </h2><p>  For many kilometers along the highway stretched the catacombs of San Callisto, which can be visited on all days except Wednesday.  In the "city of the dead" with narrow stone corridors and walled niches, you can learn about the pagan and Christian culture of underground burials.  This is a rather gloomy place where it is always cold and eternal darkness reigns. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="appieva road in rome" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1740207.jpg" width="565"></div>

    <p>  Nearby are the catacombs of San Sebastian, and an ancient legend says that the relics of saints Peter and Paul were stored in them.  You can get into a small underground cemetery only with a guide, as it is easy to get lost in the dark labyrinths. </p><h2>  Appian Way in Rome: how can I get there? </h2><p>  To get to the popular attraction on your own, you need to take the city bus number 118 on <span>Piazza Venezia Square,</span> opposite the Capitol Hill. You need to get off at the Appia Antica - Domine Quo Vadi stop, and the eyes of tourists will be recognized as one of the main attractions of Appieva road in rome. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="appieva road in rome how can I get" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1739915.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  How to get to her on the weekend?  On Saturday and Sunday, when the road is closed for public transport, a special tourist bus number 110, which leaves from Termini metro station, will take you to local attractions. </p><h2>  Travel tips </h2><p>  As tourists say, traveling on the highway on working days is not very convenient, and it takes quite a long time to go to the main historical monuments.  Sidewalks have not been laid along the many-kilometer path, and you have to constantly push yourself to the side of the road, letting cars fly ahead.  Therefore, it is best to come here on weekends to enjoy hiking, silence and the special atmosphere of a historic place. </p>
