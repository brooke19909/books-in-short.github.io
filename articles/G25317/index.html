And what is he responsible for?  Today we will try to understand this issue.  After all, it is always important to know what this or that function entered into the mobile phone is responsible for.  True, it is not always easy to understand what the number is for.

    <h2>  From whom </h2><p>  The first thing we will try to answer is to which operator this combination belongs.  After all, it is not without reason that they are so interested in her.  0611 - whose number?  Almost any modern resident of Russia will say that this phone belongs to the Beeline company. </p><p>  And indeed it is.  After all, this mobile operator really offers a combination of 0611 to use certain services.  We will talk about them a little later.  For now, it's worth finding out the conditions for making a call. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  There are several options.  We already know the number 0611. What is specific, it will be easy to understand.  This combination is used to communicate with the Beeline operator.  Of course, I wonder how much it will cost to use this number. </p><p>  If you are a Beeline subscriber, then there will be the first case.  Operator number 0611 in this scenario is free.  That is, subscribers can talk on it as much as they like.  And do not pay a dime for it.  Very comfortably. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But if you are not a Beeline subscriber, 0611 will be worth something.  Usually the price tag varies depending on the rates per minute of conversation with your mobile operator.  It takes into account a call to a <span>landline number.</span>  So, this is not always a free opportunity.  Practice shows that the phone number 0611 is most often used only by Beeline subscribers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="0611 whose number" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1147999.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Telecommunications operator </h2><p>  What kind of service is this?  What is she responsible for?  Number 0611 - what is it all about?  As it became known, we are dealing with the Beeline company.  But each operator has its own short combinations that are responsible for certain services. </p><p>  In our case, this number is nothing more than a means of communication with the company.  That is, we can say that the Beeline Corporation 0611 is used for conversations with representatives of the company.  Very comfortably.  Indeed, it is this combination that will help to resolve the issues that have arisen. </p><p>  For example, if you want to reach the operator, you will have to dial 0611 on your mobile device.  This is a universal combination that remains unchanged for all regions of Russia.  It remains to wait for an answer.  And that‚Äôs all, you can communicate with the operator.  But that‚Äôs not all.  What is the number 0611 on Beeline?  Is it really just a means of communication with the operator? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Receiving Services </h2><p>  Often, through telephone calls, subscribers try to connect or disconnect certain services.  And just for this, number 0611 is needed. What is this? </p><p>  A kind of service portal.  It is absolutely free.  Indeed, in order to use it, you just need to call and announce your desires and ideas.  You can easily and simply connect to yourself one or another package of options, as well as refuse it at any time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is the number 0611 on the beeline" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1148000.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In principle, it is very convenient.  True, not all subscribers welcome the work of 0611 (whose number is it - we already understand) as a service portal.  Indeed, the processing of a request often takes a long time.  And if you are aware of self-service teams, then this combination is completely worthless.  Unless to communicate with a Beeline telecommunications operator.  But the application of the number does not end there. </p><h2>  Call center </h2><p>  Next, you should pay attention to one very interesting fact, which includes the number 0611. What is it?  Firstly, it is a means of communication with the operator, and secondly, a service portal.  And thirdly, a kind of call center. </p><p>  Be sure: if you suddenly get a call from Beeline, the number will be displayed 0611. In this case, they may offer you some new items from the operator, or even conduct some kind of customer survey.  This practice is very common. </p><p>  However, this combination is not used very often as a call center.  After all, Beeline does not particularly like to ring customers.  This is an unnecessary concern, which, as practice has shown, only annoys buyers.  But remember, what is the number 0611 on the Beeline.  This is not only a means of communication between the subscriber and the company, but also vice versa. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beeline 0611" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1148001.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Informational portal </h2><p>  And the conversation does not end there.  Why?  The thing is that often the number 0611 (that's what we almost figured out) is used as the so-called information portal.  Do not confuse it with other concepts. </p><p>  What is it about?  For example, if you need to receive some specific information about the tariff, your own SIM card or option package, you can dial 0611 and make the idea a reality.  This is not so difficult.  Moreover, this venture is absolutely free for Beeline subscribers.  This is just one of the few areas that are most often used with this combination.  This does not end the work of the portal. </p><h2>  Answering machine </h2><p>  Beeline 0611 very often plays the role of ... an answering machine.  Often, subscribers complain that they are trying to reach the operator, but instead receive an ‚Äúelectronic conversation."  This is a fairly common practice with all companies. </p><p>  What does a voice robot (answering machine) do?  If you have enough patience and time to listen to all the commands, you will notice that this is a universal management of all services and capabilities offered to subscribers.  Here, using a simple navigation system, you are able to get all the information you need about some services, get through to a ‚Äúlive‚Äù operator (it can be extremely difficult to do this), and turn on / off certain options. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone number 0611" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1148002.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  The main disadvantage of this technique is that it is activated ‚Äúrandomly‚Äù.  That is, you can‚Äôt say for sure when you get to the robot voice, and at what point the real operator will immediately answer you.  Of course, as already mentioned, the time spent on working with a voice answering machine is enormous.  One plus in such a system is that the conversation, no matter how long it lasts, is absolutely free. </p><h2>  Caution scammers </h2><p>  And the last scenario.  He received his action only recently.  The thing is that 0611 (whose number is already understandable in principle) calls Beeline subscribers and offers (very persistently) to connect some kind of new tariff for the Internet or any other "fantasy" opportunities.  This behavior is alarming.  And for good reason. </p><p>  Why?  After all, 0611 is not only the official number of communication with the Beeline operator.  Now this combination plays the role of a kind of fraud.  Divorce honest citizens for money. </p><p>  How to distinguish a scammer from a real operator?  First, just call Beeline and find out what services they offer by calling you.  Report that someone is bored with calls from this combination.  The company will check and put the unfortunate fake on the black list. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="operator number 0611" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1148003.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Secondly, remember: no company will be too persistent in rubbing certain services.  And at any time you can look at all the offers (real) on the operator‚Äôs official website.  In addition, as already mentioned, 0611 is not so often used as a call center. </p><p>  Thirdly, try to pay attention to how you are being addressed.  Most likely, neither your last name, nor first name, nor your middle name will be named.  This is a clear pointer to scammers.  Or, if the SIM card is not issued for you, then the appeal will be according to the data that is entered in the Beeline database.  For frequent calls from 0611 to your number, it is recommended to block it with your mobile operator. </p>
