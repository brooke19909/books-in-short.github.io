Currently, it is a developing infrastructure of one of the visited resort sites located on the Lustica peninsula in Montenegro.

The name of the country - Montenegro - comes from the black forests surrounding Mount Lovcen, among which it is located.  Since that time, Montenegro at different periods of its existence was the spiritual center of the Montenegrins, and a special administrative-territorial unit, and the kingdom. </p><p>  In the 1920s, Montenegro first disappeared from the political map of the world, becoming part of the Kingdom of Serbs.  Then there was the occupation by Italy during the Second World War, in 1946 Montenegro became part of the socialist Yugoslav Federation.  The civil war in the early 90s led to the collapse of the federation.  Serbia and Montenegro formed the <span>Union Republic of Yugoslavia</span> in 1992 <span>,</span> which lasted more than 10 years and broke up in 2003.  Since then, these are two independent states. </p>

    <h2>  Beaches of Lustica </h2><p>  The demand among tourists is the famous beaches of anica and Porto Rosa.  One of the best beaches in Lustica and Montenegro is officially recognized Zhanitsa beach.  It is sometimes called the presidential beach.  Once, during the reign of Joseph <span>Broz Tito,</span> president of the former Yugoslavia, he chose this beach for personal use.  It was closed to other people.  It is located near the city of Herceg Novi.  The beach area is pebble, there is no sand. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  To relax on this beach, according to reviews, it is better to use a sunbed and umbrella.  Log into the sea on a larger pebble.  Hedgehogs live in sea water, so you need to be careful when entering the water.  The beach is surrounded by an olive grove.  There is a large marina.  From it you can go by ship to the Blue Cave or to the island-fortress of Mamula.  And not far from the harbor where the marina is located, on a small island there is a monastery of the Introduction to the Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary, built in the 15th century. </p>

    <p>  The second beach of Porto Rosa is located on the Adriatic coast of the island in the beautiful coastal village of Rosa.  Here the elite of Yugoslavia loved to relax.  In the village there are many villas of Yugoslav singers, artists and artists. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Montenegro has many interesting places, as well as ancient fortresses.  Between the peninsulas from Croatia - Prevlaka, from Montenegro - Lustica - the island of Mamula with an ancient fortress of the same name, which she received by the name of the Austrian military engineer Lazar Mamula - her builder.  In the fortress rises headquarters tower and loopholes, there is a tank with fresh water.  Spiral staircases and a bakery have survived.  The fortress is built so that it cannot be reached unnoticed.  It can be reached from the pier by a drawbridge, which is located above a wide moat.  All other sides of the island are rocky. </p><p>  Campo Mamula was shot about this island in 1959, telling about the events of World War II, when the fort was a concentration camp. </p>

    <p>  On Lustica, there is also Arza fortress, which was part of the Boka Kotorska defense line along with Mamula and Oshtro.  In the western part of the peninsula there are well-preserved military fortifications of the time of the Austro-Hungarian Empire - the fortress of Kabala and Lustica. </p><p>  The sights of Lustica include a large number of temples in villages and villages built in the IX century.  That is why the peninsulas are called Small Athos. </p><h2>  Prospects for the development of Lustica </h2><p>  Since 2013, the construction of the complex has begun on the peninsula as part of the Lustica Bay project.  The completion of the project is scheduled for 2025.  By this time, 500 villas and townhouses, more than 100 apartments and hotels will be put into operation on the peninsula, a business center, marinas will be built.  All communication buildings will be built here: a business center, medical facilities, schools, and a fire department.  When this plan is implemented, it will be possible to say with confidence that a full-fledged city for permanent residence, and not just a resort area for tourists, will appear on the map of the peninsula.  And the construction of this city will occupy no more than 10% of the peninsula. </p>

    <p>  Great plans for the Montenegrins.  However, natural phenomena make their own adjustments.  So, in the summer of 2017, forest fires occurred in the mountains in Montenegro on Lustica, which created a threat to the tourist season on the Adriatic.  A number of regions were engulfed in fire.  Montenegrin firefighters shot down the fire using the Ukrainian An-32P aircraft, which is capable of dropping up to 8 thousand liters of water to the fires of forest areas, as well as a Swiss helicopter, a fire-fighting helicopter from Bulgaria and two Israeli fire-fighting helicopters. </p><p>  Thanks to the coordinated actions of the fire services, the fire was extinguished.  In Montenegro, he was far from resort places and villages.  The airport in Tivat worked all this time in normal mode. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Typically, tourists fly by plane to the international airport, which is located in Tivat.  Every day, various international airlines make flights.  You can sail from Tivat to Lustica by boat.  You can rent a car directly at the airport or use the services of a taxi, which will take you to any vacation destination. </p><p>  Those who come to Montenegro on vacation will be interested not only to lie on the beach, but also to walk along uncharted paths, for example, explore the unique Austrian fortresses of Kabalu and Lustica. </p>
