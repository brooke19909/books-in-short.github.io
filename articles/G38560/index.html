It was formed as a result of the merger of two corporations: Advocard, specializing in the provision of distance consulting services in the field of law, and the Swiss investment company with a 25-year history of work.  Broad prospects for earning money were open for residents of Russia thanks to the tandem of European standards for building a business and global experience in providing universal services in the vastness of the CIS countries. </p><h2>  What is REWORLD? </h2>

    <p>  Reworld, whose work reviews are very rare, works remotely.  The dominant part of customers uses only the telephone format of cooperation.  In the most expensive packages of offers, such as Gold and Platinum, you can take the help of a specialist who is ready to professionally represent the interests of the client directly in court.  A narrow list of offers is available only for a separate fee.  In 90% of situations, partnership is limited to providing people with information on what they have the full legislative right to and what not.  Many years of experience indicate that this category of services is not very popular among the residents of Russia, which is understandable.  A small demand for available offers forced the company to actively use network marketing tools to promote its activities. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Cheating or the services of a professional company? </h2>

    <p>  One of the few companies that, because of the uniqueness of the product, use the principle of direct sales in their work, is Reworld Corporation.  Reviews about the business as a pyramid relate specifically to the fact that consulting services are far from being the most popular.  This leads to the fact that the population of Russia perceives the work of the organization as a pyramid.  In fact, the company Reworld, reviews of which are found both positive and negative, is neither a scam nor a pyramid.  An enterprise makes money selling real services.  The only drawback of the company is that if the client buys a certain package of services and does not use it for a year, the funds are not returned to him.  This is what prompts people to put forward their assumptions that the company is just a hoax.  Over the years <span>, the company has</span> managed to accumulate a large number of customers, despite public skepticism.  A successful business model has become the main engine of active growth, which attracted a considerable number of investors and entrepreneurs. </p><h2>  A little bit about the team </h2>

    <p>  To say that the company Reworld, the reviews of people about which are very ambiguous, is a scam, there will be no reason if you get to know the management of the corporation closely.  The holding‚Äôs president is Sergey Bekrenev, who is a successful entrepreneur and founder of the European Legal Service.  Sergey is active in the field of charity and practices in such a promising global segment as Knowledge Management.  The chairman of the board of directors is Tigran Babajanyan.  He is a professional businessman and business coach, provides professional advice in the field of management and building sales structures.  Tigran has many years of experience in the network marketing industry.  The corporation's office is located in Zurich, Switzerland, which already speaks of the high status of Reworld.  Reviews about the business with a negative connotation are nothing more than anti-advertising and the words of people who have not fully figured out this issue. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  FreeWorld - the second unique product of the company </h2><p>  The second unique product of the company is FreeWorld cards.  With their help, everyone can make travel interesting and more affordable.  After buying a card at a fixed cost, you can go on vacation and stay with a travel partner in one of the 4-star hotels that will be presented in the catalog.  The catalog has 100 thousand establishments for living, located in 168 countries of the world.  Traveling the world with the support of Reworld GG, reviews about which in this segment of activity inspire confidence, is very easy and simple, and most importantly, affordable in terms of <span>material costs.</span> </p><h2>  Multilateral assistance </h2>

    <p>  Comprehensive legal support and the security of each client is the main credo of Reworld.  The feedback from the company's employees suggests that its management clearly follows established priorities.  Thousands of people in Ukraine, Russia and Kazakhstan have already received professional legal protection, solved difficult life situations.  Over the years, the company's management has repeatedly received favorable offers on the sale of the business and on the formation of a new alliance.  Management refused.  The holding's work is focused on achieving a high level of development.  The organization plans to create a world empire in the field of network marketing of services.  The expansion of activities is carried out due to the stable conquest of new markets and the provision of remote services on different continents. </p><h2>  Advantageous offer to partners </h2><p>  In addition to the many advantages mentioned above, attracting partners and creating excellent conditions for their development is a real prospect from Reworld.  Reviews of the company indicate that the holding is focused on the formation of new generation leaders.  Business consultants can use modern Internet technologies, numerous mobile business platforms that are designed to support entrepreneurs.  To date, the number of partners of the company has already crossed the mark of 30 thousand people.  The ability for them to monitor their activities online is another benefit from Reworld.  Reviews about the business indicate that the specifics of its construction satisfies consumer demand and all the needs of customers. </p><h2>  Why it is profitable to work side by side with a company </h2>

    <p>  The company's products are not only prestigious, they are also very interesting.  The acquisition of both a tourist and a legal card is quite profitable.  Becoming a consultant and distributing these products on your own is a unique opportunity to earn from Reworld Holding.  Reviews ("divorce or not divorce", etc.) do not give an accurate idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe essence of the company, but a large number of successful partners around the world speak about the honesty of the enterprise and profitable schemes for transparent cooperation.  The fact that you will have to work hard to achieve a certain level and success makes you cautious about this category of business.  Nobody will give gifts to anyone.  To achieve a certain level of well-being, a certain resource of time and effort will have to be spent.  It may take from 2 to 3 years to create and develop your business, but then the established business will feed the whole family of the partner until the end of his life. </p><h2>  Sales system </h2>

    <p>  Consider what reviews exist about Reworld.  Divorce within the company is nothing more than a myth.  The sales structure, which is multi-level marketing, pushes people to this idea.  Unlike standard pyramids, the holding offers a truly sought-after product that people buy.  There are no sky-high prices.  The company is unlikely to leave the market, because it is constantly expanding its territory and is actively developing new <span>distribution channels.</span>  The organization offers partners the opportunity to build their own business and grow in personal terms, provides a chance to improve their material level and provide free time.  It all starts with simple counseling.  Consultant status can only be obtained by personal invitation.  It opens up the opportunity to distribute the company's products among other people.  One of the goals of the partnership is to open its own business center, the maintenance of which is charged about 25 thousand dollars.  Up to three centers can be established for partners of the highest rank, which guarantees monthly support of $ 75 thousand.  The effectiveness of partners helps to determine a unique point system.  There are no restrictions.  Reworld makes it possible to grow as much as a person can. </p>
