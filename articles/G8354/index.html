Fortunately, it happened without a single shot and casualties, and no matter what the descendants of those whom Pushkin called the “slanderers of Russia” say, by the will of the Crimeans themselves.  However, one cannot fail to understand that it would not have taken place if it had not been for the efforts of people, a significant part of whom were quite far from Crimea. </p>

    <p>  In March 2014, reports appeared in the press that a medal “For the Liberation of the Crimea” had been created, its first batch had already been manufactured at the Russian Ribbon factory and the first awards had taken place. </p><h2>  Crimean War Medal </h2><p>  For the <span>annexation of Crimea to Russia</span> in 1783, many military and civilian dignitaries were generously awarded Catherine the Second with orders, valuable gifts, titles and estates.  However, the medal, in the name of which the word “Crimea” appeared, first appeared during the war of the Russian Empire with the forces of the coalition consisting of the British and <span>Ottoman Empires,</span> France and the Sardinian Kingdom (1853-1856).  It was created in honor of the end of hostilities, as well as to mark the coronation of Emperor Alexander II. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In total, 170 thousand of such medals were made, and the presentation for the award was completed at the end of August 1859.  It is also known that there were several options for this award: on the St. George, Vladimir and St. Andrew ribbons, which were made of dark or light bronze. </p><h2>  World War II Medal “For the Defense of Sevastopol” </h2>

    <p>  The next “Crimean” award appeared in 1942.  It became the Soviet medal “For the Defense of Sevastopol”, which was awarded to all those who defended the main Crimean naval stronghold from mid-autumn 1941 to early July 1942.  In total, over the history of the existence of the medal, it was awarded to 52 540 military personnel and civilians. </p><p>  On the obverse of the medal are convex pectoral images of the figures of the Red Army and Red Navy, looking to the left, and under them are the guns and anchors.  A convex inscription “FOR THE DEFENSE OF SEVASTOPOL” is applied around the circumference of a circle with a diameter of 2.2 cm.  As for the reverse, it exactly resembles the other side of the rest of the Soviet awards of the Second World War. </p><h2>  First medal “For the liberation of Crimea” </h2>

It was intended for those military personnel and civilians who participated in the liberation of the <span>Crimean peninsula</span> from Nazi invaders.  However, the sketch of the award remained on paper, since the corresponding provision was not adopted to establish such a medal.  The liberation of Crimea from fascist invaders for this reason cannot be regarded as a less significant event than other battles of the Second World War. </p><p>  Moreover, as a result of this operation, the USSR regained full control of the Black Sea, which jeopardized such important allies of <span>fascist Germany</span> as Romania, Turkey and Bulgaria. </p><h2>  Description of the new medal “For the Liberation of Crimea” </h2><p>  As already mentioned, in March 2014, the Russian press wrote about the creation of a new award.  After some time, information about her institution was confirmed, it became known that it was made according to the sketch of 1944, from which the sickle and hammer were removed. </p><p>  The departmental Medal “For the Liberation of Crimea” of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation was made in the form of a regular circle with a diameter of 3.2 cm. In the central part of the obverse there is a relief image of the contour of the Crimean peninsula, which is framed in the lower part by two crossed laurel branches fastened with a five-pointed star.  As for the reverse of the award, in its upper part there is a relief image of the emblem of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, and under it there are relief inscriptions “FOR RETURN OF THE CRIMEA” and the corresponding dates: “02/20/14 - 03/18/14”.  In addition, the words “MINISTRY OF DEFENSE” in the upper part and “RUSSIAN FEDERATION” are printed in a circle. </p>

    <p>  The medal “For the Liberation of the Crimea” is connected with a ring and an eye to a 5-sided block covered with silk ribbon.  Column colors: black, orange, white and red. </p><h2>  Awarded </h2><p>  All in all, about 300 people have received the medal “For the Return of Crimea”.  Among the first awarded marines, high-ranking officers from the command of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, the head of the government of Crimea, etc. Sergey Shoigu himself handed the medal during his trip to Crimea in March 2014.  Fighters of the Crimean “Golden Eagle” and some civilians were also awarded.  The first thing that interests those who hear about the new medal “For the Return of Crimea” - what benefits it gives.  Since it is memorable, those to whom it was handed do not receive any advantages in relation to other citizens of the country or to their colleagues who did not receive such an award.  At the same time, many of those who received this medal claim that it is dearer to them than all others, since there will remain a reminder of the most important event in their life. </p><h2>  Commemorative Medal “For the Liberation of Crimea and Sevastopol”: Award List </h2><p>  On March 17, 2014, the presentation of the award established by the NGO took place </p><p>  "The revolutionary committee" Sevastopol - Crimea - Russia "."  It was a <span>commemorative medal</span> dedicated to the liberation of the Crimea and Sevastopol, as members of this public organization call the return of the peninsula.  In total, about 130 people were awarded, lists of which were published in the press.  Among them V.V.  Putin, commander of the Crimean “Golden Eagle” Y. Abisov, Chairman of the Crimean government <span>S. Aksenov,</span> centurion of the Sevastopol Cossacks S. Alampiev, singer and composer O. Gazmanov, V. Matvienko and many others. Medal “For the Liberation of Crimea ...”, photo which is presented below, many publications confused the departmental award of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation on the return of the peninsula to Russia, however, as you see, they are completely different and have nothing to do with each other. </p>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  The commemorative medal “For the Liberation of Crimea and Sevastopol” is worn on a 5-sided block covered with moire ribbon, repeating the design of the famous St. George’s, which has recently become a symbol of the struggle against the newly-born fascists.

At her feet, along the edge of the circle, 2 convex inscriptions “March 18” and “2014” are applied.  The reverse of the medal is decorated along the edge with two laurel branches converging to a <span>five-pointed star,</span> between which an anchor is depicted in the lower part.
