  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ozone holes - a problem of our time</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Ozone is contained in gaseous wastes that are emitted by enterprises and is a hazardous chemical.  It is a very active element and can cause corrosion of structural elements of various structures.  Nevertheless, in the atmosphere, ozone is transformed into an invaluable assistant, without which life on Earth could simply not exist. </p><p>  The stratosphere is the <span>layer of the atmosphere</span> that follows the one in which we live.  The upper part is covered by ozone, its content in this layer is 3 molecules per 10 million other air molecules.  Despite the fact that the concentration is very low, ozone performs an essential function - it is able to block the path of ultraviolet rays coming from space simultaneously with sunlight.  Rays of ultraviolet radiation negatively affect the structure of living cells and can cause the development of diseases such as eye cataracts, cancer and other serious ailments. </p><p>  The <span>ozone layer</span> is protected by the following principle.  At that moment, when oxygen molecules meet on the path of ultraviolet rays, the reaction of their splitting into 2 oxygen atoms occurs.  The resulting atoms combine with unsplit molecules, creating ozone molecules consisting of 3 oxygen atoms.  When <span>ultraviolet rays</span> meet with ozone molecules, the latter destroy them into three oxygen atoms.  The moment of splitting of the molecules is accompanied by the release of heat, and they no longer reach the surface of the Earth. </p><h2>  Ozone holes </h2><p>  The process of converting oxygen to ozone and vice versa is called the oxygen-ozone cycle.  Its mechanism is balanced, but the dynamics vary depending on the intensity of solar radiation, season and natural disasters, in particular, <span>volcanic eruptions.</span>  Scientists concluded that human life negatively affects its thickness.  Ozone depletion has been recorded over the past decades in many places.  In some cases, he disappeared completely.  How to reduce the negative impact of a person on this cycle? </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Ozone holes arise due to the fact that the process of destruction of the protective layer proceeds much more intensively than its generation.  This is because in the process of human life, the atmosphere is polluted by various ozone-depleting compounds.  These are, first of all, chlorine, bromine, fluorine, carbon and hydrogen.  Scientists believe that chlorofluorocarbon compounds pose the main threat to the ozone layer.  They are widely used in refrigeration units, industrial solvents, air conditioners and aerosol cans. </p><p>  When chlorine reaches the ozone layer, it interacts with <span>ozone molecules</span> .  A chemical reaction produces <span>chlorine oxide</span> and an oxygen molecule.  When chlorine oxide meets a free oxygen atom, another interaction occurs, as a result of which chlorine is released, and an oxygen molecule appears.  In the future, the chain repeats because chlorine is not able to go beyond the boundaries of the atmosphere or fall to the ground.  Ozone holes are a consequence of the fact that the concentration of this element decreases due to its accelerated splitting upon the appearance of foreign alien components in its layer. </p><h2>  Locations </h2><p>  The largest ozone holes are found over the Antarctic.  Their size practically corresponds to the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe continent itself.  This area is practically uninhabited, but scientists have expressed concern that the gap could spread to other areas of the planet that are intensively populated.  This is fraught with <span>environmental disaster</span> and the death of the Earth. </p><p>  To prevent a decrease in the ozone layer, it is necessary first of all to reduce the amount of destructive substances released into the atmosphere.  In 1987, the Montreal Treaty was signed in 180 countries, which provides for the phased reduction of emissions of substances containing chlorine.  Now the ozone holes are already diminishing, and scientists express the hope that the situation will completely recover by 2050. </p>
