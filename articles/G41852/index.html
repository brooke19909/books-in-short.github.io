  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Egg maturation and fertilization</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The female <span>reproductive cell</span> (egg) matures and is located in the ovaries.  Its structure and functions are subordinated to the eternal natural <span>process of reproduction of the</span> species.  In order for the egg to fully perform its functions, it contains inclusions of proteins and fats that feed the cell at the initial stage of the formation of a living organism.  This stage is called a zygote - it is a tandem of female and male germ cells.  Until the moment of attachment to the uterus and obtaining full nutrition from the mother‚Äôs body, it is the egg that provides nutrition to the future fetus. </p><p>  The nucleus of the egg contains 23 sexes of the chromosome.  The remaining twenty-three gives her a sperm. </p><p>  Egg maturation occurs in the follicle.  Interestingly, the first such follicles begin to form in a female child in the womb around the twelfth week.  Over time, their number rapidly increases, and then decreases.  So, in utero there can be up to seven million, but by the time the first menstruation occurs, only three hundred thousand remain. </p><p>  The woman‚Äôs body is designed so that the number of follicles does not increase, they only age and die.  By the age of thirty-five, they contain only twenty-five thousand, and about a thousand during menopause.  That is why pregnancy after thirty-five is problematic, because the maturation of the ova is limited, although it is quite possible. </p><p>  Over the entire period of life, mature eggs capable of merging with the sperm and further maturation are formed only in the amount of four hundred to five hundred pieces.  The rest of the eggs die.  This is a normal process.  Indeed, the maturation of the egg cannot be multiple - pregnancy with twins and triplets is considered a rarity and luck, and a larger number of children born at a time is considered a record.  Thus nature regulates the birth rate. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Egg formation is a complex multi-level process.  At the first stage, the reproduction of follicles occurs - this is laid in the girl still in utero.  The second stage is follicular growth.  They grow all the time before puberty begins.  The third period is the maturation of the egg.  During the period of each menstrual cycle in the <span>female body</span> , one egg matures, rarely two or three.  This phenomenon is called superovulation.  In this case, the possibility of developing twins or triplets is great. </p><p>  Since the child‚Äôs reproductive function is laid in the womb, the mother has a huge responsibility for the future of his daughter.  If the mother will take alcohol, smoke, use drugs, suffer from a sexual infection, then such a burden can negatively affect the sexual health of the girl who has not yet been born. </p><p>  Ovum maturation in the follicle occurs in this way.  Each month, the follicle grows, a cavity with a liquid appears inside it, and a tubercle with an egg goes inside this cavity.  The follicle in the mature state is quite large - about two centimeters in diameter.  When the follicle matures, it bursts and an egg leaves it.  The exit of the egg is called ovulation - it is ‚Äútrapped‚Äù by couples who <span>cannot become pregnant.</span>  Since the egg itself lives about a day, a couple who wants children must ensure that the egg and sperm meet as soon as possible so that fertilization occurs.  If fertilization has not occurred this time, then you will have to wait another month - the egg maturation period. </p><p>  If the process of meeting the egg and sperm was successful, then soon <span>signs of fertilization of the</span> egg will be felt.  The hormonal system will work in full swing, the zygote will attach to the uterus, menstruation will stop, and pregnancy will begin. </p><p>  Women planning a pregnancy should remember that egg maturation is a very delicate and sensitive process.  Do not be upset if this did not happen in the first months of a stable sexual life with a partner.  This is not a reason to talk about infertility.  There are <span>anovulatory cycles</span> when the egg does not ripen at all - the body is resting.  Only after a year of joint regular sexual activity, it is worthwhile to undergo a medical examination and, if necessary, start treatment. </p>
