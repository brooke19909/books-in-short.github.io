How to compile an organization‚Äôs nomenclature of affairs?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Each organization in the process of work is faced with a large workflow.  Contracts, statutory, accounting, internal documents ... Some of them must be kept at the enterprise for the entire period of its existence, but most certificates can be destroyed at the end of their validity period.  To be able to quickly understand the collected documents, a nomenclature of the organization‚Äôs affairs is compiled.  Samples of this document and the algorithm for its construction will be considered below. </p><h2>  Destination </h2><p>  Each organization creates hundreds of documents.  Every day they accumulate, workers gradually replace each other.  At some point, it becomes difficult to find an order two years ago.  In order to avoid such situations, a nomenclature of affairs is created. </p><div class="photo" data-original="quickthinkcloud.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="nomenclature of organization affairs" class="if uuid-2274631" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2274631.jpg"></div><h2>  Definition </h2><p>  A case is a document related to one issue, a site of activity.  The nomenclature of cases is a list that contains a list of cases to be initiated with an indication of their storage periods.  With it, you can properly organize the workflow.  The nomenclature of the affairs of a commercial organization, a sample of which will be considered later, is drawn up for this purpose: </p><ul><li>  systematization of the grouping of documents, which ensures their prompt search and preservation; </li><li>  assignment of registration number according to the classification of cases; </li><li>  compilation of an <span>inventory of documents of</span> permanent, long-term and personal storage (including acts of destruction). </li></ul><p>  The nomenclature of cases is used in the selection of documents for archiving and destruction.  This multifunctional reference is needed by each organization to streamline paperwork.  Moreover, the form of ownership of the organization does not matter.  If a sample of the nomenclature of affairs of a medical organization can be found in regulatory enactments and decrees, then the analyst of the affairs of a private organization will have to be compiled independently. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Mandatory or forced? </h2><p>  The compilation of this list is provided for by the ‚ÄúRules for the Work of Archives‚Äù.  It is mandatory for organizations that create an archive as a separate service.  In addition to state and municipal institutions, this list also includes some commercial structures, such as notaries. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.blominvestbank.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="founders meeting" class="if uuid-2271553" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/2271553.jpg"></div><p>  The rest of the institution needs to create a nomenclature of cases in order to systematize work with documents, since enterprises of all forms of ownership are required to ensure the preservation of archival certificates.  This is provided for by Federal Law No. 125.  To create or update a detailed to-do list should be in the fourth quarter of the calendar year. </p><h2>  Structure </h2><p>  The nomenclature of cases should contain all established cases, except for print media: statements of employees, job certificates, journals, books of records, all documentation of structural units, correspondence of structural units, etc. The limited access documentation should contain the bar ‚ÄúParticleboard‚Äù.  The directory should contain the affairs of temporarily operating commissions, units.  But, for example, a trade union is an independent organization.  Its employees are independently engaged in the formation of the directory.  The archive must also contain the headings of the unfinished business of the liquidated enterprises, the successor of which is the current organization. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  An example of filling out the nomenclature of the affairs of the organization you can see below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kadrovik.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="nomenclature of affairs" class="if uuid-2271545" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/2271545.jpg"></div><p>  Today, many enterprises keep documentation in electronic form.  Some reports are not even printed on paper.  At the end of each section, you should list which reports are kept electronically, indicate the number of files and all the necessary keywords for the search.  Some institutions create a separate electronic business nomenclature of business.  The sample and its filling algorithm should fully comply with accepted standards. </p><h2>  Where to begin? </h2><p>  Responsibility for the compilation of the directory in large institutions rests with the documentation support service <span>(secretariat, chancellery),</span> and in small institutions it is the secretary and another appointed person.  In commercial organizations, this function is performed by the personnel department, in which most of the documents are created.  Since the information should come from all structural divisions, it is advisable to start by developing an order on the nomenclature of affairs in the organization.  A sample of such an order is presented to your attention further. </p><p>  LLC ‚ÄúAVS‚Äù </p><p>  November 20, 2017 Moscow </p><p>  In order to systematize, store and record documentation </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  I ORDER: </p><ul><li>  To approve and put into circulation the nomenclature of the affairs of the Company from 01.01.2018. </li><li>  Heads of structural divisions ensure the <span>formation of cases</span> according to the approved form. </li><li>  The secretary should send extracts from the directory for work to the structural units. </li></ul><p>  General Director Ivanov N.A. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thestoragegroup.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="many documents" class="if uuid-2274644" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2274644.jpg"></div><p>  For institutions in some areas of activity, samples of the nomenclature of the affairs of organizations have already been developed by the Ministry.  This nuance should be clarified before the formation of the directory.  Typical nomenclatures should be completed in strict accordance with a given sample of the nomenclature of the organization‚Äôs affairs.  Other institutions may use these handbooks to compile an individual document. </p><h2>  Supporting Documentation </h2><p>  When developing a directory form, commercial organizations should focus on: </p><ul><li>  ‚ÄúArchive Rules‚Äù (decision of the Federal Archive of 02/06/02); </li><li>  Section 5 of Decree No. 477 of June 15, 2009 "On the Approval of the Rules of Record Keeping". </li><li>  Instructions for paperwork. </li><li>  Enumeration of archival documents. </li></ul><p>  You should also study the staffing, charter, <span>local acts,</span> regulations on units, rules, standards, instructions, and lists of cases.  They contain links to applicable documents.  First, samples of the nomenclature of the organization‚Äôs affairs by subdivision are compiled, then to form a common directory.  Sometimes a functional rather than a structural principle is applied.  That is, the distribution is carried out not by units, but by function. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.blominvestbank.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="staff meeting" class="if uuid-2273325" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/2273325.jpg"></div><h2>  How to make a sample of the nomenclature of the affairs of the organization? </h2><p>  The form of directories is specified in Appendix No. 8 to the "Rules for the Work of Archives".  Directories are compiled on the letterhead of the organization.  The main part of the report is presented in tabular form and consists of 5 columns: </p><ul><li>  case index; </li><li>  heading (volumes, parts); </li><li>  quantity (volumes, parts); </li><li>  storage period, article number on the list; </li><li>  note. </li></ul><h2>  Index </h2><p>  An index is a digital designation of a structural unit within an enterprise.  For example: 04-06, where 04 is the serial number of the personnel department, 06 is the serial number of the case.  The index can consist of three pairs of numbers, for example: 04-03-08, where 04 is the code of the financial and economic department, 03 is the accounting designation, 08 is the case number.  The index can be digital, alphabetic or mixed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kadrovik.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="nomenclature of affairs" class="if uuid-2271544" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/2271544.jpg"></div><h2>  Headings </h2><p>  Headings are ranked according to the importance of the documents.  First, organizational and administrative documentation is taken into account (they start from higher divisions and go to structural divisions).  Then the rules and regulations developed by the organization are listed.  Next, plans and reports (annual, quarterly, monthly) are taken into account.  Draft administrative documents are placed after the main documents.  The same type of case (for example, personal cards of employees) are filled out in alphabetical order. </p><p>  The title should summarize the content of the document.  The use of general language like ‚Äúmiscellaneous‚Äù, ‚Äúcorrespondence‚Äù, ‚Äúincoming / outgoing documents‚Äù is not allowed.  The title of the case contains the following elements: </p><ul><li>  the name of the document or the type of case, if the document is part of a large volume; </li><li>  author of the document <span>(name of organization</span> or unit); </li><li>  addressee (from whom documents are received or to whom documents will be sent); </li><li>  summary / essence (for example, "Certification Issues"); </li><li>  name of the territory; </li><li>  date / period; </li><li>  a mark if the case contains copies of other documents, and not their originals. </li></ul><p>  The volume of each case should not exceed 250 sheets.  If it is assumed that the case will be voluminous, then it is divided into parts and volumes.  The third column at the end of the calendar year indicates the number of actually filed cases. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vashbiznesplan.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="employee file" class="if uuid-2274656" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2274656.jpg"></div><p>  In the fourth column indicate the storage period of documents, in accordance with the Rules.  They must be observed by both state and commercial organizations.  If the document is not in the Rules, then the storage period should be determined on the basis of the List.  The countdown for storage begins on January 1 of the following year after its establishment.  If the certificate was issued in 2016, then the countdown should begin from 01.01.2017. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nalog-nalog.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="nomenclature of affairs" class="if uuid-2273321" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/2273321.jpg"></div><h2>  List Update </h2><p>  Every year, when transferring files to the archive, a detailed list is submitted.  Here is how the updated sample of the nomenclature of affairs of the branch of security organizations looks like: </p><div class="photo" data-original="assistentus.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="nomenclature of affairs" class="if uuid-2273633" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/2273633.jpg"></div><p>  During the year, all documents are grouped in the approved form.  If it is necessary to add a previously unused report, a new header is generated.  And the process is repeated according to the above algorithm. </p>
