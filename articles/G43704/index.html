For all other customers, the opportunity to purchase and install new equipment was implemented.  If you read reviews about the Telekart satellite dishes, you can find out that the encoding has changed.  With the more expensive Irdeto, the company switched to Conax.  This allowed us to significantly reduce the purchase and connection costs for both the project itself and for new customers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The essence of the project </h2><p>  To date, the operator of affordable and affordable digital television is precisely this project.

    <p>  As for any other operator, standard tools are used to install the “Telecards”.  It is not necessary to connect branded equipment, for example, an expensive receiver with an integrated card, as for Tricolor TV.  Any, even inexpensive repeater is suitable.  The main thing is that there should be a special Conax decoder. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Also, the list of equipment used includes such standard elements: </p><ul><li>  Smart card.

At the same time, plates with a large diameter, for example, 0.8 m, are used for remote areas. This makes the reception more qualitative.  In other cases, antennas with a diameter of 0.6 m are used. </li><li>  Mounts for antenna.  The most commonly used brackets. </li><li>  <span>Satellite Converter.</span>  This is a special electronic device located on the antenna itself.  It serves as a converter and frequency amplifier. </li><li>  Coaxial cable.  Only 15 meters is enough for installation. </li><li>  Two special connectors for the antenna. </li></ul><p>  All these elements make up the standard Telecard satellite package.  User reviews speak of its quality and quite affordable price. </p><h2>  Connection Order </h2><p>  The Telecard project is easy to install and configure.  To get high-quality pay TV, it’s enough to take just a few successive steps: </p><ol><li>  Purchase the necessary satellite equipment.  To do this, you can buy a new kit from the operator or partially use the old one. </li><li>  Tune the antenna to a specific frequency of the Intelsat 15 satellite. In this case, you need to set the specified symbol speed, polarization and format. </li><li>  Insert the purchased "Telecard" into the receiver.  For free daily viewing 18 channels are included.  Next, those that are present in the selected package work. </li><li>  Register a card within 24 hours.  This can be done by the number of a specific hotline, through an online application on the official website and using text SMS. </li></ol><p>  As a result, after the sequential execution of the instructions, the user receives a satellite TV "Telecard".

    <p>  Of course, before choosing a satellite operator, you need to weigh all the existing pros and cons.  First you need to read the reviews.  "Telecard" is a relatively young, but very promising project.  Therefore, it has a number of undeniable advantages: </p><ul><li>  New subscribers can purchase cheaper equipment than other companies.  And existing users save on the cost of packages. </li><li>  After the purchase, you do not need to wait for the activation of the card.  It only needs to be registered during the first day using one of several available methods. </li><li>  Customers can immediately access 18 standard free channels. </li><li>  Protection against bureaucracy.  This project is in line with D. Medvedev's special modernization program.  It provides for an almost complete transition to electronic communications and relationships.  All applications and connections are done online through the website or SMS. </li><li>  The ability to connect a special function "Multitrum".  This means that with the help of one satellite dish, two televisions can simultaneously work simultaneously independently of each other. </li></ul><h2>  Differences of "Telecards" from other satellite operators </h2>

You can use cheaper and more affordable counterparts or a suitable old kit. </li><li>  The process of registering a card with Telecard does not require a personal connection with the operator.  At the same time, it is activated immediately after installation. </li><li>  Telecard does not provide for the signing of an offer contract, as in Tricolor TV.  This reduces the level of bureaucracy. </li></ul>
