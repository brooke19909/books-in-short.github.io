Mortgage is not accessible to everyone, saving for decades is also quite problematic, especially for family people.  Therefore, when there were offers to buy shares in a house under construction, many saw this as their chance.  Primary housing at affordable prices, in a good area - this is a very attractive offer.  Of course, you have to wait with the race, but the result is worth it.  Future residents of the London Park LCD also thought the same.  For almost 10 years, deceived real estate investors sought justice until they were able to enter long-paid apartments. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd london park cheated real estate investors" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2216392.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Construction history </h2><p>  Back in 2005, a well-known company bought a building plot for a residential complex.  To date, it is called "L1", although it is known that she changed it several times.  The developer has planned to build 254,000 m <sup>2 of</sup> housing, as well as a huge shopping complex. </p><p>  The project was developed by specialists of the creative workshop of Vladimir Reppo.  And it turned out to be very interesting, as the deceived equity holders say.  LCD "London Park" seemed like a real fairy tale.  The area has existed for a long time, which means it has a developed infrastructure.  Residents of the new complex can use public transport, with which you can get to anywhere in the city.  There are three Ring Road interchanges nearby. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  general description </h2><p>  What was the idea of ​​the London Park LCD deceived equity holders?  According to the project, this is a modern complex, which covers an area of ​​5 hectares.  In a short time, in just a few years, a modern complex was to grow here, which would compare favorably with the surrounding buildings.  Not only reliable, but also beautiful and functional buildings form a closed ring, in the center of which there is a park. </p><p>  Today, these dreams have yet to come true.  The first line should have passed in 2008.  At the same time, the change was postponed several times until the deceived equity holders began to be alarmed.  Residential complex “London Park” was completed as a result, moreover, people had to make rallies more than once and attract public opinion to the problem. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD London Park St. Petersburg" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2216389.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Architecture features </h2><p>  As part of the complex, you can see completely different buildings, which gives it a special flavor.  This complex differs from most analogues.  The fact is that there are high-rise buildings and small cottages in 2 floors, with separate entrances.  Thanks to the original architecture, it stands out from other mass developments.  It is precisely because of this that the London Park LCD (St. Petersburg) is so popular.  Despite the difficulties with implementation, the project turned out to be very interesting. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The interior decoration makes it not only functional, but also simply beautiful.  But this is very important for a person who wants to spend his whole life in a purchased apartment.  The buildings are decorated in a recognizable style, as the name implies.  RC “London Park” (St. Petersburg) is a modern complex where a special decoration of the halls is planned, as well as the installation of noiseless elevators of increased comfort.  For the safety of residents, there are special rooms for the security guard. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Prospect Education" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2216386.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Flats </h2><p>  There are offers for every taste.  The residential complex "London Park" is designed for the widest audience of customers.  Here are presented: </p><ul><li>  Small studio apartments.  Their area is from 25 to 35 m <sup>2</sup> . </li><li>  One-room - from 27 to 62 m <sup>2</sup> . </li><li>  Two-room apartments - from 40 to 144.5 m <sup>2</sup> . </li><li>  Three-room apartments - from 70 to 191 m <sup>2</sup> . </li></ul><p>  We should also mention the luxurious four-room apartments.  Their area reaches 250 m <sup>2</sup> .  Layouts are very different, carefully thought out.  The upper floors are particularly attractive with panoramic city views.  But the first floors have their own charm.  This is a separate entrance, which can be decorated as a terrace.  Balconies and loggias in all apartments are glazed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Fine finish </h2><p>  Residential complex “London Park” offers ownership of housing with a thorough finish.  It includes concrete screed and alignment of ceilings and walls.  Also included is the installation of interior doors and windows.  Judging by the reviews, they put quality designs, so you do not have to redo them immediately after arrival.  The developer is obligated to carry out wiring with outlets.  If necessary, you can conclude a contract with the developer for any other work. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="london park residential complex" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2216387.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Information about the developer </h2><p>  The object is located in a long-lived area, at the address: Prosveshcheniya Avenue, 43A.  This is one of the most complex urban sites.  Despite the difficult story, the project is still relevant. </p><p>  LCD London Park (St. Petersburg) is a long decade of preparatory work and endless postponements.  The project survived all the turmoil, but survived and was ready to delight buyers with new apartments.  Despite everything, the long-awaited apartments were commissioned in 2017.  Some real estate investors waited for their housing from the first day of construction. </p><p>  Although few expected this from this developer.  This is a well-known company that has implemented more than a dozen projects.  Of course, the financial situation in the market is changing, and risks cannot be written off.  Although this can hardly reassure people who are tired of going to court and looking for an answer when they get their keys. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd london park spb" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2216388.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  House territory </h2><p>  To date, the developer has moved to address these issues.  The residential complex "London Park" is a closed facility from outsiders.  He is guarded around the clock.  Video surveillance is planned to be conducted not only in the entry group.  In addition, <span>the</span> entire perimeter, entrance groups and front doors are covered by a <span>video surveillance system</span> , and there are video intercoms in the entrances. </p><p>  The courtyard is planned to be landscaped and landscaped.  Here will appear playgrounds with a special coating, illuminated fountains, recreation areas and a large number of flower beds.  That is, it will be an internal park with an area of ​​5 hectares.  To date, these works are already underway, but not completed. </p><h2>  Internal infrastructure </h2><p>  Despite the fact that Enlightenment Avenue is by no means the outskirts of the city, and there will be no problems with schools and gardens, the project includes the creation of its own social facilities.  Of course, these are parking lots.  Today, the first line of construction for 573 cars is being rented.  The second stage buildings are planned to be commissioned next year.  They will have additional parking for 1046 cars.  When the project is fully completed, the parking area will already accommodate 2,340 cars.  In addition, it is worth noting the excellent technical equipment of the territory.  You can be sure of your safety.  Sensors and fire extinguishing systems, smoke exhausts are located around the entire perimeter. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="london park residential complex address" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2216390.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  This is the main factor that speaks for buying an apartment here.  The address above is already indicated.  The residential complex London Park is located in a very cozy and quite quiet area.  This is a great choice for families with children, as well as for senior citizens.  In walking distance - parks and squares, which not only give an excellent view, but also serve as green lungs.  And how nice it is to take a walk in the evening and breathe in fresh air in the shade of the trees! </p><p>  But there are also disadvantages to consider.  The residential complex is located directly along the major highway.  Industrial zones are located nearby.  But if the developer realizes his plans and breaks the park, then this shortcoming will be smoothed out. </p><h2>  Numerous unrest in interest holders </h2><p>  While the <span>object was being built,</span> and the deadlines were postponed, the share of people who invested their money in apartments had a lot of worries.  Since the developer did not give an answer to the question of when they will hand over the London Park residential complex, people had to go to rallies, attracting the attention of the authorities.  One of these occurred in 2014, when the construction delay was already 5 years late.  Interest holders then demanded to provide a schedule for the completion of the residential complex. </p><p>  The protesters demanded from officials an understandable mechanism of control over this schedule by officials and equity holders.  In case of default, the deceived equity holders promised to continue to gather for rallies. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="London park housing complex when they surrender" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52853/2216814.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Real terms </h2><p>  In fact, the rally did not push things off too much.  Only in June 2017 did they begin to issue keys to equity holders of the first stage.  In total, about 600 families received them.  This was the reward for the long wait.  Of course, most people are happy about this, but still there was an unpleasant aftertaste.  This event was a signal for those who planned to buy an apartment here after the completion of construction.  At the end of 2017, it is planned to commission several more buildings.  The rest will be systematically commissioned until 2020. </p><h2>  Good and bad news </h2><p>  Dolgostroy recently commissioned the first phase of housing.  And today, apartments have already been seized.  The fact is that real estate investors filed a lawsuit against the developer.  <span>Consolidated enforcement proceedings</span> included 300 cases.  Mostly they were interest holders who demanded a refund and payment of the penalty.  Now the <span>bailiffs are arresting accounts,</span> apartments, and the owners of the company are looking for something to sell to pay the debt of 400 million rubles.  This raises another question: can the company in such circumstances fulfill its obligations to other equity holders and complete the construction on time?  However, the company management assures that they do not refuse their obligations.  They proposed to set up a repayment schedule, according to which the requirements of some interest holders would not be met at the expense of the interests of others. </p><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  Investing in housing under construction is always a risk.  Some are lucky, and after a few months they call in a new apartment.  Others have to wait for decades and go on ships.  LCD London Park (Enlightenment Avenue) is one of the most problematic projects in St. Petersburg.  But in spite of everything, the company is gradually completing construction.  This means that all equity holders will finally receive their apartments.  Perhaps it will also be possible to obtain the amount of the penalty that can be spent on repairs. </p>
