    <p>  The kingdom of mushrooms is being studied by the science of mycology.  The period of its occurrence is considered the end of the nineteenth century. </p><p>  The kingdom of mushrooms is a special form of life that can exist in a wide range of different conditions.  It includes a large and very common group of natural organisms that carry signs of both animals and plants. </p><p>  Mushrooms appeared on Earth more than a billion years ago.  Gradually, this form of life has become an integral part of all ecosystems on the planet.  The general characteristic of the kingdom of mushrooms is characterized by a large ecological and biological diversity of species.  According to currently available data, there are from one hundred to two hundred and fifty thousand different representatives of this life form on the planet.  Scientists described only five percent of them. </p><p>  The kingdom of mushrooms exists on land, in the air, as well as in water.  This life form performs one of the most important functions in the planet's biosphere, decomposing all kinds of organic substances.  Some <span>types of mushrooms are</span> used for food and household purposes.  These living organisms are also used in the production of medicines. </p><p>  Before the onset of mycology, fungi were attributed to <span>the plant kingdom.</span>  Together with bacteria, algae and lichens, they belonged to the lower division.  Further study of these groups required to distribute them according to another, newer classification system. </p><p>  Mushrooms, unlike plants, lack the chlorophyll necessary for <span>the photosynthesis process.</span>  As a result of this, by analogy with animals, this form of life is nourished by organic substances obtained from the outside. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The kingdom of mushrooms justifies its isolation from the group of plants due to the unique abilities of its living organisms.  Almost all representatives of this life form have mycelium or a filamentous system.  It is with its help that the absorption of nutrients occurs.  The strings of mushrooms are called hyphae.  They are necessary not only for nutrition, but also for the formation of special reproductive fruiting bodies, on the surface or inside of which spores are located. </p><p>  Mycology divides fungi into various species.  The classification of this kingdom is made according to the type of spores and the structure of spore-bearing elements that belong to this life form. </p><p>  Mushrooms of various sizes are found in nature.  Their range is from microscopic unicellular forms (yeast) to significant specimens having a diameter of the fruiting body exceeding fifty centimeters. </p><p>  In their structure, representatives of the kingdom of mushrooms have a fairly wide variety.  The soil types of these organisms often grow in symbiosis with tree roots, forming mycorrhiza.  Mushrooms mineralize organic matter, forming humus.  Some representatives of the soil life form contribute to the destruction of forest litter.  Predatory organisms parasitize in plants and animals and capture small roundworms. </p><p>  The kingdom of mushrooms has a significant impact on the cycle of natural elements.  Thanks to the representatives of this life form, the decomposition of animals and plant debris occurs.  This complex process is carried out by <span>cap mushrooms</span> belonging to the group of saprophytes.  For example, many talkers can be attributed to them. </p><p>  Some mushrooms are rich in an enzyme apparatus that produces <span>biologically active substances.</span>  These properties are used in the clarification processes of fruit juices, in the processing of raw materials and roughage, as well as in the <span>hydrolysis of proteins</span> and starch.  Mushroom black mold in industrial production is used to produce citric acid. </p><p>  However, not all representatives are beneficial.  Mushrooms can cause great harm to forestry, parasitizing on trees and causing their defeat.  Also, this form of life can cause various diseases in people (dermatitis, scab, ringworm). </p>
