    <h2>  <span>Errors of washing machines</span> "Indesit" series AVD </h2><p>  The washing machines of this series are a bit outdated today.  However, they are not able to display Indesit error codes immediately.  In this case, they can be determined based on the glow of indicators.  As a rule, on a standard panel there are timer, super-mode, quick wash, and additional rinse bulbs. </p><p>  In fact, each indicator is a <span>special</span> code <span>signal</span> that can be calculated.  It works on a binary system.  In this case, the owner must know the Indesit error codes specifically for the AVD series. </p>

    <h2>  What codes are there? </h2><p>  The main code for models of the AVD series is F01.  These errors of Indesit (washing machines) are connected with the closure of the device triac.  In this case, there are certain problems with the motor.  In this case, immediately turn off the washing machine and wait for the master.  It is almost impossible to fix such a problem yourself.  On the washing machine, these errors can be <span>recognized (Indesit Wisl 103,</span> for example) by the last indicator on <span>the control panel.</span>  At the same time, the remaining bulbs will not light. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Code F02 tells the owner about problems with the tachogenerator.  This error is also quite serious.  In this case, the rotation of the drive device in the washing machine is stopped.  This error is usually associated with a <span>short circuit</span> in the wiring.  As a result, it must be checked for integrity.  The F02 code can be recognized by the glow of the fourth indicator.  The fourth and fifth bulbs burning together indicate problems with <span>the temperature sensor.</span>  This error in the instruction is designated F03. </p><h2>  Troubleshooting </h2><p>  Many errors may be displayed erroneously.  In this case, the system crashes, and washing stops immediately.  First of all, you should look at the model and make sure that there is no leakage in it.  Next, check the connector.  In some cases, water gets into it.  In such a situation, it should be dried. </p><p>  Problems with the washing machine motor are most often associated with chemical corrosion.  In this case, the device pads are damaged, and you can replace them yourself.  However, you should first find out their exact marking for the purchase.  A more complex action is the installation of an electronic module. </p><h2>  Error codes related to drying failure </h2><p>  Errors F13 - F15 are associated with a drying failure in the washing machine.  Code F13 indicates that the drying sensor is out of order.  At the same time, he is not able to determine the normal temperature.  In this case, the device must be completely replaced.  This error can be recognized on the control panel.  At the same time, the second, third and fifth indicator should light on it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Code F14 is associated with a broken tubular heater.  In this case, the second, third and fourth indicator lights up on the panel.  This item is quite expensive.  Additionally, replacing it at home without certain skills is almost impossible. </p><p>  Finally, the last mistake related to the dryer of the washing machine is called F15.  This code tells the owner that the tubular heater relay has failed.  With this error, the second to fifth indicators are active on the control panel. </p><h2>  Errors of the Zanusi Low End Series </h2><p>  The Zanusi Low End washing machines are quite similar to the previous series.  However, they are also not able to immediately display the error code on the display.  They have to be read based on the indicators.  The problem is that the bulbs come on in the wrong order.  In this case, the owner will again have to turn to the instructions for help. </p>

    <h2>  Error codes for Low End models </h2><p>  The flashing first light on the control panel of the Zanusi washing machine indicates problems with the triac.  This error is indicated in the instructions as F01.  In this case, the code F02 is also associated with a breakdown of the motor, and its nominal drive.  A flashing second light notifies the owner of the above problem.  If the first two indicators are immediately activated, then the error is related to the temperature sensor.  It is indicated in instruction F03. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  An additionally common code among Zanusi washing machines of the Low End series, it is considered to be F04.  It is associated with incorrect operation of the level sensor.  At the same time, the third indicator on the control panel flashes continuously. </p><h2>  How to determine the breakdown of drying in the car? </h2><p>  Error codes for the owner of the Low End series are indicated by the error codes of the Indesit F13 - F15 washing machines.  When the temperature sensors break down in them, the third indicator immediately starts flashing.  If it concerns a tubular electric heater, then the fourth lamp is activated on the panel.  In this case, washing in automatic mode instantly stops.  To resolve this problem, contact a service center. </p><p>  Finally, the last mistake is the breakdown of the relay of the tubular electric heater for drying the washing machine.  This issue is classified under code F15.  You can see it again on the control panel of the washing machine.  The above code corresponds to the fifth indicator.  If it flashes, then the tube heater relay is definitely defective. </p>

    <h2>  AVL Generation Washing Machine Errors </h2><p>  For AVL generation models, Indesit can identify any error codes for washing machines.  This is due to the fact that they are immediately displayed on the display and do not disappear anywhere.  In this case, the owner has the opportunity to instantly find out about the malfunction and take any measures. </p><h2>  What kind of errors can occur? </h2><p>  The most common are problems with the motor, which is installed in the washing machine.  If it does not receive electricity, F01 appears on the display.  In most cases, these Indesit washing machine error codes are related to winding integrity.  However, the designation F02 indicates that the motor drive has failed.  In turn, codes F03 - F05 are associated with the drain pump of the washing machine.  In this case, the level sensor also fails. </p><p>  Problems F06 - F09 are purely software problems.  Their main reason is a violation of the integrity of the wiring.  In particular, error F 08 (Indesit) indicates a violation of the internal memory of the device.  Codes F10 - F15 - this is primarily a problem with a tubular electric heater.  This problem is typical for early models with dryers.  Finally, for Indesit washing machines, the H20 error tells the owner about the malfunction of the drum. </p><h2>  Motor related errors </h2><p>  Error F 05 (Indesit) is the main one, if we talk about problems with the motor of the washing machine.  In order to solve it, you must remove the back cover from the device.  Next, you should carefully inspect the motor for foreign objects.  In some cases, the mechanism can be locked mechanically with a small screw that accidentally hits it.  In this case, the object should be removed, and the motor installed again. </p><p>  If this is not the case, then error F 05 (Indesit) may lie in the contacts.  In this case, the connectors are checked for integrity.  Additionally, the problem may be with the motor tachometer.  To check it, the specialist measures the resistance.  This indicator should be within 100 ohms.  The tachometer breaks most often when foam gets on it.  It ends, as a rule, deplorably.  In this case, for the normal operation of the washing machine, you will have to replace the motor completely. </p>

    <h2>  Drain Pump Errors </h2><p>  The error codes of Indesit washing machines with drain pumps deserve special attention.  First of all, they can lead to a water leak, and the apartment can be flooded.  It should also be understood that such problems are very common, and each owner should know what to do in this case. </p><p>  As experts advise, it is immediately necessary to shut off the water.  Next, you should do a direct inspection of the drain pump.  It is located under the drum near the motor of the washing machine.  In order to get to it, you need to disconnect the back cover of the washing machine, which is mounted on ordinary screws.  Next, remove the motor and set it aside. </p><p>  After this, it is possible to check the connection of the drain pump to the electronic module.  If the connection is not broken, you need to proceed to measure the resistance on the winding of the drain pump.  This parameter must be within 170 ohms.  If the resistance is lower or higher than normal, the drain pump should be replaced.  Unfortunately, it cannot be repaired, and this should be taken into account.  It may also be necessary to reinstall the electronic module in the washing machine. </p>

    <h2>  Service Error F12 </h2><p>  For Indesit washing machines, error F12 is associated with a hatch lock.  To solve this problem, you should first check the device‚Äôs connection.  Additionally, the specialist must inspect the feedback microswitch.  As a rule, all connectors of the electronic module are checked. </p><p>  Among other things, in Indesit washing machines an F12 error may occur due to a violation of the integrity of the wiring.  In some cases, the contacts disconnect and the door locks automatically.  If the electronic module is serviceable and working properly, then the specialist will completely replace the lock lock.  In this case, flashing non-volatile memory will absolutely not help. </p>
