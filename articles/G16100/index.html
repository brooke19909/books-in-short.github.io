    <h2>  Jack Pumpkin Workshop </h2><p>  The cartoon character Jack has long been a symbol of Halloween evening.  His portraits are hung in the form of posters near the houses, children want to put on his costume for a party, and adults are wondering how to cut a pumpkin with its terrifying grimace. </p><p>  In order for you to get the correct and beautifully carved pumpkin with Jack, it is worth remembering some of the differences when cutting.  Before cutting, stock up not only with a knife, but also with a needle with a dense thread.  It is better to take the largest needle that is found.  If this is not in the house, then the awl will come down, but then grab a lighter as well.  All this is necessary for the "special mouth", which, as we can see in the drawings, the cartoon character is sewn up.  We can only cut a small narrow gap and, having outlined the same distance in a couple of centimeters, make vertical stitches with thread. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  What can be cut from pumpkin if you do not have experience in this matter </h2><p>  On the eve of All Saints Day, many people begin to decorate their home with carved pumpkins.  Sometimes the beauty just strikes them.  In pumpkins you can see not only simple, familiar faces, but even whole artworks. </p><p>  In 1996, Michael Harris, a resident of California, surprised his neighbors with his pumpkins painting his lawn.  On the territory of his yard were real masterpieces - images of all the inhabitants of the street.  He knew exactly how to cut a pumpkin so that everyone would remember this for a long time. </p><p>  If you also want to please your guests with such amazing decorations for the holiday, but you have no experience in carving pumpkins, do not worry, the main thing is practice and the presence of artistic talent. </p>

    <h2>  Original ‚Äúlights‚Äù from pumpkins for All Saints Day </h2><p>  Many of the needlewomen start preparing for important holidays with the creation of home-made decorations for the home.  Such decor can always surprise and evoke amazed looks and praise from guests.  Therefore, back in December, they undertake to make balls on the Christmas tree, and by March 8 the house is filled with spring ikebans.  But what to do in the fall, before the most bewitching and mysterious harvest festival - Halloween?  That's right, it's time to think about how to cut a carriage from pumpkins, because simple and standard decors from these autumn vegetables are not suitable for high-level craftswomen. </p><p>  But do not forget that you have to work with perishable material.  Therefore, be patient or practice ahead of time on smaller and not very valuable pumpkins.  Skillfully carved drawing will definitely be able to cause children's joy and delight from adults. </p>

    <h2>  <strong>Nightclub party: surprise those around you with your outfit</strong> </h2><p>  Fashion for costume parties came to us a long time ago.  At first, the morning parties that were familiar to all of us in kindergartens and schools forced our parents to make new and original outfits for us every year, and over time, corporate parties at work began to force us to go shopping to find the appropriate costume. </p><p>  The issue of choosing a carnival outfit must be approached not only with responsibility, but also with humor and originality.  You do not have to buy an outfit or rent one.  For example, on the eve of All Saints Day (Halloween), you can afford to make an outfit yourself.  One of the easiest ways is to come up with how to cut a pumpkin with a standard, but interesting pattern, and choose an appropriate image for yourself.  It can be either a peasant or a ghost.  With a pumpkin in your hands, you will look harmonious at any party. </p><h2>  <strong>Choosing a Halloween costume</strong> </h2><p>  Surely each of us knows the feeling when you don‚Äôt know what image to choose for your Halloween celebration.  Girls usually can not decide on the position of "good and evil", who to be - a witch or a princess.  The question is, <em> </em>  how to cut a drawing on a pumpkin so that the house is also decorated in accordance with the event. </p><p>  To begin with, you must choose for yourself characters in which you definitely should not reincarnate.  Walking in this way "from the opposite", the easiest way will be to choose what you want and be satisfied.  Rate your external data.  You should not dress in a kolobok if you weigh 45 kg, first of all remember that on Halloween it was usually customary to wear frightening outfits.  After many years, people dress up both in good heroes, and in movie characters and books, but what definitely shouldn't be done is to have an absurd appearance at Halloween celebrations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what can be cut from pumpkin" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24277/563448.jpg" width="360"></div>

A quality nightclub, where you can definitely have fun and relax on Halloween, will probably announce information about the upcoming party long before the scheduled day. </p>

    <p>  The institution must necessarily have an appropriate atmosphere, a creatively decorated room, and advertising brochures should inform about the presence of a competitive program and free cocktails.  If the institution does not offer anything but big words to confirm a quality party, you should refrain and refuse to visit such a club. </p><p>  Garage parties can be a very good option for a Halloween evening.  When small clubs gather a limited number of personally invited guests.  The atmosphere of fun is guaranteed. </p>
