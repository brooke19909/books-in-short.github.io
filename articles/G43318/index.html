  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DVR SHO-ME HD-7000SX: positive and negative reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Using DVRs has become perhaps as commonplace as eating or brushing your teeth.  Using devices like the SHO-ME HD-7000SX, the driver can easily capture the situation on the road.  More information about the product will be discussed in the article. </p><h2>  Gadget culture </h2><p>  The technological leap that characterizes the 21st century has led to an increasing pace of production and the massive acquisition of automobiles.  Motorways and interchanges do not have time to build as quickly, because in large cities traffic jams and accidents very often occur. </p><p>  To restore the details of a car accident and punish the culprit (who often hides from the scene), video recorders are used.  SHO-ME HD-7000SX is one such. </p><p>  Reliably mounted on the windshield, the gadget is an excellent assistant to the motorist. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.drive2.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="dvr sho me hd 7000sx" class="if uuid-2743277" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2743277.jpg"></div><h2>  About device </h2><p>  The product has a built-in screen with a diagonal of 2.7 ", with which you can view the recorded videos. Video recording is cyclical and occurs in a resolution of 1440 √ó 1080 pixels. The viewing angle of the camera is 140 ¬∞. The date and time stamp is superimposed on the image in the subtitle line. In the design SHO-ME HD-7000SX products have a microphone that can be turned off as unnecessary. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Files are saved to a 32 GB flash drive in AVI format.  The clips last 3, 5 or 10 minutes depending on the options set. </p><p>  An important point worth mentioning is the presence of a G-sensor in the device.  This is an electronic accelerometer that records the time of an accident in three dimensions.  The function allows you to capture on the camera everything that happened before and after the traffic accident. </p><p>  When the shock sensor is activated, recording starts automatically, the file is placed in a special folder on the memory card, which is protected from erasure and overwriting.  Time and date are automatically superimposed regardless of the settings.  The moment of increasing load on the car and a change in speed are noted. </p><p>  The G-sensor in the SHO-ME HD-7000SX needs to be calibrated before driving, setting the degree of sensitivity.  Otherwise, the device will respond to any sharp turn or push, and the memory will be filled with files protected from automatic deletion. </p><div class="photo" data-original="avtoshop-led.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sho me hd 7000sx reviews" class="if uuid-2743280" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2743280.jpg"></div><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  SHO-ME HD-7000SX is noted by motorists as a reliable and compact device.  I like the viewing angle, a clear picture and ease of operation. </p><p>  According to the comments, the quality of shooting at altitude at night and in the daytime.  The mount is reliable - the suction cup does not fall off the windshield. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Despite the abundance of positive opinions of consumers, there are also negative ones.  In particular, it is indicated that the quality is not at all as high as stated: license plates in FullHD format are distinguishable only at close range.  There were problems with writing files: overwriting does not work, you have to format the memory card. </p><div class="photo" data-original="avtomoda54.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sho me hd 7000sx dashcam design" class="if uuid-2743828" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43230/2743828.jpg"></div><h2>  Total </h2><p>  Summarizing, it should be noted that the product is worth the money: the optimal set of characteristics, and even a G-sensor for only 2250 rubles.  Only one nuance: since 2016, the gadget is difficult to find on sale. </p><p>  The product is not bad, like the entire line of devices under the SHO-ME brand.  However, during the selection, you should decide what features you want to see in the DVR, and then only choose a model for the car. </p>
