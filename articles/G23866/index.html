  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Do-it-yourself sun skirt pattern</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The sun skirt has become popular among experienced and novice seamstresses due to its simplicity and unpretentiousness.  Despite this, she looks good enough not only on young girls.  This model is often studied by girls in labor lessons as one of the simplest ones, and general principles are explained using its example. </p><h2>  Merki </h2><p>  First of all, starting individual work, each self-respecting seamstress takes measurements.  To draw up a competent <span>pattern of a skirt, the sun</span> will need only 2 measurements: half-waist and the estimated length of the skirt.  For example, the following numbers will be taken into account: </p><ul><li>  Half circumference - 34 cm. </li><li>  Skirt length (Du) - 68 cm. </li></ul><p>  Since the skirt pattern itself looks like a circle with a hole, it is necessary to calculate the radius of the hole itself.  It is calculated by the formula: </p><p>  R = 1/3 * Pot - 1, </p><p>  where Pot - Half-waist. </p><p>  R = 1/3 * (34 - 1) = 11 </p><p>  If after division it does not work out an integer, it is necessary to round up to a greater extent until it is received.  For example, if you get 10.33, then the number is rounded to 11. </p><h2>  Kinds </h2><p>  Unfortunately, not all fabric cuts can allow you to cut a full circle, therefore, depending on the width of the fabric, the patterns of the skirt are divided into two types: </p><ol><li>  Product with two seams. </li><li>  Product without seams. </li></ol><p>  Seams are placed on the product in a way that is convenient for the creator.  Someone prefers the front and back, but someone prefers on the sides. </p><h2>  Pattern with two seams. </h2><p>  When creating a full-fledged product from a pattern of a skirt with two seams, you will need a fabric whose length will be: Du * 4 + R * 4 + 10 cm. Do not forget about hem allowances, usually 2-3 cm are put on the pattern for them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To draw up a skirt pattern, it is necessary to expand a piece of fabric, and lay the length of the skirt along the edge of the upper edge, while adding a few centimeters to the hem of the fabric.  Next, you should postpone the radius and mark the point from which to draw a circle using a compass or other improvised means.  There should be two circles of radii, the first includes only the radius of the notch, and the second is the sum of the lengths of the radius and the deferred centimeters for the hem, the length of the skirt.  According to the rules, the notch under the waist on the self-made pattern of the skirt should be increased by 1 cm on each side.  The same pattern is repeated for the other half. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nudekisde.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Skirt pattern sun" class="if uuid-2323170" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47527/2323170.jpg"></div><h2>  Seamless </h2><p>  This option assumes the presence of a fabric with a width equal to 2 * Du + R, this is necessary so that the pattern "fit".  The very pattern of the skirt is constructed in the same way as in the previous case, but at the same time the fabric is folded in half, and the work starts from the fold.  If the length or width is not enough, then you can finish the missing parts later separately. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thefullfiguredchest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cute summer look" class="if uuid-2323755" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47527/2323755.jpg"></div><h2>  Sewing </h2><p>  Before sewing on a typewriter, it is necessary to sweep away the future seams, having previously left a place under the zipper in one of them, about 15-20 cm. It is imperative to cut tissue sections so that the fabric does not begin to crumble.  The next step is to process the fastener space. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The notch under the waist is processed using a belt, braid or other decorative elements, for example, using a corsage.  The bottom of the skirt is processed strictly after fitting.  After completion of work, the skirt is thoroughly ironed and completely ready to wear. </p><p>  The appearance of the skirt can be anything, it all depends on the imagination of the creator.  Some girls prefer the most concise products, it is easier to make an image with them.  Sometimes the skirt is decorated with embroidery, lace, pockets or ribbons, thereby acquiring a unique look.  The color of the skirt and the material depend on the wishes of the future hostess.  For example, a finished skirt made of woolen fabric looks warm, falls down in large waves.  A product made of chiffon, more suitable for the summer and spring, will be flying and emphasize the femininity of the hostess. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vovk.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="A modest look with a practical skirt" class="if uuid-2323756" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47527/2323756.jpg"></div><h2>  How to wear a sun skirt </h2><p>  Despite its simplicity, such a skirt has been popular for several decades, as it has no age restrictions.  It can become the center not only of everyday image, but also of office and informal ones.  The main criteria for determining style are length and fabric.  For example, the same sun skirt, but made of fabric in a bright cage or strip, and with a length above the middle of the thigh, is perfect for young and bright people who love attention.  But the skirt below the knees will not only successfully emphasize the slimness of the waist, but also hide the imperfections of the legs, a similar model is especially popular among teachers and in other professions that require restraint. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lolamagazin.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Simple and practical skirt with pockets" class="if uuid-2323760" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47527/2323760.jpg"></div><p>  To create a delicate look, you can turn to the dark skirt of the sun and complement it with a translucent shirt, this option will be ideal for the summer and will look good both with open sandals and high heel shoes.  In winter, young girls should pay attention to the combination of this product with warm stockings and a knitted sweater. </p><p>  <span>The skirt pattern for a</span> school-age <span>girl</span> is the same as for adults, the finished product can be decorated with buckle, lace, hemline, or other decorative elements.  Some craftswomen can also use petticoats, thereby giving the product charm and tenderness. </p>
