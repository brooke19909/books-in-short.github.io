This grandiose building in the world list of the tallest hotels takes second place.  It is located on the artificially created island of the Persian Gulf.  A feature of this complex is the absolute uniqueness of each of its rooms.  All of them have their own unique design, are equipped with modern household appliances and have two floors.

There are many popular night clubs and restaurants. </p><h2>  Palm jumeirah </h2><p>  This is a man-made island that extends the coastline of Jumeirah by six kilometers inland to the Persian Gulf.  Both residential buildings and elite premium-class hotels with a high level of service and private beaches have been built here.  These include: </p><ul><li>  Atlantis the Palm Jumeirah 5 * - designed for entertaining youth recreation; </li><li>  Jumeirah Zabeel Saray 5 * - for family holidays; </li><li>  Kempinski the Palm Jumeirah 5 * - calm comfortable rest. </li></ul><p>  It should be borne in mind that you can’t swim from the outside of the island.  All beaches are in its center. </p><h2>  Dubai Marina </h2><p>  If you think in which area of ​​Dubai it is better to relax, then we recommend that you pay attention to this, one of the most prestigious areas.  There are skyscrapers (including residential ones), the height of which reaches 120 floors.  Each such house has its own cinema, fitness rooms, and waiting rooms are provided for guests.  In these houses, high-speed silent elevators.

In addition, there are several lakes for parking yachts.  Even those tourists who do not live in the area like to come here to visit shopping centers.  The largest of them is the Marina Mall.  We are sure that many tourists believe that this is the best area of ​​Dubai. </p><h2>  Jumeirah Beach Residence </h2><p>  If in most areas of Dubai there are many hotels, then this is only four.  Basically there are buildings with apartments, the famous sand-colored houses, which are known to many by the photo in travel agency brochures.  Along the whole area there is a beautiful well-groomed beach strip with many <span>cafes, restaurants</span> and shops.  The beach here is excellently equipped, but umbrellas and sun loungers can be borrowed at an additional cost.  The entrance to the sea is gentle. </p><p>  This area of ​​Dubai is loved by wealthy travelers from Pakistan, India and Russia.  There is a pedestrian area, which is lit in the evenings by decorative lanterns. </p><h2>  Downtown Burj Dubai </h2><p>  If you are not going to the UAE for a vacation, but on a business visit, then you should not have to ask yourself in which area of ​​Dubai it is better to choose a hotel.  Of course, in Downtown, the business district.  This is the place where the owners of large companies, financiers and other wealthy people live.  Often this area is compared with New York and Bangkok, London and Singapore.  Stunning skyscrapers are located here, which you can watch for hours.  The famous shopping center of Dubai is located here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="in which area of ​​Dubai is it better to stay" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2080220.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The International Trade Center, located in this area, is an interesting attraction in Dubai.  Today it is a kind of symbol of national pride and is a skyscraper in which there are offices of foreign companies, residential premises, hotels, exhibition halls, the International Convention Center. </p><h2>  Al-barsha </h2><p>  The areas of Dubai are constantly expanding and landscaping.  Al Barsha is a new area of ​​Dubai.  The place is quite quiet, one might say, family friendly.  There are many inexpensive but comfortable hotels located near many of Dubai's attractions.  Near the Dubai Mall, a large ski center, Ski Dubai. </p><p>  The mere thought that a unique ski resort is located in the middle of the desert leads tourists to indescribable delight, although this structure is more popular among the local population and visitors from neighboring countries.  At Ski Dubai you can rent everything you need: snowboards and skis, sledges, here you will even be offered winter clothes.  For the local population, the ski resort has become a real miracle - now they can play snowballs and ski and sled.  This is, without exaggeration, the amazing attraction of Dubai. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="in which area of ​​Dubai is it better to choose a hotel" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2080219.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Deira </h2><p>  It's no secret that many tourists like to visit the eastern regions of Dubai - here are the famous markets, which you can wander around for hours.  For example, the <span>Gold Market.</span>  <span>In Dubai,</span> there has long been no own field.  Therefore, sellers here work with gold brought from South Africa, Russia and China.  You are unlikely to see price tags in such markets; the seller will tell you the price, but you must bargain. </p><h2>  Bur Dubai </h2><p>  The area is an alternative to budget vacations.  There is a huge selection of hotels of any category, in comparison with the old tourist area of ​​Deira.  They are separated by Creek Bay.  The area is intended for shopping, beach vacations, business trips.  The vast majority of hotels offer a free shuttle service to the equipped municipal beach of Al Mamzar Beach, the entrance to which is paid.  There is also a free beach. </p><p>  Among the attractions we recommend visiting the Fort Museum, the fabric market, Creek Park with a dolphinarium, go for a walk along the bay by boat, walk through the Burjuman and Wafi City shopping centers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="in which area of ​​Dubai is it better to relax" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2080213.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Jebel </h2><p>  The area is suitable for a secluded relaxing holiday in beachfront hotels with their own beaches.  Here, experienced tourists recommend choosing an all-inclusive option in five-star hotels.  Outside the hotel infrastructure is poorly developed.  But the area is developing rapidly: there is already a horse and go-kart club, a golf club. </p><h2>  Bar dubai </h2><p>  We walked through the main areas of Dubai and finally got into the historical center, where historical and cultural attractions are located.  Inspecting them, connoisseurs of Arab culture and art, history buffs will be delighted.  At the local textile market, you can buy Oriental and European fabrics, pillows, carpets, handmade linens. </p><h2>  Al Fahidi Museum </h2><p>  The exposition of the cultural and historical national museum of Al Fahidi is dedicated to the history of the country.  The entrance to it is located from the side of the ancient fort.  Here you can get acquainted with the life of the local population in antiquity, see reed huts, learn all the stages of the historical development of the UAE. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="main areas of dubai" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2080215.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The exposition is divided into three parts: modern, medieval and prehistoric Dubai.  Tours are conducted by experienced professional guides who speak several languages, including Russian.  In the museum you can see many interesting exhibits that open the veil of secrets of the history of the emirates. </p><h2>  Sheikh Said's House </h2><p>  This is a special attraction of Dubai.  The building was built by the grandfather of the current ruler of the emirate, later it housed the residence of Sheikh Saeed, and business meetings and meetings began to be held.  Today, everyone can visit this house.  This monument is especially popular among foreign tourists.  In addition, this museum is included in the list of cultural monuments of the country.  The official status of the museum was assigned to him thirty years ago, after restoration work was carried out in the building.  Interestingly, the inspection of the House-Museum is carried out according to the rules of the eastern countries - from right to left. </p><p>  We tried to briefly describe the areas of Dubai.  Where it is better to relax, which hotel to choose, how to spend time - you decide.  But we hope that your choice will not disappoint you and the trip will be vivid and memorable. </p>
