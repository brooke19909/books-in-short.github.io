    <h2>  Hotel Feature </h2><p>  Spice &amp; SPA Hotel (Belek) has five stars and is considered an elite Turkish hotel complex.  It was built about ten years ago and since then it is rightfully considered one of the best in the country.  The territory of the hotel, along with buildings is almost one hundred thousand square meters.  The Internet reviews of Spice Hotel (Turkey / Belek) provide information that every corner of the hotel complex is decorated with great love and abundantly planted with exotic plants.  Walking in this territory is a great pleasure for adults and children. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The design of the Spice Hotel (Belek) is a unique alloy of oriental flavor and comfort, which is ensured by modern materials and technologies used to build the hotel complex. </p><p>  The hotel has several buildings where guests are accommodated.  The main building has four floors, the rooms here in the bulk are represented by standards and suites.  Two additional buildings were located nearby, and in a special zone hidden from the eyes of the bulk of the guests, cottages were built.  Some have two floors, others only one.  There are twenty-two such cottages at the Spice Hotel in Belek; newlyweds and families with several children like to stay in them. </p><h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  The hotel complex was built in a very picturesque place almost on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.  The exact location of the Spice Hotel is Belek.  In Turkey, this resort is quite popular not only among our compatriots, but also among guests from the good old Europe.  There are numerous entertainment venues where young people can always hang out.  Also in Belek there are many boutiques and shopping centers, where tourists have the opportunity to purchase exclusive goods at fairly low prices. </p><p>  Guests at the Spice &amp; Spa Hotel (Belek) are only two kilometers from the center of resort life.  You can walk them in just five minutes, besides the road runs along the picturesque streets of the city, where every second you want to take another photo. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This beach resort is especially attractive for tourists.  It belongs to the hotel and stretches a wide sandy strip for almost three hundred meters.  Sunbathing and swimming here is one sheer pleasure. </p><p>  Guests of the Spice Hotel (Turkey / Belek) are separated from the international airport terminal in Antalya by a long forty kilometers.  However, this is quite typical for Turkish resorts, all of them are located quite far from the airports.  Therefore, hotel complexes always provide tourists with a shuttle service.  Comfortable air-conditioned vehicles are used for transportation, so after a long and tiring flight the road to the airport will not be a difficult test for travelers. </p><p>  The hotel is designed for the simultaneous reception of one thousand one hundred and sixty guests, five hundred forty-six rooms are arranged for them, divided into sixteen categories.  The apartments differ not only in decoration (Turkish, Indian style) and the level of comfort, but in the number of services available to guests.  Therefore, be sure to consider this moment when booking a room for yourself or your family. </p>
