But this does not mean that she is the only one.  An alternative is the Perfect Money system.  Reviews emphasize that it was opened back in 2007, which means it has long had its fans.  The service is easy to use, but its reliability is doubtful for many, which is why the system remains on the sidelines so far.  It has a big plus, namely that customers can open a multicurrency account in dollars, euros or gold. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="perfect money reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2161308.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  One of many </h2><p>  Modern realities make it possible to choose payment systems.  If you are tormented by the question which one to prefer, you need to familiarize yourself with all the conditions in detail, calculate your profit, read the reviews.  Today we will consider the pros and cons of the quite popular <span>Perfect Money</span> e- <span>wallet.</span>  Reviews about him are mixed.  So let's figure out which of them are honest and which are not. </p><h2>  Features of the payment system </h2><p>  Launched Perfect Money was a company that is registered in Panama.  The operations center is located in Zurich.  It is focused on operating foreign currency.  This leads to certain inconveniences in Russia.  But if you are buying on Ebay, then this can be a significant plus. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Perfect <span>Money, reviews</span> of which we are considering today, positions itself as an ideal financial institution.  We can say that this is very self-confident.  Developers put forward three main advantages of the system: </p><ul><li>  Convenience. </li><li>  Security. </li><li>  Simplicity. </li></ul><p>  Focusing on this, we can say that most users should like the system.  But statistics show that a significant part continues to work with the WebMoney service. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Perfect money wallet reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/2162214.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Perfect Money Features </h2><p>  First of all, it is a transfer of money between users.  This requires that you and the recipient be registered in the same system.  Here it‚Äôs worth a little to talk about such a thing as verification.  It is used in the project Perfect Money.  Reviews say that this procedure forces you to refuse to register in the system, because it scares you with its complexity.  But for most customers, it is intuitive, you just need to start performing sequential actions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="payment system perfect money reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2161307.jpg"></div>

After performing simple actions, it decreases to 0.5%.  To pass verification, you need to go to the "settings", in the menu "Verification Management".  It goes through three stages: </p><ul><li>  By name.  To do this, you need to download a scan of a document proving your identity.  It can be a passport or a driver‚Äôs license. </li><li>  By the address.  To do this, you need to make a scan or photograph of the utility bill, on which the address is clearly visible, as well as full name </li><li>  By phone number.  The robot will call the entered number and in English will dictate 4 digits. </li></ul><p>  After that, you can use the payment system. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="perfect money credit exchange reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2161290.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Additional features </h2><p>  What else can Perfect <span>Money do?</span>  <span>Reviews</span> suggest that not only send payments, but also receive them.  But that is not all. </p><ul><li>  Very pleased with the opportunity to regularly pay electronic bills online.  This eliminates the waste of time in queues at the bank.  There is another convenient nuance, which consists in the fact that you do not even have to do anything.  Just set up automatic payment, and a certain amount will be charged from the account every month. </li><li>  Transfer of money for goods and services.  This is very convenient for those who use foreign sites. </li><li>  Issue of electronic vouchers. </li><li>  The acquisition of currency or gold, as well as the exchange. </li><li>  Affiliate program.  Everything is simple here.  If you attract people to the resource, then they go to the site via a referral link, after which you begin to receive 1% per annum from the monthly balance in the account of each referral. </li></ul><p>  A separate line should be noted the possibility of lending, which offers a Perfect Money wallet.  Reviews emphasize that you can not only take funds, but also be their recipient.  This is a kind of deposit in an electronic account.  The company charges 4% per annum on the minimum balance and pays them monthly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Customer status </h2><p>  According to reviews, the Perfect Money payment system is quite labile, so it can suit a large number of users.  If you just registered, then you are first assigned the status Normal.  It does not impose any restrictions and limits, which is convenient for most users. </p><p>  One year from the date of registration, the user can be assigned the status of Premium.  You can speed up this process by depositing at least 50 thousand dollars into your account.  The client can regularly apply for status upgrades, which involves a number of discounts on standard system tariffs. </p><p>  Partner Status.  The decision on this is made by the administration of the company.  Most often these are business accounts that link their payment to the system.  Here the client receives the maximum number of privileges. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="perfect money customer reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2161291.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  How to register? </h2><p>  It presents no difficulty.  Perfect Money customer reviews describe the procedure as the easiest option for beginners.  You must go to the site and fill out a special form.  Passport data, first and last name, city and postal code are indicated here.  Also indicate the status of the account.  Now you need to accept the terms of the user agreement, which are presented in English. </p><p>  After that, an e-mail will be sent to you.  It can cause difficulties for those who do not know English, since translation is not provided.  There will be an ID code and a wallet replenishment instruction.  The interface is understandable, which users note in their reviews. </p><h2>  Personal Area </h2><p>  In addition to the simple and not overloaded interface, I would like to note a convenient separation of all information in such blocks as ‚ÄúExtract‚Äù, ‚ÄúHistory‚Äù, ‚ÄúAnalytics‚Äù.  The last section is not too important for ordinary consumers.  But if you make money on the stock exchange, then reviews of the financial press in recent days will be very useful. </p><p>  The system has one significant drawback.  It consists in the fact that operations in rubles are impossible here, which means that each time there will be a conversion.  Reviews about the withdrawal of Perfect Money do not speak in favor of this system, because it is difficult and expensive to cash electronic money.  There is no direct transfer to the card either. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="perfect money credit exchange reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2161331.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <h2>  Credit Exchange, reviews </h2><p>  Perfect Money also allows you to earn money.  For this, a kind of financial pyramid is organized.  Here you can lend money at different interest rates.  (from 2% to 70%).  You have a chance to choose a client based on an analysis of the amount of money taken and returned.  Unfortunately, there are not many guarantees.  The percentage of loss of funds is also large.  Therefore, reviews about the Perfect Money credit exchange are not the most attractive.  You can try to take money at a small percentage and lend at a higher rate so that there is no high risk. </p><h2>  Minuses </h2><p>  Many users note the difficulty in estimating tariffs, because first you need to make a payment, and only then the system gives out the final amount.  In addition, if you mistakenly sent money to someone else's account, you cannot return it.  A separate item is the restoration of the account if necessary.  The cost of this service is 5800 rubles.  (100 dollars).  The last point is the anonymity of the payment system. </p><p>  If you do not want to make transfers taking into account the preferential commission, then you can not enter any passport data.  It is because of this that the system is accused of servicing financial pyramids. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="perfect money withdrawal reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2161330.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  To summarize what has been said, it becomes obvious that of the advantages of Perfect Money, users note three points: </p><ul><li>  Simple interface </li><li>  Minimum input data about yourself. </li><li>  The ability to make profitable purchases for the currency. </li></ul><p>  The system has many more disadvantages.  It: </p><ul><li>  All correspondence is in English. </li><li>  High commission. </li><li>  Lack of direct output to the card. </li><li>  Operating only in foreign currency. </li></ul><p>  Decide for yourself how this option will be convenient for you.  This is not the only payment system, so it will not be difficult to find an alternative.  If you are looking for high protection and transparency, then it is better to stop at the leading payment systems, even if you have to spend a little more time on registration.  But your money will definitely be completely safe, and no one will get access to it. </p>
