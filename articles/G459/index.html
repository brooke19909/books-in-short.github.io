    <h2>  Phuket Island View, Phuket: negative reviews </h2><p>  As in any other resort, in this hotel you can find a lot of shortcomings.  This is largely due to the fact that Phuket is a rather specific and exotic place to relax.  Hotel Phuket Island View 3 * is no exception.  It is worth paying to the negative reviews of the following content: </p><ul><li>  old furniture in the room (in some places there are scuffs and stains); </li><li>  all repair work in the hotel is carried out during the guests' relaxation, and therefore it is quite possible that noise and dust will interfere with you, or you will not be able to use any infrastructure facilities; </li><li>  it‚Äôs unpleasant enough that you can‚Äôt take food out of the restaurant (you either have to eat everything up by force or leave the food you paid for in the dining room); </li><li>  the safe at the reception is open from 07:00 to 23:00, and the rest of the time you can neither take your things from it, nor put anything extra; </li><li>  in the pool there is a sharp smell of chlorine, and due to the high concentration of this substance, the skin can be very itchy; </li><li>  tasteless coffee in the hotel restaurant; </li><li>  due to the poor functioning of the sewer system in the bathroom there is an unpleasant odor; </li><li>  in the dark, many rats can be seen on the territory (but this is a problem not only of this hotel, but of the entire resort); </li><li>  the waves take out a lot of algae and garbage on the beach, which remains on the shore); </li><li>  due to the large number of bureaucratic procedures, registration is extremely slow; </li><li>  the bathroom has very poor lighting, which not only complicates the adoption of hygiene procedures, but also increases the risk of injury; </li><li>  the hotel does not have its own beach, and at the municipal one has to pay 100 baht for using sun loungers and umbrellas; </li><li>  Wireless Internet only works well at the reception, and the signal does not reach other public areas; </li><li>  there are not enough hooks in the bathroom to hang towels and bathrobes; </li><li>  on the nearby beach there is no shower or toilet; </li><li>  during off-season, the assortment of breakfast dishes is significantly reduced;  the hood does not work well in the restaurant, and therefore in the dining room there is a persistent smell of food, which subsequently soaks clothes and hair; </li><li>  some rooms have cockroaches; </li><li>  in the massage room do not change the sheets on the couches before serving the next client; </li><li>  old washed towels of an unpleasant gray color; </li><li>  do not clean on the balcony; </li><li>  while bathing in the shower, water spills throughout the bathroom; </li><li>  the air conditioner works very noisy, which is why you have to turn it off at night; </li><li>  beach towels do not change. </li></ul><p>  Fans of exotic vacations should definitely pay attention to Phuket Island View 3 *.  Phuket, Karon Beach is a great place for those who want to get to know Thailand better.  And the prices at this hotel will please those travelers who are not used to spending a lot of money on hotel accommodation. </p>
