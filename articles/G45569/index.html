    <h2>  Comments of tourists about the number of rooms and the location of the hotel </h2><p>  As follows from the stories of our compatriots, Zdravets 4 * is a standard economy class hotel.  This hotel, like many other Bulgarian hotels of this type, is somewhat reminiscent of a Soviet boarding house.  The rooms here are spacious, bright, comfortable and clean.  The atmosphere in them is minimal, but there is everything you need for a comfortable stay.  For example, the bathroom has a hairdryer, so you don‚Äôt need to take it with you from home.  Pleased with the presence of a small refrigerator in the apartment and a working air conditioner.  Also, our compatriots were satisfied with sound insulation.  So, even those guests, whose windows overlooked the pool, where, as a rule, it is quite noisy both during the day and in the evening, with the <span>balcony door</span> closed, they could easily rest.  As for cleaning, there were no complaints about the maintenance personnel in this regard.  According to tourists, the maids daily cleaned the rooms, and towels and bed linen were changed every 3-4 days. </p><p>  Our compatriots also found the location of Zdravets 4 * very successful.  According to them, the hotel is located close to the center of Golden Sands, so all the entertainment and infrastructure of this resort city are within walking distance.  It is also convenient to travel from here to other <span>cities in Bulgaria.</span>  Literally one and a half hundred meters from the hotel is the beach.  By the way, tourists liked the local beaches very much for their fine sand, cleanliness and excellent infrastructure.  Experienced travelers recall that almost all the beaches in Bulgaria, and Golden Sands as well, are municipal.  Therefore, for the rental of sunbeds and umbrellas you will need to pay extra. </p>
