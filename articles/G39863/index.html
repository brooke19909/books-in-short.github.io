    <p>  <span>There are plenty of positive reviews about El Arenal in Mallorca due to the rich entertainment program.</span>  Anyone who finds the strength to leave the beach and put on his most festive outfit on vacation can plunge into the world of nightly entertainment.  Directly at the resort itself is a huge number of bars and restaurants.  Here you are guaranteed to have a good free time.  In the midst of the holiday season, they are constantly just crowded with young people who are resting here until the morning.  They all crave entertainment and new emotions, so sleep is out of the question.  Nightlife here is in full swing. </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1">It is noteworthy that couples of more venerable age will be interesting and comfortable here.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">After all, there are many 24-hour bars that offer entertainment that is interesting for any age.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">In addition, do not forget that very close to the largest city of the island - Palma de Mallorca.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">If desired, you can get to him.</span> </p><p>  In order to explore all the places of entertainment of El Arenal and coastal resorts, it is best to rent a car or even a bicycle.  The distances here are very small.  In Palma de Mallorca, you can usefully spend the whole day exploring various sights.  Or you can go shopping to the point of exhaustion. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Tourists in reviews of this resort often write that they most enjoy the clear turquoise sea and dazzling white sand. </p><p>  Vacationers like the fact that the beach occupies a large area, there are plenty of sun loungers and umbrellas here.  True, all this is paid.  Therefore, Russian tourists who want to save money are located under the palm trees on the towels that they bring with them. </p><p>  The entrance to the sea is sandy, very comfortable.  At first it‚Äôs shallow, but, moving away from the coast, you can swim in plenty.  After all, swimming in the clear sea is a true pleasure.  Even when you swim to the buoys, you can clearly see the bottom, as the water here is so clear. </p><p>  Among the minuses note the lack of water entertainment, to which Russian tourists are accustomed to in the Black Sea resorts.  Here they are missing.  In June, it is comfortable to swim even with young children, because there are practically no waves. </p><p>  After the sea, you can wash off the salt in the shower.  There are many on the public beach.  But there are no changing cabins at all. </p>
