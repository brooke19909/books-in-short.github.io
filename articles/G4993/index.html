    <h2>  What is Call Me? </h2><p>  But first, what is a beggar?  This term is used by many telephone subscribers.  What is a call back request? </p><p>  In fact, ‚ÄúCall Me Back‚Äù is a service that allows you to ask a person to call.  Very often used for lack of funds in the account.  The subscriber receives an SMS message asking.  Sometimes this opportunity is called simply "homeless".  After all, a message is thrown off by a person who does not have the means to call.  Here is such an interesting service that can be useful to anyone.  But how to ask to call back on "Beeline"? </p><h2>  Three seconds </h2><p>  The first option is suitable for those who use per-minute billing.  Often on such offers the first three seconds of the conversation are free.  That is, you can call yourself and ask for a call back during this period.  This rule applies to all operators. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thus, a request to call back to Beeline can be verbal.  But this option is suitable only when you have enough funds in your SIM card account.  At least for a minute of conversation.  Otherwise, the call simply does not happen.  As you can see, this is not a universal move.  But how can I ask to call back to Beeline if there is little or no money on the mobile account? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beggar on beeline" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1136178.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  the Internet </h2><p>  For example, the not-so-bad method is to use the world wide web to implement ideas.  The thing is that the network now has a lot of various virtual services that allow you to send SMS messages to your friends for free.  Anonymous or not. </p><p>  If you are interested in how to throw a "homeless" on the "Beeline", you can take advantage of this kind of offer.  Download a special program (or go to the SMS sending service), install it and run it.  Now write a letter asking to call.  Do not forget to indicate who you are.  It is also advisable to write your phone number so that the subscriber does not doubt the authenticity of the request.  Ready?  Enter your friend‚Äôs number in the appropriate field (‚ÄúRecipient‚Äù) and click ‚ÄúSend‚Äù. </p><p>  All done.  Beggar sent to Beeline.  Though in a somewhat non-standard way.  Please note that a day you can send either an unlimited number of free messages, or about 5-10 pieces.  It all depends on the type of program or Internet hosting.  Paid services should not be trusted - often all this is the most common fraud.  Be wary of sending beggars via the Internet. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  "Call me" </h2><p>  Of course, Beeline also has an official method for solving the task set before us.

It remains to click "Submit."  A few minutes of waiting - and the request will be made.  By the way, these ‚Äúbeggars‚Äù add up to USSD commands.  That is, it doesn‚Äôt matter what method you use - a day you can still send no more than 10 "homeless people" in total. </p>
