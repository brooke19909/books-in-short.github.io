    <h2>  Village History </h2><p>  The first evidence of life in these places, archaeological scientists date back to the middle of the XII century.  It was possible to find a number of jewelry and utensils, which historians were able to identify as objects made precisely at that time.  So, in the territory of a <span>modern village,</span> archaeologists unearthed two barrows and found more than 3,000 different household items, for example, amber beads, pendants in the form of coins, clay products. </p><p>  In those days, the small village belonged to the church - officially it was the property of the Novospassky monastery.  And so it went on for a long five centuries, until one day the Russian tsar decided in his own way the fate of the settlement.  In 1709, by his highest command, the village of Ostrovtsy in the Moscow Region was transferred to the eternal possession of the family of Count <span>Sheremetev Boris</span> Petrovich, a famous commander, diplomat, who by that time had been awarded the count's title for three years already.  It is believed that it was Count Sheremetev who was at the head of the Russian army when it won the battle of Poltava, for which in the same year Peter the Great awarded him numerous awards and also bestowed land estates. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Settlement development under the Sheremetyevs </h2><p>  The village of Ostrovtsy in the Moscow Region brought the Count's family a good income, mainly due to its convenient location - it was located right on the famous Astrakhan highway, along which merchants brought a lot of goods to Moscow.  Merchants stayed in Ostrovtsy to take a break before the last leg of the journey - in front of them was waiting for the capital.  In addition to several extremely profitable <span>inns, a</span> flour mill was a significant material income for the count family - in a year it brought in net 1,500 rubles of profit, which at that time was simply a huge amount.  For comparison, the clerk in the sovereign service in the middle of the XVIII century received 20 rubles a year, as Leonty Avtonomov wrote in his memoirs. </p><p>  According to the mid-19th century, Ostrovtsy still remained in the family, which was then headed by Count <span>Dmitry Nikolaevich Sheremetev,</span> and had 96 yards in which 717 peasants lived. </p><h2>  Under Soviet rule </h2><p>  With the advent of Soviet power, the village of Ostrovtsy in the <span>Moscow Region</span> entered the Podmoskovny state farm and became a large agricultural complex.  Even more rapid development began in the 60s and 90s of the last century, when the state farm, and then the joint-stock company, began to energetically build a microdistrict of high-rise buildings. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Ostrovtsy Village, Moscow Region: how to get there </h2><p>  Today, the former Astrakhan tract is the Ryazan highway, and the location of the village is still successful in terms of transport accessibility, because only 15 km from the village to the Moscow Ring Road.  By car or public transport it takes literally a few minutes.  The village stands directly on the M5 federal highway Ural, which connects it with a direct road to the nearest stations of the Moscow metro: Vykhino, Kuzminki, Kotelniki.  The bus stop "Ostrovtsy 1" is located in the very center of the village, and 12 minibuses pass here.  The most popular of them: No. 558 to Kuzminki, No. 68 to Bykovo, No. 33 to Lyubertsy. </p>

    <p>  Here, near the Ostrovtsy stop in the Moscow Region (photo above), there is a local attraction - a pink Indian elephant.  This is a stone structure that belongs to a private person and is still uninhabited.  It is decorated with small rhombus-shaped windows and numerous paintings.  While there is no data on what is planned to be placed in this building, it is not difficult to assume that it is unlikely to be residential. </p><h2>  Ostrovtsy in the Moscow region: cemetery </h2><p>  The local cemetery is considered a landmark.  Famous personalities who have left a noticeable mark on the history of the country, and especially in the history of astronautics, are buried here.  The former village of Ostrovtsy, Moscow Region, is located near the city of Zhukovsky, named after the founder of Soviet rocket science, and many figures in this important area were buried in a necropolis specially equipped for them.  The cemetery has 54 sites on which lie, for example, Hero of the Soviet Union Daniil Gaponenko and a major scientist who made many discoveries in aerodynamics - V.V.Sychev.  Famous Soviet athletes are buried here. </p>
