It‚Äôs worth figuring out which <span>video player is better.</span>  This, of course, is about DVD players. </p><p>  First, let's not forget about such a thing as multi-zone.  For both discs and DVD players, a regional coding system has been introduced.  The whole Earth, according to this system, is divided into 6 zones, and for each zone they usually produce their own versions of disks and reproducing devices corresponding to these disks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Which player is better" class="if" height="206" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10760/26063.jpg" width="205"></div>

    <p>  Reading formats is a big problem for DVD players from dishonest manufacturers.  One of the main rules when choosing a device for DVD: which player is better, reads more formats.  Although you should not assume that the number of supported formats is the only criterion.  When deciding <span>which DVD player is best,</span> other things are important.  But this is a very significant and significant characteristic.  The format that the player must support in the first place is Mpeg-4, preferably with XviD and DivX codecs.  Now, elite brands do not hesitate to include support for this format in their players, so if you see a player on the storefront that does not support this format, you can safely move on.  In addition, it is likely that you will want to listen to music on your DVD recorder / player, in which case it is imperative that your DVD player supports either the DVD audio format or the Super Audio CD format.  Note that now on DVD-players the DVD-audio format is more common, as it is better suited for home theaters.  By the way, if you bought a player from a really high-quality manufacturer, but it doesn‚Äôt have the format you need, do not despair: for such there are a large number of software updates, after flashing which your player will have more options. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

The question does not have a clear answer.  Someone just needs to watch the films that he has in his home collection, and someone has a need to ‚Äúcatch‚Äù various programs and films on television and record them in order to watch them again and again.  So in this case, the question of which player is better is generally incorrect.  Players with the ability to write to disk are often called DVD recorders.  With varying <span>degrees of compression of</span> video material, a DVD recorder can burn from one to several hours of movies or programs on a single DVD.  Of course, the greater the compression ratio and the more time video fit on the disk, the worse its quality will be.

    <p>  A modern player, as a modern person, should be easily adaptable, that is, it should be easy to adapt to a variety of circumstances.  Therefore, a good DVD player should have as many connectors as possible.  Of the required, you need to highlight the <span>HDMI connectors,</span> audio output and microphone input and PC-interface.  The more connectors, the less compatibility and connectivity issues.  When answering the question of which player is better, the variety of connectors sometimes plays an even more important role than the variety of formats. </p><p>  And the last thing to remember: there are devices for playing DVDs with almost all the functions that can only be;  there are those in which everything is to a minimum.  No need to run after the first ones described above.  Remember that you need exactly the player that has exactly the functions that you need. </p>
