    <p>  Even in antiquity, two points of view appeared on this issue.  The first theory is called abiogenesis.  She argues that there is the possibility of the emergence of living from nonliving.  Another theory implies the impossibility of the independent birth of life.  Other options appeared: for example, the creation of life on Earth by God.  Let us consider in more detail the main stages of human evolution. </p><p>  A man has long tried to study his family tree.  This is reflected in legends, legends, epics of almost all tribes and nationalities. </p><p>  Only in 1859 a book by C. Darwin was published, which described the <span>origin of species</span> in connection with natural selection.  She made a sensation and aroused great interest.  Many condemned his theory, criticized and ridiculed.  But people close to science admired this creation. </p><p>  This book described the natural origin of man.  Evidence based on scientific knowledge was also given there.  They talked about the relationship of humans and mammals at the genetic level.  Over time, Darwin appeared followers who began to study the stages of human evolution. </p><p>  Man and some vertebrate animals have common structural features.  For example, features of the nervous system, skeleton, digestion, respiration, and blood circulation.  The kinship is most pronounced when considering the development of the embryo. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Special features are rudiments and atavisms.  They are present in the human body in large quantities, but are useless.  This is a legacy left from animal ancestors.  If we consider a person from the point of view of biology, then this is a mammal from the suborder of higher, belonging to primates.  However, humans are sentient beings.  The greatest similarity is seen in people with anthropoid apes, the difference between which is the ability to work and use tools. </p><p>  The stages of human evolution include the period when there was a natural selection of individuals capable of activity using tools.  Then there was a transition from application to the manufacture of objects of labor.  It was a natural selection resulting from evolution.  Eating foods cooked using fire reduced the load on the digestive system.  Gradually, she underwent some changes (the intestines became shorter). </p><p>  <strong>There are three stages of human evolution.</strong> </p><p>  1. The emergence of the genus Homo, the first being of which was Australopithecus.  This is the stage of the biological revolution. </p><p>  2. Next is the next stage of evolution of this kind.  It lasts before the modern stage of human evolution has begun.  Here, not only biological factors, but also social factors influenced this process.  Among the representatives of this time, one can distinguish Pithecanthropus, <span>Heidelberg people,</span> Sinanthropus and Neanderthals. </p><p>  3. The last stage is the evolution of <span>modern man.</span>  Here, the social aspects of existence have the greatest impact. </p><p>  The first traces of human activity using tools were found in the period 2.5 - 2.8 million years ago.  It is also known that many human populations did not succeed each other as a result of evolution.  They existed simultaneously and disappeared as a result of the struggle for survival. </p><p>  Man is a <span>rational being that</span> has both biological and social attributes.  This distinguishes him from other creatures that live on the planet. </p>
