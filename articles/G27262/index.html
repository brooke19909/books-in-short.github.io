So, if you say "economic social institution", meaning by this organization or institution, it will be the correct use of the term.  This is the name of special research institutions that work within the framework of narrow specialties.  An institution can also be understood as a set of statuses and roles whose purpose is to satisfy certain needs.  This designation can be used both for the public system of rules, and for the usual ways of responding to specific incentives, and for designating the structural component.  An example is the following phrase - "democratic institutions."  It is quite often used in modern journalism.  Or as an alternative - the institution of a family or marriage (to which many complain that it is destroyed).

It can relate to both the relationships of individuals and entire communities.  Take an economic institution - this is the belief that the greatest prosperity is possible under capitalism, and the need for equal opportunities, and so on.

      <p></p>
    <p>  Moreover, it often turns out that several spheres are firmly connected.  So, the equal opportunities mentioned earlier are an economic social institution.  Although certain organizations engaged in specialized activities may be created.  An example is the Moscow Institute of Economics.  We will take time for each of these interpretations. </p><h2>  Organizational plan </h2>

    <p>  Various research institutes are created as separate organizations and institutions specializing in certain problems or tasks.  They are a place of concentration of professionals in their field, who solve the questions posed to them.  Very often, such institutions are contacted to order research in a particular field or to perform complex scientific and technical work.  In addition, promising young people in these institutions receive (at least) appropriate training. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A common practice is such a state of affairs when researchers are also working in a reputable company (even if it is a freelance specialist).  As an example, we can consider economic institutions.  Specialists working in them often still act as freelance advisers for senior administrative personnel of commercial enterprises or even for public servants. </p><p>  Let's look at an example.  In conditions when the highest posts are most often occupied by people with a legal education (just remember the president and the chairman of the government), economic institutions play an important role.  They provide specialists who help you choose the best solution for the development of the country.  Whether recommendations will be followed is a separate question.  After all, an economic institution is a kind of forge of personnel, and not a control center, the decisions of which are not subject to discussion. </p><p>  Of course, even professionals can sometimes be wrong.  But because they are specialists, they have a very low error rate.  Therefore, when a crisis is seething, an economic institution is a useful tool in terms of putting things in order. </p><h2>  Specific features </h2>

Often they act and influence the formation or development of a particular system of behavior.

    <p>  Take, for example, democracy.  What it is, in general, most people understand.  But what about the implementation or solution of certain situations and aspects of public life?  The study of possible options and institutions involved. </p><h2>  Institute as a public system of rules </h2><p>  Let us develop the example of the institution of democracy.  Only now we’ll not talk about the activities of individual organizations, but about the public system of rules of conduct and interaction. </p><p>  Here we take such a question as the change of power.  What is the best way to organize this?  The institute provides for a special mechanism - elections.  They follow certain specific rules.  As an example, you cannot order false negative material about competitors.  The main bet is that each person himself tells what he is doing, what experience he has, outlines his vision of the future, and voters are invited to only vote for who they liked. </p><p>  And this applies only to one aspect.  Something similar can be said about other <span>areas of public life:</span> this is the division into three branches of power to complicate the emergence of a dictatorship, and the great weight of civic organizations and much more.  Moreover, there are many institutions (public rule systems) that describe most of the moments in various areas of life.  If it's hard to believe, then let's go through a few of them.  So, there are institutions of the family, school, law enforcement system, army, social activities and so on. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Institute of Economics" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/1424129.jpg"></div>  As you can see, the concept of “institution” is multifaceted.  The topic itself is quite interesting, and it would be desirable to learn it not by one (or even several) article, but by familiarizing yourself with fundamental scientific works.

    <p>  After all, if we consider research institutions, then an institution is an extremely important and at the same time very complex organizational structure.  And to describe the activity of rule systems is generally not easy, since they are significantly influenced by the past of each individual country and locality. </p><p>  Therefore, the generalizing approach is rather difficult here.  Even if we talk, for example, about democratic traditions, it’s very difficult to create a complete picture.  One can’t recall the bipartisan systems of the USA and Great Britain in comparison with the parliaments of France, Germany and other countries. </p>
