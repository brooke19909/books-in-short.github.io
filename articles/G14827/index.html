  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Vintage style in photography</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you try to characterize the style of vintage in general, then probably the most correct words will be the following - this is the most real nostalgia for the past.  The word "vintage" translated from English literally means "aging wine."  This is a fashionable and very specific direction, which is based on the revival of certain trends of past generations and entire eras.  This style is usually distinguished by the presence of elements of romance and exquisite luxury.  Designers love to experiment with elegant hats, lace and unusual antiques. </p><p>  Fashion history and <span>vintage style are</span> very closely interconnected, and all the most extravagant that has been popular over the past decades, very appropriately combines the traditional elements of bygone years.  This style has become a new direction, which organically merged and became part of European culture.  It is used with pleasure by designers of clothes and furniture.  Photographers did not pass him as well, using them for stunning photo shoots. </p><p>  Vintage style is increasingly popular with celebrities and top models.  With its skillful use in a female image, a unique mysterious fleur and refined sophistication appear.  Old things made from natural fabrics that are no longer available, created on the basis of original styles, look favorably against the background of modern clothes.  The original finish, unique lace look no less stylish than hits from modern designers.  This is often used by professional salon photographers.  They clearly notice the nuances that can give <span>ordinary things unusual</span> shades. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The vintage style is leisurely and thorough, it was created with love from very significant trifles.  Everything in it is the main thing and absolutely everything is of interest.  Take a closer look at modern photos and you will definitely notice their uniformity.  Now try to compare them with those made in vintage style.  The difference is huge! </p><p>  If you came in a dress made in the style of the 30s to a party, all attention will be focused on you, because you are wearing a unique thing.  A skilled photographer will surely pick up a moment to take a gorgeous shot, and silently underline with a hint of nostalgia: ‚ÄúThis is a vintage style ...‚Äù.  Indeed, he is capable of much, because he attracts and fascinates, makes you look back and does not cease to amaze.  They just want to admire.  Everyone wants to have things done in this unique style, and, of course, wants to capture this unusual image. </p><p>  Vintage photography is undoubtedly the art that has now defined a new direction in photography.  Such shots hold attention for a long time, I want to carefully consider them.  It seems that they have some mysterious code, a message from the past, although in fact we understand that the photograph was taken by a contemporary. </p><p>  Wedding pictures are especially good in this style.  Vintage wedding photo is exquisite and unique.  Photographers tirelessly fantasize, and the newlyweds are happy to participate in these productions.  Sessions using this style are at the peak of popularity today and there are many non-standard ideas for their implementation. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To take such a photograph, it is necessary to place antique objects in the frame, let them be several, but they will be truly epoch-making.  It can be old paintings, a chest of drawers or a cabinet with a cute napkin, which our great-grandmothers also embroidered.  Such a background will become a kind of "greeting from the past," from the time in which these things were appropriate.  <span>Table clocks</span> made at the beginning of the last century, a handmade women's glove, an exquisite bracelet, antique men's <span>watches on a chain</span> and much more - these are the details that are used in frames.  They will give a certain mood to other images. </p><p>  Vintage photos are always touching and unique.  Any girl in her album dreams of having such pictures.  They resemble photos of our grandmothers in furs and sophisticated hats, with slightly tinted lips and surprisingly expressive eyes.  Each family very carefully stores such rare photographs.  In the vintage style, certain notes of nostalgia about the past, about that time that cannot be returned, but which left us a huge cultural heritage, are hidden.  In those days they treated pictures as a work of art.  That is why this style returns photos value and its long-forgotten status. </p><p>  Take a picture surrounded by antiques, casually throwing the finest shawl over your shoulders, carefully put on a hat with a veil, from under which the delicate gloss of your lips will barely shine through.  You are unlikely to remain indifferent, but feel the romance with all your heart and you will probably want to return to this image more than once. </p>
