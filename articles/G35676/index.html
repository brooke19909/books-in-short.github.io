Children are taught to distribute their time correctly by adults, who often themselves postpone everything until later.  As a rule, this very ‚Äúlater‚Äù never occurs.  All planned affairs are smoothly pushed aside by others and in the end turn into one continuous ball of unresolved tasks. </p><p>  The problem most often lies not in the number of cases, but in an irrationally drawn up schedule.  People do not pay enough attention to planning their activities.  But after spending quite a bit of personal time on learning the basics of time management, you can significantly save <span>time</span> in the future.  Then in life there will be a place not only for eternal problems, but also for yourself and your family.  One of the simplest and most effective planning techniques is the Eisenhower Principle. </p><h2>  What is the essence of technology? </h2><p>  The principle of the Eisenhower matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãthe competent distribution of tasks depending on the degree of their importance.  It helps to break down the entire list of cases into important and not important, urgent and not so.  Using the matrix, you can determine the period of time that will be needed to solve the problem, because something requires more attention, and some things and five minutes spent on them are not worth it. </p>

    <p>  To achieve success, you need to follow a certain algorithm.  The order of necessary actions depends on the priority of tasks.  As a rule, various factors interfere with concentrating on one goal: personal problems, people around you, habits, etc.  Eisenhower's method can help get rid of weaknesses and focus only on useful actions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How did this principle arise, by whom is it formed? </h2><p>  The thirty-fourth president of the United States of America, Dwight David Eisenhower, substantiated the described principle of time management.  A politician could not leave any task unresolved, so he tried to make his schedule as rational and optimized as possible.  As a result, Eisenhower converted all the tasks into a matrix. </p><p>  Today, office workers, managers, and senior executives use the president‚Äôs method.  This suggests that this method of prioritization is indeed effective and relevant. </p><h2>  What is the Dwight Eisenhower matrix? </h2><p>  Eisenhower's square (or principles of <span>time planning)</span> is based on the construction of a matrix.  The basis of the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãthe axis of importance (abscissa) and the axis of urgency (ordinate).  Their intersection gives four squares, each of which is filled with tasks, according to their distribution. </p><p>  So, for starters, it is worth deciding what is important and what is urgent.  Important matters affect the <span>achievement of the result</span> to the greatest extent <span>,</span> and urgent tasks require immediate completion.  On the whole, a picture is formed that gives a complete picture of the state of affairs. </p>

    <p>  Despite the highest priority of this square, you can pass the solution to the problems filling the cell to someone else.  But this is only if this is possible, and affairs do not necessarily require personal participation. </p><h2>  What tasks does Quartrate B imply? </h2><p>  This part of the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãfilled with daily chores.  As a rule, this includes everything that deserves the most attention.  These are important, but not urgent matters, most of which are related to the main activity of a person.  The low urgency of the tasks will make it possible not to make sudden decisions, and a constructive and reasonable approach will make it possible to carry out all the tasks in a better way. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The activities of people who mainly solve problems from square B are more productive.  With good work results, such people have enough time for personal life, they do not experience constant stress.  This square consists of tasks that are of little importance and, perhaps, to some extent everyday, but it is precisely from them that human activity basically consists. </p>

    <p>  Tasks from sector B strongly affect both moral and material conditions.  This is sports, diet, sleep, training and work activities - those things that can not be done without, but they usually pay the least attention, letting a lot of things go by themselves. </p><h2>  What matters are included in square C? </h2><p>  Square C includes those matters that do not bring closer to the cherished goal, but, on the contrary, inhibit events, postpone the performance of truly important tasks.  Most often, they require urgent time, but they distract and lead you astray.  Here it is important to always remember the results of your activities and goals and not switch to secondary. </p><p>  In this sector, you can safely include household chores and promises made to someone.  In general, these matters are not so much important as urgent. </p><h2>  What is in square D? </h2><p>  For people who do not know how to plan time correctly, things from this square take up the greatest amount of time.  Rather, these tasks can be called not problems, but pleasant concerns, which, moreover, do not bring absolutely any rational benefit.  The influence of the square D is necessary, if not excluded, then try to at least reduce it. </p>

    <p>  Do not replace the rest with aimless monitoring of social networks, watching TV shows or TV shows, empty chatter on the phone.  Free time can also be spent for the benefit of yourself and others: family, relatives and friends. </p><h2>  Where is the Dwight Eisenhower Principle used? </h2><p>  The described distribution of tasks is used not only to rationalize time.  Accelerated analysis based on the Eisenhower principle is used, for example, to determine the necessary functions of retail objects.  Product improvement at all stages of the life cycle is called <span>functional cost analysis (PSA).</span>  This principle combines economic and technical methods for determining the relationship between the properties of a product and its costs.  The latter must be logical and payback. </p>

    <p>  What is the principle of Eisenhower in the FSA, investigated by many experts from countries with market economies: France, Germany, Britain, USA.  As a result, it was revealed that in order to determine the range of corresponding functions of an object, it is important to observe the proportions between their necessity and cost.  The Eisenhower principle in the FSA is to analyze the product and the distribution of its properties in three categories: </p><ol><li>  Category A. Main or fundamental functions: the direct purpose of the goods, for the provision of which it is necessary to spend a greater amount of funds. </li><li>  Category B. Secondary product functions that are related to the core.  The presence of such add-ons is welcome, but the absence does not affect sales too much. </li><li>  Category C. Excessive functions, the absence of which will in no way affect the quality of the goods.  Avoiding spending on supplements that are completely unnecessary can save you a lot. </li></ol><h2>  Eisenhower Principle Practice </h2><p>  It is absolutely not necessary to distribute tasks precisely in the form of a matrix - squared, but at first you can do just that to ensure clarity.  It is convenient to convert the standard <span>view of the matrix</span> into several lists or a general plan, where cases from different squares are highlighted.  For example, urgent and important tasks (square A) can be written in red ink at the same time, important but not urgent in green (sector B), unimportant but urgent tasks (square C) in blue, and black in unimportant and non-urgent.  Moreover, the degree of importance of a particular case should not be evaluated in the mind, but on paper.  So the tasks take shape, and their implementation becomes more real. </p>
