  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New Year decoupage for the most beautiful fairy tale</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  They are always preparing for the New Year together, and at the same time, this night is full of surprises and surprises.  New Year's decoupage will give even more fabulous and magical mood.  If your children are old enough, then you can decorate the Christmas tree with exclusive and elegant balls.  Believe me, New Year decoupage will capture them so much that you have to decorate the whole room. </p><p>  First you need to buy balls and napkins with New Year's drawings.  The material of the balls does not matter.  The main thing is that they are not decorated.  Drawings on napkins should be small, as  large fragments on the balls will wrinkle. </p><p>  Decoupage <span>Christmas balls</span> begins with the preparation of the surface.  For better adhesion of the picture to the ball, it must be primed.  This is done with ordinary acrylic paint.  If you want to give some roughness, then you need to apply paint with pokes.  As an option for background design, you can consider the use of <span>craquelure varnish.</span>  It is applied both over the main primer, coating with a paint of a contrasting color from above, without painting cracks, and after the final completion of the background with the subsequent filling of cracks. </p><p>  New Year's decoupage does not have to be performed with images of this theme, because you can post a photo of a tiger or a hare, if the year is appropriate.  Alternatively, after the primer, not only an artistic drawing, but the entire napkin, but torn into small pieces, can be glued to the entire surface of the ball.  This approach is especially convenient for those who decoupage secretly prepare for the New Year and do not have much time for cutting small parts. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can <span>glue the</span> picture <span>with</span> ordinary <span>PVA glue</span> with the addition of water or with special glue for decoupage.  There are 3 options for gluing the image: </p><ul><li>  Apply glue to the surface of the ball; </li><li>  Apply glue to the drawing on the back; </li><li>  Cover with glue the entire surface of the picture, starting from the middle. </li></ul><p>  The latter method is most often used, because  it is most convenient when working with a thin sheet of paper.  For the convenience of the location of the picture, it can be moistened so that it lies on the surface of the ball and does not move out during the application of glue.  Once the image is in place, you must carefully remove the air from under it.  To do this, a transparent file or solid polyethylene is placed on top and, stroking from the middle to the edges, air is expelled. </p><p>  After that, the decoupage of New Year's balls does not end.  In order for the exclusive decoration to serve for a long time, it must be covered with a transparent matte or glossy varnish.  Before this, you can add shine to glitter or dry glitters, printed on the drawings made with glue.  The varnish is applied in 2 layers, previously expecting each layer to dry.  To speed up the process, a hairdryer is often used. </p><p>  But the New Year decoupage does not end there.  Under the chiming clock, almost everyone opens a <span>bottle of champagne.</span>  It can also be embellished.  You can take the same picture, and place it where the label is located.  Optionally, the overall design of the bottle can be left or completely primed and decorated to your taste.  A prerequisite is to prime under the picture and remove the label completely.  If necessary, rinse the bottle with water and wipe off any residual factory glue.  This beginning of the New Year will definitely be remembered for a long time. </p><p>  By the way, who said that the New Year decoupage only applies to Christmas balls and adult champagne ?!  Children deserve a holiday more than us!  No <span>baby champagne ?!</span>  No problem!  Ordinary plastic bottles with drinks can also turn into a masterpiece.  The decoration procedure is similar. </p><p>  Decoupage for the New Year is not only decoration, but also magic that you can do with your own hands.  And if your beloved <span>fairy-tale hero</span> appears not only on napkins, but also on Christmas-tree <span>decorations, a bottle of</span> champagne, drinks ... then fortunately there will be no limit! </p><p>  Give each other a holiday every day! </p>
