    <p>  <span>A small group</span> in social psychology is the main subject of study.  Scientists have collected rich theoretical and experimental material, which made it possible to make scientific generalizations and create a methodological base for the discipline.  Consider the main points. </p><p>  A small <span>social group</span> is an association of individuals who have direct personal contact and are connected by some kind of activity, family or emotional affinity.  Its members are aware of their affiliation and recognized by others. </p><p>  Such a community usually includes a small number of individuals, and the composition is determined by social characteristics (age, gender, education, nationality, etc.) and number. </p><p>  A small social group has a different structure, which can be determined: </p><ul><li>  firstly, the responsibilities of its members in joint activities; </li><li>  secondly, the roles (expected actions) of a person who is assigned specific responsibilities; </li><li>  thirdly, by norms (prescriptions, requirements, wishes of socially approved behavior). </li></ul><p>  A small social group can be classified according to several parameters. </p><p>  Firstly, according to the method of formation are distinguished: </p><ul><li>  formal, which arise for the performance of specific functions in any organization, and in the group there are from three to fifteen people; </li><li>  informal, formed on the basis of mutual sympathies and interests, in which there can be from three to ten people. </li></ul><p>  Secondly, according to the degree of formation of interpersonal relations are distinguished: </p><ul><li>  differential small social group, which enter at will; </li><li>  a team formed by necessity. </li></ul><p>  Thirdly, the following groups are classified by the significance of each individual in them: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  all members must be present (these are usually formal associations); </li><li>  a reference small social group is a conditional or real community with which each individual will relate himself as a model, and whose assessments, values, opinions and norms will be guided in behavior. </li></ul><p>  Such social communities have certain functions: </p><ul><li>  Normative and comparative.  It implies that a standard and norms of behavior are formed in it, as well as assessments of others and a specific individual. </li><li>  The instrumental is connected with the fact that organization of joint activities is necessary. </li><li>  Supportive and expressive function is associated with providing the emotional needs of each individual. </li></ul><p>  Within small social groups, various processes take place, as a result of which the group changes its shape and develops. </p><p>  The main one is <span>group dynamics.</span>  It refers to the processes of separation or rallying of a group, the emergence of formal and informal leadership, the formation of norms and rules, the development of informal unification within the formal, as well as antipathies and sympathies. </p><p>  In addition, the process of establishing the norms of an existing group, that is, the emerging rules of behavior of each individual individually, is no less important.  Such standards contribute to effective group interaction, and a small social group will be more cohesive.  Thanks to the existing rules, the pressure on each individual will increase.  Therefore, the group with their help can force everyone to follow the norms, supporting the integration of members in the group. </p><p>  The third process is that in a small <span>social community</span> a certain hierarchy arises.  A leader stands out, who can be either formal, which was officially appointed, or informal, which the group itself chose.  The remaining members of the community must clearly know their functions and responsibilities. </p>
