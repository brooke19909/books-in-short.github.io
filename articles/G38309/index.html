  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Beadwork and beadwork technique. Decorate the fishtail with pink petals</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>The technique of embroidery with beads</span> is considered one of the simplest and most effective types of needlework.  It is much simpler than embroidering with a cross and other counting techniques, and much easier and faster than stitching.  When embroidering with beads, it is not necessary to constantly change the threads, because colored patterns create multi-colored beads that are strung on a strong waxed or silk thread close to the fabric-based color. </p><p>  The technique of embroidery with beads is one of the most exciting types of needlework.  The work is created quickly and easily, at hand, the craftswomen ‚Äúblossom‚Äù amazing textures shimmering in the light, multicolored paintings, and the beaded background makes them seem to be woven from small precious crystals. </p><p>  Like any material, beads have their own characteristics.  To make the embroidery beautiful, even and neat, the beads are carefully sorted by size and quality.  There are even round beads, matte or transparent, very small or large enough, there is a bead-cutting - this is usually large beads with an uneven faceted structure, finally, glass beads are multi-colored shiny small elongated tubes, several mm long, which are used in mainly for decorating clothes. </p><p>  The technique of embroidery with beads of the same size and texture allows you to create smooth smooth fabrics, cutting gives the embroidered fabric a light crystalline structure and unevenness.  Beadwork is successfully combined with <span>embroidery stitch</span> and cross.  Embroidery methods are different.  The most popular are sewing in an attachment, when several beads are strung on a thread at once, and then the thread with beads is attached according to the picture with another auxiliary thread in the spaces between the beads, and embroidery with individual beads that are attached to the base with oblique stitches close to each other, even horizontal in rows.  A similar technique for embroidery with beads resembles the well-known counting techniques with a cross or <span>tapestry seam,</span> and any patterns created for counted embroidery are suitable for it. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Bead embroidery can be supplemented with convex, volumetric elements made using the beadwork technique. </p><p>  <strong>French beadwork technique</strong> </p><p>  The French technique seems to be specially invented for weaving flower petals and leaves of a round and oblong shape, which decorate not only panels, but also hairstyles from long and short hair.  For example, the technique of weaving a fish tail - the original braid from long thick hair, can successfully combine a difficult braided braid with an ornament of beaded petals. </p><p>  To weave one petal, you will need a wire 0.3 and 0.6 mm thick and a smooth round bead of medium size.  A thicker wire is used for warp, and a thin one is used as a working thread.  Several beads are strung on the base wire, the amount of which is equal to the length of the petal.  To keep the beads and not move out, a small knot is made at the end of the wire.  Then, a thin working wire is attached to the base wire below, as close as possible to the strung beads, making one turn.  One more bead is stringed onto the working wire more than on the base, an arc is stretched along the beads strung on the base, and the working wire is fixed with one turn from above.  Then the same amount of beads is strung on the working wire, and an arc is made on the other hand, securing the working thread with a coil from the bottom to the bottom of the wire.  Again, string one or two more beads, stretch a new arc, first to the right of the base, then the same to the left, fixing the working wire from the bottom to the top of the wire.  The result is a round or oblong petal.  The upper tip of the base wire is cut 3-4 mm above the petal and carefully bent inward, hiding between the beads.  Of the prepared petals are various flower heads: tulip, rose, poppy, chamomile.  The more bead arcs, the wider and rounder the petal will turn out.  You can decorate the braid from the hair with separate petals, mounted on an invisible hairpin and beautifully located along the braid. </p>
