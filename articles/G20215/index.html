They can often be found on sale, but many people still do not understand why some manufacturers began to equip gadgets with such a function.  Well, there is an explanation for this. </p><h2>  3D creation </h2><p>  This is the first why dual camera phones have been created.  Everyone perfectly remembers 2011, when the general fashion for home 3D began.  People began to actively buy TVs that supported stereo images.  So the smartphone manufacturers decided to keep up with the fashion trend.  In the same 2011, phones like LG Optimus 3D and HTC EVO 3D saw the light of day.  By the way, they can be seen in the above photo. </p>

    <p>  Screens in them involved a special parallax barrier.  Due to this technology, the left eye of a person saw one part of the pixels, and the right - the other.  Viewing 3D materials has become real.  Two cameras also worked the same way.  The first lens saw one part of the pixels, and the second - the other. </p><p>  However, these dual camera phones have not become popular.  They aroused interest, but buyers did not like the fact that the displays had a small resolution, which reduced the quality of the material being shot.  Yes, and using smartphones were inconvenient.  To take a 3D photo, you had to hold the phone motionless at one point - the slightest movement spoiled the frame. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Panoramic effect </h2><p>  When taking photographs, people always want the whole object that they want to capture to get into the frame.  But this is not successful in every case.  Phone manufacturers this fact is well known.  Therefore, there were dual-camera phones designed to expand the field of view of the lens. </p>

    <p>  Many will say: ‚ÄúBut smartphones now have a fisheye and panorama function!‚Äù  Yes, she is.  But only on such smartphones is universal optics, the viewing angle of which is limited.  To get as much detail as possible into the lens, you have to use very curved lenses, or make photo sensors in a wide, non-standard format.  Pictures are obtained greatly reduced in height, quality also suffers. </p><p>  But with a smartphone with a dual module, you can take great photos.  To do this, you only need to press the button once, fixing the desired object.  You will get a great shot without gluing and graphic defects.  A striking example of such a phone is the LG G5, which costs 22-25 thousand rubles.  One camera in the module has a viewing angle of 90 degrees.  Another, highly specialized, has a wider one - 100-120. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Improving photo quality </h2><p>  This is another reason why you need a dual camera on phones.  Smartphones with a single lens do not have optical zoom.  If you need to zoom in on the object, the system will simply take the necessary piece of the image, after which it will ‚Äústretch‚Äù it.  Naturally, there can be no talk of any detail.  But the dual module solves this problem.  After all, one ordinary camera is included in it, and the other is telescopic.  The presence of such a module boasts the recently released iPhone 7 Plus.  In it, both matrices are the same, but one is equipped with high-aperture optics with the usual parameters, and the other has a long-range view with a limited viewing angle. </p>

    <p>  Enhancing contrast, clarity and detail is another reason why you need a dual camera on your phone.  Very useful feature.  When the module has both color and monochrome cameras, this affects the quality of the shoot.  One optics captures colors and shades, while the other registers the smallest details.  The result is a bright, detailed picture.  It is such a module that is installed on the Huawei P9, whose price is about 30,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Xiaomi Redmi Pro </h2><p>  I would like to note this phone model with special attention.  Mi 4 Pro with a dual camera is now very popular.  But Xiaomi was the last of those who decided to develop this concept. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The main camera of this model is 13 megapixel.  The second - at 5 megapixels.  It is she who captures the depth of data.  Thanks to its presence, Xiaomi Redmi Pro takes amazing pictures with a bokeh effect (the subject is in focus and the background is blurred).  Interestingly, the owner of the phone can adjust the settings.  The aperture is easily adjustable manually, whereby it is possible to achieve the desired level of blur. </p><p>  By the way, this phone has already been tested by many connoisseurs of technology, and most of them did not forget to compare Xiaomi Redmi Pro with the seventh iPhone.  But really, the photographs taken from the cameras of both models are no different.  That's just Xiaomi is worth 1/3 of Apple's phone. </p>

    <h2>  Cheap models </h2><p>  As you can already see, smartphones with such impressive optical characteristics are quite expensive.  But, since models with this functionality soon became popular, manufacturers of budget smartphones quickly set up their production.  Chinese dual-camera phones are a good alternative to all the previously mentioned models. </p><p>  Take, for example, Doogee Shoot 1. Its price varies from 5 to 6.5 thousand rubles.  Its optical module consists of a 13-megapixel main camera manufactured by Samsung, and a second additional 8 megapixel.  Photos are bright, clear and detailed, and the notorious bokeh effect can also be achieved easily. </p><p>  A little more expensive (6.5-7 thousand) is Elephone Max, which is the first experimental smartphone company.  The manufacturer interested buyers with a dual camera capable of taking pictures on a level with DSLR-based SLRs. </p><p>  The third budget option is LeEco Cool1, the price of which varies from 9 to 14 thousand (depending on configuration).  The module of this smartphone includes two 13-megapixel cameras, f / 2.0 aperture, as well as dual LED flash and phase detection autofocus.  Most importantly, this phone shoots 4K Ultra HD video.  The front camera of this model, by the way, is 8-megapixel, and records videos in 1080p format. </p><h2>  Elite Chinese Model </h2><p>  A much more expensive Chinese option is the Gionee M2017.  It costs about 65-75 thousand rubles in its usual form.  Crocodile leather versions are still sold in China, and they cost a hundred thousand more. </p>

    <p>  The price is explained by the presence of an 8-core processor, the incredible thinness of the case, 64 built-in gigabytes of memory, a 2560x1440 display extension and, of course, an optical module.  It consists of 12 and 13 megapixel cameras, respectively, which support 4x optical zoom.  There is also a powerful LED flash. </p><h2>  Smartphones for selfie lovers </h2><p>  Gadgets with a dual front camera also exist!  This is the Vivo X9 and X9 Plus, released in December 2016.  These smartphones have a regular 16-megapixel camera at the back.  But in front - a dual front module.  One camera is 20 megapixels, and the other is 8 megapixels.  And the aperture is f / 2.0.  This is a really great dual camera on the phone. </p><p>  Why was it decided to install it in the front part?  Because this is a new solution for the gadget industry, and besides, selfie lovers want high-quality photos.  And with such characteristics, even the bokeh effect can be made in one motion.  During shooting, the main camera focuses on the person‚Äôs face, while the other creates a background blur. </p><p>  The price of these models varies from 22 to 28, and from 30 to 35 thousand rubles, respectively. </p>

    <h2>  Bluboo dual </h2><p>  This is the last model worth noting attention.  Its price starts at 5,700 rubles.  The dual module consists of the main 13-megapixel Sony IMX135 camera and an auxiliary sensor of 2 megapixels.  Despite the fact that the characteristics are less impressive than all the previously mentioned models, it is possible to achieve a beautiful background blur and clear focus with such a phone. </p><p>  In general, as you can see, there are a considerable number of smartphones with modular cameras.  If desired, you can find a good gadget at a reasonable price, buy it and enjoy high-quality images. </p>
