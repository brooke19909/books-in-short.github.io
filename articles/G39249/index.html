Now in any kitchen you can find washing machines hidden in the cabinets, dishwashers and other equipment.  But let's talk specifically about washing machines.  They are ideal for the role of embedded technology.  And it is precisely them that are usually produced in this form.  But before we move on to the rating of built-in washing machines, we need to consider how they differ from conventional washing machines.  And the differences are actually a lot.  It's just that not everyone knows about them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.geraldgiles.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rating of built-in washing machines" class="if uuid-3237974" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3237974.jpg"></div><h2>  The main differences between the built-in washing machines </h2><p>  With ordinary washers, everything is clear.  Many people know about them.  But embedded machines must have a number of features that are absolutely necessary for them to function properly.  In general, it is precisely such differences that characterize the type of washing machines.  Now we will consider those options that a priori should be present in the embedded technique of such a plan. </p><ul><li>  Leakage protection.  This option is required for the built-in washing machine.  If an ordinary washing machine can do without it, since it is usually installed in the bathroom, the built-in one will not do.  Since the kitchen, furniture, etc. will be flooded.  Almost all equipment of this type has protection.  Even partial. </li><li>  Curtains for doors.  Any built-in machine must have curtains on its body for installing cabinet doors.  As a rule, curtains are installed on both sides.  Just then the user removes the excess.  Some cars do without curtains.  They have a slightly different design, and doors are installed differently. </li><li>  Vibration Reduction Option.  When the centrifuge is working, any machine begins to vibrate violently.  But in the case of built-in appliances, this can be dangerous, as furniture can fall apart.  Therefore, this technique is equipped with a vibration reduction function.  Not to say that every machine was equipped with it, but such a chip is available. </li><li>  Only horizontal loading.  This is clear.  Do not place top-loading machines in kitchen furniture.  In this case, the porthole of the machine should not be very convex, since it will interfere with the doors of the cabinet closing. </li></ul><p>  All of the above - the main features of built-in washing machines with horizontal loading.  If these devices do not meet these requirements, then it is highly likely that the equipment will quickly become worthless or ruin the repair in the apartment.  So it‚Äôs definitely not possible to build an ordinary car in the kitchen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.did.ie" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="horizontal loading washing machine" class="if uuid-3237976" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3237976.jpg"></div><h2>  How to choose the built-in machine? </h2><p>  In general, this is not so easy.  And if at hand there is a specialist in this field that you fully trust, then it is better to use his services.  And if not, then you need to consider the following features, which in no case should be overlooked. </p><ul><li>  Dimensions of the machine.  If you buy a car that is larger or smaller than your kitchen cabinet, then there may be problems with its placement.  In general, you first need to buy a car and only then make a stand under it.  But pure attention should be paid to the depth.  It will not be good if the machine sticks out and spoils the view. </li><li>  The presence of leakage protection.  This has already been said.  If the machine is not sufficiently protected, then the likelihood of a very unpleasant situation in the future is high.  It is better to be safe and get a really high-quality product than to spend money on a new car and on repairs (including neighbors). </li><li>  Noise and vibration level.  Built-in appliances should work quietly.  Otherwise, being in the same room with her will be problematic.  A strong vibration can damage furniture and everything else.  Therefore, you need to pay special attention to these features.  To avoid various unpleasant situations and discomfort. </li></ul><p>  All of the above will help you choose the right washing machine for installation.  However, you must not forget about reliability.  And now we will present the rating of embedded washing machines in terms of quality and reliability. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine beko" class="if uuid-3237978" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3237978.jpg"></div><h2>  No. 1. Bosch VIZ 24140 OE </h2><p>  Of course, the first place is occupied by a car from the legendary German manufacturer.  Bosch appliances are renowned for their quality and reliability throughout the world.  And the Bosch WIS 24140 built-in washing machine is no exception.  This is an excellent unit with full protection against leaks, the option of easy ironing, lowered sound insulation and much more.  The maximum load of the car is 7 kg.  And at maximum it reaches 1200 rpm.  There are several washing modes for different types of fabrics.  But most importantly - the car is extremely reliable.  Judging by the reviews of the owners, over the five years of use, not a single failure has occurred.  And despite the fact that the drive is by no means direct.  This washing machine is also equipped with artificial intelligence.  That's why she tops the rating of embedded washing machines. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.appliancesonline.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bosch built-in washing machine" class="if uuid-3237981" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3237981.jpg"></div><h2>  No. 2. Bosch WIW28540OE </h2><p>  An honorable second place was also taken by equipment from the legendary German manufacturer.  The built-in Bosch washing machine is distinguished by quality and reliability.  Specifically, this model has a maximum load of 8 kg, a drum of 53 liters, the option of easy ironing, modes for washing various fabrics and even shoes, intelligent electronic control, the option of delayed start and complete protection against leaks.  The maximum speed of the drum in centrifuge mode is 1400 rpm.  These are pretty decent features.  This model only costs a little more than the previous one.  However, it is in steady demand.  According to the owners, this Bosch built-in washing machine can serve faithfully for quite some time. Naturally, there are special curtains on the front panel for mounting doors. In general, the Germans, as always, are on top. You don‚Äôt expect another from such a famous manufacturer . </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.asko.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bosch wis 24140" class="if uuid-3237983" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3237983.jpg"></div><h2>  No. 3. Washing machine Asko </h2><p>  In general, this manufacturer has a lot of cars of various configurations.  But the Asko W6984 ‚Äã‚ÄãFI washing machine is of particular interest.  This is a built-in washer with impressive features.  This machine can accelerate to 1800 revolutions per minute.  In this case, there is the possibility of choosing these very turns.  There is also an intelligent electronic control, complete protection against leakage, improved noise and vibration isolation, child protection, imbalance control, many programs for washing various types of fabrics and an informative LCD display.  You can load 8 kilograms of stuff into the machine.  Water consumption per wash - 65 liters.  In addition, this horizontal loading washing machine is incredibly economical.  It consumes very little electricity.  And therefore is in steady demand.  In addition, it is reliable.  Owners claim that breakdowns are extremely rare.  And even that is not very serious. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.photopoint.ee" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="front-loading washing machines" class="if uuid-3237985" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3237985.jpg"></div><h2>  No. 4. Hotpoint-Ariston washing machine </h2><p>  The tandem of very well-known companies has led to the fact that quite good devices began to appear on sale.  For example, the Hotpoint-Ariston CAWD 129. built-in washing machine boasts various washing modes (including for delicate fabrics), partial leakage protection, electronic intelligent control, a powerful engine that develops 1200 rpm and the presence of drying.  The car fits 7 kilograms of things.  Not so little.  In addition, this unit is able to start on a timer and automatically turn on the dryer.  This is an excellent horizontal loading washing machine that will fit into almost any interior and will not stand out.  In addition, this washer has a decent vibration isolation.  The noise level is very low.  And it consumes little energy.  There is also a foam control sensor, which is important.  However, users do not consider it particularly reliable due to the lack of complete protection against leaks.  Although they are buying it very actively. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.servisdomacichspotrebicu.cz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="built-in washing machine electrolux ewg 147540 w" class="if uuid-3237986" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3237986.jpg"></div><h2>  No. 5. Washing machine Electrolux </h2><p>  This brand is well known to most of our compatriots.  It produces very high quality and reliable products.  this is just the built-in Electrolux EWG 147540 W washing machine. The key features of this washing machine are direct injection of detergent, a huge selection of programs for various types of fabrics, full protection against leaks, vibration isolation, noise reduction, the option of washing shoes, the choice of spin speed, spin control foam level and imbalance control.  there is also protection from children.  The spin speed can reach 1400 rpm.  There is a rinse option and direct drive (which is important).  At the same time, users claim that this machine is incredibly reliable.  Their conclusions are based on the presence of a direct drive, which is a priori more reliable than a belt drive) and full protection against leaks.  And the price of this built-in front-loading washing machine is quite reasonable. </p><h2>  No. 6. Washing machine Whirlpool </h2><p>  Another well-known manufacturer in our Palestine.  Household appliances from Virpul can be found in almost every home.  Of particular interest is the Whirlpool AWO C 0714 washing machine, which belongs to the category of built-in appliances.  This machine has full protection against leaks, excellent vibration isolation, low noise, a huge number of different washing programs, an anti-crease option, an option to control the level of foam and imbalance, electronic intelligent control, a large and informative LCD screen, an option to select revolutions and spin cancel function.  Also, the machine consumes a little energy and copes with the most difficult pollution.  The level of reliability is acceptable due to complete leakage protection.  But in the ranking of embedded washing machines with high reliability, it is only in sixth place, since users are not very active in buying it. </p><h2>  No. 7. BEKO WMI 81241 </h2><p>  This manufacturer is also at the hearing of our compatriots.  However, he cannot boast of special product quality.  Therefore, it occupies the bottom lines of the rating.  The BEKO WMI 81241 washing machine is not particularly attractive.  She even has partial leakage protection.  There is also no option to prevent creasing and many other things that our previous heroes have.  But users are actively buying it.  Because she is one of the most affordable.  Its price is so low that anyone can afford it.  The maximum spin speed is 1200 rpm.  Drum loading - 8 kilograms.  There are several washing modes and intelligent electronic controls. </p><h2>  No. 8. BEKO WMI 71241 </h2><p>  And this model boasts an even lower price.  The BEKO WMI 71241 washing machine also belongs to the built-in category.  But it is even simpler and more modest than the previous one (in accordance with its cost).  Nevertheless, the machine has electronic control, several washing modes, a relatively powerful engine (developing a speed of about 1200 rpm) and an unbalance control option.  However, there is evidence that this machine is very noisy and vibrates.  And you can‚Äôt call it very reliable.  There is only partial protection against leaks. </p><h2>  Which car manufacturer to choose? </h2><p>  If you need exceptional reliability, it is better to pay attention to the products of the German company Bosch.  Yes, expensive.  But there is a guarantee that the car will work for a bunch of years without complaints and breakdowns.  In addition, this company has the most adequate and responsive service centers.  And there are no problems with warranty repairs (if something suddenly happens).  This manufacturer values ‚Äã‚Äãits reputation. </p><h2>  Verdict </h2><p>  Based on this rating of built-in washing machines, we can say for sure that the most reliable are Bosch washing machines.  But if their cost is too high, then you should pay attention to Asko and Hotpoint-Ariston.  They are also very reliable.  Also not bad and units from Electrolux.  But products from VEK are still better to avoid.  Although they are very cheap, they do not differ in special quality.  And the reliability is not very. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we presented the rating of built-in washing machines in terms of reliability.  Among them are both products from recognized masters of the genre, and devices from lesser-known and respected firms.  Almost any car from our rating can be safely installed in the kitchen.  Just do not particularly trust VECO and Virpul.  They can not compete with more famous brands due to poor product quality.  Despite the low prices.  It is better to overpay for the car and save on possible repairs in the future.  And it‚Äôs not good to flood the neighbors.  So buy only reliable washing machines. </p>
