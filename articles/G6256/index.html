A fairly common problem is damage to the <span>rubber cuff of the</span> hatch.  As a rule, repair or replacement of this component part can be carried out independently, without calling a specialist at home.  In this article, we will figure out what role the cuff for the washing machine plays, what are the most common causes of its malfunction and how to independently replace it. </p><h2>  Meaning of this part and fault diagnosis </h2><p>  The cuff for the washing machine plays the role of a stopper that prevents water from entering the machine mechanism and also seeping through the door.  If the device works correctly, then when performing the necessary operations, all the water is in the tank.  In case of leakage when the hatch door is closed, repair is required. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cuff for washing machine" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/1641265.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Causes of Cuff Damage </h2><p>  There are some of the most common reasons that can lead to the need to replace this component or repair it: </p><ol><li>  Prolonged use of the device leads to natural wear.  Like any other part, during operation, the rubber cuff becomes unusable and requires replacement. </li><li>  Exposure to chemicals in detergents. </li><li>  Wear due to friction with the housing.  Especially when working at high speeds.  Experts note that for this reason, a new cuff for the LG WD series washing machine is often required. </li><li>  Damage to sharp objects during washing.  For example, locks, zippers, decorative elements of clothing. </li><li>  The development of fungi and mold due to constant moisture. </li></ol><h2>  How to remove the cuff </h2>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is worth noting that in modern models of washing machines, it is often provided for the ability to remove the cuff without removing the outer casing, this greatly simplifies the repair.  Owners of devices of old models will have to dismantle the front of the case.  In order to remove the cuff, no special knowledge is required.  The main thing is that the new rubber gasket must fully correspond to the size and structure of the old one.  In order not to make a mistake with the choice, spare parts for washing machines should be purchased in strict accordance with the model of the device or should be sent to the store, taking with them the part that is being replaced. </p><p>  Visually, you can see that the front of the rubber gasket is hidden in a special recess.  To remove it, you first need to remove the retaining clamps from it.  So that the cuff of the hatch of the washing machine does not fall out, a special clamp is put on top of it.  It is with him that it is worth starting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine door cuff" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/1641263.jpg"></div>

    <p>  As a rule, it is made of plastic, but can also be found in metal form.  To remove the clamp, you need to hold the latch and pull it towards you.  If the clamp is made of metal wire, it is best to take a sharp object so that it is easy to pry off.  Next, you need to find the mark on the cuff, which will serve as a guide to how the replacement element should be installed.  Otherwise, leaks cannot be avoided. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Installing a new sample </h2><p>  First you need to clean the entire surface where the work will be done.  The new cuff for the washing machine must be installed in a clean and dry place so that it can fit snugly against the structure.  The new rubber gasket is tightly fixed over the entire surface of the tank.  It must be remembered that the mark on the cuff, which was mentioned earlier, should be at the top.  In addition, there are other marks that must also coincide with the tank.  Now you need to carefully place the seal in the recess, which is located on the body.  During installation, there are often problems with pulling around the perimeter of the circular opening of the tank.  Especially often this happens halfway when an unidentified part starts to bounce or wrinkle.  In this case, it is worth trying to fix the cuff at the same time from two edges. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cuff for washing machine lg" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/1641264.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  After the cuff for the washing machine is installed, it is necessary to tighten it with a clamp on top.  If there is a regulating screw on the holding device, it will be enough just to tighten it.  It should be noted that installation with a metal clamp will be easier, but the material from which it is made is susceptible to corrosion.  Therefore, a plastic holding device will be more durable in this regard. </p><h2>  Checking the work done </h2><p>  When spare parts for washing machines are replaced and installed, it is mandatory to test the result of the work done.  To do this, run the rinse without laundry and see if there are leaks.  After a few minutes, you can tilt the machine and check whether water is dripping on the floor.  If everything is in order, then the tightness of the machine is not broken and you can safely use it.  Advice to hostesses: after each washing, wipe the cuff dry from the inside.  This will prevent the formation of mold and the propagation of fungi, therefore, extend the life of the rubber gasket. </p>
