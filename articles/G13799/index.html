    <p>  Pulkovo is actually the only <span>airport in St. Petersburg,</span> which is at the same time the international air gate of the North-West Federal District.  By the way, few people know that it was called "Highway" until 1973.  Today it is located at a distance of twenty kilometers from the city center. </p><p>  Having served almost thirteen million people in 2013, the airport took third place in the number of passengers brought.  Pulkovo Airport is also the base airport for Transaero and Russia airlines. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now all, both international and domestic flights, are operated through the new Terminal-1.  And the Pulkovo-1 terminal, well-known to many, was closed for repairs, which they plan to finish in 2014.  After repair work, the Pulkovo-1 building will be connected to the newly-built terminal, where they will serve passengers of domestic flights.  At the end of March this year, the Pulkovo-2 terminal, which sent international flights, completely stopped working. </p><h2>  Section 2. Architectural Features </h2>

    <p>  From Pulkovo you can get to the metro quite quickly, however, once you find yourself in the building, you still need to try to take the time and look around.  And actually there is something to look at. </p><p>  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãall aprons of the airport terminal has now doubled.  Previously, it was 250 thousand square meters, and now it is 450. The services of the air complex are equipped quite modernly and in accordance with the requirements of all, even the most capricious travelers. </p><p>  The airport is designed by Grimshow Architects, an English architecture bureau.  The whole appearance of the terminal reflects the historical buildings of the Northern capital and resembles architectural features of the Soviet era and the front halls of the Hermitage.  In sunlight, the roof of the building has a gleam of gold, like the <span>domes of the temples of</span> St. Petersburg. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The curved curved ceiling resembles the expanse <span>of the Neva River,</span> there are sculptures of female aircraft, and the transition from the registration zone to the border control zone resembles the bridges of the Northern capital. </p><p>  The new terminal has 110 cabins for passport control, therefore, there will definitely not be any queues.  The check-in area for international and domestic flights, in which there are 88 counters, is divided into two parts.  To issue bags and suitcases, 7 luggage carousels were installed. </p><p>  Created conditions for people with disabilities.  17 boarding gates were installed; in the air complex there are 14 telescopic ramps, 45 elevators, as well as 17 escalators. </p><h2>  Section 3.

    <p>  In general, it‚Äôs definitely not worth worrying that the passenger will get lost or cannot get to the city on time.  Explain why.  The fact is that today in the building everything is extremely simple and clear.  Everywhere you can see the beautifully lit signs and signs.  For example, Pulkovo Airport - Metro, and then the arrow will coordinate the traveler about the correct transition to the destination.  As experienced travelers note, such signs are found literally at every step, which means that the question of how to get to the metro from Pulkovo does not arise even for those who are at the airport for the first time. </p><p>  Express buses from Pulkovo-1 (No. K800) and from Pulkovo-2 (No. K900) run every hour even at night.  It is possible to get to several metro stations at once: Technological Institute, Moskovskaya, Vladimirskaya, Dostoevskaya, which is the final one. </p><h2>  Section 4. How to get to the metro from Pulkovo (buses and minibuses) </h2><p>  Public transport is also abundant.  Of course, it moves around the city more slowly, but its prices are much lower. </p><p>  A shuttle taxi No. K39 and a bus No. 39 leave from the Moskovskaya station. </p><p>  From the station "Kupchino" - minibus number K-113. </p><p>  Minibuses No. K-213 and No. K-3 depart from Sadovaya metro station. </p><p>  From Vladimirskaya square - minibus number K-900. </p><h2>  Section 5.

    <p>  In connection with the construction of the new terminal, the entire load was distributed on the first and second platforms.  But the third is almost all freed.  Earlier, upon arrival of passengers, for example, at the annual St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, a separate lane was allotted, which complicated the work of staff and the presence of other passengers in the hall.  Now, for visitors to this event, Pulkovo Airport will take the entire third platform.  Therefore, there will be no problems with the registration and baggage claim for other passengers. </p><p>  It should be noted that a cargo platform has already been introduced, which also greatly facilitated the work.  Due to the increase in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe airport, the cleaning volume has certainly not been reduced.  But this is not a problem: a lot of new equipment has been acquired, so it will not be difficult to clear the runways from snow in winter. </p>
