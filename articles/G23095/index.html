Creative Ideas</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Handmade gifts are of particular value because, in addition to time and effort, a piece of warmth and goodness is invested in them.  An original pillow with your own hands can also be an interesting gift to a friend, husband or mother-in-law.  For a child, you can sew a pillow-toy that will decorate the room and entertain the child.  If you have at least basic sewing skills, then such a thing will not be difficult to do. </p><h2>  Interior </h2><p>  Every housewife dreams of comfort and beauty of her home.  You can diversify the interior by adding original <span>sofa cushions</span> to it <span>.</span>  For example, on an existing pillow you can sew a satin ribbon, making small frills.  Or decorate it with lace.  Another option for decor is embroidery.  It can be done on a special machine or manually. </p><p>  An interesting idea might be a pillow made of old jeans.  Such a little thing is very multifunctional: in addition to its direct duties, it will play the role of a warehouse for often lost things, for example, a remote control from a TV, glasses or a cell phone.  And you can make several <span>decorative pillowcases</span> and change them according to your mood.  A red pillow will mean that everything is fine, green - you are calm, black - you are angry.  And the husband, having come from work, will see what color is today, and will know how to behave today. </p><h2>  For lovers as a gift </h2><p>  Such an original pillow with your own hands is done simply and is suitable for a gift for Valentine's Day.  To do this, we need a pillow, pillowcase in plain color, red knitted fabric, threads, scissors and a pencil. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Original DIY pillow" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/36079/849438.jpg" width="600"></div>  If there is no finished pillow, then it can be sewn (size - 50 * 50 cm).  Further from the fabric we cut out the heart.  We lay the details on top of each other and sew on the pillowcase with transverse stripes with a distance of 3 cm between them. After all the seams are completed, the sewn heart needs to be cut (exactly between the seams).

For inexperienced knitters, such a design option as the "patchwork" pattern is suitable.  It is also called the "pearl pattern."  The number of loops must be a multiple of two.

    <ul><li>  1 row: front, wrong side. </li><li>  2 row: wrong side, front. </li></ul><p>  It turns out that the loop that we in the previous row knitted front, in the next we also knit the front.  The pattern comes out in a checkerboard pattern - simple, but very interesting and beautiful. </p><p>  You can make a pillowcase on a pillow from an old <span>knitted</span> sweater or sweater.  It will also be nice to complete the product using the patchwork technique, but then you need to work with a crochet hook.  Any remaining yarn will be used.  Of these, we knit a lot of different squares, which we then hook around the perimeter.  It turns out bright and funny pillows. </p><h2>  Pillows toys </h2><p>  The interior of the children's room can also be diversified.  The original pillow, made with your own hands in the form of a soft toy, will delight the child for more than one year.  In addition, you can not only lie down on it, but also play.  Patterns of original pillows can be prepared by yourself according to the samples presented below.  For example, to sew the legendary and beloved electronic pet Pu. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Original DIY pillow" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/36079/849442.jpg" width="600"></div>  To do this, take a brown <span>fleece fabric</span> and cut out two details from it.  We sew eyes on one piece and embroider the mouth.  Then we sew the parts together, leaving a small hole for stuffing.  As a filler, you can use sintepon, holofiber or cotton wool.  It depends on what stuff you use for stuffing, whether there will be soft pillows or not.

    <p>  Girls will surely like a pillow in the shape of a kitty pussy.  Here you can choose a fabric with a higher pile, for example, velor or terry.  We also cut out two details and embroider a muzzle on the front side of one of them.  Then we sew them together on a typewriter or manually.  We make a bow separately, we stuff it with a filler and sew to a ready-made pillow. </p><h2>  Pillow letters </h2><p>  Today, at the peak of the popularity of <span>pillow letters.</span>  You can use them for their intended purpose to study the alphabet with young children or to decorate the sofa by laying out the name on it.  Such an original pillow with your own hands is sewn a little more complicated than the previous ones. </p><p>  To get started, you need to determine the size of the letters.  If you are going to make one initial of your name, then it should be large enough, up to 50 cm in size. If you sew the name completely, you can limit it to 30 cm. As toys for children, you can make small letters of 10 cm in size. So , size selected. </p><p>  Now we draw a pattern on paper in full size.  To build a pattern, it is best to use <span>graph paper: its</span> price is low, and the pattern will be accurate.  It should be borne in mind that letters such as B, C, and K cannot be turned upside down - on this basis, one must observe the location of the pattern when cutting onto fabric.  The best way to do this is to fold the fabric with the front sides inward, after which the material is connected with pins and two parts are cut out at once.  The pattern on the side parts is not built: here just a long rectangle is taken, equal to the intended width of the letter, and sewn along the contour of the pillow.  We make seam allowances on all the details.  Also, when building a pattern, you need to take into account that when filling the pillow with a padding polyester, it will lose about 2-3 cm in size. </p><h2>  Maternity Pillows </h2><p>  Well, you can not ignore the side of the pillow in the form of a horseshoe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Soft pillows" class="if" height="228" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/36079/849448.jpg" width="200"></div>  Here we are no longer talking about beauty and style, but about comfort and convenience.  People who often have a back pain, or pregnant women can not do without it.  You can put it not only under the back, but also under the head during sleep.  And when the baby is born, it can be put on a pillow to feed.  In this position, the nursing mother will not get tired, and feeding the baby will be a real joy.  And when the child grows up and learns to sit, then he can be safely planted in the middle of the pillow, not being afraid that he will fall.

    <p>  The sizes of such products vary, from 70 cm to average human height, so if you decide to sew such a thing for yourself, then you need to stock up with a lot of synthetic winterizer and fabric for sewing.  If you plan to use a pillow for a child, then you need to sew two pillowcases with a zipper made of cotton material. </p>
