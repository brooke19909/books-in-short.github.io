    <p>  The famous building is located in a luxurious area called Westminster.  The first royal palace appeared here in 1016.  But after 1295, the families of the monarchs freed this building, and it passed into the power of the parliament. </p><p>  All the beauty that was built over the centuries was consumed by fire on October 16, 1834.  Despite the struggle of firefighters with the elements, the palace burned.  Realizing the magnitude of the tragedy, the leadership ordered all forces to be thrown to save Westminster Hall.  A day later, the parliament building <span>in London</span> turned into ruins.  But the unique hall with luxurious wooden beams managed to be preserved. </p><p>  After deciding to restore a historically important site, Charles Barry's project was chosen.  The style in which the structure is designed is neo-Gothic.  Initially, the task was set: to build a luxurious, majestic and impressive palace. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Oldest hall </h2><p>  Almost everything presented to the visitor today was rebuilt after a big fire.  But the oldest part of the castle is Westminster Hall.  Its area is 1547 m¬≤.  This room was saved from fire.  The construction of the room began in the distant 1097.  And two years later, the architects passed the object.  Everyone who enters the hall, first of all, pays attention to the amazing roof.  At one time, this hall bore the honorary title of the largest in Europe.  And only many years later, everyone found out where the parliament building is in London. </p><p>  The functions of this room were quite wide.  Court sessions were held here.  On the benches the fate of the most famous people of his time was decided: both kings and politicians.  In addition, foreign guests were received in the lobby, receptions were held, and banquets were held. </p>

    <h2>  Ceremony of the year </h2><p>  The front door is the Sovereign Entrance.  It is located under <span>the Victoria Tower.</span>  Every year, the monarch with his entourage comes here to open a new parliamentary year.  Then he goes to another, no less magnificent hall.  The next room has a single purpose - it serves as a dressing room for autocrats.  Here, the country's leaders dressed in parliamentary robes, put on the imperial crown.  This is one of the few traditions that Westminster Palace in London holds. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  By far, the most luxurious room of the palace is the Royal Gallery.  The interior and decoration were to be worthy of a monarch.  It should be noted that this is one of the largest premises.  Its dimensions are 33.5 x 13.7 meters.  The walls are decorated with frescoes.  From this hall, the procession proceeded to the Upper House to open the session.  When a royal woman comes in, deputies, judges and clergy rise from their seats. </p>

    <h2>  Established traditions </h2><p>  Since the 16th century, the parliament has been divided into two parts.  The Lower <span>House of Commons</span> consists of parties.  In the Upper Lords and representatives of the clergy.  Earlier, deputies worked in the temple.  They sat on church benches set opposite each other.  The British Parliament still maintains this order.  During historical events, these two authorities "settled" in the same room. </p><p>  Between the Chambers there is a central hall, above which the Central Tower rises.  The entrance to the community hall is made in the form of an arch.  It is decorated with stones on which traces of explosions remained.  In 1941, during the Second World War, the Lower House suffered very much.  The plates found in the ruins have been preserved as a symbol of the invincibility of Great Britain.  Nearby are statues of the two most influential ministers of England - Lloyd George and <span>Winston Churchill.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The owners of the palace </h2><p>  In the northern part is the Lower House.  After rebuilding in 1950, it became less luxurious.  Nevertheless, her beauty is striking.  The ruling parties and the opposition are sitting opposite each other.  Between them there is a conditional corridor indicated by red lines. </p>

    <p>  The width between the marks is equal to the length of two elongated swords.  The color in which the room is decorated is green.  The size of the hall is 14 x 20.7 meters.  It is here that everyone who forms a parliament gathers.  For 400 years, the Palace of Westminster remained the main residence of the British kings.  This is the official administrative center of the country. </p><p>  The meeting room of the House of Lords is very rich and luxurious.  The main tone is red.  The imperial throne is located here, where the monarch sits during the opening of the parliament.  The throne is amazing.  The chair is gilded.  The masters spent three years on its decoration.  Here, the current queen read ceremonial words.  However, its authors are deputies and ministers.  The plans of the parliament for the next year are included in the speech.  And only after this ritual the parliamentary session is considered open. </p><p>  The building itself is on the left bank of the main river of the city - the Thames.  It should be noted that many tourists choose water excursions, since the parliament building in London is reflected in the splendor of the waves.  And this is a unique view. </p><h2>  "Face" of England </h2><p>  Of course, the <span>symbol of London</span> is Big Ben.  It is used as a business card and is often featured in films, books, and greeting cards.  Usually people call the Clock Tower by this name.  However, this is actually the nickname of the largest of the five bells of the palace.  His job is to count the clock.  The "voice" of the chimes is broadcast every 60 minutes on the BBC. </p><p>  As already known, almost the entire palace burned down in the fire of 1834.  When the authorities decided to restore the parliament, the Clock Tower also entered the project.  This amazing attraction is the work of the <span>English architect</span> August Pugin. </p><p>  The mechanism was designed by a group of lovers.  And by 1854, the clock was finally assembled.  The last day of spring 1859 is considered the birthday of Big Ben.  It was then that the hour hand was launched.  Today it is impossible to imagine the parliament building in London without this structure. </p>

    <h2>  Mechanism basis </h2><p>  Under the watch there is a Latin inscription, which translates as "God save Queen Victoria."  Another sentence was struck nearby: "Praise the Lord."  During World War II, German bombers tried to destroy the symbol of the indestructible Great Britain.  However, the tower survived. </p><p>  The base of the bell reaches 3 meters.  The height is 2 m. The diameter of the dial is 7 m. The length of the hour hand is 2.7 m, and the minute hand is 4.2 m. </p><p>  It should be noted that Big Ben is a kind of mosaic.  Each of the four sides consists of 312 glass particles.  Every 5 years, professional cable washers sink to the dial.  They wipe the watch with a special solution, while trying not to damage the fragile windows. </p><p>  Until now, this architectural landmark is included in the list of the largest clock mechanisms in the world and takes second place.  The weight of the famous bell is almost 14 tons. </p><h2>  New name </h2><p>  The height of the tower reaches 96 meters.  However, the mechanism itself is 55 meters from the base.  You can climb the mountain using a narrow spiral staircase, consisting of 334 steps.  They lead to a small platform.  However, tourists are not allowed there.  Only watchmen can climb into the "heart" of a watch.  Very rarely, tours are arranged for the press and guests of honor. </p><p>  The tower is especially beautiful in the dark.  The four-sided clock is illuminated by illumination.  The chiming clock is well audible even at a distance of 8 km.  Interestingly, when the British Parliament sits at night, Big Ben is lit in a different color. </p>

    <p>  Until September 2012, they were known as the Clock Tower of the Palace of Westminster.  However, politicians decided to rename the monument in honor of the 60th anniversary of the reign of Queen Elizabeth.  This change has caused controversy among the public.  But, despite this, he did not lose his Big Ben magic.  Every tourist who has visited London cannot return home without a photo with this attraction. </p>
