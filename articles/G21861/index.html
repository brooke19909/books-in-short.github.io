    <p>  Resting in Mallorca, you just need to see the city of Palma de Mallorca, which is the capital not only of the island, but of the entire archipelago.  The city is located in the bay of the same name, which is recognized as one of the most beautiful places in the world.  Crystal clear water, stunning beaches, bays, bays, rocky cliffs, flowering gardens, pine forests and palm alleys make the island a very popular resort. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Palma is a beautiful city that is worth seeing with your own eyes.  You can go round it on a special red tourist bus.  A ticket purchased for it gives you the right to use it throughout the day.  But the historical center of the city needs to be walked around to admire it and imbued with the local spirit.  In addition, in Palma you can see the round <span>Belver Castle</span> and the cathedral, built right on the coast.  In the port you can catch a ferry and go to the famous Ibiza island, which is known for its entertainment around the world. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel delfin playa 4" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1508379.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Palma de Mallorca will be interesting for shopaholics.  The best shopping places in the city are the streets: Sindicat, Sant Miguel, Jaime III.  A large number of various stores work here.  It is especially good to make purchases during the sales period, which begin on the first of July.  Therefore, tourists planning a vacation during this period should definitely visit them.  In Mallorca, you can also buy traditional local products: handmade ceramics, furniture, objects made from palm leaves, national embroidery, famous pearls and handmade sandals. </p><h2>  Top Mallorca Attractions </h2><p>  Not only Palma de Mallorca is of interest on the island.  All of Mallorca is full of attractions.  Among them, it is worth highlighting the following places that are required to visit: </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="delfin playa 4 palmanova reviews" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1508380.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <ol><li>  The aquarium of the capital of the island is considered one of the best in all of Europe.  It also includes a natural marine park.  On its territory there are 55 aquariums, in which more than 700 representatives of the fauna of the Mediterranean live. </li><li>  The Dragon Cave is Mallorca's most amazing natural landmark.  Here you can see the real kingdom of the grottoes, stalactites and the cleanest underground lakes.  An ancient legend says that the Templars and pirates of the Mediterranean Sea once hidden their treasures in a cave.  The very first attempts to find innumerable wealth were made in the 14th century.  However, so far nothing has been found, but detailed maps of the cave have been compiled. </li><li>  The small fairytale town of Valldemossa captivates tourists with its provincial antiquity.  Although the city is small, but it has many attractions, among which are: the Cartesian monastery, the church of St. Bartholomew. </li><li>  The Marineland Dolphinarium has an extensive entertainment program.  Of greatest interest is the show program with animals, in which not only dolphins perform, but also parrots with sea lions.  Dolphins in the wild can be seen in a transparent tunnel.  In addition, tropical, Mediterranean and freshwater fish inhabit the dolphinarium.  Flamingos, pelicans, monkeys, iguanas, snakes, penguins and frogs also live here. </li><li>  Cape Formentor is located in the north of Mallorca.  This is one of the most visited places on the island.  And the reason for this is the extraordinary beauty of the local landscapes: stunning cliffs fall into the sea, and their peaks are completely covered with green thickets.  The cape is also known for its beautiful white sand beach and clear, clear water.  A lighthouse was built on it back in the 19th century, which still works. </li><li>  Amusement park "Kathmandu" is considered the second in the list of the best entertainment venues in Spain.  Here tourists will find for themselves an incredible amount of interesting activities.  Guests are offered ten incredible attractions.  The most important of them is an inverted house.  No less interesting for children is a climbing wall, water activities, slides, jumps and labyrinths. </li></ol><h2>  Delfin Playa 4 * (Palmanova): reviews </h2><p>  Having a conversation about the complex, I want to talk about the reviews of its guests.  Hotel Delfin Playa 4 * is one of those hotels whose reviews are rather contradictory.  It is worth noting that planning a trip to this place is not worth those people who are too picky about all the little things.  As we already mentioned, the hotel is not young, and the last repair was carried out for a long time.  This is noticeable by numbers.  In general, the apartments are spacious and equipped with normal furniture.  All of them are designed in the same style with the interiors of the complex.  The rooms are air-conditioned and the balconies and terraces are equipped with a minimal set of furniture.  So in the evening you can sit and enjoy the seascape, if the windows of your apartments overlook the coast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="delfin playa 4 spain palmanova" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1508382.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In Delfin Playa 4 * (Spain, Palmanova) there are two buildings: the main one (where the reception is located) and the additional one, through the path.  Russians usually settle in the second building.  To get a room with a sea view, receptionists ask for a surcharge.  Is it worth it, you decide. </p><p>  Wi-Fi is available only in public places, you must pay extra for using it in your room (the cost is impressive).  The apartments have refrigerators and air conditioning.  One of the buildings is currently closed for restoration.  Daily housekeeping is not always of high quality, but towels without reminders change every day.  Unfortunately, the bathrooms do not have shampoos and gels, so it's best to take your own from home. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  According to vacationers, the food in Delfin Playa 4 * (Mallorca) is very decent.  At the buffet there is always a large assortment of dishes.  <span>Continental breakfasts are</span> standard: omelets, eggs, sliced, jamon, yogurts, toasts, tea, coffee, granola, bacon. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="delfin playa 4 majorca reviews" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1508384.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  All vacationers indicate the presence of a large amount of fruit in the restaurant.  Here you can try: bananas, grapefruits, melons, watermelons, peaches, pineapples, oranges, apples, plums, pears, grapes.  For lunch, soups, meat, pastries, side dishes, poultry, fish, salads, wine and drinks appear on the buffet.  Perhaps the greatest variety of food can be seen at dinner.  At any time during the day, the main restaurant has ice cream and can also be ordered at the bar. </p><p>  Active tourists who want to see something new, except for the beach, recommend paying half board, because when traveling around the island, you are unlikely to have time for lunch.  All Inclusive will suit people more passive.  In addition, it is worth noting that next to the hotel there are a huge number of cafes and restaurants in which they cook deliciously delicious. </p><p>  Not all hotel guests are satisfied with the service of waiters in the restaurant, who are too slow and in no hurry to clean the dirty dishes.  The All Inclusive system allows you to order a lot of drinks, good quality cocktails in bars.  Fans of alcohol will certainly appreciate this nuance. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  Delfin Playa Hotel 4 * (photos are given in the article) has a very good location.  Near it there is a public transport stop.  The complex itself is located right on the coast, just a couple of minutes - and you are already on a gorgeous sandy beach.  The coast of Mallorca is a real miracle.  The beautiful warm sea, combined with beautiful white sand, palm trees and coniferous trees create an amazing experience.  On local beaches you can relax forever, admiring the beauty of nature and enjoying peace and quiet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="delfin playa 4 reviews" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1508385.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel has several wonderful pools, near which there is a relaxation area with umbrellas and sun loungers.  True, people are rarely seen near them.  The local coast is so beautiful that everyone wants to plunge into the sea. </p><p>  In the evening you can walk along the promenade, where there are numerous shops.  What about animation in Delfin Playa 4 * <span>(Mallorca)?</span>  <span>Reviews of</span> tourists say that it is present, but not to the same extent as, for example, in the same Turkey.  That is, in the evenings there are entertainment programs, but not every day, but in the daytime there is no team of animators who occupy your time with various sports events.  It is difficult to say whether this is good or bad, but, unlike the Turkish complexes, European hotels do not pay much attention to the leisure of guests.  On the other hand, the hotel has a great location, thanks to which you can quickly reach the most interesting places of the island to see the local beauty.  Therefore, active tourists simply do not have time for other events.  Simply, when purchasing a tour to this complex, this fact should be taken into account.  If you want to relax in a hotel with active animation, then it is better to opt for one of the Turkish offers, where really professionals work in this business. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Given all of the above about the Delfin Playa 4 * complex (reviews are given in the article), we can say that the hotel may well be recommended for a budget holiday.  Tours to this hotel are the cheapest compared to other four-star Mallorca complexes.  Simply, when acquiring a ticket, you should be aware of some of the nuances and not make excessive demands on the economy class complex, which fully meets the price-quality ratio. </p>
