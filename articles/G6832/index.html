Landmark to the West.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The causes and consequences of the Krevsky Union of 1385 in modern historiography are estimated very contradictory.  Some historians consider this event a kind of ‚ÄúRubicon that split Russia,‚Äù for others it is significant that this was the beginning of a voluntary union of the two peoples.  At the same time, their states did not lose their own sovereignty.  The unification of the Poles and Litvinians took place against the backdrop of increasing confrontation between East and West.  About what reasons served as an impetus for the Krevsk Union of 1385 will be described in the article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.geni.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kreva Union 1385 g causes and consequences" class="if uuid-2577661" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55362/2577661.jpg"></div><h2>  Algerd and Keistut </h2><p>  The onslaught of the crusaders in the East intensified.  The Grand Duchy of Lithuania was on the way to their advancement.  Lithuanian prince Gedymin did not manage to appoint a receiver for himself.  I immediately took advantage of this to know.  Local separatism intensified, undermining the power of the state.  The Teutonic Order, even more impudent from impunity, carried out predatory raids under the specious pretext of "the baptism of the Slavs." </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kreva Union 1385" class="if uuid-2577663" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55362/2577663.jpg"></div><p>  Two brothers - the princes Olgerd and Keistut - voluntarily shared their responsibilities for the defense of the state, being their co-rulers.  Each chose his own direction: Keistut was interested in relations with the West, and Olgerd positioned himself as a <span>collector of Russian lands</span> in the East.  If necessary, they provided each other comprehensive support.  Such a policy soon bore fruit.  The power of ON increased. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="dic.academic.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rapprochement incl. with Poland poland union 1385" class="if uuid-2577660" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55362/2577660.jpg"></div><p>  Even after the death of his brother, Keistut did not change the tradition.  The son of <span>Algerd, Prince</span> Jagiello, took the place of his father.  In order to understand the issue of the causes and consequences of the Union of Krev in 1385, it is necessary to say a few words about the heir to Olgerd. </p><h2>  Jagiello </h2><p>  He was a very cunning, treacherous and cruel ruler, for whom personal power was above all.  So very soon, he began to intrigue against his uncle.  At this time, there was a convergence of interests between Dmitry Donskoy and Keistut.  They both saw the main threat in the Golden Horde.  Jagiello decided to take advantage of this and became close to Mamai.  After the famous Kulikovo battle, the authority of Grand Duke Dmitry Ivanovich Donskoy increased.  In it they saw the main defender and support of the Russian lands.  They listened to his opinion, sought his support.  Among them was Jagiello. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kreva union 1385 history" class="if uuid-2577673" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55362/2577673.jpg"></div><p>  Only one thing confused this power-hungry prince.  If he accepts the conditions of Dmitry Ivanovich, then he himself, and at the same time the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, will have to recognize the supreme power of the winner of the Battle of Kulikovo.  This was not in the interests of Jagiello.  The nephew managed to destroy his uncle Keistut in 1382, and his son Vitovt fled to the crusaders.  Now he was the main contender for the supreme power in the ON.  Soon Jagiello received a very tempting offer from the Pope.  It must be voiced in more detail in order to understand the reasons and conditions for the conclusion of the Krevsky Union. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Catholicism East </h2><p>  Rome had long cherished the hope of turning the Russian lands into the fold of its church.  Promises, threats, and the use of military force did not help.  The Teutonic Order was repeatedly hit on the teeth by the Rus, and this suggested that something had to be changed in the strategy. </p><p>  It was necessary to find a ruler who was ready to instill Catholicism.  The ideal candidate was the Orthodox prince Jagiello.  He needed support as never before.  Moscow threatened his power from the east, Vitovt from the west, and in Lithuania itself many of his countrymen were unhappy with the reprisal against Keystut.  The offer of Poland for him was the only acceptable option not only for salvation, but also for strengthening his own power.  The causes and consequences of the Krevsky Union in 1385 cannot be considered without stopping at the very concept of ‚Äúunion‚Äù.  What does it consist of, what characteristics does it have? </p><h2>  What is union? </h2><p>  A union is a union that can only be concluded between states with a monarchical form of government, in which one monarch is the head of all states participating in such a union.  Moreover, between them there should not be close economic and political cooperation, and the sovereignty of such countries remains unshakable. </p><p>  The convergence of the GDL with Poland and the Krevsk Union of 1385 are a vivid example of this.  Each of the parties had its own army, treasury, border and did not particularly interfere in each other's affairs.  However, in the event of a general danger, such allies acted as a united front.  It was a forced union of two weakened states, under tremendous pressure from the outside. </p><h2>  Terms of an agreement </h2><p>  Behind Poland stood the powerful Roman Catholic Church.  She was the main guarantor of compliance with the agreements by the West.  In exchange for their support and settlement of conflicts with the Teutonic Order, the following was required from the Lithuanian prince Jagailo: </p><p>  - Adopt Catholicism and contribute to its promotion on the territory of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. </p><p>  - To return all the disputed territories that the Litvins, in their naivety, considered their own and attached to the principality by the power of the sword. </p><p>  - To pay a penalty for violation of the marriage contract.  Jadwiga was already promised to the Austrian duke, but 200,000 Florens should help the "poor fellow" drown out the mental suffering. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gadtravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="reasons and conditions for the conclusion of the union of Kreva" class="if uuid-2577686" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55362/2577686.jpg"></div><p>  The history of the Krevsky Union of 1385 is a sad story of the betrayal of the faith of ancestors by the tip of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.  Ordinary people, like part of the aristocracy, did not accept an alien faith.  A bloody confrontation began.  Vitovt took advantage of this situation - the son of the meanly murdered prince Keistut.  In this massacre he was supported by Muscovites and crusaders.  Gradually, Vilnius, Gorodnya, Novogrudok fell under the control of Vytautas.  In this growing conflict, a compromise was needed.  The Kingdom of Poland, represented by Jagiello, understood this very well. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  If you briefly characterize the causes and consequences of the Krevsky Union in 1385, it is necessary to highlight some of the most important points.  The West, trying to prevent the strengthening of the Moscow state, drew another ally to its side - the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.  This became possible not only due to the fact that the top of this state was flattered by privileges and liberties.  Europe‚Äôs deliberate choice occurred because its culture, economy, and military power were the most attractive to the people who understood that there was still something to learn from others. </p>
