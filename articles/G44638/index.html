    <h2>  Biographical Information </h2><p>  Vadim was born in November 1974 in the city of Anzhero-Sudzhensk, Kemerovo Region.  Until the eighth grade (according to Takmenev himself), the future journalist dreamed of a surgeon's career, very often being at the work of his aunt.  It was after such visits that Vadim had a fear of contracting some terrible disease.  He constantly washed his hands, worried about the purity of water, fruits and vegetables. </p><p>  As you can see, Vadim Takmenev, whose biography is now widely known in wide circles, dreamed of a completely different profession in his childhood.  Only closer to graduation, he began to think about the possibility of going into journalism.  Soon, he began working with the newspaper “Struggle for Coal”.  Now it has a different name - “Our city”.  Takmenev published her first notes and articles in it.  After Vadim graduated from junior school, he entered the Kemerovo State University at the Faculty of Journalism.  He graduated in 1996. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Takmenev in a relationship is consistent.  He met his future wife, Elena, as a student.  It is noteworthy that they met thanks to the notorious <span>Eugene Grishkovets,</span> who at that time was also a student of this university (but studied at a different faculty), and also directed the student theater “Lodge”.  It was he who was then visited by Takmenev.  Details of the dating are unknown, but a year after the meeting, the couple got married. </p><p>  Vadim Takmenev, whose wife decided to devote herself completely to the family after the wedding and the birth of children, has two daughters.  The oldest is Polina, the youngest is Agatha.  The girls are already quite old. </p>

    <h2>  Work on television </h2><p>  Vadim Takmenev began his work on television when he was a student.  He worked for the Guzl Kuzbass in news programs.

    <h2>  Participation in television programs </h2><p>  Today the program “Central Television” with Vadim Takmenev is very popular.  She first appeared on television in 2010 at the end of summer and immediately won the attention of viewers with her unusualness.  Here you could see a completely diverse news of Russia, which included the cultural, political and social events of the country.  In addition, the program included a discussion of sensations, showing curiosities and scandals over the past week. </p><p>  Within a year of the program’s release, it became the best program of the season (according to the “Telepress Club”).  And in 2014, the journalist himself became a winner of the Taffy Prize as the best presenter of the information program.  Of course, there were absolutely negative reviews about her. </p><p>  During the existence of “Central Television”, its substantial reformation took place.  The first version of the program was released in 2010 (as described above).  After several people left it in 2012 (Alexander Urzhanov, Pavel Lobkov, Nikolai Kartosiya), it was decided to introduce some changes.  Already this fall, the program took a different look.  Together with Takmenev, <span>Anna Kasterova</span> began to lead her (although for a fairly short time), and her airtime also increased.  Another significant change was the theme of the program - politics has given way to the entertainment aspect.  And in 2013 there were regular changes.  The program was again reduced broadcast time, but it was released live on all time zones of the country. </p>
