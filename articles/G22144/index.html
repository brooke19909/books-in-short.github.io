    <p>  So, most travelers praise the Arcadia Hotel.  They mention its green area, spacious rooms, delicious food and attentive staff.  As for the Gosteev hotel, tourists disagree about it.  Some believe that more worthy options can be found if Dzhubga became the place for a summer vacation.  The hotels of this village in terms of beauty of the territory, comfort of rooms, cleanliness and location, as a rule, are on the same level as Gostev, but some of them can offer better food.  Vacationers at this hotel complain about small portions, insufficient amounts of meat and fish. </p><p>  As for Hestia, it is worth noting that some vacationers complain about the rare cleaning of the room and the lack of dishes in the kitchen.  Although the rest of the guests are satisfied. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Hotel reviews may not be the same, as all people have different requests.  Therefore, choosing one or another option, it is worth being guided not only by the opinions of vacationers, but also by your own requirements for a comfortable stay.  And let your vacation in Dzhubga become unforgettable! </p>
