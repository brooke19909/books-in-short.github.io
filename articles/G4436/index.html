Booties pattern</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Purchased overalls for newborns almost always have small boots.  But, unfortunately, their quality leaves much to be desired. </p><h2>  Which to choose </h2><p>  Most often, booties made by industrial production look very thin and flimsy.  The fabric is blown through.  As the saying goes: "Keep your feet warm and your head cold."  And not in vain.  Due to the hypothermia of the feet, we get a lot of problems and diseases. </p><p>  Therefore, we simply must protect our child from the first days.  If your baby should be born in winter, then it is worthwhile to think in advance about how to wrap your legs.  Even if he is wrapped in a good blanket, booties will not be superfluous. </p><p>  The booties pattern is almost the same for any material.  You can distribute small shoes into several types: </p><ul><li>  Winter version from a sheepskin. </li><li>  Boots based on fur. </li><li>  Boots made of felt or fleece. </li><li>  Light calico, cotton booties for warm weather (or for home). </li><li>  Denim models for little mods. </li><li>  Crocheted or knitting. </li></ul><p>  In this article, we‚Äôll talk about how to sew booties with your own hands <em>.</em>  Consider several options from different fabrics and for every season, including for the winter. </p><h2>  Old collar and new shoes </h2><p>  It often happens that a jacket or a down jacket has long been gathering dust on shelves and is waiting in the wings, and the <span>fur collar</span> hangs neatly from it in order to be useful.  Just he can perfectly fulfill the role of small winter booties.  It will be necessary to simply cut out all the necessary details for the pattern from it and sew it.  Let's find out in more detail how to sew fur booties.  The pattern is presented below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="booties pattern" class="if" height="289" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12967/1520349.jpg" width="236"></div>

Wrap in a ring and flash. </li></ul><p>  Make several holes in a circle of booties and thread a ribbon or cord.  Thus, shoes will not be blown and will not be lost.  For convenience, we advise you to do all the seams manually, since the details are very small. </p><h2>  Sheepskin winter booties </h2><p>  The principle of operation is very similar.  Only in this case is it easier and more convenient to work.  To make small shoes for a new member of the family, you can use an old sheepskin coat.  There, it‚Äôs easier to cut out the details, and the sheepskin lies evenly.  Sheepskin booties are distinguished by special comfort and warmth.  Everyone knows that any clothing for children from this material is in demand <em>.</em>  A pattern of booties made of fur is perfect for this material. </p><ol><li>  We work in the same way.  We prepare a pattern, cut out the details. </li><li>  We pass to assembly.  All the same.  We connect the side parts to the top, and then to the sole.  Decorate the top of our strip. </li></ol><p>  You can create small uggs for your crumbs.  For this, the following booties pattern is suitable <em>.</em> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern of warm booties" class="if" height="285" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43946/1520099.jpg" width="525"></div>

We combine these three parts and sew them together manually.  In principle, it is possible on a typewriter.  On top you can also put on tape for fastening and just for beauty.  But this type of model is most likely for older children, it will not be very comfortable for newborn babies to wear them, and it is difficult for mother to wear. </p><h2>  Boots for home </h2><p>  Quick and easy to make warm home shoes.  In this case, consider material such as felt.  Sew very easily and quickly.  Pattern booties from felt can be used by anyone. </p>

    <p>  The booties made of felt are very soft and warm.  Just what a little man needs.  Having chosen the color, we proceed to manufacture. </p><ul><li>  Cut out our pattern.  Apply to fabric and circle. </li><li>  Leave a couple of millimeters at the seams and carefully cut. </li><li>  We attach the top of the boot to the toe of the sole and sew it by hand.  When two parts are sewn, we make a neat seam on the heel.  It is advisable to do it from the outside, so as not to harm the delicate skin of the baby. </li></ul><p>  In order for our felt booties not to be boring, you can decorate them.  For example, make bunnies.  Since such material as felt is very obedient, it will not be difficult to make several details. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself booties" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43946/1520103.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <ul><li>  Cut a circle of felt, for example, white, it will be a muzzle.  And a couple of ovals for the ears. </li><li>  We sew the details to the booties, and embroider the eyes and nose with thread. </li></ul><h2>  Booties for spring </h2><p>  Now let's prepare the booties with our own hands for spring or autumn.  For this we need several types of fabric.  A raincoat fabric for the top layer or another fabric that does not get wet and does not blow.  The synthetic winterizer for warming.  It can be made in one or two layers.  And fleece for the inner layer.  It can be replaced with any fabric.  But preference do towards natural materials. </p>

    <p>  The pattern of warm booties is similar to the pattern from the beginning of the article. </p><ol><li>  Cut each layer according to the pattern.  We recommend making each layer a couple of millimeters larger than the previous one.  For example, the middle one, that is, the synthetic winterizer, is slightly larger than the internal one.  Internal - a little more than average. </li><li>  Connect our layers and flash.  To begin with, it is worth connecting each part separately.  When all the details have been assembled, we are already assembling our booties from them. </li><li>  We connect the side parts to the top. </li><li>  After we sew the sole. </li><li>  The top can be decorated with our strip.  It does not have to be done with the inner layer.  It will be enough the top and one layer of syntepon. </li><li>  Making a drawstring. </li></ol><h2>  For little mods </h2><p>  To dress our baby a little and make his image more stylish, you can make denim booties.  Your old jeans will do just fine for this.  A soft and breathable fabric must be used for the inner layer.  For example, cotton.  These booties are perfect for warm sunny weather. </p><p>  We cut out our details on the pattern, not forgetting to leave a couple of millimeters at the seams. </p><p>  To begin with, it is recommended to assemble and stitch each part separately.  But if you are an experienced craftswoman, then it will not be difficult for you to sew a shoe right away. </p><p>  After you have collected the first boot (it does not matter which pattern was used, it all depends on your tastes), we proceed to the similar construction of the second.  In the manufacture of <span>baby booties</span> there is an indefinable plus: one pattern can make both shoes, since they are not distributed on the right and left. </p><p>  Do not forget that the seams should be on the front so as not to damage the skin of the baby. </p><p>  We proceed to the decoration. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew fur booties" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12967/1520354.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  How to decorate </h2><p>  Every mother wants her child to stand out from the gray crowd.  And we begin to do everything possible for this from the diapers.  Let's talk about how to decorate our homemade booties. </p><ul><li>  Fur booties, in principle, do not need any decoration.  The fur itself looks very luxurious and beautiful. </li><li>  Small sheepskin booties can be decorated with a beautiful drawstring or ribbon. </li><li>  Booties made of felt or fleece can be decorated with the muzzle of a bunny, cat, dog.  For girls, adding flowers or beads will be relevant.  It is only worth remembering that all small jewelry, including beads or rhinestones, must be very high quality and well sewn.  The child, due to his age, pulls everything in his mouth.  And if you hurry up and weakly sewn a bead, it can easily fall into the baby's mouth.  Be very careful! </li><li>  Also, a beautiful little bow on the heel can serve as an excellent decoration. </li><li>  For little men, appliques in the form of cars or an airplane can be sewn on the sides. </li></ul><p>  Pamper your kids with their own things.  Indeed, this is how they will even more feel your love and the warmth of your hands. </p>
