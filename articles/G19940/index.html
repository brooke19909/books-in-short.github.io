    <h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  Tourists traveling on vacation to the Falcon Resort Hotel, it is important to familiarize themselves with the features of the location of this hotel complex.  So, the remoteness of the institution from the main passenger transport hubs can be described as follows: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  from Dabolim Airport - 40 km; </li><li>  from Mapus bus station - 10 km; </li><li>  from Tivim railway station - 15 km. </li></ul><p>  Baga Beach and Aguada Fort are approximately 3 km from the hotel.  But the famous Calangute Beach from the hotel will have to walk about 500 meters. <br>  If you want to feel the atmosphere of the city, then you can visit the large Newton supermarket, the Natvara restaurant and the popular pizzeria after only 1 km. </p><h2>  Hotel Rooms </h2><p>  Hotel Falcon Resorts 1 * (India, North <span>Goa, Calangute) is</span> quite small, and its number of rooms is only 30 rooms, located in two-story buildings.  The apartments are divided into several categories: </p><ul><li><strong></strong>  Conventional room - a small one-room room decorated in a traditional Indian style. </li><li>  The Deluxe Suite is perhaps the best apartment in the hotel, equipped with a double bed and a large TV. </li><li>  The Superior Room - two-room apartments, which can accommodate a large family or a group of friends. </li><li>  Honeymoon Suites is a small, standard room with a double bed.  Its distinguishing feature is a romantic design with a large number of ruffles and pink elements. </li><li>  Budget - the cheapest category of rooms, more reminiscent in design of a military barracks.  In a small room there is only a bed and a hanging cupboard. </li></ul>
