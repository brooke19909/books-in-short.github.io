    <h2>  Basic concepts </h2><p>  <span>Primary documentation in accounting - what is it</span> ?  It is called evidence of the fact of a <span>business transaction,</span> reflected on paper.  Currently, many documents are prepared in the automated system " <span>1C".</span>  <span>The processing of primary documentation</span> involves the registration and recording of information about completed business transactions. </p><p>  Primary accounting is the initial stage of recording events that occur at the enterprise.  Business operations refer to actions entailing changes in the state of the assets or capital of the organization. </p><h2>  Primary Documentation Processing in Accounting: An Example Scheme </h2><p>  As a rule, in enterprises, the term "work with documentation" means: </p><ul><li>  Getting primary data. </li><li>  Preliminary processing of information. </li><li>  <span>Paperwork.</span> </li><li>  Approval by management or specialists authorized by order of the director. </li><li>  Reprocessing <span>of primary documentation</span> . </li><li>  Fulfillment of actions necessary for carrying out a business operation. </li></ul>

In this case, when <span>processing the primary documentation,</span> information from it is transferred to special registers. </p><h2>  Documentation Requirements </h2><p>  The primary documentation is issued upon the completion of the operation or immediately after its completion. </p><p>  Reflection of information is carried out on special unified forms.  In the absence of approved forms, the enterprise can develop them independently. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="primary accountant" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/2059412.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Stages of processing primary accounting documentation </h2><p>  At each enterprise in the state there is an employee responsible for working with primary information.  This specialist should know the rules for <span>processing primary documentation</span> , strictly observe the requirements of the law and the sequence of actions. </p><p>  The stages of <span>processing the primary documentation</span> are: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Taxation.  It is an assessment of the operation reflected on paper, an indication of the amounts associated with its implementation. </li><li>  Grouping.  At this stage, documents are distributed depending on common characteristics. </li><li>  Account assignment.  It involves the designation of debit and credit. </li><li>  Cancellation.  To prevent re-payment <span>on the primary documents, the accountant</span> p marks the "paid". </li></ul><h2>  Errors in documents </h2><p>  They can occur for various reasons.  Basically, their appearance is caused by the employee‚Äôs careless attitude to the work performed by him, illiteracy of a specialist, and malfunctioning of equipment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="processing of primary accounting documentation" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/2059413.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Adjustment of documents is highly discouraged.  However, in some cases, correction of errors cannot be avoided.  The <span>accountant</span> must correct the mistake <span>on the primary documentation</span> as follows: </p><ul><li>  Cross out the wrong entry with a thin line so that it is clearly visible. </li><li>  Write the correct information above the strikethrough line. </li><li>  Check "Corrected believe." </li><li>  Indicate the date of adjustment. </li><li>  Put a signature. </li></ul><p>  The use of corrective means is not allowed. </p><h2>  Work with incoming documents </h2><p>  The processing of incoming papers includes: </p><ul><li>  Definition of a document type.  Accounting papers always contain information about completed business transactions.  For example, they include an invoice, an order to receive funds, etc. </li><li>  Checking the details of the recipient.  The document should be addressed to a particular company or its employee.  In practice, it happens that documents for the purchase of materials are specially written for the company, although there is no contract with the supplier. </li><li>  Verification of signatures, stamp imprints.  Signatories must be authorized to do so.  If the endorsement of primary securities is not within the competence of the employee, then they shall be declared invalid.  As for the prints, in practice often errors occur in those enterprises that have several stamps.  The information on the print must correspond to the type of document on which it stands. </li><li>  Checking the status of documents.  In the event of damage to the papers or lack of any sheets, it is necessary to draw up an act, a copy of which should be sent to the counterparty. </li><li>  Verification of the validity of the event reflected in the document.  Employees must confirm the fact of the transaction.  The documents on the acceptance of values ‚Äã‚Äãare certified by the warehouse manager, the terms of the contract are confirmed by the marketer.  In practice, there are situations when a supplier receives an invoice for goods that the company has not received. </li><li>  Determination of the period to which the document relates.  When processing primary securities, it is important not to take into account the same information twice. </li><li>  Definition of the accounting section.  Upon receipt of the primary documentation, it is necessary to establish for what purposes the set values ‚Äã‚Äãwill be used.  They can act as fixed assets, materials, intangible assets, goods. </li><li>  Definition of the register in which the <span>document</span> will be <span>filed.</span> </li><li>  Registration of paper.  It is carried out after all checks. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Work with outgoing papers </h2><p>  The processing of this type of documentation is somewhat different from the above. </p><p>  First of all, an authorized employee of the enterprise forms a draft version of the outgoing document.  On its basis, a paper project is being developed.  He is sent to the head for approval.  However, another person with the appropriate authority can approve the draft document. </p><p>  After certification, the project is executed according to the established rules and sent to the recipient. </p><h2>  Workflow planning </h2><p>  This stage is necessary to ensure the prompt receipt, sending and processing of documentation.  For the competent organization of workflow at the enterprise, special schedules are developed.  They indicate: </p><ul><li>  Place and term of registration of primary securities. </li><li>  Name and position of the person who compiled and submitted the documents. </li><li>  Accounts made on the basis of securities. </li><li>  Time and place of storage of documentation. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Accounting registers </h2><p>  They are necessary for registration of primary documentation.  At the same time, a note on accounting is put down on the papers.  It is necessary to prevent re-registration of documents. </p><p>  Primary papers may be kept in electronic registers.  However, at the request of government agencies or contractors, the company must provide paper copies. </p><h2>  Features of document recovery </h2><p>  Currently, the regulatory acts do not have a clear procedure for the restoration of securities.  In practice, this process includes the following activities: </p><ul><li>  Appointment of a commission to investigate the causes of loss or destruction of documents.  If necessary, the head of the enterprise can involve law enforcement agencies in the procedure. </li><li>  Contacting a banking organization, counterparties for copies of primary documents. </li><li>  Correction of income tax return.  The need to submit an updated report is due to the fact that documented expenses that are not documented are not recognized as expenses for tax purposes. </li></ul><p>  In case of loss of primary documentation IFTS will calculate the amount of tax deductions based on available securities.  At the same time, it is possible that the tax authority will apply penalties in the form of a fine. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="primary documentation processing in accounting example" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/2059416.jpg"></div>

Its design must be approached very carefully.  Any mistake can lead to negative consequences. </p>
