The complex on the basis of the former Soviet sanatorium "Emerald Coast" began to function in 2014.  In the early years there were not the best reviews about him.  But recently, his owner has changed, who started a large-scale reconstruction.  As if by magic, the "killed" sanatorium of Soviet times was transformed.  There was a pretty decent hotel, SPA-services, cafes, developed leisure infrastructure. </p><p>  In this article we will talk about this complex, which is called "Baden-Baden."  What distinguishes it from the original, located in Germany?  The fact that he is in the Urals, in the Sverdlovsk region.  Its exact address is: Rezh city, Lenin street, 118. It is not far from Yekaterinburg, only eighty kilometers away.  Therefore, the SPA-complex "Baden-Baden" is very popular among residents of this city, especially in winter.  What do the reviews say about him? </p>

    <h2>  What are Rezh sources </h2><p>  Sverdlovsk region is rich in mineral waters.  It is enough to recall, for example, Lipovka.  This hydropathic center is famous for its radon baths.  And Lipovka is located not so far from the city of Rezh.  The sources of this town are not radon, but, nevertheless, have significant mineralization.  The optimal bathing time in such water is 15-20 minutes.  Wells have been drilled recently.  Water comes from a depth of two hundred meters.  And here it is necessary to bring very disappointing, but truthful information.  This water has a temperature of only 17 degrees.  That is, it is impossible to call the source "Baden-Baden" (Dir) thermal if you wish.  Water is heated at the outlet and allowed into the pools.  In an indoor tank, its temperature is maintained at 33 degrees, and in the open air - 39 ° C. But you cannot take mineralization from this water, and this is a big plus. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  The current "Cote d'Azur" </h2><p>  It has long been forgotten what ailments were treated in this health resort of the Sverdlovsk region.  For a long time, the sanatorium was desolate, offering rare vacationers unpretentious and very Spartan conditions on the banks of the picturesque Rezh reservoir.  But the treatment base in the sanatorium was not bad, so it was decided to leave it at the new Baden-Baden SPA complex (Rezh sources). </p><p>  Reconstruction undergone health resort buildings.  Today you can still see the peeling pioneers on the facade and other "greetings" from the Soviet past.  But do not be horrified: a major overhaul has already passed inside.  Europacks are inserted into the windows and, of course, new furniture and plumbing are purchased.  The owner of Baden-Baden plans to convert the dining room of the sanatorium into a European-style restaurant, where breakfast will be served in buffet style.  But now you can have a good rest there.  This is evidenced by numerous reviews of tourists. </p>

    <h2>  Pools </h2><p>  We already mentioned that there are two tanks in the hot springs.  One is indoors.  Its length is ten meters, it is not too deep.  Therefore, the pool is often called a "children's".  But the main thing in it is hydromassage.  Out of six pipes of various configurations, water jets beat.  With their help, it is good to massage various parts of the back.  But even under water, jets beat, as in a jacuzzi.  And in this pool there are two sunbeds, on which air massage is carried out.  The temperature of the water in the tank is maintained at + 33 ° C. In the outdoor pool, it is six degrees warmer.  The reviews claim that swimming in the last tank is more comfortable - the smell of chlorine is not so felt and it is more spacious.  Its length is 25 meters.  The outdoor pool also has two waterfalls and a hydro and air massage area. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Hot Springs (Dir): price </h2><p>  Pools can be visited for swimming, without hotel accommodation.  Prices depend on whether it is weekdays or weekends.  On weekends, swimming will cost more.  And the reviews say that it will be less comfortable - too many people come to Rezh sources.  In 2017, the tariffs are as follows: 1 hour - 250 and 450 rubles, 3 hours - 700 and 1000;  6 hours - 1100 and 1650 rubles.  If an adult buys a ticket for three hours or more, a child under 14 years old can go with him for free.  On Mondays and Tuesdays, discounts are provided to pensioners, on Wednesdays - for students.  The reviews also mention the many services for which a separate fee is charged: this is a bath complex, a parking lot, the use of barbecue facilities and rental arbors. </p><h2>  What is included in the guest package </h2><p>  Two buildings of the former sanatorium “Emerald Coast” are now filled with rooms of six categories - from economy class to VIP level.  The cost of living is from 3800 to 9100 rubles per day.  But this price includes three meals a day and unlimited visits to Rezh sources.  But that is not all. </p><p>  If you stay at the hotel for more than five days, new bonuses await you.  This is one oxygen cocktail or herbal tea and half an hour in a salt room per day.  Another free service is a massage bed session.  And an additional bonus: the procedure in the medical building of the sanatorium "Emerald Coast" of your choice.  The hotel offers free parking, Wi-Fi, use of table tennis and a games room.  You can sit in the living room with a real fireplace, cook barbecue on the grill.  Therefore, reviews recommend coming to the Baden-Baden complex with an overnight stay and not for one day. </p>
