Why did all the fame go to Edison?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  An ordinary incandescent bulb that is used in almost every home is often referred to as an Edison bulb.  The history of her invention was not so simple.  Before giving artificial light to billions of people, she went a long way in development. </p><h2>  Edison Light Bulb </h2><p>  American Thomas Alva Edison is one of the most enterprising people in this world.  He owns about 4 thousand patents for various inventions.  This person became the author of a phonograph, telegraph, carbon microphone, kinetoscope, iron-nickel battery and other devices.  It is with his name that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating an incandescent light bulb is associated. </p><p>  However, Edison‚Äôs bulb with charcoal inside was far from the first in the world.  More than ten inventors worked on the problem of creating an <span>artificial light source.</span>  Lamps of various shapes and sizes appeared, inside of which were located bamboo, platinum and charcoal threads.  Many of them have been officially registered. </p><p>  Why, among so many inventors, only Edison won world fame?  Its main role was manifested not in the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a lamp, but in the development of a way to make the mechanism easy to use, cheap and generally available. </p>

    <h2>  First attempts </h2><p>  It is difficult to say exactly who owns the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a light bulb.  But, before the Edison bulb appeared, hundreds of experiments were carried out and many similar inventions were announced.  At first, arc bulbs appear, and then incandescent bulbs.  In the XIX century, the discovery of the phenomenon of the <span>voltaic arc</span> leads inventors to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating artificial light.  To do this, it was necessary to connect two connected wires to electricity, and then slightly move away from each other.  So a glow appeared between the wires. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There is evidence that the Belgian Gerard was the first to create a lamp with a carbon rod.  Current was supplied to the device, and the rod produced light.  Later it became known about the Englishman Delar, who replaced coal with a platinum thread. </p><p>  Such bulbs were considered valuable discoveries, but their use was accompanied by great difficulties.  Platinum thread was an expensive pleasure, not everyone could afford to use such a lamp.  The coal rod was much cheaper, but for a long time it was not enough. </p>

    <h2>  Solid success </h2><p>  In 1854, the German watchmaker Heinrich Goebel creates a lamp with a thin carbon rod, which shines much longer than the previous ones.  This was achieved by the inventor by creating a vacuum.  Goebel‚Äôs lamp was undetected for a long time, and only years later it was declared the first bulb suitable for practical use (invalidating Edison‚Äôs patent). </p><p>  Joseph Swan, Alexander Lodygin worked on improving the mechanism.  The latter patents the invention of a ‚Äúfilament lamp‚Äù operating on a carbon rod in a vacuum.  In 1875, <span>Pavel Yablochkov</span> markedly distinguished himself by inventing ‚Äúelectric candles‚Äù.  The Russian engineer used a filament made of kaolin, which did not need a vacuum.  Yablochkov's lamps were used for street lighting and were widely used in Europe. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Mechanism improvement </h2><p>  The main direction has long been known.  A rod of a certain material is in a vacuum and is connected to an electric current.  It remained to choose the right material for the electrode, for a long glow. </p><p>  In 1878, Edison became interested in finding a successful solution for light bulbs.  The inventor acted by the method of practical tests: carbonized a lot of plants, substituted various materials as a filament.  After 6 thousand experiments, he manages to make a lamp from the coals of bamboo, which lasts 40 hours.  Edison's bulb begins to be mass-produced, displacing other lamps on the market.  In 1890, engineer Lodygin registered the use of a tungsten rod, and later sold a patent to General Electric. </p>

    <h2>  Merits of Edison </h2><p>  Being engaged in the development of the lamp, Edison understood that in addition to the choice of materials, the design of the mechanism is also important.  So, he invents a screw base, a <span>cartridge for a lamp,</span> creates fuses, counters, first switches, electric generators.  Many of the lighting components that Edison invented are standard and are still in use around the world. </p><p>  The inventor made light bulbs accessible to everyone.  To do this, he began to sell them at a lower price.  Edison's <span>light bulb</span> cost a little more than a dollar.  The plans of the entrepreneurial American were to make the invention so affordable that even wax candles would seem like luxury compared to it.  Fast automation of production allowed to reduce costs and at the same time produce a large amount of goods.  Soon, the cost of the lamp became about 22 cents.  The inventor's dream came true - light bulbs appeared in every home. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="edison light bulb photo" class="if" height="428" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/1324827.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Edison bulbs in the interior </h2><p>  Light bulbs are now commonplace.  They are affordable and quite convenient to use.  Moreover, many different types and models of lamps have appeared.  Their practical significance has faded into the background, now they have become an important addition to the home interior. </p><p>  "Edison's bulb" (see photo above) is the name of a certain <span>type of lamp.</span>  They are decorated in retro style and are similar to those used during the time of Thomas Edison.  Such lamps emit a soft pleasant light, look like a glass bulb or ball on a strong cord.  Edison's bulbs are often used to design public spaces - bars, cafes, or to design living rooms and bedrooms. </p>
