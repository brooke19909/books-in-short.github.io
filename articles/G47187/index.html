If a couple of years ago, companies tried to beat competitors in this matter, now they have begun to adhere to a certain technology in production, which has made all gadgets ‚Äúincubator‚Äù.  Huawei P8 Lite, reviews of which will be discussed below, is also not far from this tradition.  Nevertheless, he has his indisputable advantages.  In addition to the already standard two active SIM cards. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone huawei p8 lite black reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1010485.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  A few words about the company </h2><p>  Huawei Technologies Co Ltd was founded in 1988 in China.  And this is one of the largest multinational telecommunications supplier companies.  Many Russians still remember the landline phones of this company, which were very popular in the zero.  Today, Huawei is considered one of the most popular smartphone and tablet companies in the world.  And now, many prefer to purchase a Chinese smartphone from a trusted company at a stable and affordable price than overpay for the brand and name of the device. </p><h2>  About the P8 Lite Model </h2><p>  The average cost of this gadget on the Russian market is about 14-18 thousand rubles.  Today it can be safely called a budget model with flagship "manners."  Huawei P8 Lite, reviews about which are quite positive, is worth its money.  And there are several objective reasons for this, which we will discuss below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone huawei p8 lite reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1010484.jpg" width="600"></div>

The Huawei P8 Lite smartphone, reviews of which amaze with the number of admired epithets, looks stylish, fashionable and very solid.  The classic type of housing with a non-removable battery makes it convenient for daily use (there is no need to change the back panel when it is moving away and loosening).  Matte back cover does not slip in hands, imitates metal.  The chrome edging gives the appearance even greater solidity and style.  It is an ideal design gadget for a business person, whether a woman or a man. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone huawei p8 lite reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1010483.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  About screen </h2><p>  Huawei P8 Lite, whose screen reviews are only positive, is equipped with a ten-finger multi-touch.  A five-inch diagonal is already familiar in the modern world, so it looks appropriate in any hands.  The type of matrix is ‚Äã‚ÄãIPS with 16.78 million colors.  Pictures and photos look "incredibly cool", judging by the reviews of the owners.  By the way, Huawei P8 Lite, which reviews only the responsiveness of the sensor, has good viewing angles and brightness.  Therefore, on a sunny day, using a smartphone will not cause difficulties - everything is clearly visible and readable, you do not have to strain your eyes.  This is what bribes many buyers, because not all modern models of other manufacturers are equipped with such a good screen. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="huawei p8 lite white reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1010482.jpg"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Cameras: external and frontal </h2><p>  The Huawei P8 Lite phone, reviews of which in details will be a little lower, amazed many users with its cameras.  In particular, external.  Despite the fact that the model is considered budget, it removes no worse than the top flagship of the Samsung or iPhone.  An external camera shoots with a sharpness of 13 megapixels, but the Chinese manufacturer did not save on the matrix.  Shooting starts as quickly as possible.  Some users note that it is lightning fast.  The shooting has three modes (unexpected for a budget model): photo, video and ‚Äútime lapse‚Äù.  The latter is intended to capture some kind of quick moment.  For example, sunset on the horizon or a person jump.  The output is clear and vivid accelerated video clips (or ‚ÄúGIFs,‚Äù as computer users call them).  13 megapixels is a very standard indicator for modern smartphones, but the main quality still depends on the camera matrix.  And Huawei P8 Lite, the reviews of the owners of which are mostly positive, is equipped with a fairly high-quality module.  It is no worse than the original P8, although simplified.  There are fewer functions and ‚Äúchips‚Äù, but all this can be solved with a good photo editor.  The original pictures of the main camera still remain at their best even in the dark.  Macro shooting is also very high quality, without blur, autofocus is smooth and works stably.  <span>The</span> 5 megapixel <span>front camera</span> perfectly copes with selfies and video communications.  Although in low light the picture is still somewhat yellowish and blurry.  But this is also the name of famous brand flagships. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Communication standards </h2><p>  This is a sore point for many city dwellers, because 4G and LTE coverage areas are increasing every day, but not all smartphone manufacturers manage to keep track of this.  Fortunately, the Huawei P8 Lite Black smartphone, whose feedback on the quality of communication is approved, supports all modern standards: 2G, 3G, 4G, LTE, LTE-A Cat 4. Naturally, how stable the connection will work depends on how operator to use and in which coverage area to be.  Major cellular giants (Megafon, MTS, Beeline) are expanding the boundaries for new standards. </p><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  How well and gadget will work stably depends on it.  The described model is equipped with a new generation processor HiSilicon Kirin 620, 1.2 Hz.  And it is enough for the main tasks: phone mode, games, application health.  The latter, by the way, according to users, just "fly".  No lags, freezes and glitches were noticed even in multitasking mode (when <span>a</span> lot of applications work in the <span>background</span> ).  The smartphone fully justifies itself - it works clearly and stably, without causing discomfort to the user.  The eight-core processor, of course, in modern conditions is no longer surprising, but still happy.  For example, the most ‚Äúheavy‚Äù popular games (NFS, WOT and others) work even at maximum settings stably and without brakes.  Fresh ‚ÄúAndroid 5.1‚Äù allows you to plunge into the magical world of applications and toys to the fullest. </p><h2>  Memory: operational and primary </h2><p>  The Huawei P8 Lite Black smartphone, reviews of which is mostly positive, is very standard in this regard for 2015.  <span>External memory</span> is 16 GB, which is quite enough for games, and for applications, and for storing information.  If necessary, you can increase by using an SD card (micro) an additional 64 GB.  RAM is 2 GB.  And this, too, is enough for the full-fledged games and applications.  Even in multitasking, many applications work easily in the background.  The device does not slow down or fail, which is pleasant for users.  A smartphone replaces many other gadgets: on it you can listen to music, play, read, surf the Internet, communicate.  And all this works quickly and smoothly. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  "Android" devices have an unpleasant property - to "eat" the battery in large quantities.  And here, unfortunately, the Huawei P8 Lite Black, reviews of which are not very positive in this regard, remains in the red.  The 2200 mAh battery is not enough.  Light day, of course, the smartphone will work, but you have to deny yourself something.  On the other hand, many users note that with the correct calibration and run of several "discharge-charge" cycles, the gadget still does not require a constant location near the outlet.  But an additional power source (powerbank) is still better to purchase. </p><h2>  Color spectrum </h2><p>  The company released a smartphone in several colors: white, black, silver.  The "filling" is the same for everyone, but the appearance still looks different.  So, Huawei P8 Lite Black, reviews of which among men are the most positive by this criterion, is more suitable for the stronger sex.  He is more serious and brutal.  Silver color is considered neutral, so it will suit both ladies and young people.  But the white smartphone is just made for a female pen.  It is perfect, pleasant and very stylish even without additional accessories.  Huawei P8 Lite White, reviews about which are only pleasant among women, thanks to the plastic case is not easily soiled, remains white and clean for a long time even when used without a protective case. </p><h2>  Accessories </h2><p>  Chinese models are good because many companies quickly and massively begin to produce additional jewelry and accessories.  The almost flagship Huawei P8 Lite was no exception.  You can easily pick up the back panel with a fashionable design or print.  In addition, headsets and earphones also fit any with a 3.5 mm plug.  Girls especially like to pick up stylish and fashionable cases and phone covers that make the gadget even more interesting and beautiful. </p><h2>  Male look at a smartphone </h2><p>  Many representatives of the stronger sex, who often use the phone for "heavy" and serious games, were satisfied with the model.  They like high performance and stable performance.  Many solved the problem with a low-capacity battery due to a charging case and an external powerbank.  The appearance of the gadget in black liked most of the men, and some did not even immediately recognize the imitation of metal in the case. </p>

Some were pleased with both voice and gesture control, when you do not need to touch the smartphone at all.  We can safely say that the device is suitable for serious ladies and teenage girls who do not leave social networks day or night. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="huawei p8 lite reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1010487.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Brief conclusion </h2><p>  <span>Huawei Ascend P8</span> Lite, reviews about which are mostly positive, I liked both the girls and the guys.  It can be safely recommended to those who are looking for a reliable smartphone for everyday tasks for relatively little money.  And by the way, the gadget fully justifies them.  A fast and powerful processor ensures stable operation, and a high-quality camera allows you to take beautiful pictures at any time of the day and in any environment.  Active SIM cards work without interruption, one does not ‚Äújam‚Äù the other when making a call.  Therefore, a modern person can afford to combine work calls with personal ones right on one device without acquiring additional ones for himself.  Micro-size SIM cards are supported, for which you need to prepare in advance (although many operators have already switched to dual sim: those that you can choose by size yourself). </p>
