What is the history of the city?  What are the attractions in it? </p><h2>  Auschwitz </h2><p>  The city is located only 60 kilometers from Krakow.  It is located in the Auschwitz Lowland near the place where the Sola and Przempsz rivers flow into the Vistula.  This is a very small city in Poland, which sadly became famous throughout the world during the Second World War as Auschwitz.  Here was one of the largest concentration camps. </p><p>  Today, about 40 million people live in the city.  Modern Auschwitz is developing as a major commercial and industrial center of the country.  And the residents themselves focus on the Polish pronunciation of the name - ‚ÄúAuschwitz‚Äù, and not on the German ‚ÄúAuschwitz‚Äù, which recalls the tragic events of the past. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="coat of arms of auschwitz" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/1295004.jpg" width="477"></div>  The city has three official symbols: flag, coat of arms and emblem.  On the city flag is the image of the coat of arms on a blue background.  The coat of arms of Auschwitz depicts a tower with a scarlet roof and two eagles on each side.  The emblem of the city was made in 2002, it graphically depicts the figure of a dove - a symbol of peace and unity of all races.

    <h2>  History </h2><p>  This city in Poland appeared in the XII century, later it was almost completely destroyed.  In the XIII century, it was restored and immediately received the status of a city.  For Auschwitz there were constant disputes between the Czech Republic and Poland, since the city has long been a center for the sale of salt. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the 16th century, Jews began to inhabit it.  And a century later, the Polish king Vladislav IV gives them privileges for living: at home, the right to open a synagogue and the foundation of a cemetery.  By the beginning of the 20th century, Jews made up about 40% of the urban population. </p><p>  In the XVIII century, the city became part of the <span>Austrian Empire.</span>  He returned to Poland after the First World War.  During the Austrian rule, Auschwitz became a major railway junction, factories, schools, churches were built in it.  Part of the urban architecture of that time has survived to this day. </p>

    <p>  The city was liberated in 1945, and in 1947 the camp became a museum.  Auschwitz is now on the World Heritage List.  Museum organizers left barracks and barbed wire.  Different pavilions are dedicated to different nationalities.  Here are new installations, old photographs, clothes and other things of prisoners. </p><p>  In one of the pavilions behind the glass wall there are many shoes and shoes belonging to the prisoners of Auschwitz.  This spectacle will not stand everyone. </p><h2>  The city's attractions </h2><p>  Outside the camp-museum, life goes on.  Beyond the walls of the former camp is a completely different one - sweet and pleasant Auschwitz.  The sights of the city are typical European narrow streets and ancient architecture. </p><p>  The city has a castle built in the XII century.  It is the oldest building in Auschwitz.  The castle is located on a hill and is surrounded by dense trees.  During the attack of the Tatars, he was destroyed.  Prince Meshko II rebuilt it in the XII century, while surrounding it with fortified walls. </p><p>  Auschwitz houses several old churches.  For example, the Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary or the Church of the Nativity of the Virgin.  In the city center are the town hall and the market square.  Attention is also drawn to the chapel of St. Jack and the Church of Our Lady of Remembrance of the Faithful. </p><p>  Walking along the streets of Auschwitz, you can see many houses with quite interesting architecture.  Among other things, here is the home of Shimon Kluger - the last Jew who lived in this city.  Now in his house is a Jewish museum. </p><p>  Within the city there are a parish and a Jewish cemetery, as well as the Hebrew Jewish synagogue Lomdey Mishnaes, founded in 1918. </p>
