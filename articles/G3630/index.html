  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Yaroslav the Wise</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Prince Yaroslav the Wise (about 980-1054) was the son of Vladimir the First Svyatoslavovich and Princess Polotsk Rogneda.  His wife was the daughter of the King of Sweden, Olav Ingigerd (Irina in baptism). </p><p>  In adulthood, Yaroslav became the Prince of Rostov, and some time later (after Vysheslav died), the Prince of Novgorod. </p><p>  In 1015 (after the death of <span>Vladimir the First Svyatoslavovich)</span> the throne of Kiev was captured by the stepbrother of Yaroslav Svyatopolk the First Cursed.  According to one version, Svyatopolk, wanting to eliminate rivals, kills all brothers.  Yaroslav cannot be killed.  Sister Predslava warns him of danger.  According to another version, Yaroslav the Wise himself is responsible for the death of all brothers.  In 1015, in December, in the battle of Lyubech, Svyatopolk was defeated.  Yaroslav the Wise captured Kiev. </p><p>  However, in 1018, Svyatopolk again invaded Russian land.  In the battle of the Bug, Kiev was conquered.  Yaroslav the Wise fled to Novgorod.  From there, he intended to go to Scandinavia.  But the Novgorodians forced the prince to continue the battle.  In the battle of Alta, Svyatopolk was defeated.  Thus, Yaroslav the Wise again conquered Kiev. </p><p>  Another brother, Mstislav, claimed the throne of Kiev.  Yaroslav after the victory over Svyatopolk begins a new struggle.  In 1024, the battle of Foliage took place.  The victory in the battle was won by Mstislav.  However, Yaroslav was allowed to reign in Kiev.  Thus, the Old Russian state was divided between the brothers.  Yaroslav was transferred the territory from the Dnieper to the west, and Mstislav - to the east along with Chernigov.  He died in 1035 Mstislav.  From that moment on, Yaroslav became "autocratic" in Russia. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The activity of the ruler after the last battle near Listven was aimed mainly at enlightening and spreading Christianity in the country.  In 1036-37, on the orders of Prince Yaroslav, powerful fortresses were erected, the Golden Gate with the Church of the Annunciation was built.  In addition, the <span>church of St. Sophia</span> was founded <span>,</span> monasteries of <span>St. Irene</span> and <span>St.</span> George were built. </p><p>  In the <span>"Tale of Bygone Years"</span> there is a lot of information indicating the educational activities of the ruler.  Under Prince Yaroslav, many books were translated from Greek into Russian.  These works formed the basis of the library created in the church of Sofia.  The first legislative act in Russia was created by <span>Yaroslav the Wise.</span>  <span>"Russian truth"</span> has become the main source of economic, social, legal relations of the ancient Slavs. </p><p>  Around 1050, <span>Metropolitan of Kiev</span> Illarion was appointed - the first Russian metropolitan to defend the independence of the Russian diocese and independence from Constantinople. </p><p>  In the foreign policy sphere, the activity of the ruler was aimed at strengthening the position of the Old Russian state.  Vladimir the First Yaroslavovich, on the initiative of Yaroslav the Wise, launched a campaign of Russian troops in Byzantium in 1043, which ended in failure. </p><p>  It should be noted that the nickname "Wise" is attributed to Yaroslav for his educational and legislative activities within the country.  However, the ruler did a lot to strengthen the external relations of the state.  So, Yaroslav conducted a very wise "dynastic policy."  The marriages that were concluded by his children allowed Russia to become related to almost all of Europe.  This "dynastic policy" contributed to the development of the principality, new cities were founded in the state, trade flourished, cathedrals and monasteries were built.  Subsequently, this "dynastic policy" was legislated by <span>Alexander the First</span> Blessed.  According to the adopted decree of the Imperial House, <span>unequal marriages were</span> prohibited <span>.</span> </p><p>  According to some reports, the death of Yaroslav occurred in 1054, February 20.  The ruler bequeathed the throne to his son Izyaslav, who ruled in Novgorod. </p>
