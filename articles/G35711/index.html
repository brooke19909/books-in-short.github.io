    <p>  Holidays in Lankaran on the Caspian coast with black sand prevailing on the beaches, which have a healing peculiarity, is a coastal recreation area.  The gaftoninsky recreation area is a place with sanatoriums and magical hot springs - Istisu.  It is also interesting for tourists who are fond of ecotourism and those who are interested in attractions.  The Narimanabad zone, located on the Sara peninsula, attracts tourists with its transparency of the Caspian Sea and snow-white beaches. </p><p>  The resort city of Lankaran is a Muslim city, and therefore the beach areas are divided here: for men and for women.  The beaches themselves are not in open space, but surrounded by trees, creating a pleasant shade on hot days. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  The main historical sights of Lankaran include the Lankaran fortress, built in the 18th century, the Kichik-Bazar mosque, built in the 19th century, and the house of Mirahmad Khan. </p><p>  The fortress in Lankaran was one of the best in the Talysh Khanate.  It was an impressive fortress in size.  Huge stone walls, crowned with battlements, with tools mounted between them, large ditches, which during the defense were filled with water - all this had a frightening appearance for the enemies.  In 1812, Russian troops captured the fortress.  As a result, a peace treaty was signed. </p><p>  One of the current attractions of Lankaran in Azerbaijan (pictured below) is a samovar. </p>

    <p>  The city is famous for its tea, which is grown on local plantations.  Tourists can enjoy this wonderful drink, which is prepared in a samovar, as well as take a memory photo next to the huge samovar, which is installed on the Tea Square of the city. </p><h2>  House of Mirahmad Khan </h2><p>  Almost in the center of the city in 1913 the house of Mirahmad Khan was built.  It is considered to be a beautiful building, very similar to a palace.  An architect from France supervised the construction, but the elements decorating this house used the techniques of national decor.  During the construction, white and red bricks were used, and the entrance is decorated with animals of mythical origin.  What is noteworthy, this was the first multi-story building in Lankaran. </p><p>  No less interesting and somewhere sad is the history of the construction of this house.  Mirahmad Khan ordered its construction in honor of the victory of his wife in the contest of beauties of Transcaucasia.  The building was nationalized after the revolution, and the tragic fate befell the tenants themselves.  Currently, this house houses the local history museum, which contains valuable exhibits related to the history of the region. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lankaran city azerbaijan" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2083135.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Hanega </h2><p>  The sights of Lankaran include the cult Muslim complex - Hanega.  You can get into it by heading along the ancient road leading to Iran, walking along the Pirsagat River.  This is a well-preserved quadrangle of fortress walls with loopholes, hidden from the eyes of tourists.  Hanega is a monument of medieval architecture, decorated with ceramics and exquisite stone carvings.  It was built in the XII-XIV centuries, at a later time it was either completed or rebuilt.  It was such a beautiful building that the ruthless Mongols, who all swept away in their path, did not touch it.  Moreover, all the loot from this shrine was returned to the cult complex. </p><p>  The cult Muslim complex of Haneghi includes the tomb of Pir Hussein and the minaret.  The mosque was built in the middle of the XIII century from stone trimmed slabs and covered with a skillfully executed spherical dome.  The decoration is tiled carvings and ornaments around the perimeter of the octagonal trunk of the mosque's minaret.  The tomb is connected to the mosque.  The tombstone was once covered with ceramic tiles.  The main decoration of the tomb is a tiled 11-meter frieze.  This place is considered a shrine in the Muslim world.  The relics of the holy elder Pir-Hussein are stored here. </p>
