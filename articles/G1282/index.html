This is the story of the name of the city of San Francisco.  True, in addition to its official name, it is called the "city by the bay" and the "city of fogs."

Why do travelers from all over the world try to get to the island?  Perhaps this attraction is attractive due to its interesting, but rather gloomy history.  And tourists come to the island to personally see what Alcatraz was decades ago ... </p><p>  In the history of the city of San Forancisco, the fact of the construction of the first lighthouse of the West Coast in 1854 was noted.  And the place for him was determined on the island of Alcatraz (translated from Spanish "rock") in the bay of San Francisco, to direct the ships passing through the Golden Gate.  But not only the lighthouse was built on the island.  Government officials decided that the tiny island, nicknamed ‚ÄúThe Rock,‚Äù would be the perfect place for a federal penitentiary.  The rocky island was washed by dangerous currents, extreme tides, so it was impossible to escape from this prison.  The country's most famous bad guys were serving sentences in prison: Al Capone, George ‚ÄúMachine Gun‚Äù Kelly and ‚ÄúBird Man‚Äù Robert Stroud, a killer who was an expert in ornithological diseases. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.semestertimes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The fortress is located on the island" class="if uuid-2899490" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2899490.jpg"></div><p>  During a tour of Alcatraz, tourists can personally see how gloomy the life of prisoners in solitary confinement was.  Alcatraz may seem sinister from the inside, but tourists can enjoy dazzling views of San Francisco, the Golden Gate Bridge, the lush surroundings of marinas in the north and the neighboring Angel Island, as well as California State Park. </p><p>  San Francisco is one of the most iconic cities in the United States of America and, without a doubt, the most beautiful.  The combination of geography, nature, architecture and its diverse and cosmopolitan composition makes San Francisco a world-class city. </p>
