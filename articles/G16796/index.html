This is not surprising, because it usually takes a lot of time to get from one point to another.  Few people want to ride in a stuffy bus or hustle in the subway.  Not everyone can afford a new high-quality car.  In this case, people resort to a car loan service. </p><div class="photo" data-original="omg-event.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="RN Bank" class="if uuid-3165815" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3165815.jpg"></div><p>  A similar type of loan is issued today by almost every bank.  However, there are separate organizations that provide money on credit on more favorable terms.  For example, RN Bank can be attributed to them, reviews of car loans in which differ mainly in positive ratings.  This is primarily due to low interest rates and interesting programs for customers. </p><h2>  Affiliate program "Renault-Nissan" </h2><p>  Before considering reviews of car loans at RN Bank, it is worth paying attention to interesting information.  This financial institution is a partner of the Renault concern, which, as you know, owns Nissan production. </p><p>  It is not surprising that he provides the most favorable conditions for vehicles from these manufacturers.  The rates for the program can vary greatly depending on the specific model, as well as the down payment and the period for which the loan will be issued.  In addition, you need to consider the risks that the borrower will insure. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Features of lending </h2><p>  Reviews on car loans at RN Bank often say that not every car can be purchased in installments.  But if you choose one of the car dealership offers, you can save a lot. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.usinenouvelle.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Logos of cars" class="if uuid-3165818" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3165818.jpg"></div><p>  For example, in customer reviews, you can see that in some cases the overpayment is at all 0%.  This is because the bank periodically holds shares, according to which overpayment on the loan is not charged.  However, one must understand that in this case the nominal rate remains, which, as a rule, is slightly higher than when applying for another type of loan.  But, regardless of this, the buyer still gets a very nice discount, due to which the overpayment is almost equal to 0. </p><h2>  Features of a car loan at RN Bank </h2><p>  First of all, it is worth noting that this financial institution does not have its own branches and branches.  Accordingly, in order to get a loan, you must contact the seller in the salon, which will redirect the client to the loan specialist.  He will help fill out a questionnaire and get a response from the bank. </p><p>  If the user receives an approving response, then in this case a standard contract of sale is concluded.  Since, in order to receive a car loan from PH Bank, Casco is a compulsory service, then after this insurance is issued. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At the next stage, the happy owner of the car must make an initial payment and only after that draw up a loan agreement.  When all the formalities are completed, you can arrange the car for yourself and transfer it as a guarantee to a financial institution.  This does not mean that you cannot use the car.  Just the car owner does not have the right to sell this vehicle, as it is part of a contractual relationship. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rcibs.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Renault car" class="if uuid-3165811" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3165811.jpg"></div><p>  If we talk about vehicles, then it is worth paying attention that for each brand of machine its own conditions are developed.  Therefore, taking part in such an affiliate program, you should first study all the subtleties of processing credit relations and other conditions. </p><h2>  Features of lending </h2><p>  As a rule, when applying, the client can count on up to 4.5 million rubles.  At the same time, a loan is issued for a period of up to 7 years, and the interest rate can be 0% if you successfully get into the stock.  However, even if the overpayment is supposed, then, as a rule, it does not exceed 12% per annum. </p><h2>  What documents will be required </h2><p>  According to reviews of car loans at RN Bank, no additional securities are required.  First of all, you need a passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation and proof of income in the form of an appropriate certificate. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.affiliatedhomes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Zero percent" class="if uuid-3165837" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3165837.jpg"></div><p>  Sometimes managers are asked to provide an additional work book or a photocopy of its pages.  SNILS will also be required, and if a person has performed military service, then documents confirming this.  Separately, it is worth considering the existing programs and tariffs for new customers. </p><h2>  Renault Credit </h2><p>  Under this program, lending conditions may vary, unlike a particular machine model.  The size of the loan will be influenced by numerous factors, for example, the class of the vehicle, how much it is in demand and popularity at the moment.  If a car is not in great demand or, for example, it has gone out of fashion for several years, then in this case very often the bank does not charge any overpayment and provides customers with an interest-free loan. </p><p>  However, in this case we are talking about a specific configuration of vehicles, which usually do not include any additional devices.  If the buyer wants to connect additional options that are very different from the standard package, then in this case the loan rate changes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.earnacar.co.za" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Credit purchase" class="if uuid-3165827" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3165827.jpg"></div><p>  For example, if you apply for a car loan at Renault-Logan, then the overpayment will be 7.9%, and the lending period reaches 5 years.  In this case, the down payment must be at least 30%.  If the client wants to deposit a minimum amount, which will be equal to 10 percent, then in this case, you can purchase another model.  But then the interest rate will be increased to 10.9.  In addition, the minimum loan amount and many other conditions are taken into account.  But still, many in their reviews write that the car is cheaper.  At the same time, the client can always take advantage of the early repayment of a car loan at RN Bank. </p><h2>  Nissan Finance </h2><p>  In this case, special offers apply.  For example, if cars that are in high demand.  Suppose a customer decides to purchase a Teana model.  It gives out money on credit for up to 3 years. </p><p>  The most pleasant feature of this loan is that if the client manages to deposit funds for 3 years, then in this case no overpayment is implied.  It is also worth paying attention to the minimum overpayment rate.  It can be obtained if you make immediately 50% of the total cost of the vehicle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="automobile-credit.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nissan Program" class="if uuid-3165816" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3165816.jpg"></div><h2>  Datsun finance </h2><p>  Another interesting offer from the bank. </p><p>  This vehicle is in demand and is very popular with consumers.  Even without a loan, its cost is low, and the characteristics of the car are excellent. </p><p>  In this case, the financial institution offers two options for lending to choose from.  The client can use the basic or special program.  In the first case, it is understood that the vehicle equipment will be minimal.  But the percentage of overpayments will be an order of magnitude lower.  In the second case, the client can choose additional options and include them in the total loan amount.  Most car owners prefer this particular option. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.datsun.co.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nissan car" class="if uuid-3165823" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3165823.jpg"></div><h2>  RN Bank: early repayment of a car loan </h2><p>  Like most bank loans, such lending involves the payment of the full amount until the end of the contract.  But in this case, you need to pay attention to several nuances. </p><p>  If we consider the reviews on the early repayment of a car loan at RN Bank, then it is worth paying attention that this procedure can also be performed online.  Although the official portal of a financial institution does not allow you to arrange an initial loan online, this does not apply to contractual contributions.  Therefore, you can repay the loan without leaving your home. </p><p>  If we talk about how to early repay a car loan at RN Bank, then first of all, you need to notify the employee of the financial organization of his intention in 30 days.  To do this, you can use the feedback on the bank's website.  After drawing up the relevant application, the borrower receives an SMS with data on the amount that he must pay in order to close the loan. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  If we consider the reviews on car loans at RN Bank, we can see that lending is provided not only for the purchase of new cars, but also for any products that were released by the company.  At the same time, a separate tariff plan is provided, according to which, again, there will be rather low interest. </p><p>  In general, the bank's customers are very satisfied with the services provided.  They note that such loans are much more profitable than standard lending at any other bank.  Many also note that applications are processed quickly, and the rejection rate is very low.  Therefore, to get a car is obtained on more favorable terms. </p>
