That is why, despite some of the shortcomings, many vacationers praise Muses 3. <span>Greece, Rhodes,</span> about (the reviews about this resort are generally wonderful) of which a lot has been written on the net - the island is really picturesque and comfortable to relax.  Hotel Muses 3 of all the budget available here is considered almost the best.  For an economical vacation, most Russian tourists consider it a place just perfect. </p><p>  Some Russians even write in searches in search engines when searching for housing in Rhodes "Hotel Muses 4 * (Faliraki, Greece): description".  The fact is that many tourists who have ever visited this hotel believe that its service and infrastructure can be attributed to four stars.  Three-star here, in fact, are only the rooms themselves.  The rooms in this hotel are quite comfortable.  But at the same time there are not too good reviews about the rooms.  For example, some guests get rooms with broken furniture or even an unfinished ceiling.  In the basement, however, the rooms are completely, as already mentioned, raw.  Some guests also believe that the rooms in this hotel, and especially for three people, are a bit cramped.  But be that as it may, in general, the Muses Hotel 3 * hotel is considered by tourists as a place quite worthy and suitable for a comfortable stay. </p>
