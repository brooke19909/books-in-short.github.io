    <p>  Thus, Tsarina <span>Elizaveta Petrovna</span> received <span>absolute power,</span> she began such an idle and even cheeky life close to her soul.  The latter characteristic is explained by her frivolity when choosing a spouse.  At her whim, the Ukrainian Cossack became the spouse of the queen herself, and secretly.  Such an act is already creating good soil for reducing confidence in this person. </p><p>  During her reign, Elizaveta Petrovna, whose rule was not entirely legal, was forced to decide to return to the methodology of leading the country of Peter the Great.  A significant role in the development of the state was played by <span>Count Shuvalov.</span>  It was thanks to him that the reign of Elizabeth Petrovna became associated with the abolition of customs within the country. </p>

    <p>  She is also considered the founder of the first banks in Russia.  But this is not all, because it is precisely the reign of Elizabeth Petrovna that is associated with numerous reforms in taxation, as well as with a bright leap forward in the development of <span>heavy industry.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  All the reforms that took place during this period had a favorable effect on the general situation in the country.  Perhaps development would have moved to a higher level, but the Seven Years War slowed it down. </p><p>  As for foreign policy, the reign of Elizabeth Petrovna made a considerable contribution to its development.  During this period, a <span>peace treaty</span> was signed with the Swedes.  called Abossky.  But because of the desire of Bestuzhev-Ryumin <span>to establish relations</span> with Austria, Russia became a participant in the Seven Years War, and even if it showed good results and won in many battles, this affected the well-being of the country negatively. </p>

    <p>  As for personal characteristics, the queen, despite some of her shortcomings, had a lot of advantages.  These include her mind, which helped to choose the right tactics in a real situation.  In addition, she knew perfectly how to behave with courtiers.  But all its positive qualities were applied only at the household level, and they did not extend to state affairs.  In this regard, if necessary, make a decision, she simply put it aside or put it on the shoulders of her confidants. </p><p>  It is worth noting another important feature that influenced the reign of Elizabeth Petrovna.  There was not a single death penalty during this period.  The thing is that the queen was deeply religious and made a vow, thanks to which she saved the lives of many people. </p><p>  If we consider this period on a national scale, then we can note stability and a certain economic growth, an improvement in the positions held by state power in Russia.  It was thanks to the correct understanding of the situation on the part of Elizaveta Petrovna that the Petrine reforms were continued, and her rule did not become destructive for the state as a whole. </p>
