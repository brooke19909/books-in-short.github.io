  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Plasticine rocket: modeling with children of different ages</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The program for educating children in preschool institutions is currently noticeably complicated.  Young students are offered new interesting knowledge and tasks.  Modern kids can memorize and absorb a greater amount of information, so from the older group of MDOU they are offered to study the topic "Outer Space".  Pupils learn the names of the great astronauts, get acquainted with the solar system and its elements.  For better assimilation of the material, productive activity is also needed: drawings, modeling, applications from various materials.  In this article, we will look at how to mold a plasticine rocket with children. </p><h2>  Modeling rockets with children of the younger group </h2><p>  Working with plastic materials is very useful for children of three years.  She develops fine motor skills, which contributes to the development of speech.  In addition, the development of the imagination is useful for kids. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="plasticine rocket" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/1378780.jpg" width="400"></div>  Children of the younger group imagine what the rocket looks like, but it would be useful to conduct a preliminary orientation session and describe it in general terms.  Before sculpting, discuss the size and color of the craft with your child.  Modeling a plasticine rocket begins with a warm up of the material.  The baby should turn the heated piece into a ball, then gradually flatten it into a cylinder.  Then a child rolls a ball from a piece of a different color, turns it into a cone and connects the parts.  To show the booster block, we sculpt three small sausages similar to a cone and attach to the body.  We cut a ball of red plasticine with a stack - this is fire.  The windows remain.  Their child can sculpt out of plasticine (flattened circles).  Buttons can be attached to the place of windows, which looks very interesting.  Help the baby at all stages of work, if necessary.

Take a cardboard lid from a box of chocolates or shoes.  Paint it inside with black gouache.  Then use the old toothbrush to spray the yellow paint on the background (the brush and paint should be dry). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to mold a plasticine rocket" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/1378781.jpg" width="554"></div>  You got outer space.  Now we sculpt a rocket from plasticine.  Prepare 4 balls (one of them is large).  Form a cone from a ball.  This is the rocket body and nozzles, connect them.  A yellow circle of plasticine will become a porthole.  Place the rocket in the cardboard blank.

    <h2>  How to fill cardboard outer space? </h2><p>  When a plasticine rocket is placed in a cardboard base, turn on the fantasy with the children.  What can be put there?  Mix a little blue and green plasticine, form a ball - planet Earth is ready!  Roll small balls from yellow plasticine, give them the shape of rhombuses - these are stars in the sky.  Roll the ball out of white plasticine.  Decorate with windows of any color and stick four toothpicks - this is a space satellite.  This composition is easy to perform and very happy for children. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Modeling rockets with children of senior and preparatory groups </h2><p>  With older children, a plasticine rocket can also be made using other materials, such as foil.  Pupils of MDOU, starting from the age of 6, strive to make their creations as plausible as possible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="plasticine rocket modeling" class="if" height="408" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/1378790.jpg" width="600"></div>  The layout of the foil and plasticine is very similar to the original.  First you need to dazzle a large cone.  By the way, a very simple and quick way to do this is to sculpt the sausage by pressing only on one edge.  The excess is simply cut off by the stack.  Thin foil must carefully wrap the case.  Now the rocket shines beautifully and mysteriously, resembling a real one.  We sculpt the nozzle cones, which can also be wrapped with foil.  We attach to the case of the window.  Now we sculpt a thin but long sausage of a contrasting color and wrap the body of our work with it.  Plasticine rocket is ready!  Such classes are very useful not only in developing finger motility and imagination, but also in gaining new interesting knowledge about the world around us.

    <h2>  Application from plasticine "Rocket" </h2><p>  Take a disposable plate and make a background, smearing the heated plasticine in black on its surface.  Roll brightly colored plasticine into a cake and use a pair of scissors or stacks to cut the outline of the rocket.  You can also roll plasticine into a ball, turn into a cone and flatten.  Then flatten the two triangles.  Attach the finished rocket to the background. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sculpt a plasticine rocket" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/1378794.jpg" width="600"></div>  Then flatten the two window balls and glue them to the rocket.  Make fire from red plasticine (this can be done either from a single piece, or from several rolled sausages).  It remains to decorate the background at your discretion: attach stars, planets or even comets here.  Now you know how to make a plasticine rocket with children of different ages.

    <h2>  New ideas </h2><p>  Children love plasticine modeling classes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a plasticine rocket" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/1378782.jpg" width="600"></div>  She develops imagination, logic, and crafts always turn out beautiful and bright.  If your plasticine is of good quality, then with a careful attitude, the craft can please you for a long time.  You can use hardening mass for modeling, but this is already more expensive pleasure.

    <p>  Now you know how to mold a rocket from plasticine, but if you want to make it even more like a real one, then glue it with screws, bolts, nuts.  Especially this work will be appreciated by the boys. </p><p>  If you want a large-sized rocket, make a cardboard model.  Glue the cone from the sheet and coat with plasticine.  You can use anything you want: a capsule from a chocolate egg, an empty tube from glue stick, and so on.  It is only in your imagination. </p>
