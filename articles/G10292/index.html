So, tourists were satisfied with their choice and are ready to recommend the hotel to all friends and acquaintances.  Some travelers even come here not for the first time.  But we learn more about everything. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Housing stock </h2><p>  Based on the comments they left, our compatriots were satisfied in most cases with accommodation at the Three Trang Beach Resort Hotel.  So, according to them, of course, it is best to ask you to settle in a room with a view of the bay.  For this, most likely, you will have to pay extra.  However, the view from the windows of other apartments is also pretty.  As for the rooms themselves, they are quite spacious, bright, decorated in a pleasant style.  However, travelers believe that the furniture and appliances here, although very high quality, are far from new and will soon require replacement.  Loved the guests large king size beds.  An absolute plus of Tri Trang Beach Resort 4 * (Phuket, Thailand), tourists call the availability of free wireless Internet in the apartments and throughout the hotel.  Moreover, the connection speed is quite high, so that guests without problems shared photos with their friends and relatives, could check their emails and use Skype, Viber and other instant messengers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tri trang beach resort 4 phuket" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1069377.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Cleaning </h2><p>  There were no complaints about the quality of the work of the maids by our compatriots.  So, a thorough cleaning of the rooms is carried out every day.  The maids will change the towels if you drop the used ones onto the floor.  Bed linen is updated a couple of times a week.  In addition, as spending the maids will replenish the supplies of bottled drinking water in the minibar, tea bags and coffee and personal hygiene products (shampoo, soap, shower gel, etc.).  According to many guests, for the excellent work of the maids it is not a pity to leave them a little tip. </p><h2>  Check in, departure </h2><p>  According to travelers, accommodation of guests who have just arrived by their proper rooms at Tri Trang Beach Resort 4 * (Phuket) starts at 2 p.m.  This is due to the fact that the maids need to clean and prepare the rooms just released by previous guests of the hotel.  However, regardless of the time you arrive at the Three Trang Beach, you can use its entire infrastructure.  So, waiting for the keys to the room, you can go to a restaurant, bar, pool or immediately to the beach.  In addition, our compatriots note that upon arrival at the hotel you will be offered soft drinks and wet towels, which helps to freshen up the road. </p><p>  As for the last day of your stay at the hotel, the occupied room should be vacated before noon.  If you plan to leave the hotel later, then if you have free apartments, you can extend your stay.  The reception should be notified in advance about your desire. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thailand tri trang beach resort 4" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1069378.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Hotel Tri Trang Beach Resort 4 * (Phuket, Thailand) offers guests several options for catering: all-inclusive, only breakfast or half board.  Everything will depend on your preferences here.  So, tourists who prefer to spend most of their holidays on the territory of the hotel complex chose the ‚Äúol inclusive‚Äù familiar to many of our compatriots.  This concept allows you not only to eat all day at the Three Trang restaurant, but also to have a drink at the bar.  Those travelers who often try to get outside the hotel, going on sightseeing, long excursions, shopping, etc., prefer to pay only for breakfast at the hotel.  This allows them not to be, as they say, tied to the hotel in terms of food.  In addition, in this case, tourists have the opportunity to try a variety of dishes offered both in restaurants located in the neighborhood, and in other places. </p>

    <p>  By the way, even if you do not live according to the "ol inclusive" system, you have the opportunity to eat in the restaurant "Three Trang Beach Resort".  Just in this case, you will have to pay separately for all lunches and dinners.  I must say that our compatriots were very pleased with the level of <span>catering at the hotel</span> .  According to them, the choice of dishes here is very diverse, and at the same time, the cooks prepare very tasty.  In addition, in the restaurant you can taste not only Thai dishes, but also more familiar dishes. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  The choice of many tourists fell on Tri Trang Beach Resort 4 *, the reviews we are reviewing, and for the reason that this hotel has its own magnificent beach.  It is located, according to the guests, right behind the restaurant.  So you can go to the beach right after breakfast.  There are very few people here, so everyone can comfortably sit on comfortable deck chairs with mattresses.  A great plus for travelers is also the fact that in this place there are almost no winds, and accordingly, waves.  Therefore, it is very comfortable for families with small children to relax.  Entry into the water, according to tourists, is sandy and fairly gentle.  However, during low tide you can step on sharp dead corals, so it‚Äôs still recommended that you go swimming in special rubber shoes so as not to damage your legs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel tri trang beach resort 4 phuket" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1069380.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  According to tourists, the hotel "Three Trang Beach Resort" is perfect for a quiet measured pastime.  However, the hotel management took care of the entertainment component of the guests' rest.  So, a team of animators works here day and night.  They offer everyone to play volleyball on the beach, do yoga, gymnastics, water aerobics, and participate in fun contests.  In the evenings, a disco is held several times a week on the beach, which was enjoyed by guests of various age groups.  Karaoke is also available.  The hotel's restaurant serves live music during dinner. </p><h2>  Staff </h2><p>  The staff of the Three Trang Beach Resort left our compatriots with an exceptionally favorable impression.  According to the guests, the staff here perfectly copes with their duties.  In addition, the hotel employees are always smiling, polite, welcoming and attentive to guests.  But practically no one speaks Russian here, although many employees understand the basic phrases.  If you feel that you do not have enough English to explain yourself, then you can ask to call a Russian-speaking administrator at the reception.  He will help you solve any problem. </p>
