I would like to note that it immediately included three smartphones, the difference between which is not only in the indices (Asus ZenFone 2 ZE550ML, ZE551ML and ZE500CL), but also in the technical parameters of each.  However, outwardly, the changes are not so significant - all three devices have a similar design and similar constituent materials of which the body is made. </p><p>  In this article, we will consider one of the phones that was presented by the company at the CES 2015 conference, and this will be the ZE550ML model. </p><p>  To begin with, we learn what the device is characterized by, what it represents in the scale of Asus products and how it can attract a buyer. </p><h2>  general characteristics </h2><p>  <span>Smartphone Asus</span> ZenFone 2 ZE550ML (16Gb) is presented in the form of a budget, stylish, multi-functional phone, made at a high quality level.  Its value is three hundred dollars.  At the same time, it has 2 GB of RAM, a powerful battery and camera, a colorful display and an attractive appearance. </p>

    <p>  Analyzing the advantages of the device, it can be considered that the smartphone is successfully trying to be pleasing in several criteria at once in order to win the largest possible market share. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Is the phone in question really good?  Let's find it out together! </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The device is offered in a simple but cute box made of cardboard, painted white.  On top of the image is the telephone, as well as the company logo of the developer and a number of technical parameters. </p><p>  In a package with a smartphone, the manufacturer offered an original headset for hands-free conversations and listening to audio, as well as a charger consisting of a cord for connecting to a PC and an adapter.  It works on the basis of QuickCharge technology.  What this means and what is its feature, we will write a little further.  Also, in addition to the indicated, we managed to find instructions for working with it in the box with the phone and, of course, the device itself. </p>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The design of all smartphones in the ZenFone 2 line is identical.  The back cover of the device covers most of the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe phone;  in its form, it has smoothed corners, and in texture it is made of soft matte plastic, or, as an alternative, from plastic stylized as metal.  The buyer can try both options, since the covers on the phone are easily replaced and, in addition, are on sale in a wide range. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The front of the phone is represented by a wide screen, occupying about 72 percent of the area, which is limited by thin frames on the sides.  The upper and lower frames are wider.  On the first, there was a place for the logo of the manufacturer and the front camera, and on the second there is a decorative iridescent plate.  Directly above it are the touch system keys. </p><p>  Originally, the manufacturer approached the placement of navigation elements of the device.  So, Asus ZenFone 2 ZE550ML (16-gigabyte version) has a ‚Äúrocker‚Äù of volume, which is not on the side (as is common with many developers), but on the back cover.  Users call this decision either disastrous or mega-successful, depending on their own preferences. </p><p>  The dimensions of the device seem more compact due to its curved shape.  As a result of its application, the smartphone at the edges looks thinner than in its central part. </p><h2>  Screen </h2>

    <p>  The Asus ZenFone 2 ZE550ML features a 5.5-inch display capable of broadcasting FullHD images.  Resolution (and, as a result, image density) is not the highest here - it is 1280 by 720 pixels.  In the reviews, buyers indicate that it is very easy to notice the grain of the screen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In other parameters, the Asus ZenFone 2 ZE550ML display (the review proved it to us) does not lag behind - there is a good <span>oleophobic coating that</span> makes the glass smoother so that there are no fingerprints left on it.  The developers did not forget about the protection, putting <span>Gorilla Glass</span> 3 on the smartphone, which makes it possible to talk about the stability of the gadget to physical factors.  The brightness of the phone‚Äôs display allows you to comfortably interact with it even in sunny weather, without worrying about the illuminated picture. </p><p>  Another factor is viewing angles, and they also deserve all praise.  In practice, it looks like this: no matter how you turn the device, the picture retains its colors. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  At the time of the release of Asus ZenFone 2 ZE550ML, the current version was Android 5.0, which is also called Lollipop.  Now, probably, the user is available an ‚Äúair‚Äù update to a new modification (at the time of writing this review is 6.0).  However, visually there is not much left from the native OS on the phone: the model operates under the control of the individually developed ZenUI graphical shell.  It differs from simple Android in that some graphic elements are processed here, although everything is done in the same Flat Design style, where bright colors and flat images prevail.  However, this is not so important - as practice shows, any interface can become familiar quickly enough, and the user simply creates a habit of how everything is located. </p><p>  The speed of the system, according to some tests, is quite high - the smartphone responds quickly to any touch. </p>

    <h2>  CPU </h2><p>  The Asus ZenFone 2 ZE550ML has a quad-core ‚Äúheart‚Äù Intel <span>Atom Z3560, the</span> core frequency of which is 1.8 GHz.  It works in tandem with the PowerVR G6403 graphics engine.  There is also 2 GB of RAM. </p><p>  If you are not told anything about the speed of the smartphone, its technical indicators are simpler: in practice, the phone has high performance.  As tests have shown, it can run bulky (in terms of graphics) games without delays and braking.  <span>Looking at the Asus ZenFone 2 ZE550ML reviews,</span> you can draw the same conclusion. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  Speaking about physical memory, it should be noted the choice provided by the manufacturer between smartphones with 16, 32 and 64 GB.  Of course, the latest version is the most expensive.  At the same time, each of them has a slot for a memory card, which allows expanding the disk space for loading additional data. </p><p>  Asus, in addition to the map and internal space, also provides the opportunity to use its cloud storage.  To do this, you will need to log in to a special service using the main account.  After the user will be available 5 GB of memory. </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  On the Asus ZenFone 2 ZE550ML smartphone there are two cameras installed - with a resolution of 13 and 5 megapixels.  To take pictures using the main, rear, camera, the phone has a dual flash.  Also, the quality of images is adjusted by a special system add-in called PixelMaster.  This is an option which, according to the developers, assures a significant increase in image accuracy. </p><p>  You can create photos in two modes - ‚ÄúAuto‚Äù and ‚ÄúPro‚Äù.  The first provides for a minimum of options for settings and, accordingly, greater intervention ‚Äùin the selection of image parameters from the smartphone.  The second allows the user to independently choose which options he wants to connect when creating a photo. </p><p>  If you are guided in what parameters should be selected in certain lighting conditions, then, playing with them, you can find the ideal ratio for the most successful shot. </p><p>  To improve the quality of photos on the Asus ZenFone 2 ZE550ML (16Gb) there is HDR technology.  It implies the creation of a series of images, which, as a result of processing, are glued together into one by choosing the most successful photo section.  As a rule, at the same time, it is possible to achieve better illumination of individual areas of the photo. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The device has a relatively high autonomy due to a large battery with a capacity of 3000 mAh.  In addition, special attention should be paid to the charger, which is included in the kit, using Quickcharge technology.  It implies a charge recovery from 0% to 60% in just 39 minutes of connecting to the network.  This is useful if, for example, you are in a hurry on the road or at some event where you will not be able to additionally charge your device. </p><p>  True, the disadvantage of such a large battery is its large weight, which is added to the device and makes it less comfortable to use. </p><h2>  Communication </h2>

    <p>  The phone supports two SIM cards, the slots for which are located under the back cover.  Removing it and rearranging cards is easy enough.  For help in this, you will not need to turn to additional tools such as needles, nails and other things that are so often used. </p><p>  Asus ZenFone 2 ZE550ML 16Gb smartphone has all the possible communication options.  Of course, first of all, it is a GSM module for working in networks of 2G / 3G / LTE formats.  Another device is able to support navigation using satellite systems GPS, A-GPS and GLONASS. </p><p>  Also, Bluetooth, WiFi and NFC systems are used for data transfer.  Using the latter, you can charge your smartphone without using a classic adapter with a cord, as well as pay in special terminals contactlessly. </p><h2>  Accessories </h2><p>  In addition to the characteristics of the device, I would also like to note a number of specialized accessories released specifically for the presentation of the model.  These include a portable charger, a stand for a smartphone and an original case-cover. </p><p>  Portable charging (ZenPower) is a battery with a capacity of 10 thousand mAh, capable of replenishing the smartphone‚Äôs battery three times.  The case of the device is made of metal, pleasant to the touch.  It also looks quite attractive, thanks to its ‚Äúbronze metallic‚Äù surface and rounded edges.  The accessory has a rectangular shape, and due to its compactness it easily fits in the pocket of a bag. </p><p>  Another manufacturer introduced a special stand that allows you to fix the phone during charging.  It consists of two parts (‚Äúhalves‚Äù), which are held together by a magnet.  With their help, the phone, as the battery is charging, can be installed in any position that will be convenient for work. </p><p>  The case is also designed specifically for the <span>Asus ZenFone 2 ZE550ML.</span>  <span>Reviews</span> indicate that it is made of coarse material, which has a surface that is comfortable to hold in your hands.  On the cover of the case there is a rounded hole through which all system information from the display of the device is visible.  The back case for Asus ZenFone 2 ZE550ML (ZE551ML) has the same hole for the camera.  He has a pretty appearance. </p>

    <p>  Of course, Asus has other accessories that are not included in the presentation.  For example, this is an additional flash that makes pictures in low light brighter and more saturated.  It attaches the same way as the iBlazr into the charging hole. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Customer recommendations regarding the Asus ZenFone 2 ZE550ML (16 GB) are mostly positive in color.  People who have acquired the device and have experience working with it, note that the gadget is really good in everything - it has an attractive appearance, high-quality assembly, a powerful battery.  Separately, it is possible to note the presence of a wide range of original and affordable add-ons for the model, which can also be purchased at Asus stores.  But there are also some disadvantages. </p><p>  In particular, they include the quality of images.  According to some buyers, they are not performed at such a high level, as might be expected when studying the technical features of the device.  Another example of a flaw is the unusual placement of navigation.  As already noted, the volume key is located on the back cover.  In addition, the screen lock button is located on the upper edge of the Asus ZenFone 2 ZE550ML.  Its black color can be seen in photographs of the dark version of the device.  People note that reaching for it is not always convenient, especially considering the dimensions of the model‚Äôs screen. </p><p>  There are still complaints about the power consumption of the device.  Like, if you do not adjust the charge, the phone will consume too much, because of which the battery will drain in a matter of hours.  The problem is solved by deepening the settings and choosing the right options. </p><p>  Of course, there are other negative characteristics of the phone, including feedback that the device periodically loses connection, the external speaker may fail, or, for example, a poor-quality case for Asus ZenFone 2 ZE550ML.  All this, of course, can happen both due to factory defects, and due to unlucky coincidence, therefore, perhaps the model should not be blamed for this design.  And such reviews are not so massive as to seriously talk about them. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  What can be said about the model that we described in detail in today's review?  Initially, at its cost, it is positioned by the developer as a budget.  With such a price, the phone can really find demand among a wide audience of customers, but, unfortunately, not in Russia.  If our model in the maximum configuration will cost about 21 thousand rubles (because of the course), then we can‚Äôt talk about its availability. </p><p>  In general, this is a laudable device.  He cannot cause any serious complaints and criticism, and in general it can be noted that he is endowed with quite solid characteristics and capabilities.  If you are looking for such a device and at the same time do not experience discomfort due to the location of the buttons, then ZenFone 2 will be a great choice. </p>
