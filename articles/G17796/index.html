    <p>  A playground, a special menu for children, a mini-water park with safe slides, children's shows, games, contests and animation - if you need everything together, then you should choose the Kaliakra 4 * hotel.  Albena (Bulgaria) offers many options for families with children.  But it is the Hotel Kaliakra that is in constant demand by holidaymakers.  This is absolutely understandable.  A high-ranking hotel that has not changed for years values ‚Äã‚Äãits reputation.  Convenient location on the beach, excellent service and the concept of food "ultra all inclusive" give a wonderful vacation experience not only to children, but also to their parents in the resort of Albena (Bulgaria).  Hotels (reviews of parents say this) give such rest and recovery to kids that during the year you can forget about colds.  Especially if hotels specialize in wellness programs.  Accommodation at the Kaliakra hotel will cost guests about 5 thousand rubles per night. </p><h2>  Reasonably priced quality </h2><p><strong> </strong>  Relax quality, but at a reasonable price - this opportunity gives Bulgaria.  Hotel (Albena) can be selected at a distance from the sea.  You can walk through the park 750 meters to it, or use the free shuttle shuttle every half hour from the hotel to the beach.  In this category, the hotel "Magnolia" should be allocated. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bulgaria hotel magnolia albena" class="if" height="228" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/563640.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Bulgaria can also offer a three-star option with quality service, a swimming pool, animation and all-inclusive meals.  Hotel Magnolia (Albena) makes family vacations affordable.  Accommodation in one room for two adults will cost from 3 thousand rubles.  When placing in a double room, the first child under 12 years old is free of charge, for the second 30% of the cost of living an adult in the main place is paid.  Nearby is Luna Park.  All this makes a family trip on vacation a quality trip at a reasonable price. </p><h2>  Rest in the hotel complex "Laguna Beach" </h2>

    <p>  Another option for a quality family holiday with children is the Laguna Hotel.  Albena (Bulgaria) provides an excellent opportunity to choose one of the three accommodation options in the hotel complex, and you can use the entire infrastructure.  This is perfect for those who prefer a large hotel area.  The buildings ‚ÄúLaguna Beach‚Äù, ‚ÄúLaguna Garden‚Äù and ‚ÄúLaguna Mare‚Äù are modern seven-story buildings with a large number (up to 700) of rooms.  The Laguna Beach building is located on the first coastal line, the other two in the park area.  All cases according to their service belong to 4 *.  Hotels (Albena, Bulgaria) comply with European standards.  And this means that the rooms in the buildings have everything you need for the declared level. </p><h2>  Prices for holidays in Albena </h2><p>  Comparing the cost of holidays in Asia and Europe, beach lovers often make the choice not in favor of the latter.  Affects the high cost of the European direction.  It should be noted that this is not a completely justified comparison. </p>

    <p>  Bulgaria is interesting for those who combine relaxation and knowledge.  You need to relax in Bulgaria, not limited to the hotel and even the resort.  A completely safe and comfortable trip will be provided by the country of Bulgaria.  Hotel (Albena), the level of which is above 4 stars, always offers excursion programs and forms an attractive holiday picture for tourists.  Excursions in Bulgaria are a separate topic for discussion.  The whole spirit of the people is permeated with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe struggle for their freedom and independence.  This is also transmitted in the song, national Bulgarian music.  Such a rich land has always been a tidbit for the conquerors.  And the Bulgarians have been forced to conquer their "place in the sun" for centuries.  Bulgaria is interesting and unique in its national idea. </p><h2>  Albena <span>(Bulgaria) Hotels:</span> reviews of resort guests </h2><p>  Bulgaria is a country that has something to share with guests.  She is rich in her traditions.  Open-air city museums, folklore, crafts, monasteries, churches and fortresses - all this creates such a unique color scheme that rest is remembered for a long time.  And I want to return again to the hearty Bulgarians for a tasting of their unique national dishes and strong drinks.  Tourists say that it‚Äôs worth trying the national soup tarator, baked ingots, lutenitz, Bulgarian bread, <span>cheese cakes</span> and, of course, onion (raw smoked meat).  All meals can be found in taverns at a resort like Albena.  Bulgaria, whose hotels abundantly present national dishes, is a gourmet paradise. </p>
