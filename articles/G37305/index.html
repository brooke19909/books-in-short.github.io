    <h2>  About the nature of the surroundings </h2><p>  The mountains of Arkhyz are majestic and fabulously beautiful.  Lake of Love and other magnificent natural attractions attract tourists here - lovers of a romantic form of relaxation.  There are a lot of places for outdoor recreation. </p><p>  The journey begins to the lake from the village of Arkhyz.  The road first goes along the gorge of the river.  Kizgich.  The first 3 kilometers of the path is a convenient forest trail, then there is a long climb to the pass, called the Arkhyz saddle (2000 m).  A wide trail goes through a dense forest, covered with centuries-old firs, the shadow of which slightly facilitates the path.  After the forest, subalpine meadows appear, from where the village is visible below.  Arkhyz also offers a view of Abishir-Akhub (ridge) and Morg-Syrty, in which the lake is located.  Ahead is Mount Red.  Half an hour from this place is a picturesque natural reservoir, similar in shape to a heart.  The lake is located at an altitude of 2347 meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake of Love (Arkhyz): walking route, reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2152797.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  According to the reviews of travelers who visited these places, there is practically nothing to see in Arkhyz itself.  In this village there are some services for those who take independent walks in the local mountains.  It offers hiking and horseback riding, trips to the reserve zone, river rafting, etc. It turns out that the most remarkable and beautiful place in Arkhyz is Lake of Love. </p><p>  But it should be noted a couple of local attractions.  Arkhyz is known among scientists for his location in the region of Europe‚Äôs largest astrophysical observatory (RAS).  And you can get into it for a fee. </p><p>  On the road to Arkhyz you can see the cave face of Christ.  There are still legends about how it came about.  Many believe in providence, and some believe that this is the work of a skilled person.  In any case, it‚Äôs worth seeing such a miracle, especially since for this you need to climb the makeshift stairs in extreme conditions.  And this is also a kind of romance! </p>
