Here the wizard‚Äôs imagination will have no limit.  From clay, you can make many products: from decor and scrapbooking to jewelry, bouquets and figurines.  You can master this material in courses or on your own. </p><h2>  What you need to know about clay </h2><p>  The material is selected according to what needs to be done.  If it will be jewelry - clay should be selected baked.  Hair accessories can be made from all types of materials, but remember that too large baked clay jewelry will be heavy.  Voluminous bouquets from it are also not worth making.  For the manufacture of decorative flowers, it is better to choose self-hardening clay, the best example of which is recognized as Japanese.  It does not require heat treatment and completely dries in air in 24 hours.  The material is soft and ductile and, most importantly, completely non-toxic.  It is easy and pleasant to work with him.  Japanese clay consists of cellulose, water, talc and natural fibers.  Masters all over the world appreciated the quality of Claycraft by Deco Japanese polymer clay. </p><h2>  Sculpting technique </h2><p>  The main technique for creating elements is stretching the material in the palm of the hand with the thumb of the opposite hand.  This technique is not suitable for baked clay, which is sometimes broken with a hammer to start working with it.  Japanese clay has the texture of soft marshmallows, and interaction with it turns into a tactile pleasure.  To work with clay, not only hands are used.  There are special tools designed to facilitate the task of creating realism and more accurately convey the natural form of plants and flowers.  The main ones are: stacks - plastic knives with various sizes of cloth and notches to give texture, molds - forms of silicone or plastic to create leaves and flower petals.  Also, ordinary manicure scissors are used in the work. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.creativeparadiseglass.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Molda for a flower" class="if uuid-2905369" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/108960/2905369.jpg"></div><p>  To give a beautiful texture, lace or fabrics with a beautiful weave of threads are used. </p><p>  Water will help increase the stickiness of the surface.  It is enough to hold the product with a wet finger.  If the surface has already set, PVA glue will help soften it. </p><h2>  How much clay to buy for work </h2><p>  For a beginner, you can limit yourself to buying white clay.  You can vary the color with acrylic paint.  No need to try to achieve brightness by adding a large amount of paint.  The hue will still remain pastel, but the properties of the material will deteriorate.  Clay will become sticky and dry quickly.  Do not add oil paints to it, they give a flat and unnatural color, which also changes after drying. </p><p>  Another way to stain Claycraft by Deco polymer clay products is by dry brushing with acrylic paint or pastel over a dried surface. </p><p>  To make the product last longer, it can be coated with acrylic varnish.  From this, it will become more durable and resistant to moisture. </p><h2>  Professionals </h2><p>  When it became clear that working with polymer clay from a hobby turned into a serious occupation - you can safely buy material.  Claycraft by Deco polymer clay is presented in seven colors: white, black, blue, brown, red, yellow and green.  From them you can get a lot of additional colors and shades.  Japanese clay maker Claycraft by Deco recommends using pre-made patterns to create one color or another. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Clay colors" class="if uuid-2905348" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/108960/2905348.jpg"></div><h2>  Special material properties </h2><p>  Claycraft by Deco clay must be stored in tightly closed packaging without air.
