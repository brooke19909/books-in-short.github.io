And the first problem that worries the guest is the need to get settled, and as comfortable as possible, while spending a small amount of money.  Many guests primarily pay attention to the goodwill at the meeting and the good attitude of the staff.  Others pay attention to cleanliness of the room and additional inexpensive services.  Today, competition among hotels is high, so many inexpensive hotels in St. Petersburg will please you with an atmosphere of carelessness and peace of mind, they will consider you not just a client, but a true friend. </p><p>  Inexpensive hotels will appeal primarily to tourists, but are also popular among business people, businessmen who come to the capital as necessary.

For the day you have important things to do in the city, so there is no need to overpay for services that you do not need.  In each hotel you will find comfortable furniture and large tables where you can adequately receive guests.  You do not even have to visit the store, as the hotel has everything you need, even your own kitchen. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is wrong to believe that inexpensive hotels in St. Petersburg do not make any efforts to develop quality of service, which attract customers at a low price.

Often, hotels in St. Petersburg are located near metro stations.  Nearby there are many shops and places of recreation, as well as attractions.  For tourists, this is an invaluable advantage. </p><p>  What could be better than spending the night in a cozy and comfortable hotel room?  Many hotels in St. Petersburg will be a good place for you to relax, where you can gain strength after long walks in the capital.  Upholstered furniture, a comfortable sofa and a <span>good TV</span> make you feel really comfortable.  What else is needed? </p><p>  Many customers who have left reviews about hotels in St. Petersburg will reveal to you all the advantages and qualities of such establishments.

The hotel is a good choice, compared with a rented apartment, daily free housekeeping, the availability of inexpensive additional services make many people <span>choose the</span> first.  In this case, you do not have to overpay a lot of money for the well-known names of advertised business class hotels.  Inexpensive hotels in St. Petersburg is the best choice not only for temporary tourists, as they are also popular among residents of the capital who want to just relax.

Having visited at least once in such a hotel, you will save money and relax. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Let's look at a few examples of inexpensive hotels. </p><p>  EuroHostelSpb Hotel </p><p>  Just five minutes from Nevsky is EuroHostelSpb.  This is a reasonably priced hotel.  He is ready to accept 50 people.  Of course, not every room is equipped with cosmetic sets, however, a shower and a telephone are in each.  Also, if you want to cook something in person, there is a guest kitchen equipped with everything you need.  Cost - from 800 r.  This is subject to availability and beds.  But, in general, the hotel is far from bad. </p><p>  Hotel Azhur </p><p>  Of course, this hotel is much better than the previous option, but the price is 300 rubles.  more.  All rooms are equipped with modern technology.  In each you will find: safe, internet access, refrigerator, telephone, TV, hairdryer and bathroom.  A considerable advantage of the hotel is its location with metro station Chernyshevskaya. </p><p>  Hotel Elegy </p><p>  The hotel rooms are very reminiscent of home decor.  The hotel offers digital telephony services with international access.  Very close to the hotel is the Hermitage, Yard Square, <span>Summer Garden,</span> Kazan Cathedral.  This is very important for visitors.  Just left the hotel and the architectural heritage of the city is already in front of you.  The hotels will offer you laundry services, ticket booking, excursion services.  The only drawback is its rather noisy location. </p><p>  Hotel Sonata </p><p>  This is a fairly inexpensive hotel, from 500r.  per day.  But each room has everything you need.  Bathroom, shower, hair dryer, towels, TV.  What else is needed?  The hotel is located next to metro station <span>Ploschad Vosstaniya.</span>  Nothing bad can be said about this hotel, except that the staff is a bit slow. </p>
