Moscow, Shmitovsky passage</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Shmitovsky passage has an unusual history, which not every street of the capital can boast of.  It is here that there is one of the oldest children's city hospitals, a memorial stele, as well as one of the five Catholic monasteries located on the territory of the Russian Federation. </p><h2>  N.P. Schmitt </h2><p>  Shmitovsky passage was originally called Smithovsky, since it was there that the enterprises of Richard Smith were located.  In the early 1930s, the highway was renamed, it was named in honor of N.P. Schmit, a former owner of a furniture factory who actively participated in the revolutionary revolt of 1905 and was killed in prison.  The businessman bequeathed all his property to the Bolsheviks, so they decided to thank him in this way. </p><p>  In the period from 1925 to 1931, the street was mistakenly called the Shmidtovsky passage, but after the adoption of the relevant order, he received his current name.  At the end of the 1960s, the First Krasnogvardeiskaya Street, formerly called the First Street of the Testovsky Village, was added to it.  The city authorities decided that it was easier not to rename it many times, and added it to the passage. </p><h2>  Monastery </h2>

    <p>  The main attraction possessed by the Shmitovsky passage is 1 out of 5 monasteries belonging to the so-called Franciscans - the mendicant Catholic order.  It was built in the eighteenth century with the permission of Emperor Peter I. Then there was a relatively small community of the same name, however, at the beginning of the nineteenth century it was no longer there. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1993, the Franciscans returned to Moscow, a community and a mission appeared here.  Over the more than twenty-year history of the Renaissance, five monasteries appeared in Russia; they are also located in St. Petersburg, Kaluga and other cities of the country.  All of them are subordinate to the corresponding Custodian.  The capital‚Äôs monastery is located at the very beginning of the passage and immediately stands out from the rest of the buildings. </p><h2>  Hospital </h2>

    <p>  Shmitovsky passage also has other interesting sights, which can take a lot of time to inspect.  In particular, this refers to the miraculously preserved three houses from the Lower Presnya quarter, which were erected in 1928.  In one of them (No. 10) there are a large number of shops, at one time there lived Boris Chukhnovsky, known for his flights to the polar ice. </p><p>  At the intersection of passage with st.  In 1905, you can see the stele, which was created in memory of N.P. Schmit.  Not far from it is the monument ‚ÄúEternal friendship‚Äù, which symbolizes the relationship between the German district of Denkendorf and the Krasnopresnensky district of the capital.  Building No. 16 is a territory of the former Proletarsky Trud factory. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Shmitovsky passage is located in the western part of the city, between Zvenigorod highway and Kutuzovsky prospect.  The easiest way will be to get there by car, from the Garden Ring to the hospital can be reached in twenty-five to thirty minutes under favorable conditions on the road.
