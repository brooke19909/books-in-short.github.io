The development of banking services has led to the emergence of new credit products using cards, and the conditions for using them vary.  Of course, banks take into account the wishes of their customers, but the terms of the relationship are different.  They should be sorted out. </p><p>  Most banking institutions provide an opportunity to familiarize themselves with all the clauses of a credit card agreement by posting information on official Internet resources.  It is very convenient and allows you to compare conditions without leaving your home.  You should pay attention to the size of the established rate, because the amount that you will need to return will ultimately depend on this.  Of course, the smaller the agreed percentage, the lower will be the total amount.  The length of the grace period that all credit cards have is also important.  Banks usually set a period of 30 or 55 days, with the first figure always being offered to new customers, and the second is announced over time if your credit history suits the management.  Certainly, the maximum grace period is more beneficial for customers, because many rely on salaries, and their payment is often delayed due to the fault of the employer and other reasons independent of the employee.  Some banks, knowing about such features, initially offer the opportunity to use credit funds for 55 days. </p><p>  When choosing a credit card, be sure to ask about the cost of its service.  Often this aspect is overlooked, as a result of which there may be misunderstanding about the funds debited for servicing the card.  And although the amounts are usually small, and you need to pay them monthly, in the end they can be pretty decent.  You should also be aware that credit cards are also different in terms of the limit.  Quite often, given the good payment history without delay and early repayment, banking institutions decide to increase credit. </p><p>  As for the procedure for obtaining such a card, today it can even occur by submitting an application through an official web resource on the Internet.  For this, an indication of the basic passport data and / or identification number is sufficient. </p><p>  Source: www.bancaintesa.ru </p></div></article>
