    <h2>  Communicator design </h2><p>  The design of HTC HD2 is not much different from modern smartphones: the same all-in-one with touch input capability.  The difference is in the control panel, which is located under the screen.  Here, instead of the 3 standard buttons to date, 5. is displayed. In addition to the Back, Home, and Menu buttons, there are also Call and End Call buttons.  The volume control buttons are displayed on the left side of the smartphone, and the locks are on the right.  On the bottom side, all wired communicator interfaces are grouped: a 3.5-mm audio port and a standard micro-USB.  On the back cover there is a camera, a dual LED backlight for it and a loud speaker. </p><h2>  CPU, graphics and camera </h2><p>  At the time of sale, the best hardware among competitors was HTC HD2.  The characteristics of the specifications of its central processor clearly indicate this.  Qualcomm‚Äôs Snapdragon QSD2850 chip runs at 1 GHz and has no competitors in performance.  The touch screen of this device, as noted earlier, had a diagonal of 4.3 inches.  Its resolution was 800 x 480. Now you will not be surprised by such parameters, but in 2009 these were fantastic indicators.  The only criticism is the number of colors displayed.  There were 65 thousand, and this value is embedded in the operating system itself.  That is, this restriction could not be circumvented in any way.  Also, the device had only one camera, which was based on a 5 megapixel sensor.  Important technologies such as autofocus and dual LED flash were also implemented.  Therefore, the quality of the photos obtained using this device, at that time was one of the best. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Memory </h2><p>  Things were great with the memory subsystem in HTC HD2.  Characteristics, reviews of the owners of the gadget said that there were no problems with the placement and launch of the software.  The amount of RAM was 448 MB, and the capacity of the internal drive was 512 MB.  Well, in addition, an external micro-SD format card could be installed in this device.  As a result, this communicator had no problems with the memory subsystem. </p><h2>  Communicator autonomy </h2><p>  Very small battery capacity - 1230 mAh - in HTC HD2.  The characteristic is really modest, as in modern times, when devices of this level are already equipped with batteries of 1500-2000 mAh.  Accordingly, the autonomy of this device was limited to two days.  And this is with a minimum load on the device.  But if you increase the intensity of use, then this value decreased by a day with an average level of use, but with the maximum use of the gadget, you could count on 8-12 hours of work. </p><h2>  Interfaces </h2><p>  All modern data transfer methods are supported by the HTC HD2 phone.  Its characteristics in this regard are really impressive.  There is a Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth, and ZHPS, and micro-USB.  Also, the smartphone is dual-band and boasts support for GSM and 3G.  In the first case, theoretically, you can get 560 kBit / s, and in the second - 7.2 Mbit / s. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  System software </h2><p>  Windows Mobile with the Professional version 6.5 prefix acted as system software in this device.  At that time, it was one of the best software platforms for communicators.  iOS has not yet received widespread adoption, as has Android.  But the "Symbian" stopped on the spot and did not develop. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc hd2 specifications reviews" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/877350.jpg" width="200"></div>  Another important feature of this device was the presence of a pre-installed office suite.  This allowed him to view and edit text documents and spreadsheets.

    <h2>  User Owner Reviews </h2><p>  The only drawback that the owners of this unit are talking about is the high cost.  At the time of the release of the device, it was 1100 dollars.  But, on the other hand, modern flagships are rated by manufacturers similarly, and at this price the gadget is not unusual.  After all, he was also a premium segment device.  It was possible, of course, to save a certain part of the amount.  It was enough only to purchase specialized versions of this communicator on international trading floors, for example, HTC HD2 T-Mobile.  His characteristics are identical, but the price was lower.  The characteristics of the technical plan are not satisfactory, as are the other components. </p>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  After 6 years, the hardware parameters allow you to solve most everyday tasks on HTC HD2.  The characteristic of the software component of this communicator causes certain complaints.  The operating system is outdated both morally and physically.  But still, this is an excellent communicator, which even after six years can carry out all the functions assigned to it. </p>
