    <p>  <span>Ancient civilizations of the</span> East were located in the southern part of Asia and in the northern part of Africa.  These include Babylon, Assyria, Iran, Phenicia, Ancient China, Urartu, Egypt, Ancient India and the Hittite state. </p><p>  Eastern despotism is the main feature that characterizes the <span>state system of</span> these states.  This term means unlimited power of one head of state. </p><p>  The reason why the eastern despotism was formed is that in ancient countries the land community was preserved for a long time and <span>private ownership of</span> land did not develop for a long time.  Thus, the rural community became the basis of this state system.  In addition, the emergence of this system was facilitated by traditional rules that village communities could not violate.  For example, in Egypt, the importance of despotic power was reinforced by the need to create irrigation facilities, without which it was impossible to engage in agriculture.  If residents would abandon such a political system, state authorities could destroy the important elements of platinum, and the population would be left without water, and, consequently, mass death would begin. </p><p>  In addition, eastern despotism was based on the divine dignity of its rulers.  For example, in Egypt, the pharaoh completely controlled the legislative, military and <span>judicial powers.</span>  No one could oppose his decision, because  it was believed that he was an intermediary between people and gods.  In the ancient Sumerian state, the head was also a higher power.  He was recognized as a priest, so his orders were obeyed without question.  In India, despotism was characterized as the complete arbitrariness of the ruling monarch.  However, here the ruler was not a priest.  All his power was based on the teachings of the brahmanas. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In ancient China, the ruler was not only a priest, but also a "son of heaven." </p><p>  Eastern despotism had characteristic features: </p><p>  1) The prevalence of the state over society in an absolute degree.  The state is considered the highest force that stands above man.  It regulates all spheres of activity and relations of people not only in society, but also in the family.  The head of state forms tastes, social ideals, can appoint and remove officials at any time, is uncontrolled, exercises command of the army. </p><p>  2) The policy of coercion.  The main task facing the state was to instill fear in every citizen.  Wards should tremble and believe that the ruler of the country is not a tyrant, but a defender of the people, reigning at every level of power, punishing arbitrariness and evil. </p><p>  3) <span>State ownership of</span> land.  All of it belonged only to the state, not a single <span>individual</span> had economic freedom. </p><p>  4) Socio-hierarchical structure.  It resembles a pyramid.  At its peak was the ruler, then the state bureaucracy, communal farmers and the lowest level belonged to dependent people. </p><p>  5) Each civilization of the Ancient East had an organized apparatus of power.  It consisted of three departments: financial, public, and military.  Each was assigned a specific task.  The financial department sought funds for the maintenance of the administrative apparatus and the army, the public was engaged in construction work, the creation of roads, the military - the supply of foreign slaves. </p><p>  It is worth noting that despotism was not only negative.  The state, even with such a system, gave some guarantees to the population, although not equally.  Laws controlled relations between the population, imposed penalties for actions.  Thus, a civilized society of the modern type began to form. </p>
