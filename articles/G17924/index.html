Sberbank offers 2 options: free informing (the ‚ÄúEconomical‚Äù package) and paid messages (‚ÄúFull‚Äù package).  Those who do not want to receive notifications from a single short number "900" can disable the service.  The operation is free, the execution time does not exceed 24 hours. </p><h2>  How to refuse a Sberbank mobile bank: all methods </h2><p>  To disable alerts, the client must choose one of 3 methods: </p><ol><li>  Call to the contact center of a financial organization.  At the service of users - 2 round-the-clock lines: single number or "900". </li><li>  Contacting the office of Sberbank. </li><li>  Using the USSD command to the number "900". </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.presstv.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2015/08/14/424674/iran-russia-superjet-aviation-sberbank"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to refuse a mobile bank of Sberbank" class="if uuid-2681423" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2681423.jpg"></div><p>  The options are suitable for credit card holders who want to refuse from Sberbank‚Äôs mobile bank or change the service. </p><h2>  Features of disabling SMS information from the number "900" </h2><p>  Not all users know how to refuse the services of Sberbank‚Äôs mobile bank.  Features of cancellation of SMS-informing service are the following rules: </p><ol><li>  The operation is available only to cardholders. </li><li>  Deactivation of the service is carried out after an oral or written application of the client.  Sberbank is not entitled to unilaterally notify a citizen of a refusal to continue using the service. </li><li>  The term for a complete shutdown of a service takes from 1 minute to 24 hours. </li><li>  The client has the right to refuse several mobile banks at the same time. </li><li>  The operation is impossible without identification of the owner of the credit card.  Deactivation is permitted by the direct cardholder or his legal representative.  In the second case, the client must submit an officially executed document confirming his authority. </li><li>  Cancellation of the application is not possible.  If the user changes his mind, he should apply for the resumption of the service. </li></ol><h2>  Refusal of a mobile bank through a contact center </h2><p>  The most affordable way to opt out of Sberbank‚Äôs mobile bank is by calling the hotline. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.atlasconcorde.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.atlasconcorde.com/en/design-project/sberbank-of-russia/"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to refuse the service of a mobile bank of Sberbank" class="if uuid-2681425" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2681425.jpg"></div><p>  The contact center is open 24/7.  To turn off alerts, the cardholder must: </p><ul><li>  Dial the Sberbank single line telephone number, which is indicated on the back of the card.  Since 2017, an additional number is in force - "900". </li><li>  Go through the answering machine commands.  It is required to choose everything related to the mobile bank: disconnecting the service or communicating with the operator. </li><li>  Call the call center specialist the reason for the call, name, registration address, card number, code word and phone number with the option connected. </li></ul><p>  The client called the control information to the manager of the financial organization when opening the card.  If the owner has forgotten the previously indicated data, he can change them in any branch of the bank.  It is allowed to receive a one-time code for calling the support service in the Sberbank terminal. </p><p>  After the call, the user will receive an SMS notification with "900" about the application for disconnecting the mobile bank.  The service will be canceled within 24 hours.  If the owner of the plastic card has applied for several numbers at the same time, an alert will be received for each of them. </p><h2>  Visit to the bank to cancel the service </h2><p>  How to refuse a Sberbank mobile bank without a card, control information and code in the terminal?  This is possible when visiting an additional office. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="russia-ic.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://russia-ic.com/news/show/22277#.W1HhiaC3qKI"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to refuse a mobile bank" class="if uuid-2681840" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2681840.jpg"></div><p>  To refuse the option, the client just needs to take a passport with him.  The shutdown process using operator services takes no more than 10 minutes. </p><ol><li>  The cardholder presents a document for identification and gives the reason for the appeal.  It should be clarified which card you want to remove the service from (if there are several) and name the number (or the last digits of the combination). </li><li>  An employee of Sberbank identifies the client and fills out an application to disable the service. </li><li>  The client signs the application. </li><li>  The transaction is confirmed by another employee of the bank.  The application goes into processing. </li></ol><p>  A plastic card holder is given a copy of the document for canceling SMS notifications.  After submitting the application, the client will also receive SMS from the number "900".  The option is completely disabled within 24 hours. </p><h2>  Mobile Bank Lock </h2><p>  In case of loss of the card or temporary refusal of the service, customers can suspend SMS informing using the USSD command.  This is a brief request to the number "900", which blocks the service until it is renewed by the cardholder.  A feature of the method is the complete absence of commission: all SMS to the bank address are free, payment can be charged only at the tariff of the mobile operator. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thecoolgadgets.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://thecoolgadgets.com/anti-lie-atm-russia-sberbank-atm-future-of-anti-fraudsters-technology/"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to refuse a Sberbank mobile bank through a terminal" class="if uuid-2681816" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2681816.jpg"></div><p>  How to temporarily refuse a Sberbank mobile bank via SMS: </p><ol><li>  Type one of the "Service Block" or BLOKIROVKAUSLUG in the message.  The short code for the operation is "04". </li><li>  Send a message to "900". </li><li>  Confirm the desire to get rid of messages using the code sent in the response notification. </li></ol><p>  Using a USSD command is a temporary way to refuse a Sberbank mobile bank.  It suspends the option indefinitely.  During blocking, payment for the "Full" package is not charged.  To permanently disable the service, you must call the contact center or visit a bank branch. </p><h2>  Is it possible to refuse the option through ATMs and terminals? </h2><p>  In 90% of cases, the connection of a mobile bank service is carried out in remote service channels.  But not all customers know how to refuse the Sberbank mobile bank through the terminal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thefinanser.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://thefinanser.com/2016/07/sberbank-first-pikachu.html/"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to refuse a Sberbank mobile bank by phone" class="if uuid-2681431" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2681431.jpg"></div><p>  In ATMs, it is impossible to disable the option even if you have a plastic card and information about the number.  Customers can only change the package from ‚ÄúFull‚Äù to ‚ÄúEconomy‚Äù so as not to pay a commission of 30-60 rubles per month. </p><p>  How to refuse a Sberbank mobile bank using a tariff change: </p><ol><li>  Insert the card, enter the PIN code. </li><li>  Select the "Information and Services" section, then - "Mobile Bank". </li><li>  Click on the "Economy" package, enter the phone number. </li><li>  Confirm the operation. </li></ol><p>  After executing the commands, the service will change: from the paid tariff, it will switch to "Economy".  In the same way, customers can expand the range of alerts by choosing the "Full" package.  The transition to the new conditions of SMS-informing is carried out during the day. </p><h2>  In what cases is it impossible to disable the service? </h2><p>  Sberbank does not refuse plastic card users who decide to cancel SMS informing.  But in exceptional cases, you can‚Äôt refuse a mobile bank, for example: </p><ol><li>  If the card does not belong to the client.  Only the owner of the credit card can refuse the service.  An exception is the case when another citizen‚Äôs credit card was tied to the client‚Äôs phone number by mistake.  In this case, you can solve the problem after contacting the call center or by request in the office of a financial organization. </li><li>  If a shutdown request has already been submitted. </li><li>  If the data provided is incorrect.  When calling tech support, for example. </li><li>  It is impossible to get rid of services in the department without a passport. </li></ol>
