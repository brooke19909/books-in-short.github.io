Its name comes from the Arabic "al-Kuwait", which translates as "fortress city."  The entire cultural, political and economic life of the country is concentrated in its capital, Kuwait. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="29.31166" data-lng="47.48176599999999" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="8"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/3/7/8/5/13785.png"></div><p>  In recent decades, the country's economy has been actively developing, and its capital was built and grew prettier.  The city has many shopping centers, modern buildings, museums, historical, cultural and architectural monuments. </p><p>  Kuwait, a photo of which you can see in this review, is an Islamic state.  The architecture of the country and its capital has a national flavor, but in a more stylish, modern design.  Many objects are champions: the highest skyscrapers and towers, the largest fountains and ships. </p><div class="photo" data-original="whitesystems.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Capital of Kuwait" class="if uuid-3048883" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3048883.jpg"></div><p>  Travelers from all over the world are increasingly attracted by the sights of Kuwait.  We will introduce you to some of them in this article. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Kuwait Sights: Photos and Description </h2><p>  Kuwait‚Äôs memorable places amaze even experienced tourists with their diversity.  They can be inspected almost throughout the year due to the warm climate.  Tourists can only decide what to see in Kuwait in the first place, and what interesting places to visit on the next visit. </p><p>  Experienced travelers are advised to visit the Kuwait towers, which are the hallmark of not only the capital, but the whole country.  The architecture of the three tall (187 m) towers harmoniously combines modern and traditional Arabic styles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="desertgirlkuwait.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kuwait Towers" class="if uuid-3048904" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3048904.jpg"></div><p>  The towers of different heights are located near the sea, are a kind of symbol of a country striving to develop and play an active role in the world political and economic arena.  Tourists are enthralled by lunch at a restaurant located at a great height, especially when you consider that it constantly rotates.  This attraction of Kuwait is visited by all guests of the country, and the locals are very proud of these amazing designs. </p><h2>  Al-Hamra </h2><p>  The tallest building in Kuwait and one of the tallest in the world.  The tower, with 77 floors, resembles an externally deployed scroll.  The skyscraper is a delight not only for guests of Kuwait, but also for professional architects. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Inside the grand structure are restaurants and boutiques, fitness centers and cinemas, a sports club.  Part of the building is occupied by office space.  There is a restaurant on the roof of the building where tourists can enjoy not only excellent cuisine, but also enjoy the panorama of the capital.  The design of the skyscraper has received numerous awards from the community of architects. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.building.am" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Al Hamra Skyscraper" class="if uuid-3048912" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3048912.jpg"></div><h2>  Big mosque </h2><p>  This iconic landmark of Kuwait is one of the largest mosques in the world.  The temple fully justifies the name, since the dimensions of the structure are actually grandiose.  The mosque was built in 1986.  It can accommodate up to 41 thousand people. </p><p>  The temple occupies a vast territory of 50 thousand square meters.  m. Twenty of them occupy the building itself.  The rest of the territory has a beautiful garden with flowers, palm trees, fountains and waterfalls.  The mosque is decorated with 82 domes, gilded with gold leaf, thousands of columns, luxurious chandeliers and the largest handmade carpet.  The beautiful temple is surrounded by sparkling pools that only emphasize the beauty of the building.  During the day, the building sparkles in the sun in gold, and at night it strikes with artful lighting.  The unique lighting system, depending on the phases of the moon, is changing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pegham.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Big mosque" class="if uuid-3048923" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3048923.jpg"></div><h2>  Green Island </h2><p>  Many tourists are interested in what to visit with children in Kuwait.  We recommend visiting the man-made island with numerous cafes and playgrounds.  The observation tower offers magnificent views of the sea.  Those who wish can swim here without going to the beach.  The island has a large salt lake. </p><p>  Art lovers can visit the equipped theater area.  Even a walk through the island, which contains more than 50 thousand plants brought from all over the world, will bring great pleasure. </p><div class="photo" data-original="murtahil.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Green Island" class="if uuid-3048928" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3048928.jpg"></div><h2>  Liberation Tower </h2><p>  This popular Kuwait landmark was inaugurated in March 1996.  At first, the building was called a telecommunication tower.  Its construction was started in 1990, shortly before the Iraq attack on Kuwait.  Built at that time, the structure was not damaged and after the defeat of the troops of Saddam Hussein (1991), its construction continued. </p><p>  In 1993, the name of the tower was changed to the present.  The Liberation Tower is a symbol of the liberation of the country.  It is almost 40 meters higher than the Eiffel.  From its base to the top, the facade is lined with ceramic tiles.  The telecommunication complex and the tower are divided into three working areas, which include a community center with a VIP-hall, an observation deck (rotating) and a restaurant, technical buildings.  Above the observation deck are six floors with offices. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.meed.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Liberation Tower" class="if uuid-3048933" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3048933.jpg"></div><h2>  Emir's Palace </h2><p>  Magnificent construction and popular attraction of Kuwait.  This oriental palace, luxurious and beautiful, was completely built only from local materials.  Performed in accordance with oriental traditions, the building is decorated in gold with ceramic elements.  Another feature of the palace is the tower, decorated with ceramics and gold, and having a unique clock on the facade. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yandex.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Emir's Palace" class="if uuid-3048943" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3048943.jpg"></div><h2>  Maritime Museum </h2><p>  Before the discovery of oil deposits in the country (1930), the city of Kuwait was a rather prosperous port, a scuba diving center.  The Maritime Museum was opened for visitors in early January 2010.  Previously, on the site of the museum was part of the Sharqiya school, which was the first male school in the country. </p><p>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a museum belongs to the National Council of Culture, Literature and Art.  Its design was developed by local architect David Al-Cattan.  The exposition presents models of boats, marine tools, as well as various devices that reflect the trading and maritime traditions of Kuwait. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ttnotes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Maritime Museum" class="if uuid-3048957" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3048957.jpg"></div><h2>  Kuwait Rink </h2><p>  An artificial ice rink under the roof delights all Kuwaiti guests.  Guest reviews indicate that they were amazed at the opportunity to skate when the sun mercilessly burns on the street. </p><p>  The complex, located in the capital, includes Small and Large ice zones.  This is one of the most visited entertainment centers in the country. </p><h2>  Musical fountain </h2><p>  One of the largest fountains in the world was installed in the capital of the country in 1983.  It occupies a large area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 16 thousand square meters.  m. The musical composition consists of 220 fountains, which are distributed in three pools.  Each of them has a dominant fountain. </p><p>  When Iraq was captured by Kuwait, the fountain was almost destroyed, but after some time it was completely restored.  Around the fountain are green areas, playgrounds and small cafes.  Every night a fascinating light and music show takes place here.  With the first chords of classical music, water flows begin to perform their dances.  This spectacular performance delights in its beauty. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ttnotes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Musical fountain" class="if uuid-3048970" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3048970.jpg"></div><h2>  Kuwait Travel Reviews </h2><p>  This small country makes a huge impression on everyone who happened to be here.  Despite the fact that the nature in Kuwait is not too picturesque, there are many tourist sites and attractions that are impressive.  Tourism infrastructure in the country is well developed.  Kuwait delights not only with historical monuments, but also with modern buildings. </p>
