The main task is to update the wardrobe or supplement it with several fashionable things.  The easiest way is to go to the store and buy new things.  But what if the budget is limited?  Of course, do needlework.  This time we will look at how to sew a long skirt in several versions.  Let's start with the <span>simplest model.</span> </p><p>  How to sew a <span>long skirt</span> with an elastic band. </p><p>  This model is very simple to manufacture.  Any material that drapes well is suitable for her.  It can be crepe, chiffon, lace or knitwear.  The choice of fabric depends on your tastes and the destination of the finished product.  This model will look great on a slim figure. </p><p>  We will need a piece of fabric measuring 1.5x2.5 meters, threads per tone and an elastic band 2 centimeters wide.  Before stitching a long skirt, it is necessary to process all four sides of our fabric cut.  An overlock or a special sewing foot for twisting is perfect for this purpose.  After that, we fold the fabric in half, with the wrong side facing out and grind it in a straight line to make a pipe 1.5 meters long.  Be sure to iron the seam. </p><p>  Since the fabric is light and transparent, we need a lining.  We measure the desired length of the skirt, add five centimeters to it, and bend the rest of the fabric inward.  This will be our lining.  We fix the hem with needles and, stepping back from it two centimeters, we lay the first line.  At a distance of 2.5 centimeters from it, we make the second straight line, leaving a couple of centimeters unstitched.  We measure the gum of the desired length.  Using a pin, insert it into the skirt through the prepared hole and sew the ends together.  Evenly distribute the folds across the entire width of the skirt.  Our new thing is ready. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How to sew a long summer sun skirt </p><p>  This model can be made without a side seam.  We need a square of fabric measuring 1.5x1.5 meters, a wide elastic band and threads of a suitable tone.  We fold the finished piece of fabric in half two times and get a square with a side of 75 centimeters.  We need to figure out how much tissue to cut for the waist.  To do this, measure the girth of the place where the skirt will sit.  If you want to wear it on your hips or with a lowered waist, then take measurements in this place.  Divide the resulting girth in half and multiply by 3.14.  In my case, the figure is 13. </p><p>  On a folded square we measure 13 centimeters and draw a semicircle.  This will be the waistline.  From it we measure the length of the skirt and also draw a semicircle.  If you want a more interesting model - leave a hem with corners.  We cut off the excess tissue and expand the cut.  We got a big circle with a hole in the center.  Carefully process the hem of the skirt in any way. </p><p>  After that, we are engaged in the manufacture of a belt.  We measure the length of the central circle and cut out a strip of fabric two centimeters longer and 5-7 centimeters wide.  Stitch the belt into the ring, leaving one centimeter un sewn, and iron the seam.  After that, fold the strip in half and pin it with needles.  We get a finished belt 2.5-3.5 centimeters wide.  We put a strip on the front side of the skirt, aligning the cut with the waist line.  We retreat 0.7 centimeters and lay a straight line.  We process a seam on an overlock.  If you use two narrow elastic bands instead of one wide, then divide the belt in half with an additional line.  We insert the gum and sew its ends.  Our new thing is ready. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  How to sew a long straight skirt </p><p>  In most cases, it is necessary to wear formal clothes.  If you have a small selection of such things, then we will tell you how to sew a long skirt with a lock.  For this, we do not need a pattern.  It is enough to know the circumference of the hips and the length of the product.  Take for example the circumference of 100 centimeters, and the required length - 80 centimeters.  The result was a rectangle, on each side of which it is necessary to add a centimeter, after which we get 102x82 centimeters. </p><p>  We process side sections of fabric on an overlock.  Fold a piece of fabric in half and mark the height of the cut and the location of the zipper.  Fix the edges with needles.  Stitch the seam at a distance of one centimeter, guided by the marks, and then iron it.  We embed the lock from the wrong side and grind it. </p><p>  We lay the finishing line, fixing the seam allowances and making a cut on the skirt.  We hem the bottom of the product.  After that, you can do the design of the waist.  We turn our workpiece to the wrong side and put it on, fastening the lock.  With the help of needles, we stab excess tissue, forming lateral, front and rear tucks.  We remove the skirt and grind the tucks according to the marks made, after which we iron them to the center. </p><p>  The waist line can be made in several ways: </p><ul><li>  Sew on a belt. </li><li>  Finish with edge trim. </li><li>  To process with a slanting inlay. </li></ul><p>  We will be making out the waist with a slanting inlay cut from the main fabric.  Its width should be 2.5 centimeters.  The front side of the inlay is placed on the wrong side of the skirt and tuned, stepping back from the edge of 0.5-0.7 centimeters.  After that, we turn off the inlay on the front side of the skirt, closing the sections at the waist.  We bend the excess inward and stab with needles.  Do not forget to leave the side allowances, which at this moment must be turned inside.  We lay the line, departing 0.1 centimeters from the edge of the oblique inlay. </p><p>  In one hour you sewed a strict <span>skirt of a straight</span> cut.  By changing the texture of the fabric and complementing the main model with decorative elements, you can independently make fashionable things for work and leisure. </p>
