    <p>  At first glance, it becomes clear that the program promises significant benefits to its owner.  However, this is not the limit.  Rosbank has updated its service package to create a new, even more interesting product - Supercard +.  It includes a Visa Platinum, Gold and Classic premium card, four <span>currency accounts</span> and a deposit.  Owners of the extended version of the program have more privileges in service and benefits when shopping from Rosbank PJSC.  The "supercard", the conditions for which will be discussed later, will appeal to active and wealthy people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get a product? </h2><p>  To get a package of services, you must visit the bank branch located at the place of registration of the potential client.

After the announcement of the ‚ÄúSupercard +‚Äù service package, cases of switching to this tariff plan from simpler ones become more frequent, which can also be done using the promotional code, having received a year of service as a gift. </p><h2>  Premium Card Benefits </h2><p>  Each <span>bank</span> offers Visa Gold or Platinum <span>.</span>  <span>Rosbank was</span> no exception.

    <p>  Visa Gold and Visa Platinum are convenient, profitable and prestigious.  Cards of this level open up many opportunities for their owners, including: </p><ul><li>  high limit for a one-time withdrawal of funds; </li><li>  free emergency replacement in a short time; </li><li>  legal advice and medical insurance for travelers; </li><li>  bonus program; </li><li>  discounts on flights, the best hotels and restaurants in the world with the possibility of booking; </li><li>  preferential car rental. </li></ul><p>  The platinum card additionally includes an extended concierge service and two types of insurance for purchases. </p><h2>  Cashback </h2><p>  A pleasant cashback service is also provided for the ‚ÄúSupercard‚Äù, ‚ÄúSupercard +‚Äù service packages.  True, the conditions for its accrual vary.  For example, for owners of the first version of the product, cashback is charged for every 3 months in the amount of 10%.  But in order to get such a rather big reward, the total amount of purchases should be at least 75 thousand rubles.  At the same time, every 3 months the bank changes the categories for which it encourages its customers.  For 2016, under the Supercard program (Rosbank), the reviews of which are very positive, the following sections of purchases are established for which cashback is charged: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  from January to March - health and beauty; </li><li>  from April to June - home comfort; </li><li>  from July to September - children's goods and entertainment; </li><li>  from October to December - restaurants. </li></ul><p>  Payments for services or goods that are not included in the above categories are rewarded with a return of 1% of the payment amount to the account. </p>

    <p>  ‚ÄúSupercard +‚Äù will delight its owners with a 7% cashback, which is charged in the same categories as in the previous program.  True, the minimum amount of purchases will be 20 thousand rubles.  When paying for goods and services that are not on the list, 1% is returned to the card holder. </p><p>  But for beginners a pleasant surprise awaits from the Supercard program.  Rosbank, whose reviews are mostly positive, provides a 7% cashback in the first three months of using the card.  It is worth considering that the monthly fee is limited to 5 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Remuneration for the remaining funds </h2><p>  In addition to the benefits that the user receives from Visa Gold and Visa Platinum premium cards, the bank offers its own bonuses under the Supercard program.  Rosbank, whose customer reviews are fairly good, provides cardholders with a reward for the remainder of the money on the card.  The gradation of accrual of annual interest is as follows: </p><ul><li>  with a balance of less than 250 thousand rubles.  - 5.5%, more - 6.5%; </li><li>  on the account less than $ 3000 - 0.25%, more - 0.3%; </li><li>  Stored less than ‚Ç¨ 3000 - 0.15%, more - 0.2%. </li></ul><p>  Remuneration is accrued for the entire amount of funds. </p><p>  Participants of the Supercard + program can receive from 6.5% to 7% per annum of the balance in the ruble account (if stored up to 2 million or more, respectively), 0.35-0.4% for the amount in US dollars and 0.1 % on funds in euros. </p><h2>  Cashing out </h2><p>  Withdrawing money sometimes becomes a big problem for plastic holders: you need to calculate how much it is more profitable to remove taking into account the commission, and the ‚Äúnative‚Äù terminal is not always at hand.  Holders of the Supercard do not know the problem of cashing out, because Rosbank took care of its customers as well as possible.  It is possible to withdraw money from the card without a commission not only in the ‚Äúnative‚Äù ATM, but also using the partner terminals.  Among them are Alfa-Bank, VTB-24, Gazprombank, Russian Agricultural Bank and many others.  Free withdrawals are available worldwide and on the devices of the Societe Generale group. </p>

    <p>  If you need to cash money through the cashier, you will have to pay a small commission to Rosbank - 0.5% of the amount (minimum 29 rubles) or 1% of an external organization (minimum 150 rubles). </p><h2>  Refill </h2><p>  You can not only withdraw money from the card, but also replenish its account if necessary.  To carry out the operation, you need to know the number of the contract with the bank or the card number.  You will also need a passport if crediting occurs through the cashier.  The owner of the plastic has several options for replenishment: transfer from another card, depositing funds through a terminal, cash desk or online service.  The bank set a limit on account replenishment - not more than 75 thousand rubles for one Card to Card transfer and not more than 500 thousand per month for online transactions. </p><h2>  "Supercard" ("Rosbank"): service tariffs </h2><p>  Like any other product, the ‚ÄúSupercard‚Äù service package must be paid annually.  Rosbank collects a monthly service fee.  The difference between the two cards is only 50 rubles: the initial version of the "Super Card" will cost 450 rubles.  per month, and an advanced "Supercard +" will cost 500 rubles.  per month.  By calculating the amount for the year, you can make sure that these products are not created for every citizen. </p>

    <p>  But wealthy people will be delighted by one small condition put forward by Rosbank.  The "Supercard", the cost of which in the usual case will be 54 thousand rubles, will be serviced completely free of charge with an aggregate account balance of 250 thousand rubles.  The same applies to the ‚ÄúSupercard +‚Äù service package. </p><h2>  Super Account Terms </h2><p>  Time deposit is available under the Supercard program.  The version of the service package with Visa Platinum does not have such a function.  The deposit is valid for 3 months.  For conservation, you can put from 1000 to 250 thousand rubles.  The fee is 10% of the amount, it can be capitalized or transferred to the main account using the online service. </p>

    <p>  As you can see, the list is impressive.  Clients noted many positive aspects of the Overcard, but why were they dissatisfied?  Common causes of negative comments towards the product are: </p><ul><li>  high cost of service; </li><li>  many points that must be observed in order to use the card become profitable; </li><li>  paid SMS service; </li><li>  the unnecessity of a large number of accounts and cards. </li></ul><p>  The "supercard" from "Rosbank", the pros and cons of which were discussed above, is still quite good and in its own way profitable.  The main problem is that it is really accessible to a small audience. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  There was a lot of talk about the Supercart on the Web and on television.  Advertising attracted new customers, people passed codes to each other and advised a unique package of services.  Those who did not have time to issue a "Supercard", with pleasure agreed to the updated program "Supercard Plus" ("Rosbank").  Online purchases with fraud protection and an additional guarantee, cashback bonuses, benefits of premium cards, currency savings accounts - all this can be obtained as a single product.  Those for whom the balance of 250 thousand rubles is a common thing, appreciated the functionality of the "Supercard".  In other cases, the program is unreasonably expensive and promises loss rather than profit.
