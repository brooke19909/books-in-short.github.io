    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  A very mixed assessment is given by some tourists to the resort hotel Alidia Beach Resort 3 * (Goa).  Reviews about this institution, in addition to positive ones, also contain negative comments: </p><ul><li>  the water in the pool is very cold due to the fact that there is no heating in it, and the shade from the trees does not allow it to heat up from sunlight; </li><li>  Internet is paid and rather slow; </li><li>  because of the increased dampness in the bathrooms of some rooms frogs settled; </li><li>  since the shower is not separated from the toilet in any way (there is not even a curtain), during bathing everything is always flooded with water; </li><li>  the rooms are very uncomfortable old beds, and I also want to note the washed clothes; </li><li>  a lot of mosquitoes both on the street and in the rooms; </li><li>  very poor soundproofing - all conversations and movements of neighbors are heard in the room; </li><li>  paid breakfast is very modest - juice diluted with water, as well as toasts with butter and jam (apparently this was done so that tourists could order paid dishes from the menu in the morning); </li><li>  the owner of the hotel is not too caring with the guests and constantly makes some meaningless remarks to the guests; </li><li>  the safe at the reception is paid, in addition, the cost of this service is 2-3 times higher than in neighboring hotels; </li><li>  despite the fact that the hotel does not provide meals and you have to buy food yourself, there are no refrigerators in the rooms - everything spoils very quickly (apparently, again, this was done so that tourists would leave money in the hotel cafe); </li><li>  poor voltage in the rooms (it is very problematic to use a hairdryer and other electrical appliances, as well as charge the phone); </li><li>  the apartments have very little furniture and the walls are uneven. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Resort Alidia Beach Resort 3 * (North Goa) makes a fairly positive impression, because its territory is like a real jungle.  In addition, the advantageous location offers many opportunities for relaxation.  Nevertheless, it can not do without negative points.  In almost everything, savings can be seen, which can not always be called reasonable.  This applies not only to the furnishings in the rooms, but also to a number of services.  So, the cost of some services is several times higher than similar services in neighboring hotels.  This is especially true of tariffs for using the safe, car parking, as well as prices in the restaurant. </p>
