Today we will talk about a complex tax mechanism that regulates this activity. </p><h2>  The essence of taxation </h2><p>  Before we begin to consider the types of tax systems, we need to understand for ourselves the direct essence of the fiscal activity of any state.  The fact is that the policy of encumbrance with obligations of business entities has a rather complex structure and an impressive regulatory background. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="types of tax systems" class="if" height="376" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26834/1028710.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  And this is not surprising, because taxation is such a financial instrument that underlies the economic relations of any country, both developed and in the way of its formation.  So, the fiscal burden represents a certain share of material values, which is seized from the owner in favor of the state.  It performs mandatory and regulatory functions and is an integral part in replenishing the budget treasury.  The latter, in turn, serves as a regulator of economic processes of national importance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Varieties of fiscal burden </h2><p>  The policy of imposing obligations is complex and multi-level; therefore, the <span>tax system of the</span> Russian Federation <span>(the types of taxes of</span> which amount to about several tens) is classified in accordance with a number of signs.  By the level of implementation of <span>fiscal policy</span> : </p><ul><li>  national (federal) burden: spreads throughout the territory of the Russian Federation and is binding in any region; </li><li>  regional: regulated by the Tax Code and varies in rates and conditions of taxation depending on territorial features; </li><li>  local burden: it is a tool to replenish the budget treasury of a local nature. </li></ul>

    <p>  Also, the tax is divided depending on the purpose of its implementation and it happens: </p><ul><li>  abstract (implemented on a general legal basis); </li><li>  special (introduced to replenish the state treasury for specific, clearly established goals). </li></ul><h2>  Structure of the tax system </h2><p>  Each state has distinctive characteristics in the current fiscal policy, therefore, the types of tax systems around the world are significantly different.  Moreover, there are such countries that manage to replenish their budget treasury in a very sophisticated, at first glance, way.  All this depends on many subtleties, including historical circumstances. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="main types of tax systems" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26834/1028712.jpg" width="575"></div>

All this in its interaction is a huge mechanism that underlies the economic relations of any state. </p><h2>  The principles of fiscal systems </h2><p>  Types of tax systems vary among themselves depending on the characteristics of the country's domestic policy.  Under this concept of principle, in this case, fundamental provisions and ideas are laid that can regulate the fiscal activity of the government.  In the tax system they are divided into economic, organizational and legal. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tax system main types of taxes" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26834/1028714.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The former include equality, justice, transparency, the absence of infringements of any kind, expediency and, most importantly, convenience.  And this means that tax policy applies to all payers equally, regardless of their status and position in society.  At the same time, everyone perfectly understands what he pays to the budget for and in what amounts these funds are levied from him. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="types of tax systems in rf" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26834/1028715.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Organizational principles cover the timeliness and periodic framework for the implementation of obligations to the state.  Legal are regulated by regulatory legal acts. </p><h2>  The role of the tax system in the state </h2><p>  Despite its individuality, the main types of tax systems perform the same functions around the world: </p><ol><li>  This element of economic activity is primarily a well-coordinated mechanism of interaction between government organizations and a business entity (in certain cases, an individual). </li><li>  Moreover, various types of the state tax system equally determine the role of the bearer of obligations to the budget: they are an essential element in the formation of the budget treasury. </li><li>  The economic function of the fiscal mechanism is to regulate the country's domestic financial flows, which determine the general welfare of society. </li><li>  And finally, the investment function involves caring for the future of the state through the implementation of a competent fiscal policy. </li></ol><h2>  Fiscal system in the Russian Federation </h2><p>  It is rather difficult to analyze the budget policy of our country.  If only because the state did not think it was enough for more than two decades to establish a clear mechanism for imposing and paying obligations, which is why the types of tax systems in the Russian Federation have changed several times already. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="types of state tax system" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26834/1028716.jpg" width="534"></div>

    <p>  Today, we can say that the procedure for replenishing our budget lacks a powerful and clear regulator, although there is still potential for this.  As for the latter, it is laid down in well-developed normative legal acts, the availability of benefits and an individual approach to payers.  And they could function successfully, but this does not happen due to the presence of a complex administrative system in the state and too high a level of bureaucracy. </p><h2>  Tax system, main types of taxes in the USA </h2><p>  For many centuries, the United States government has been successfully pursuing a liberalization policy, which formed the basis of market relations in the state.  And this means that the mechanism of the tax system in this country has been successfully established and functions literally like a clock. </p><p>  Due to the high level of benefits, as well as a loyal attitude to the depreciation of fixed assets (due to which you can reduce profits), investment processes in the budget treasury are clearly established. </p><p>  In the process of carrying out economic activities, the Americans are liable for a set of basic taxes: </p><ul><li>  fiscal fee on sales; </li><li>  income liabilities; </li><li>  social insurance fund fees; </li><li>  local burden on business activity (applies to each state individually). </li></ul><h2>  Types of tax systems in Europe </h2><p>  The Western European fiscal policy mechanism is qualitatively different from generally accepted world practices.  At least by the fact that it is too conservative in relation to the carriers of tax obligations. </p><p>  For example, in France there are no <span>tax holidays</span> and various benefits, but the government is loyal to the application of accelerated depreciation rates by business entities.  The reduced rate of fiscal burden applies to those enterprises that resort to scientific activity during the operating room. </p><p>  But the German tax policy is characterized by increased interest on liabilities.  Sometimes income tax can reach 50% for some activities.  At the same time, <span>penalties</span> for non-compliance with regulatory legal acts simply reach a sky-high level.  However, the European mentality is such that it doesn‚Äôt scare local entrepreneurs at all, so the mechanism for replenishing the treasury is brilliantly established. </p>
