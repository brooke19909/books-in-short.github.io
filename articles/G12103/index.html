Apparently, this circumstance played an important role in the fact that this resort is very popular among Russians.  In addition, Alanya has such a developed tourist infrastructure that even avid sybarites run the risk of coming here on vacation. </p><p>  Via a busy modern highway, travelers can quickly and easily get to another famous Turkish center - the capital of this region of Antalya. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lonicera city 3" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/676405.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Alanya Hotels </h2><p>  Turkey has been a near abroad for Russians for many years.  It comes mainly to those who prefer a beach holiday and who are attracted by the local low housing prices.  At the same time, judging by the reviews, for many Russians the star rating of hotels in this region is not critical.  After all, Alanya - one of the inexpensive resorts of the Turkish coast - has one feature: its luxury hotels do not differ much from places of residence with a lower level of comfort. </p><p>  The best hotels are, of course, those that have four or five stars.  They are located mostly on the first line.  But "treshki" are no less popular.  Some of them were built in the city center, not far from the sea, but they are also characterized by a rather high level of service at a low price.  Among them, not the last place is occupied by such a hotel as Lonicera City 3 *. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lonicera city 3 alanya" class="if" height="212" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/676403.jpg" width="320"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  In general, Lonicera City 3 * meets the expectations of Russian tourists.  The beach, judging by the reviews, is very large, but the main thing is clean.  The coating is sand.  Some, however, do not like that you need to pay separately for sunbeds, but Cleopatra is a municipal beach that is not the property of this hotel. </p><p>  As for the number of rooms, almost all the reviews are positive.  A lot of good memories about the staff.  The food, according to tourists, is delicious.  Some, of course, did not like the lack of animation, however, for entertainment and active pastime there are many relevant institutions. </p>
