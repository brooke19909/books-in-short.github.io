It is worth noting that according to official documents, the capital of Montenegro is the city of Cetinje, however, both business and political centers and institutions that are of national importance are located in Podgorica.  On the territory of this wonderful city in the entire history of its existence (which dates back to the Mesolithic period), many religious and cultural institutions, fortresses and castles were erected.  Many of them have now turned into ruins, but this does not reduce the number of tourists in the country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The capital of Montenegro" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/16260.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  During the existence of the Roman Empire, the current unofficial capital of Montenegro belonged to this particular state.  Despite the power of a foreign procurator, Montenegrins and Serbs lived on the territory of the country, as now.  Later, the Albanians, who currently make up a third of the population of Podgorica, began to inhabit the city.  A considerable percentage of Slavic bloods is located on the territory of this state, because the XI - XII centuries, before the Turks and Mongol-Tatars seized power over this region, the tribes who came from Kievan Rus lived here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Montenegro Podgorica" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/16261.jpg" width="600"></div>

The metropolis is located under three large hills, the highest of which is called Goritsa.  This name was first mentioned in documents dating back to 1326, and since then it has repeatedly changed, however, like the state of Montenegro itself.  Podgorica, however, has always had its former name for the <span>natives</span> . </p><p>  Unfortunately, all those ancient and historically important monuments of art and architecture that were located on the territory of the city earlier are inaccessible to the eyes of a modern tourist.  The fact is that during the Second World War the city was completely destroyed, and the foundation remained from most of the buildings at best.  In 1946, the capital of Montenegro was renamed Titograd and built up with new type of buildings.  Also, in the middle of the last century, the Podgorica Airport was built there, which is of global importance and is a large transport hub. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Podgorica Airport" class="if" height="274" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/16262.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The history of Podgorica can be seen in its museums and other cultural institutions.  The city is rich in state libraries and theaters, galleries and monuments, among which tribute is paid to Russian poetry.  It is presented in the form of a monument to Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin, which is located in the central part of the city.  It is also worth noting that in addition to intellectual attractions, the capital of Montenegro is full of natural advantages.  Tropical mild climate and proximity to the <span>Adriatic Sea, a</span> large number of greenery and flowers - this is the main decoration of Podgorica. </p><p>  This warm city is "permeated" by the waters of five rivers.  On the outskirts of the metropolis there are river beaches where you can relax no worse than on the sea coast.  And hotels, which are more than enough on the territory of Podgorica, will help any tourist to stay comfortably in the city. </p>
