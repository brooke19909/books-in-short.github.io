And there are reasons for this, for example, bright colors are used in creating the design, the Scandinavian style is maintained, and the build quality and materials complement the ‚Äúimage‚Äù.  At a party with professional musicians from any of the Urbanears models, it‚Äôs not a shame to appear.  However, potential buyers have relevant questions: how good are these headphones in performance and sound.  Let's look at several models to understand what this ‚Äúbeautiful cover‚Äù really is. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="earphones urbanears" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1882046.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Options models Plattan and Zinken </h2><p>  The manufacturer supplies both models in cardboard boxes.  They are made of thin canvas.  The package includes documents, a removable cable type.  Plattan can also be found to charge the battery.  There is no cover or case, although many modern models are equipped with one of them.  But on the other hand, by European standards, these models are quite inexpensive - 99 euros, so it makes no sense to hope that the manufacturer has put any bonuses. </p><h2>  Headphone Design </h2><p>  Urbanears headphones are sold in different colors.  Reviews about the appearance are positive.  In the market you can find different models - from black to purple.  Why is that?  In Sweden (the manufacturing country), headphones are sold in specialized clothing stores, which is why companies are trying to make their equipment for all possible options.  Also, this solution makes the headphones bright and fashionable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="urbanears headphones reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1882051.jpg"></div>

Hinges are made of metal.  Thanks to them, the model can both rotate and fold.  The angle of rotation of the cups is small, so many owners claim that the hinges are superfluous. </p><p>  One of the cups has a 3.5 mm jack, the second 6.3 mm.  This allows the use of cables with different plugs.  Accordingly, there is no need to use an adapter.  In the Plattan model, everything is a little different.  These <span>wireless headphones</span> have a cable with a remote control and a microphone, but there are 3.5 mm connectors at both ends.  The cord is extremely thin, has a fabric coating.  Does not rustle and does not bring discomfort.  Often the owners carry this cable with them as an alternative solution if the battery is exhausted.  The headband has a cloth roller.  It can be removed and washed if necessary.  For the latter, water not hotter than 30 ¬∞ C is used. </p><p>  Overhead type headphones, respectively, can put pressure on the ears.  However, over time, the spring loosens.  The charging port for the battery model is on the right side of the bowl.  You can immediately find the button to turn on the device and search for the source of music.  This is all the same key.  To activate the search, you must hold it for six seconds.  The same cup has a touch control panel on the upper side.  Here you can answer incoming calls, change the playlist and increase / decrease the volume.  The Plattan model has an indicator next to the panel.  If it glows in red, then the battery should be recharged, if white - then the battery condition is 100%. </p><p>  The drivers of both models have the same diameter - 40 mm.  However, the designs are different.  Zinken headphones have a double diaphragm, while Plattan only a single diaphragm.  Both are made by hand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="earphones urbanears kransen" class="if" height="430" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1882052.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sound patterns </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the models have serious differences in design, their sound remains at the same level.  In any case, if you connect the wireless model using a cable.  The upper frequencies are noticeably lowered, the lower ones are excessively raised.  This is striking when listening without the equalizer turned on.  Especially if you use a computer as the <span>sound source</span> .  With smartphones, these problems are almost invisible.  Such a contrast between the frequencies was created in order to brighten up the weak power of the phones.  When playing with stronger devices (some tablets, computers, musical instruments, etc.), the sound is often distorted.  However, reviews about it, in connection with the price category, are not bad. </p><h2>  Performance Model Plattan </h2><p>  Without additional recharging, the model can work up to 14 hours, but this figure is inaccurate.  It all depends on the volume, music level, distance to the sound source.  Many owners use headphones for about 3 days and only then charge. </p><h2>  Urbanears Kransen Model Feature </h2><p>  Earphones Urbanears Kransen are often used with phones from the American "apple".  Connection is via cable.  Headphone sensitivity - 100 dB.  The frequency range is from 20 to 20 thousand Hz.  Headphones of a dynamic type, represent a typical headset in the form of plugs.  The impedance is 32 ohms, and the membrane has a diameter of 10 mm.  There is no mount, and the cable has a braid of fabric. </p>
