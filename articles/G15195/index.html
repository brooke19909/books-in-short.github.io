Dias (1488) and Vasco de Gama (1498), who sailed here to replenish fresh water reserves.  In 1799, during the war with Napoleon, the British authorities erected the stone fort Frederick here.  He was supposed to protect the settlement from the landing of French troops.  Fort Frederick has survived to this day - it is one of the attractions of Port Elizabeth. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.thenational.ae" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="photo port elizabeth" class="if uuid-2999532" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46001/2999532.jpg"></div><p>  In 1820, 400 thousand immigrants from Britain arrived here to establish the Cape Colony, which was supposed to strengthen the influence of Europeans in southeastern South Africa.  Until that time, the territory was under the control of Zulu tribes, forming Zululand.  The Zulu king Shako allowed the settlers to establish a city on these lands in exchange for a gift in the form of firearms. </p><p>  The city received its name in honor of the late wife of Elizabeth, the first governor of the Cape Colony - Sir Rufan Donkin.  Since 1861, he received autonomy status with the local municipality.  The rapid development of the city began in 1873 with the construction of the railway to the city of Kimberley. </p><p>  During the 2nd Boer War, the port became a transit point, as  soldiers sailed here on ships, food supplies and horses were brought.  Due to hostilities, the city was replenished with refugees, among whom were Boer families with children.  They were interned by Great Britain in concentration camps. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.nmbt.co.za" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Horse memorial" class="if uuid-3000043" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46001/3000043.jpg"></div><p>  In 1905, at the direction of the mayor of the city, Alexander Fettes, a monument was unveiled to the horses who died in the war.  In total, more than 300 thousand horses fell here during the hostilities.  The monument is one of 3 such memorials in the world. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Climate and industry </h2><p>  For Port Elizabeth (South Africa), the climate is subtropical, during the year there are light rains.
