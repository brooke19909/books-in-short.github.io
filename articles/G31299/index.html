This is a very profitable business, because, due to the fame of the original scenario, the project is guaranteed to have the necessary audience even before the release of the screens.  This happened with the film "Maleficent", the plot of which is built on one of the old tales. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A significant role in the success of the film was played by the participation in it of Angelina Jolie, who, by the way, coped well with her role.

    <p>  The Disney company is engaged in the production of full-fledged feature films, and does this very successfully.  The first film from the Pirates of the Caribbean series was released in 2003.  It should be noted right away that this is not an animated film, but the quality of the special effects in it was truly amazing for that time. </p><p>  The plot tells about the adventures of heroes who, unwittingly, were involved in a showdown of pirates.  In the first film, three main characters immediately appear, the adventures of which will be discussed in the following films.  Among them is the beloved pirate Jack Sparrow, played by the famous actor Johnny Depp.  Many are sure that it was the charisma of this actor that in many respects became the reason for such a huge popularity of films.  It is worth noting that there is some truth in this, because Johnny Depp is so good in the role of a pirate that his hero catches the viewer from the first seconds. </p><h2>  Disney Channel Original Movie: Featured Films </h2>
