How to get to the Babushkinskiy park?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Finding a good place for a budget holiday with the whole family in the capital is not always easy.  Not everyone can organize trips to nature; modern entertainment centers quickly get bored.  I want something simple and comfortable, as in our childhood.  Grandma's park offers a cheap and pleasant place to relax - a special place in modern Moscow.  In a small area there are various <span>activities for children</span> and adults, but there are many quiet areas for walking.  This is a favorite place for many residents of the region and Muscovites living for several blocks. </p><h2>  Historical reference </h2>

In the early years of its existence, this oasis of nature did not know much care, but even then the locals went for walks here.  Seven years after the opening of the park, it was decided to improve it.  The first tracks, sports and playgrounds, an open stage and much more.  In 1955, the village of Losinoostrovsky was the city of Babushkin.  The reconstruction was carried out everywhere - the streets were renamed, new houses and <span>public buildings</span> were built.  In the spring, on the holiday of peace and labor, the Grandma‚Äôs Park of Culture and Rest re-opened after reconstruction.  In less than ten years, the city of Babushkin will become part of Moscow and become one of its areas.  The status of the park will also change, but the new name will remain with it.

Their authors are most often people who have not been there for a long time.  After the collapse of the USSR, like many other cultural objects of that time, the natural corner was really launched.  Financing problems affected: old benches and rides began to break, but no new funds were allocated, bushes and trees were not trimmed, there were no interesting events.  A whole generation of residents of the district, who were perplexedly looking at an abandoned square not far from their houses, had successfully grown up.  The park really has a relatively small area.  However, despite all these factors, in the troubled nineties of the previous century, his story did not end. </p><h2>  Green <span>Moscow: Babushkinskiy</span> park - revival </h2>

The events related to the improvement took place not by accident in that year, because very soon the park should have turned 50 years old.  The changes affected the appearance of the whole natural territory: new paths and benches were arranged, the lighting system was reconstructed, and landscape design was carried out.  The infrastructure of the park was also noticeably updated.  Today it is a modern open-air complex, which will be interesting to visit for adults and children of any age.

This is a multifunctional children's town, decorated in a bright design.  Entertainment is completely safe even for the smallest, thanks to the use of a modern ‚Äúsoft‚Äù coating in its zone instead of traditional asphalt.  There is a playground for children with disabilities.  On weekends and holidays, entertainment programs are held, and on weekdays you can <span>ride a horse</span> or pony or go to the "Living Area".  All these entertainments for a moderate fee are offered to their guests by the Grandma's Park.  The official site of the nature and cultural reserve (bapark.ru) has a detailed program of upcoming events, which is regularly updated.

In the capital there are indeed many larger and more interesting places for walking and leisure.  But Grandma‚Äôs park is noticeably different from most of them.  This place has a special atmosphere, it is easier to breathe and think better.  Getting here is not so difficult.  The correct address of the park is ul.  Menzhinsky, 6. The recreation area is located at the intersection of this street with st.  Comintern.  By your own car it is more convenient to get from the center along Prospect Mira.  If the route is laid from the MKAD, you need to navigate on the street.  Ostashkovskaya, then on the street.  Yenisei, and only after the metro station "Babushkinskaya" turn off at the first intersection.

    <p>  If you are traveling by train, you need to go to the Losinoostrovskaya station, after which you will have to walk a bit.  Grandmother's Park is located at some distance from the metro station of the same name, it is about 3-4 stops by ground transport.  There are many buses and taxis, which can be reached in a few minutes.  You can have a good time in the <span>park zone</span> without money - admission is free.  The cost of tickets for the rides is acceptable, you can have a bite to eat and rent a bike, roller skates or skis in the winter during the winter.  What is especially pleasant - free of charge is visiting the park even on holidays, when mass festivals and various concerts are held here. </p>
