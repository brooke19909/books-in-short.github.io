    <h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  When choosing a place to spend your vacation, always rely on the experience of travelers.  Quite a lot of information can be found on specialized resources about the hotel Reef Hotel 3 * (Adler).  Reviews demonstrate the following advantages of this institution: </p><ul><li>  very polite staff who are trying in every way to please the guests and instantly solve any problems; </li><li>  in the event that the room you have reserved is free, you do not have to wait two hours in the afternoon in order to check in; </li><li>  the rooms are very bright and clean with a beautiful sea view; </li><li>  there is an ironing board and an iron in the corridor, which are shared by several rooms (this is much more convenient than asking them at the reception or at the maid each time); </li><li>  very beautiful, clean and well-groomed area; </li><li>  very convenient location near the public beach and the central promenade; </li><li>  very beautiful <span>design of the hall,</span> as well as a pleasant decoration of the rooms; </li><li>  daily clean cleaning as well as changing towels; </li><li>  within walking distance there are many grocery stores, as well as cafes and entertainment clubs; </li><li>  There is a good transport interchange nearby, which is very important if you like to travel independently to sightseeing places. </li></ul><h2>  Hotel Reef 3 * (Adler) - reviews, description of the shortcomings </h2><p>  In no hotel, perhaps, everything is perfect and without flaws.  The same can be said about Reef Hotel 3 *.  Traveler reviews speak of the following negative points: </p><ul><li>  an unpleasant moment can be considered that the description of the numbers on the sites does not correspond to reality (or rather, all the positive characteristics concern only the suites); </li><li>  in the bathroom there is no bathrobe or slippers (although their presence is indicated in the advertisement); </li><li>  a prerequisite for service in the restaurant is the order of a comprehensive meal, otherwise you will not be able to try dishes from the menu (but this rule only applies during off-season); </li><li>  not very hearty breakfasts; </li><li>  Wireless Internet does not work very well, and therefore, if you urgently need to resolve some issues via the network, the only way out is to ask the administrator for a stationary computer </li><li>  terrible soundproofing in the rooms (especially for rooms located on the ground floor); </li><li>  in most rooms there is no balcony, and therefore there is simply nowhere to dry swimwear; </li><li>  if your bathroom has run out of hygiene items, then the maid will not bring them until you ask her about it; </li><li>  in some rooms guests noticed cockroaches; </li><li>  upon arrival, you may not be accommodated in the room you booked; </li><li>  the beds have very hard pillows, after sleep on which the neck is terribly sore; </li><li>  despite the fact that a huge package of satellite channels has been announced, in fact it shows no more than 10. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Hotel Reef 3 * makes a positive impression.  Thanks to the small but very clean and well-groomed area, an incredibly cozy atmosphere is created.  There are few rooms in the hotel, and therefore almost all guests manage to get to know each other and make friends. </p><p>  The hotel has an incredibly favorable location.  Just a couple of minutes walk is the public beach (and if you do not want to go anywhere, you can swim in the pool).  Very close is the central promenade, which can be safely called the epicenter of the resort life of Adler.  There is also a bus stop nearby, which gives you the opportunity to independently visit the nearby resort towns, as well as cultural attractions. </p><p>  Separately, it is worth noting the infrastructure of the hotel.  There are all the necessary facilities to feel comfortable and not to leave the hotel once again.  The rooms are quite spacious and bright.  But with regard to the work of the restaurant, it does not satisfy all guests.  So, for example, if you rest in the "off season", then you can not try the dishes from the menu. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the furniture and repairs are a bit outdated, the atmosphere is quite cozy.  This is largely due to the good work of the maids, who carefully maintain the cleanliness of the rooms.  Also, one cannot fail to say about the professional work of the reception desk staff, who strive to please and assist the guests in every possible way. </p>
