It is noteworthy that tourism began to develop here not so long ago - a little over twenty years ago.  During this time, a small town overgrown with forests turned into a party place known throughout the world.  It is interesting that the name was given to the city by one amazing find.  In a lost cave, archaeologists accidentally discovered an ancient icon depicting the Virgin.  A chapel was erected at this place, and then a temple, where tourists now come for excursions.  And the city itself was named after the findings of Ayia Napa, which translates as "sacred forests."  Today, this place is primarily famous for its magnificent sandy beaches, an abundance of water entertainment and nightlife, which even the famous Ibiza can envy.  The resort has a lot of various hotels, among which a tourist with any financial capabilities can choose for himself something.  If you are also planning a trip to Ayia Napa (Cyprus), the Chrysland 3 * hotel is the place that is worth choosing for your stay.  Today we will tell you in detail about this hotel complex. </p>

    <h2>  Brief information note </h2><p>  The cozy and almost homely hotel Chrysland Hotel 2 * is ideal for budget travelers who consider it a great option for family and outdoor activities.  From all sides the hotel complex is surrounded by blooming gardens, so its territory is hidden from prying eyes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is noteworthy that the hotel is considered quite small.  There are a lot of such hotels in Cyprus and their staff treat their guests with great care, many of which return here more than once.  Chrysland Hotel 2 * offers guests twenty-three comfortable rooms of three types.  The apartments are located in a two-story building, there is also a reception and a restaurant. </p><p>  It is interesting that in many tourist catalogs the hotel is called a little differently - Chrysland Hotel &amp; Gardens Club 2 *.  Therefore, having met a similar name, do not be surprised - we are talking about the same hotel complex.  Sometimes there is confusion with the stardom of this hotel.  In some directories it has two stars, and in others - three.  This confuses the tourists, and they begin to doubt their choice.  In fact, if you trust the reviews for Chrysland Hotel (Ayia-Napa, Cyprus), then the hotel can be assigned two stars with a plus.  It meets all the requirements that apply to hotel complexes of this category.  However, guests are often surprised by the cleanliness of the rooms, excellent service and beautiful, albeit small territory. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  Chrysland Hotel 2 * is located on the outskirts of Ayia Napa.  From here, the city’s most famous beach can be reached in a matter of minutes, having walked only seven hundred meters.  Keep in mind that the beach is municipal, so all hotel guests will have to pay for sunbeds and umbrellas on the coast. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Many tourists like that the Chrysland Hotel 2 * is located in a very secluded and quiet place of the city, from where, however, it is quite easy to get to the resort center with its entertainment venues.

This distance can be easily covered in about an hour.  Tourists usually use taxi or public transport. </p><p>  Most travelers advise guests of the Chrysland Hotel 2 * hotel in Cyprus to rent a scooter or other form of transport.

    <h2>  A few words about the hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  A fairly small area is a hallmark of the Chrysland Hotel 2 *.  Hotels in Cyprus, however, often have a similar characteristic.  It is difficult to find a hotel complex with an area of ​​several thousand square meters.  Therefore, be prepared for the fact that you will spend your free time at the hotel by the pool. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It causes tourists only positive emotions.  Many say that he can safely compete with the pools, which are located in five-star hotels.  The water in the bowl is thoroughly cleaned, and the relaxation area is crowded with sunbeds and umbrellas.  They are more than enough for all guests, so taking seats from the very early morning is not required. </p><p>  The reception in the lobby is open around the clock, there are also safes.  You can use them for an additional fee.  In the main building there is a small and homely restaurant.

    <h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  The hotel complex has a very cozy restaurant where guests are offered tasty and reasonably priced cuisine.  Guests usually have breakfast at the hotel, so they should take into account that, according to Greek tradition, its beginning is often delayed.  This is a hallmark of the Cypriots, which should be treated with understanding. </p><p>  Many tourists write in their reviews that the hotel breakfasts are a bit peculiar.  They consist of omelet, a modest assortment of sausages and sausages, two or three types of pastries and a fruit basket. </p><p>  Lunches and dinners are held in a very beautiful setting, they are often covered on the terrace in the light of candles and lanterns.  Guests are given a menu and all dishes are ordered accordingly.  Drinks in the evening are more expensive than in the morning and afternoon.  This is noted by all guests of the hotel complex. </p>

    <h2>  Description of rooms </h2><p>  All apartments in the hotel are well equipped with everything necessary, but guests mention that the furniture and textiles in the rooms already need updating.  Therefore, the overall impression of the rooms is mixed. </p><p>  The air-conditioned rooms are equipped with a fridge and satellite TV.  Our compatriots can enjoy watching several Russian channels.  The bathrooms have a hairdryer and cosmetic set, which, however, is replenished only a few times a week. </p><p>  Each room has a small balcony, and the telephone in the room has access to the city.  Guests are offered three types of apartments: </p><ul><li>  twin; </li><li>  double; </li><li>  family. </li></ul><p>  Each option is available for booking online.  However, in this case it will be quite difficult to cancel the reservation. </p><h2>  Chrysland Hotel: prices </h2><p>  The cost of a ticket to the hotel complex is very attractive for those tourists who are used to being economical about their vacation.  On average, a tour for two with a departure from Moscow will have to pay no more than thirty-five thousand rubles.  Of course, these prices are relevant for the autumn period.  Please note that in summer the cost of tours is always higher than in other seasons. </p><h2>  Positive feedback from tourists </h2><p>  The numerous comments left on the Internet indicate the many advantages of living in this hotel complex.  We decided to note the most common: </p><ul><li>  peace and quiet in the hotel; </li><li>  proximity to the most beautiful beach in the resort; </li><li>  fast working internet; </li><li>  instant check-in; </li><li>  delicious cocktails at the bar; </li><li>  free selection of excursions. </li></ul><p>  The guests also mention the friendly staff and excellent food, which, however, does not differ in variety.  Although the last nuance does not spoil the vacation too much for tourists, because all the dishes are served fresh and are suitable even for children. </p>

    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Do not forget about the negative comments.  Their guests also leave in sufficient quantities.  What causes this reaction among tourists?  Let's get it together: </p><ul><li>  proximity to the road; </li><li>  closing the hotel at eleven o’clock in the evening (later getting into it is quite difficult); </li><li>  poor nutrition; </li><li>  poor housekeeping; </li><li>  constant comments by the hosts to the hotel guests about the noise (in such cases, even the police are called); </li><li>  an abundance of paid services. </li></ul><p>  Such a number of minuses does not spoil the reputation of the hotel, because for two stars it is pretty good.  Therefore, it can be recommended to active young people who are not ready to spend a lot of money on vacation and prefer to constantly move around the resort, rather than sit in the walls of the hotel complex. </p>
