As a child, he could gather around the children and start telling them something.  Already at this age, it became clear that he has certain inclinations of a <span>public figure.</span> </p><p>  Eugene was developed beyond his years and, as he himself claims, already at school wrote one of his first historical works.  Eugene Panasenkov owes his love to history to his father.  The young man grew up and was brought up in a decent and educated family.  His mother worked as an engineer, and his father as a military doctor. </p><p>  Parents noticed that their <span>child was talented,</span> and therefore they did not give him to study at a secondary school, but to one where he could study English in depth.  The guy graduated from school in 1999 and immediately entered Moscow State University.  He studied at the Faculty of History and paid most attention to the personality of Napoleon, as well as his military campaigns.  Panasenkov has made presentations at various conferences at various times.  These conferences have always been fascinating, because the student knew how to intrigue people. </p><p>  In fact, a very <span>interesting person is</span> Evgeny Ponasenkov.  Photos from his scientific conferences show a person who is really passionate about science.  A talented young man did not want to receive a diploma stating that the university was graduated.  He graduated in 2004. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Historical activity </h2>

    <p>  As a historian, Yevgeny Ponasenkov managed to achieve considerable heights, and this despite his age.  Participation in conferences on the wars of Napoleon did not pass without a trace.  After graduating from Moscow State University, he publishes a book called ‚ÄúThe Truth About the War of 1812‚Äù.  This book was interestingly written, but received many negative reviews.  The fact is that the author did not praise the Russian army, as they always used to do, but looked at events from a different angle.  Eugene wrote that not only France, but also Russia was to blame for this war.  He also mentioned that the political and military leadership of the country of that time showed itself mediocre.  The book became very popular and helped Panasenkov become a prominent figure in history. </p><p>  In the summer of 2014, he reads out a report describing the model of reforming Europe that was proposed by Napoleon and Alexander I. He also talked about how Russia's foreign policy developed during the reign of Alexander I. The work again received both opponents and adherents.  The thing is that the historian never praised Russia in his works, but tried to look at what was happening as an independent figure. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Reviews on historical works </h2>

    <p>  As mentioned above, not everyone shared the views of Panasenkov.  For example, Agronov said that the work of a young historical figure is aimed at rewriting history, as well as sowing anti-patriotic sentiments in society.  He also believed that Eugene biased assessed the history of Russia in his works. </p><p>  Agreed with Agronov was another historical figure - by the name of Ivchenko.  He accused Panasenkov of lack of professionalism and banal rewriting of history. </p><p>  There were those who spoke on the side of the young author.  These include Irina Gennadievna Dagrysheva.  In her dissertation, she supported everything that was written in The Truth About the War of 1812, and added that Napoleon really did everything to avoid a bloody war, but Russia's policy towards France forced him to start military operations. </p><h2>  Literary activity </h2>

It is worth noting that he is the author of a huge number of scientific papers, which were published not only in Russian. </p><p>  The first book is the famous ‚ÄúTruth about the War of 1812‚Äù.  The second book was written in 2007 and was called Tango Alone. </p><p>  At the moment, Eugene no longer wrote books.  Do not forget that he is only thirty-three years old, which means that he will be able to write many more interesting works. </p><h2>  Activities on television </h2><p>  As a student at Moscow State University, Evgeny Panasenkov begins to work on television.  He first appeared on television in 2003.  He was the leading column in the weekly Kommersant-Vlast. </p><p>  In 2006, he became a member of another project and now leads his own column in the magazine "Queer".  He has spoken with a wide variety of articles on many different topics. </p><p>  In 2012, when all of Russia celebrated the centenary of the victory in the war against Napoleon, Eugene speaks on the Dozhd channel, where he once again confirms that this war is more far-fetched, and denies that it is worth celebrating this date.  On the same channel, he participated in many programs that discussed the domestic and foreign policies of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  In 2013, Panasenkov became the host of the program, in which he regularly reviews world-class cinema novelties. </p><p>  Six months later, he conducts another program, which is called "Drama of History."  It is worth noting that he was not only the leader, but also one of the authors. </p><p>  In the spring of 2015, Panasenkov first appeared on the radio, where he entered into a discussion with one of the deputies. </p><h2>  Cultural activities </h2>

    <p>  Not much information is available about what Eugene represents in life, outside of television screens.  This is due to the fact that the young man is fully focused on his career.  As he noted more than once in an interview, you must first make a successful career, and then think about something else.  That is exactly what Yevgeny Ponasenkov believes, whose personal life does not indulge in an abundance of information. </p><p>  If you carefully look at the biography of this person, you can see that after graduation he annually became a participant in any projects or worked on something of his own. </p><p>  The young man is a native Muscovite.  After all, his parents were born precisely in the glorious city of Moscow, where Evgeny Panasenkov lives now.  Biography, personal life - <strong> </strong>  all this regularly becomes the subject of interest of journalists.  And about the latest information is not as much as we would like. </p><p>  The family has an important place in the life of a man.  He repeatedly stated that it was his parents who made him who he is at the moment.  It was they, as well as their instructions, that formed in him those views that many historical and cultural figures of Russia reckon with today. </p><h2>  The results.

    <p>  Today, the historian, actor and director is extremely popular.  It is difficult to find a person who does not know who Evgeny Ponasenkov is.  Despite the fact that his views are often contrary to public opinion, he is respected and respected as a very talented person. </p><p>  Eugene was one of the first who was not afraid to speak out differently.  Despite his age, he managed to achieve a lot.  He is known as a person who always has his own view on any situation.  He became precisely the one who was not afraid to oppose public opinion, and this can be seen in the book ‚ÄúThe Truth About the War of 1812‚Äù. </p><p>  In the book "Tango in solitude" made it clear that he really sometimes had a hard time, Eugene Ponasenkov.  His personal life is a vivid example of this.  Indeed, many simply turn away from him because of his views. </p><p>  Despite everything, he managed to succeed.  If Eugene will continue in the same vein, then, without a doubt, he will be able to become one of the most famous figures in the world of cinema, history and in many other directions. </p><p>  Ponasenkov is the idol of many young scientists.  They strive to achieve at least part of what Evgeni Konstantinovich managed.  Of course, this person will go down in history. </p>
