Things made with hot glue look original, and the pride in the do-it-yourself interior elements is very legitimate.  Consider some of the many existing examples of how to use a glue gun not only for its intended purpose. </p><h2>  Vase or candlestick decoration </h2><p>  There are a lot of options for decorating a vase with hot glue, and we will consider some of them. </p><p>  For example, one of the simplest decorations of an inexpensive glass vase without any patterns is simply drawing lines on the walls of this utensil.  It is necessary to twist the object and apply evenly layers of glue in a circle.  For convenience, you can ask someone to help rotate the vase while you decorate it.  And you will need nothing for this: the candlestick itself or any other object and a glue gun directly tucked into the socket.  Below is a photo of the craft with a glue gun. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.crateandbarrel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vases decorated with glue gun" class="if uuid-2848527" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104418/2848527.jpg"></div><p>  You can also make a nice holder for a glass, vase or candlestick.  To do this, you need to stock up on the item itself, which needs decor, seasoned with a glue gun, acrylic paint in a spray can or oil spray, but any vegetable one will do.  The vase must be washed and wiped dry, and then on the outside cover it with a thin layer of oil.  Then, in a chaotic manner, patterns should be applied.  It is worthwhile to ensure that the lines of the drawing are well interwoven and clearly drawn.  This is necessary so that you can easily remove the holder from the glass.  You need to draw a pattern both on the sides and at the bottom.  Now it is very carefully necessary to remove the hardened glue.  The item of utensils that has been used should be thoroughly washed again.  Next, paint the holder in the desired color, wait until the paint dries, and reinsert the glass, vase or candlestick into it.  If necessary, they can be removed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Consider another version of crafts using a glue gun in this topic.  You will need a container that needs to be decorated.  To its walls should be glued fairly tightly transparent hemispheres.  You can additionally paint them in different colors, or you can leave them transparent.  Both options will look stylish.  The minimum accessories for this craft: a glass, a jar or a vase, half pearls and a gun with hot glue. </p><h2>  Snowflakes </h2><p>  To create this <span>New Year attribute,</span> you need to have a glue gun with glue on hand, nail polish or regular acrylic paint, parchment paper and a snowflake stencil that can either be drawn or printed, but this item is optional for those who are sure that which will draw a beautiful snowflake anyway.  A snowflake drawn on writing paper is placed under a parchment sheet, a hot glue is drawn around the drawing and it is waiting for it to dry.  Next, you need to carefully separate the almost finished crafts from the parchment and paint it on both sides.  Such snowflakes are well suited for decorating the interior and New Year's costumes.  And the same sheet of parchment paper can be used several times. </p><p>  This is what these crafts made with a glue gun look like. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hot glue snowflake" class="if uuid-2848536" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104418/2848536.jpg"></div><h2>  Multi-colored dots </h2><p>  Hot glue can be used to create cutest workpieces, which in the future will be useful for decorating other crafts.  One of them is multi-colored dots.  To implement this idea, you must have a gun loaded with hot glue and acrylic paints or varnish.  Everything is done very simply: the required number of dots of glue are applied to the surface treated with oil.  After drying, they need to be painted.  You can use such points to decorate a variety of crafts, postcards, etc. Such crafts with a glue gun are presented below in the photo. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hot glue dots" class="if uuid-2848652" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104418/2848652.jpg"></div><h2>  Pouf from a car tire and twine </h2><p>  This is the most functional craft from our selection.  It looks like a cool designer thing, and it will cost mere pennies.  So, what is needed to make a pouf?  Tire, twine (or other rope), plywood, loaded gun with hot glue, sandpaper, self-tapping screws, jigsaw, furniture stapler, knife and drill. </p><p>  A jigsaw needs to cut a circle with a diameter slightly larger than the size of the hole in the tire.  If necessary, the edges should be sanded.  Then, on a thoroughly cleaned pre-tire, which will become the basis for crafts using a glue gun, a plywood blank is applied and holes are made for self-tapping screws in both parts.  Next, they are held together.  From the center of the circle they begin to lay the ‚Äúsnail‚Äù rope, smearing with glue each subsequent turn.  When the gluing is completed, carefully cut off the excess cord with a knife and shoot its end to the tire with a furniture stapler.  Now the rope needs to be well treated with moisture-proof impregnation or varnished.  After drying, the pouf can be used. </p><p>  The article presents various crafts that can be done.  With a glue gun, legs can be attached to the pouf. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.upcycledzine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pouf made of tires and twine" class="if uuid-2848555" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104418/2848555.jpg"></div><h2>  Homemade bracelet </h2><p>  This jewelry will appeal to both adults and children.  Depends on how the bracelet will be made.  Making it pretty simple.  On an aluminum can from under soda, you need to put several horizontal lines in a circle, which will be pretty tightly in contact with each other.  The width of the bracelet will depend on the number of these lines.  After the glue on the jar has dried, it must be removed.  In order for the workpiece to become a real bracelet, it can be painted and decorated with various rhinestones, stones, beads and in general anything, depending on the imagination and capabilities of the master. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ch" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hot glue bracelet" class="if uuid-2848579" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104418/2848579.jpg"></div><h2>  Magic wands </h2><p>  Various crafts will help create the atmosphere of the world of Joan Rowling books.  Using a glue gun, you can make magic wands.  On wooden knitting needles or chopsticks for Chinese food, you need to apply glue strips indicating the handles, sometimes flowing onto the sticks themselves.  The strips need to be painted in metallic colors in harmony with the colors of the sticks themselves and decorated with beads or artificial pearls.  Here is a fabulous paraphernalia for a stylized holiday, theatrical production or fan fiction ready. </p><div class="photo" data-original="birthdayblueprint.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Magic sticks with glue gun" class="if uuid-2848562" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104418/2848562.jpg"></div><h2>  Precautions </h2><p>  Despite the type of crafts that can be done with the glue gun you choose, you must remember the safety rules: </p><p>  Firstly, do not give children hot glue guns that are plugged in, because they can get severe burns. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.homeheartcraft.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vases from cans and bottles" class="if uuid-2848572" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104418/2848572.jpg"></div><p>  Secondly, when working with glass and a glue gun in working condition, it is always necessary to wear safety glasses, since the vessel may burst and injure you. </p><p>  And thirdly, cans, glasses or vases designed to become candlesticks, you need to take quite wide in order to avoid the melting of the pattern applied with glue, which can happen if the container is very hot. </p>
