In the town, the number of inhabitants of which does not exceed 200 thousand, the tourist infrastructure is actively developing, and more and more foreign visitors come to get acquainted with the ancient village, located on the shores of the Aegean Sea. </p><h2>  Resort with developing tourist infrastructure </h2><p>  The colorful Piraeus (Greece), whose history goes back to ancient times, is a rather noisy and lively city that provides tourists with great opportunities for relaxation.  The settlement became part of the country in the 19th century.  After the construction of the railway connecting the resort with Athens, it became the main port of the state.  International deliveries were made through it, and the country's sea gates, which gained a reputation as a tourist center, began to develop economically. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="piraeus greece" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1741275.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Unfortunately, many travelers do not stop at the resort, but use Piraeus (Greece) only as a transit point.  However, it makes sense to take a closer look at the picturesque corner, where the combination of fresh air, amazing nature and the genuine hospitality of the locals will leave a pleasant impression. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Resort located on the lands of Attica </h2><p>  <span>The port of Piraeus</span> is located twelve kilometers south of Athens, in the bay of the Saronic Gulf.  From the capital of the state, it can be reached by public transport or metro.  Lying along the shores of the Aegean Sea, it is located on the lands of the cradle of ancient Hellas - Attiki.  Attica (Greece) is the true heart of a many-sided country where myths and traditions come to life.  This region is divided into two parts: Athens with the suburbs, which includes the port, and other areas. </p><p>  The main source of income for the resort, given its geographical location, is shipping.  Cruise ships and ferries arrive daily here.  However, in recent decades, the tourism business is gaining momentum, and new hotels, restaurants, entertainment venues and shops are appearing in the city. </p><h2>  Climate and weather </h2><p>  A large number of sunny days and a comfortable Mediterranean climate are ideal conditions for a wonderful holiday on local beaches.  The swimming season, starting in May, lasts until October. </p><p>  The hottest months are July and August, and the best time for hiking and sightseeing is autumn or spring.  And even a warm winter will not frighten travelers who want to get acquainted with a city that has been keeping its own face for many years. </p><h2>  Kastella Hill and Area </h2><p>  Piraeus (Greece) is famous for its hill of Castella, which is the highest point in the city.  A fantastic view of Athens and the picturesque bay opens from its top, and not a single tourist leaves without taking photos of the enchanting panoramas of the surrounding area.  Here is one of the most interesting areas of the resort - Castella, which delights with neoclassical-style mansions that are connected by quaint labyrinths of narrow streets. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="attica greece" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1741286.jpg" width="600"></div>
