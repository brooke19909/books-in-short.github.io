Style, cut, design are constantly changing from one century to another.  One thing is invariable in this amazing outfit - it always emphasizes female beauty, grace and makes a woman even more tender and irresistible.  Each dress is beautiful in its own way, but it is especially elegant if the sleeve is cut out with a "flashlight", that is, it is slightly trimmed or draped along the shoulder line or on the cuff.  Any woman can make a pattern of a sleeve-flashlight.  You just need to take the basis of the drawing and simulate the assembly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern sleeves flashlight" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14030/442324.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  We make a <strong>pattern of a sleeve-flashlight</strong> </h2><p>  If you decide to sew a romantic dress, then in most cases it is planned to assemble on the sleeve.  <span>Pattern dress</span> with a sleeve "flashlight" is very easy if there is a basis for the drawing.  There are several types of such dresses.  Sleeves flashlights can be different.  Assembly can be done at the bottom and bottom.  To obtain this type, you will need to take a drawing of a short-sleeve pattern.  Draw three vertical lines on it, where one should be in the center (that is, on the elbow), and the other two on the sides (one on the shoulder notch and the other on the other side), and it is important that the distance between them is the same .  Then the drawing along these lines is cut and extended to the required width (this will depend on the intended assembly). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Sleeve assembly </h2><p>  Again, the base of the dress or shirt will be required.  <span>Pattern blouses</span> with sleeves "flashlight" is built according to the above method.  Only in this case, the assembly will be mainly on the bottom and, possibly, slightly - on the okat.  Three lines are also applied: along the elbow, along the shoulder incision.  Only in this case, you will only need to extend the drawing along the bottom.  That is, the upper points on the lines are left in the initial position, and the lower ones are moved apart to the desired width.  The resulting pattern of a sleeve-lantern will only have to be circled on paper or fabric.  The bottom of such a sleeve is usually processed from the bottom by the cuff. </p><h2>  Sleeve flashlight long </h2><p>  Romantic blouses and dresses can be for any time of the year.  And if there is a basic pattern of the sleeve "flashlight" (long or short, it does not matter), then it can always be modeled.  Only need to take the basis of a <span>dress with a long sleeve.</span>  And the assembly can be outlined both at the bottom and at the bottom, and it is quite possible in two places at the same time.  It depends on the desire of the woman.  The principle of modeling is the same as in the first two cases.  Three lines are outlined and drawn, and then, depending on the location of the assembly, they are moved apart in the drawing. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Fancy Sleeves </h2><p>  In the world of fashion, what is not being created.  The same flashlight sleeve today can be seen not just gathered in the usual way, but with folds.  This is a somewhat complicated model, but you can also master it if you wish.  The pattern of the sleeve-flashlight can be made exquisite.  The basis of the drawing is taken.  You must immediately determine the length, draw a line and cut off the excess.  Then future folds are outlined.  From the point of the elbow bend (that is, the center), two more points must be noted at the same distance in both directions.  Next, draw a line down from the elbow point (this line will not be cut, it is needed to build folds).  Then draw lines from each upper target point in an oblique direction to the center.  The picture should resemble parquet.  That is, two triangles should be outlined in the drawing.  From the acute angle of the upper triangle, a line is drawn to the lower triangle.  The marked lines are cut and extended to the desired width.  Circle the outline. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sleeve pattern flashlight long" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14030/442351.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Other types of sleeves "flashlight" </h2><p>  Fantasy and imagination are the main principle of every fashion designer.  Smart sleeves can be made in various ways.  Assembly can only be performed in the center of the shoulder fold.  Instead of assembling, you can make several folds there.  Based on the drawing, you will need to draw two lines: horizontal and vertical.  The vertical line is drawn from the shoulder fold, and the horizontal line along the axillary hollows.  These lines are cut.  In the drawing, you should get two triangles.  Now you need to push them in different directions, but do not take them away from the armpit points.  The point on the shoulder fold moves apart, and the triangles rise from the horizontal line.  This sleeve is called "with a raised head."  There will be assembly at the okay, and the bottom - you can simply bend it or process it with a grinder or cuff. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern blouses with sleeve flashlight" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14030/442342.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Thus, we can conclude that the pattern of the sleeve-flashlight can be done by ourselves, and if you have at hand a drawing of the base, then, having shown imagination and ingenuity, you will get a unique outfit.  Only it is necessary to remember many familiar advice from tailors that it is necessary to measure seven times and cut off once.  Thinking over the <span>model of the sleeve-</span> flashlight, you should first carefully calculate everything on paper, and only then cut it onto fabric. </p>
