This is a real masterpiece and a great achievement of Russian architecture.  On the vast territory there are several chic palaces, fountains and water cascades, landscaped parks.  Peterhof Palace Park is popular with tourists from all over the world.  Often, guests from other countries come to Russia only to see this miracle with their own eyes. </p><h2>  The history of the architectural and park complex </h2><p>  The first mention of Peterhof in historical sources dates back to 1705.  At that time it was just a marina with which you could get to the island of Colin and the “courtyard yard”.  In 1712, at the direction of Peter I, the construction of a pompous summer residence begins; the Grand Palace was founded in 1714.  Peterhof was not chosen as a place to create a unique complex by accident.  Peter the Great wanted to have a residence more beautiful than Versailles.  The landscape in this area made it possible to build systems of water cascades and fountains capable of working around the clock in the season.  Peterhof Palace Park was built and rebuilt from the 18th to the 20th century, and each subsequent emperor added something of his own.  After the events of 1917, a complex of parks, gardens and palaces was opened to the people as a museum.  To a large extent, the reserve was damaged during World War II, but after that it was carefully restored and reopened its doors to visitors. </p>

    <h2>  Peterhof Palaces </h2><p>  Experienced tourists say that even for the whole day it is impossible to explore the entire territory and expositions of the palace and park ensemble.  The central and most interesting object of the reserve is the Grand Palace.  It was in it that the members of the royal family lived and arranged chic receptions for several centuries.  Several times, the Grand Palace partially changed its appearance, and today, according to its decoration, you can track various periods of history.  Peterhof Park, as you know, was laid by Peter the Great.  The favorite palace of the great sovereign - Monplaisir (literally translated from French - “my pleasure”) has survived to this day.  Most often, the emperor stayed here (in the modern exhibition you can see many personal things of Peter the Great).  During a walk along Peterhof, tourists can also visit the Catherine’s building, built for receptions and balls during the reign of Elizabeth Petrovna, and the Marly Palace, erected to accommodate distinguished guests. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Lower Park and Upper Garden </h2><p>  It is believed that Peterhof Reserve gained worldwide fame precisely thanks to its Lower Park.  It was originally decorated in a trendy French style (regular).  Even in the time of Peter the Great, smooth geometric paths, beautiful pavilions, evenly trimmed trees and shrubs appeared here.  The park has many sculptures and fountains.  A straight line of the sea channel stretches from the Grand Palace to the bay, dividing the green zone into two equal parts.  Peterhof Lower Park is famous for its fountains.  This cascade is “Chessboard”, “Sun”, “Greenhouse Fountain”, cascade “Golden Mountain” and some others.  The upper garden was used for household purposes until the second half of the eighteenth century.  And only at a later time sculptures and fountains appeared here. </p>

    <h2>  Cascades and fountains of the Upper Garden </h2><p>  The first fountain in the Upper Garden appeared in 1734.  Initially, in its center was a huge oak made of lead.  Hence the name - “Oak”.  Today, the round pool is decorated with a gushing sculpture of Amur taking off the mask.  Incredibly spectacular looks "Neptune" - a fountain, opened in 1736.  Initially, it was decorated with the sculpture "Cart of Neptunov", but at the end of the 18th century it was replaced by a similar composition.  Also in the Upper Garden you can see the fountains of Square Ponds and the "Mezheumny". </p><h2>  Peterhof (park): ticket prices and tourist information </h2><p>  How much does an excursion to this unique museum reserve cost?  For the convenience of tourists, it is proposed to purchase tickets separately for exploring the Upper Garden / Grand Palace and Lower Park.  The first tour will cost 400 rubles for Russian citizens and 550 rubles for guests from other countries.  And how much does the entrance to Nizhny Peterhof (park) cost?  The cost of visiting for foreign tourists is 500 rubles, for Russian citizens - 300 rubles on weekdays and 400 rubles on weekends. </p>
