The previous model was supplied by stock, which contained seven months of using communication services, which is a considerable period.  The current version of Smart-2 can also be purchased for 490 rubles, however, the period of use of the package of services from Beeline is reduced to four months. </p><p>  Also, manufacturers equipped the smartphone with mobile TV and made some improvements to the <span>technical characteristics of the</span> device.  In Western countries, mobile operators have long begun to sponsor the release of mobile devices for their SIM cards.  In the United States, you can buy a modern iPhone, which will cost the buyer several times cheaper than its cost, but the user must enter into a two-year contract with a particular company. </p>

    <p>  According to the laws of the Russian Federation, the user can change the mobile operator at any time.  For suppliers of communications there is no sense and benefit to conclude contracts for a long time.  Russian operators began to look for a way out and come up with various solutions to the situation.  One of these options was the Beeline Smart 2 communicator, the user reviews of which we will now consider.  So, everything in order. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Beeline Smart 2: reviews, specifications, features </h2><p>  The smartphone supports the operation of only one proprietary SIM card, if desired, you can unlock it for another operator.  The mobile device has a dual-core processor with a capacity of 1.2 GHz.  With regard to the power of Beeline Smart 2, the reviews of the owners indicate that it is enough to perform simple tasks: working with applications, surfing the Internet and watching videos.  For most games with high graphics or large applications, the smartphone is not suitable.  In addition, the device has the following characteristics: </p><ul><li>  Android 4.2.2 operating system </li><li>  4 GB of internal memory; </li><li>  RAM 512 MB; </li><li>  screen size 4 inches, like most budget models; </li><li>  The battery contains 1200 mAh. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smart 2 beeline reviews" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19307/691466.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><p>  Despite the availability of the Beeline Smart 2 smartphone, user reviews often emphasize that the display can please with good color reproduction and viewing angles.  It supports 16 million colors, with a resolution of 400x840 pixels.  The functions have a brightness adjustment key, which allows you to achieve optimal performance.  There <span>are proximity sensors</span> and lighting.  As for the sensitivity of ‚ÄúSmart 2‚Äù (Beeline), the reviews of experts who happened to check the capabilities of the communicator are very positive: the <span>touch screen</span> responds well to touch, during testing it did not have to be pressed twice. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Photo and video </h2><p>  Let us consider in more detail what other Beeline Smart 2 smartphone reviews are.  Photos and videos in this device, unfortunately, are not at the highest level.  <span>There is no front camera</span> in the mobile phone, but the main one is only 3.2 megapixels.  However, it is possible to configure various shooting parameters, this allows you to take photos that are quite acceptable in quality, despite the fact that the <span>phone is budget-friendly.</span>  In conditions of good lighting, the pictures are quite good, they lack blurriness and noise.  After taking the photo, you can immediately upload it to social networks. </p>

    <p>  As for the weaknesses of the Beeline Smart 2 camera, the reviews of the owners name the absence of a flash among the shortcomings.  The smartphone supports wireless communications and navigation.  There is a built-in radio, but it can only be turned on using the headphones.  The weight of the smartphone is quite light - 123 grams, the body is made of high-quality plastic.  At the same time, the Beeline Smart 2 phone, the owner‚Äôs reviews confirm this, cannot please the design.  The back panel of the mobile device is covered with fine grain, which helps prevent the smartphone from slipping, but the space is often clogged with dirt and dust. </p><h2>  What are you getting </h2><p>  The package consists of the smartphone itself, a charger, a Beeline SIM card, a connecting cable, a <span>warranty card</span> and a user manual.  There is no memory card, just like a headset.  Manufacturers, apparently, did not consider it necessary to invest in 2 or 4 gigabytes of media.  However, this is not so important for those who lack 1.7 GB of internal memory.  Inserting a large card in volume and because of this increase the cost of a mobile device does not make sense.  Some users may well do without additional memory. </p>

    <p>  Discussing the Beeline Smart 2 smartphone (reviews confirm this), users were much more sensitive to the lack of a headset in the kit, as this leads to the inability to use radio and mobile television.  Manufacturers should have taken this fact into account and included at least cheap headphones.  Now it is recommended to purchase a headset with a smartphone so that all the functionality of the device is available. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The 1200 mAh battery in active mode lasts about a day.  For a four-inch smartphone, such a battery is clearly not enough, it is more suitable for mobile devices with a 3.5-inch screen, low performance and resolution.  If the operator‚Äôs service package includes a mobile TV unlimited in traffic, then the battery lasts only 2-3 hours. </p><h2>  Parsing </h2><p>  As for the appearance of Smart 2 (Beeline), reviews for the most part insist that the previous model of the budget smartphone was much more interesting in design than the current one.  In the latest version, you can see only the standard case without any hint of the original appearance.  The smartphone is available in black and white, although it is very difficult to find light mobile devices on sale.  On the back cover there is the name of the mobile operator, but it does not catch the eye. </p>

    <p>  It is quite difficult to open the device; obviously, you cannot do without using improvised tools.  In some smartphones, manufacturers snap the back cover on the device and separately put the battery in the package.  Then you have to work hard, because when you try to open the "base", it bends and lends itself very hard.  As for the Smart-2 device, the battery is already present inside the mobile device, but it is still very difficult to ‚Äúcrack‚Äù it. </p><h2>  Ease of use </h2><p>  On the right side face is the volume control key.  It is inserted together with the decorative part, and finding it with one hand is not easy.  It‚Äôs quite comfortable to work with this button, because its progress is clear and easy.  The power button is located on top of the end of the case, it has to be used often, so the button protrudes slightly for better visibility.  The camera in the plastic rim does not stand out much from the base of the smartphone.  A headset jack is located on top of the end. </p>

    <p>  One positive feature is the location of the microphone at the bottom of the front panel.  This is especially true for users who are used to holding it in their left hand during a conversation on a mobile, which often leads to overlapping sound. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Smartphone manufacturers were able to slightly improve the functionality of the device.  For such an attractive price, Smart 2 is a very advantageous offer.  The communicator also has some disadvantages - it is an inexpressive design and a delay in processing a large amount of information.  This device is suitable for everyday use, but you should not expect great performance from it.  Such is the Beeline Smart 2 smartphone.  The reviews and specifications that we provided in the material can help you make a decision about the possible purchase of the device or refusal of it.  It all depends on your phone requirements. </p>
