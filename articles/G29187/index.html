And regardless of the place of stay, unpleasant events can occur with a person associated with a health condition, loss of luggage, and an emergency.  Very often the affected person experiences such events on the territory of his state on his own or with the help of friends.  However, away from his native places, an insurance policy will come to his aid. </p><h2>  Is insurance required? </h2><p>  When traveling outside the country, each tourist is obliged to take out insurance for traveling abroad.  Such requirements are connected with the fact that in recent years the number of travelers has increased, and as a result, there are more people who urgently needed medical attention.  Earlier, such representative offices and consulates of our state, located in other countries, dealt with such issues.  Now, the presence of honey.  insurance for traveling abroad is mandatory if a person temporarily leaves the borders of his state. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.insubuy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="car insurance for traveling abroad" class="if uuid-2330540" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52023/2330540.jpg"></div><h2>  Benefits of Insurance Coverage </h2><p>  Most European countries require a health insurance contract for an insurance amount of at least thirty thousand euros.  The insurance policy covers the costs that will be incurred by the insured person or the insured as a result of the need for qualified medical assistance.  Medical insurance for traveling abroad guarantees the traveler the assistance of specialized doctors, if an accident occurs, the chronic disease worsens.  When you draw up documents with an insurance company, you can further expand the validity of the document in case of cancellation of the trip, loss of things, other additional expenses associated with extraordinary events. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.livestrong.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="travel health insurance" class="if uuid-2330492" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52023/2330492.jpg"></div><h2>  How does a medical policy work in another country? </h2><p>  By arranging insurance for traveling abroad, the insurer provides the client with information about the company, which is responsible for organizing work with medical institutions.  Assistance - this is the name of the company whose employees accompany the client of the insurance company in the event of an insured event.  In a telephone mode, the employee will listen to the problem, answer the questions that have arisen, send to a qualified specialist who is located next to the client‚Äôs location, arrange delivery to the hospital and will advise on all other situations. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelsense.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="insurance abroad" class="if uuid-2330514" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52023/2330514.jpg"></div><h2>  How to conclude a medical insurance contract? </h2><p>  Insurance for travel abroad is carried out by insurance organizations that have a valid license for such an insurance product.  There are situations when an insurance contract is issued together with a tour package.  The policyholder should check whether this insurance company has the right to draw up such contracts in order to protect itself far from the homeland from unscrupulous insurers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you have to deal with the insurance policy yourself, you should find out all the nuances of this type of insurance from an employee of the insurance organization.  It is necessary to pay attention to the contract, which gives an expanded list of insurance coverage.  At the conclusion of the contract, it will be correct to indicate truthful information about the type of vacation so that the insurance company does not have a desire to refuse to compensate for the costs incurred. </p><p>  For registration of the contract, you need to have with you only a passport and cash.  If there is no desire to get to the office of the insurance company, Sberbank insurance for traveling abroad, issued in the electronic version, will save time and nerves. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.ingleinternational.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cost of insurance policy for traveling abroad" class="if uuid-2330511" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52023/2330511.jpg"></div><h2>  Insurance contract price </h2><p>  The amount of insurance payments that will need to be transferred to the bank account of the insurance company depends on many factors.  First of all, the country where the client of the insurance company travels and the size of the insurance amount affects the price of insurance for traveling abroad.  So, for a trip to Schengen countries, the minimum liability of the insurer is thirty thousand euros.  At the same time, if a compatriot leaves for the USA or Canada, then for these countries the smallest amount of the insurance sum under the contract is indicated in the amount of fifty thousand dollars. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The next item that affects the size of the insurance premium is the number of days of insurance.  After all, the contract can be executed both for a few days and for a whole year of insurance coverage.  The number of tourists, if this is a group trip, also affects the final cost of insurance for traveling abroad. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.coverfox.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="insurance policy price" class="if uuid-2330491" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52023/2330491.jpg"></div><p>  When applying for a policy, you should pay attention to the size of the deductible.  It is clear that the higher its size, the cheaper insurance is.  However, this is a factor that should not be saved.  By choosing a franchise of one hundred to two hundred euros, you can reduce the insurance payment by two to three euros.  However, with an insured event, as a rule, acute toothache or ear pain, the amount of the cost of treatment is within two hundred euros. </p><p>  The age of the insured or the policyholder also affects the final size of the insurance premium.  After all, the older the person, the greater the likelihood that an insurance event may occur. </p><h2>  Classic insurance program </h2><p>  The standard contract includes the following points of liability of the insurer within the sum insured for the costs incurred under such items: </p><ul><li>  call a doctor; </li><li>  hospitalization or outpatient treatment; </li><li>  urgent surgical intervention; </li><li>  diagnostic studies; </li><li>  medicines and medical supplements; </li><li>  patient transportation; </li><li>  home delivery of minor relatives; </li><li>  arrival of relatives for care; </li><li>  emergency dental care (examination, analysis, treatment, removal); </li><li>  expenses of search and rescue teams and delivery to a medical institution; </li><li>  repatriation (delivery of the body to the homeland in a tragic case). </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.insubuy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="validity of the insurance contract for departure" class="if uuid-2330557" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52023/2330557.jpg"></div><h2>  Additional insurance conditions </h2><p>  When arranging insurance for traveling abroad, insurers offer not only medical insurance, but also additional liability options.  <span>Accident insurance</span> can be added to medicine <span>,</span> this will not only cover classic expenses, but also receive financial assistance from the insurance company to restore health. </p><p>  There are times when, upon arrival in another state, a traveler is in trouble with luggage: he may be lost or damaged.  For such a case, there is a separate clause in the insurance contract, and if it is also noted, then disappointments from the trip will be reduced by the possible amount of compensation for losses. </p><p>  The insured, having applied to the insurance company, can also issue an insurance policy in case the long-awaited trip does not take place for a number of reasons, namely: </p><ol><li>  To obtain a visa, many embassies require insurance.  However, a visa will be issued or not at the time of conclusion of the contract, the client of the insurance company does not know.  For such cases, an option has been developed that allows you to protect yourself in case of refusal of a visa. </li><li>  The client of the insurance company was urgently hospitalized or injured in an accident, and therefore could not go.  This also applies to children and parents who were supposed to take part in the trip. </li><li>  Damage to the policyholder as a result of an accident or accident that occurred through the fault of third parties. </li></ol><p>  In these cases, the insurance company compensates for the cost of purchasing tickets, paying for hotel rooms, and other related expenses. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.expatmedicare.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="conclusion of a medical contract" class="if uuid-2330618" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52023/2330618.jpg"></div><h2>  Special insurance conditions </h2><p>  It should be noted that, when preparing insurance for traveling abroad, it is necessary to fill in, if any, special marks.  So, foreign citizens are obliged to inform that they are non-residents.  In such cases, the insurance payment is calculated according to another program. </p><p>  If the insurance document is drawn up for a pregnant woman, this feature should also be noted in the contract.  This is due to the fact that during a stay in the territory of another state, unexpectedly, a woman may begin premature birth or other complications will occur.  With this option, the client of the insurance company can not worry about the monetary side of the issue. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wwwnc.cdc.gov" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="special conditions medical insurance abroad" class="if uuid-2330518" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52023/2330518.jpg"></div><p>  When applying for travel to another country to work or participate in sports, it is necessary to warn the insurer about this.  Naturally, this will affect the final cost of the policy, however, it will save the insurer's budget for an insurance event.  If you do not knowingly inform about this, the insurance company has the full right to refuse to the insurer in compensation of monetary expenses for treatment and restoration of health. </p><h2>  Car insurance </h2><p>  When traveling on a vehicle, you need to think about an insurance contract for a car.  When buying car insurance for traveling abroad, check the clauses of the insurance contract that state the liability of the insurer.  There are times when an insurance company does not compensate for the cost of property damage if an accident or car theft occurred in the territory of another state.  In addition to insuring the car itself, at the border crossing, the traveler must have a Green Card compulsory liability insurance contract.  Without such a policy, the driver will not be able to enter the territory of another country. </p><p>  Going on a trip, you should not save on additional options.  Indeed, it is precisely such special annexes to the main agreement that make you feel at home anywhere in the world - calmly and confidently. </p>
