    <h2>  Holiday Village "Emerald" (Vityazevo): reviews </h2><p>  Despite all the positive aspects, there are always some negative aspects that can ruin the impression of the institution.  The Emerald Hotel (Vityazevo) was no exception.  2016 reviews contain such negative comments: </p><ul><li>  the cost of a transfer is much more expensive than a taxi service; </li><li>  the hotel does not have its own beach, and the public is very groomed; </li><li>  if you book a transfer in advance, do not hesitate to remind about this several times, because you can simply be forgotten about; </li><li>  the pool is very small, and therefore all guests are physically unable to use it; </li><li>  the animation is very noisy and intrusive; </li><li>  almost until the morning, music and other noise from neighboring entertainment establishments reached the rooms; </li><li>  some of the rooms face the windows of the neighboring hotel; </li><li>  paid sunbeds and umbrellas on the beach; </li><li>  the restaurant menu has very few fruits (even in the summer season); </li><li>  water in the pool stinks terribly bleach; </li><li>  towels are changed every 3 days; </li><li>  since the hotel is almost full in the summertime, you don‚Äôt have to rely on early check-in (moreover, during a tedious wait, guests are not offered to eat or drink coffee); </li><li>  very uncomfortable cots;  under the bed they don‚Äôt wash the floor, and therefore there is a huge layer of dust and debris from previous guests; </li><li>  maids constantly leave their cleaning equipment in the rooms; </li><li>  constant interruptions in electricity and water supply; </li><li>  often elevators can be found inoperative; </li><li>  both in the territory and in the premises there are a lot of artificial flowers; </li><li>  the floor in the lobby is very slippery (the problem is further exacerbated when guests who have just bathed in the pool pass through it); </li><li>  this, of course, is a trifle, but it is not very pleasant that the license plates on the doors hang crookedly; </li><li>  in the playroom for children there is very little entertainment; </li><li>  it is inconvenient that only one key to the gate is given to the number; </li><li>  in the restaurant there are no salt shakers on the tables, and if they appear, then the salt in them at the very bottom is already petrified; </li><li>  balconies are not thought out in terms of child safety; </li><li>  the hotel does not have concierges or any other employees who will help you find a room or carry heavy suitcases; </li><li>  at late check-in, dinner is not provided; </li><li>  sometimes maids forget to replenish hygiene supplies in the bathroom, and therefore have to ask them about this additionally; </li><li>  there is no clothes dryer on the balcony, you have to buy and pull the clothesline yourself; </li><li>  the food in the restaurant is monotonous, and therefore annoying after a few days. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  <span>Hotel "Emerald"</span> is a fairly new institution with its advantages and disadvantages.  In general, travelers are offered acceptable conditions for recreation.  Well-groomed territory, beautiful buildings, freshly renovated rooms - all this contributes to the formation of a positive impression of the hotel.  In addition, here guests are offered good nutrition, which is important.  The hotel is suitable for both adults and children.  Many guests compare this institution with similar Turkish ones. </p><p>  Nevertheless, each barrel of honey has its own fly in the ointment.  The main problem of this hotel is the frequent power outages.  Because of this, the water supply stops, the elevators stop and the restaurant's work schedule shifts.  There are some security issues (the biggest problem is the slippery floor).  Well, of course, I would like more attention to the guests.  Each tourist will be pleased if they take him to the room, organize a tour of the territory, and also help to convey things.  And, of course, it‚Äôs worth borrowing from foreign hotels the practice of dinner for guests arriving at the hotel at night. </p>
