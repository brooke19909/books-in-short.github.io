We invite you to the beautiful and legendary <span>island of Rhodes,</span> where, according to myths, a developed civilization existed 14 centuries before the birth of Christ.  Among the many of his hotels, we chose Belmare Hotel 3 * - a small, inexpensive, but, according to our tourists, in all respects worthy.  This nice place has a lot of advantages that turn rest into a series of carefree happy days.  But he also has a number of features that are useful to know in advance. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Every tourist traveling to Greece wants to get something of his own from the rest.  Some travel for the sake of the sea, others crave entertainment, others are interested in shopping, and others are attracted by unique sights.  Belmare Hotel 3 * is the most suitable for those who like a harmonious measured rest on the coast of the subtropics away from the hustle and bustle of megacities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Belmare Hotel 3" class="if" height="344" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1553217.jpg" width="499"></div>  The hotel is built on the southeast side of Rhodes, near the small village of Lardos.  In a straight line to its center - 2 km, and on the road - a little less than three.  Fans of antiquities will like the fact that the most famous Greek city of Lindos after Athens is no more than 6 km from the hotel.  But for those who plan to have fun at nightclubs on vacation, Belmare is not very suitable, since there are practically no entertainment centers in the immediate vicinity.  Rhodes - the island‚Äôs capital of the same name, which can not be visited, is not far from the hotel, namely 52 km, which are more convenient and cheaper to travel by regular buses, a stop of which is a couple of tens of meters away.

Rhodes is a fairly large island, so there is an excellent international airport called Diagoras.  Flights from a dozen Russian cities are carried out here in the summer.  The airport is located near the village of Parasidi, which is 14 km from the capital of Rhodes.  In a straight line from Diagoros, the hotel is only 35 km away, which many leaflets report.  But the village of Parasidi lies in the north-west of the island, and there is no highway to its opposite side, there is only a very winding road of local importance.  Therefore, the detour from the airport to the hotel is about 55 km.  Tourists are brought to the place by transfers of welcoming travel agencies that have sold vouchers.  Those who booked a hotel room on their own, you can get to it by taxi or from Rhodes by bus to Lardos, and then also take a taxi. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Belmare Hotel 3 Rhodes" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1553220.jpg" width="497"></div>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  Belmare Hotel 3 * looks quite nice.  The photo shows a two-story snow-white building in the Greek style, with a facade decorated with greenery.  The hotel opened in 1993, but here, literally every year, before the start of the season, they make the necessary repairs, improve the territory, and check the functionality of the rooms.  Therefore, the age of the hotel - more than 20 years - is not felt.  All tourists in their reviews note that the territory of Belmare Hotel 3 * is small, but all surrounded by greenery and flowers.  A fountain has been built in front of the central building, which is illuminated in the dark and the hotel owners are very proud of it.  Here, not far from the fountain, free parking is equipped.  The hotel does not have a chic garden on the territory where you can stroll in the evenings or relax on a bench.  On the territory there is only a swimming pool and an outdoor terrace on which you can eat or just sit, admiring the nature around. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Belmare Hotel 3 * (Rhodes, Lardos) is a classic Greek ‚Äútroika‚Äù, where traditionally the main attention is paid to the comfort of guests, the cleanliness of all rooms and the whole territory, creating a friendly home atmosphere.  The reception is open in the lobby of the main building.  The staff speaks Greek and English.  Here you can leave your suitcases for storage, hand over valuables to the safe (for a fee), rent a car, call a doctor and taxi, buy bus tickets.  There is a separate sector in the lobby where breakfast is served, and a bar is located nearby.  That's the whole hotel infrastructure. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Belmare Hotel 3 pics" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1553221.jpg" width="501"></div>

    <h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Only 50 rooms are offered by Belmare Hotel 3 *.  Reviews about them are only good.  As in most Greek "triples", the category of rooms is one - the standard, but they are for two, three and four guests.  The difference is in area and in the number of pieces of furniture.  The design of the rooms is simple but pleasant, the sound insulation is satisfactory, the windows and balcony doors are new, well closing, the balconies are very spacious, with summer furniture, but without dryers, views from the sea and mountains that surround this area.  Equipment - beds, a wardrobe, nightstands, a mirror, chairs, a table, air conditioning (free, it works quietly), a refrigerator (without a minibar), a TV with several Russian channels, an electric kettle, dishes and sets for coffee tea, Wi-Fi. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The hygiene room has a washbasin, a shower (in some rooms there is a shower cubicle, in others there is a tray with a curtain), a toilet bowl.  All necessary hygiene products are provided. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Belmare Hotel 3 reviews" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1553222.jpg" width="498"></div>

    <p>  The rooms are cleaned (according to the reviews of tourists) perfectly, linen is changed strictly according to the schedule. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Some travel agencies offer packages with Al meals at Belmare Hotel 3 * (Rhodes).  Reviews of tourists say that this is not entirely advisable, since there are nice little restaurants with a variety of Greek dishes at reasonable prices near the hotel.  The hotel food is somewhat monotonous.  Breakfast here is continental.  Their menu: cereal, milk, boiled eggs, sandwiches, salads, butter, jam, pastries.  For lunch, soups, meat and fish dishes with side dishes, salads, fruits are served.  For dinner, about the same as for lunch, only without soups.  According to the vacationers at this hotel, the choice of dishes is small, but always everything is fresh, tasty cooked.  In two bars (near the pool and in the lobby) you can take ouzo, grape vodka (crayfish), wine, beer and soft drinks all day for free. </p><p>  As such, the hotel does not have a restaurant; meals are held either in the dining area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe lobby or on the outdoor terrace.  Everywhere everything is always clean, tidy, there is enough space for everyone, the waiters are smiling and quick. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Belmare Hotel 3 Rhodes reviews" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1553223.jpg" width="498"></div>

    <h2>  Services for children </h2><p>  Belmare Hotel 3 * can offer its young guests cribs in the rooms and highchairs in the restaurant.  There is nothing more for the kids at the hotel.  The pool located on the territory is designed for adults and teenage children, as it is quite deep at any point.  Animation, playground, mini club and nanny are not provided in Belmare.  According to tourists' reviews, there are shops near the hotel where you can buy diapers and baby formulas, and the hotel is always happy to warm up milk or pour the right amount of boiling water. </p><h2>  Leisure for adults </h2><p>  Belmare Hotel 3 * will be an ideal place for those tourists who do not like noise, hustle and bustle, even if festive.  Life here is measured and calm, and all vacationers entertain themselves on their own.  Hotel facilities include an outdoor pool.  It is always clean, as workers clean it thoroughly and every day.  The depth in the pool is from 1.6 meters, the area is average.  There are always free umbrellas and sunbeds around. </p><p>  The hotel's restaurant hosts dinners with live music several times a week. </p><p>  Nearby is the Hotel Olive Garden, where entertainment is held daily.  Belmare organizes free transfers there. </p><p>  That's all the entertainment that is offered here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Belmare Hotel 3 Rhodes Lardos" class="if" height="341" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1553219.jpg" width="501"></div>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Belmare Hotel 3 * is appreciated by many tourists for its proximity to the sea.  You need to go to it on a direct road leading from the main entrance to the hotel.  How long it takes to go depends on who has the speed of movement, but even parents reached the coast in 4-5 minutes with their babies and prams.  The beach here is municipal, sunbeds and umbrellas cost 8 euros per day per set, but you can just sit on the sand on your own bedding.  In Greece, all prices, including beach accessories, fall at the end of the season.  So in September, the same set of an umbrella and a pair of sun loungers costs 5 euros for the whole day.  The sand on the beach is clean enough.  Floors are laid along the water.  There is a small strip of small pebbles near the shore, and then sand again, but some stones under your feet can come across.  Depth starts close, so you need to look after the kids here.  The water is always as clear as possible, but, as in the whole Aegean Sea, it warms up only by the middle of June.  The beach is equipped with showers, cabins, a bar and a toilet.  Among the entertainments there are "cheesecakes", jet skis, "bananas" and other attractions.  In the evening, shows are held several times a week on the beach. </p><p>  A little away from the municipal beach there is a wide strip of "no man's" shore, where you can relax without any restrictions.  The only caveat: there is a rocky entrance to the water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Belmare Hotel 3" class="if" height="341" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1553218.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  Basically for tourists looking for a relaxing holiday with unobtrusive service, and for those who expect to travel a lot around Rhodes, Belmare Hotel 3 * is suitable.  Lindos, a city that rivals Athens in antiquity and sightseeing, is less than 6 km from the hotel.  You can get there by bus for just 1.8 euros per adult.  In addition to the unique Acropolis, there are also places of entertainment - bars and restaurants with live music, night clubs.  But dimos Lindos strictly monitors the peace in the city, so many institutions are closed by midnight.  For enchanting night adventures, you need to go to Rhodes, which is not quite convenient to get to, since the buses go on schedule and after 9 pm they stop working.  The ticket price for them is 6 euros, and for a taxi - from 100 euros per car.  All this must be taken into account when buying a tour at Belmare Hotel 3 *. </p><p>  As an option, you can rent a car that costs from 50 euros per day.  If you take a car for a longer period, the price is slightly lower. </p><p>  Near the hotel in the evening there is especially nowhere to walk.  There is no promenade as such, only the beach, several taverns and residential villas.  Those who wish can take a walk to the village of Lardos, where there are a bit more taverns and shops, but there are no entertainments there, even the promenade. </p><p>  The hotel is happy to provide a room (if prepared) at any time, without waiting for the scheduled check-in schedule. </p><p>  All guests who have a significant event in their voucher (birthday, wedding anniversary, etc.) are given a bottle of wine, fruit, and a small gift by their employees. </p><h2>  Belmare Hotel 3 * (Greece, Rhodes, Lardos), reviews </h2><p>  This hotel in all travel agencies has a rating of 4.5 to 4.7 points out of 5 possible, which is an excellent indicator.
