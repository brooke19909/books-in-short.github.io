Until 2015, the Necklace of the Moscow Region was considered a large settlement, but after the administration decided to reduce the territory, this status was lost.  It was called the microdistrict, which is part of the city of Kashira, namely 10 km south of the regional center.  Due to its small size, only one railway junction passes through the Necklace.  You can get here both by train, and by car or bus along the R-114.  And not far from the line of the Ozherelye microdistrict (Moscow region), there is the famous highway leading to the best resorts, called the ‚ÄúDon‚Äù M4. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="necklace Moscow region" class="if" height="286" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1271875.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Title </h2><p>  There are many rumors about the appearance of such an unusual name.  Rumor has it that after the locals of this okrug and villages fled and survived after the Tatar attacks and raids, they laid the first bricks of the city.  Once a carriage with Catherine II herself drove past the village, and she accidentally dropped her necklace.  After which the town was named Ozherelyevo. </p><p>  In fact, everything is much simpler, the settlement received its sonorous name thanks to the name of the first head of Ozherelyev.  So the city was called the Necklace of the Moscow region.  The transition from one word to another is very likely due to the reduction of sounds, which very often happens in spoken Russian. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Economy </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the status of the city no longer belongs to the microdistrict, the date of celebration of a kind of birthday is January 1, 2015.  The population of the Necklace is 10 300 people. </p><p>  The economy in the city is at a fairly high level, the main enterprise generating income and jobs is the <span>Locomotive DEPO.</span>  Its construction was started in 1934.  Following was built and the car depot.  In addition, Ozherelye (Moscow Region) has its own brick factory, now an inoperative bakery.  And a few kilometers from the line of the microdistrict, there is a feed mill and a poultry farm. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mr. necklace of the Moscow region" class="if" height="403" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1271870.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  First mention and check-in </h2><p>  According to legend, the city was subsequently formed by the Tatar pogrom, which occurred in 1571. Although this year is the official founding date, some facts appear, due to which it can be assumed that the city appeared long before the agreed period.  One of the reasons to think of Ozherelye (Moscow Oblast) this way is that the nearby tracts got the names of those figures who worked long before 1571. </p><p>  Also gives reason to believe about this and the names of the dry valleys - Krutoy, Lysy, Marygina.  This fact suggests that the resettlement of peoples to this territory did not occur after the pogrom, but as a result of arid weather conditions in the steppe zone.  Their names, associated with the word "log", were born from the lips of precisely these residents, because in Kashira and on the territory adjacent to it, this form of relief was called completely different. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãnecklace of the Moscow region" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1271877.jpg" width="600"></div>
