    <h2>  On the left coast </h2><p>  In historical information, there are two dates with which the birth of Yekaterinoslav is associated. </p><p>  It is proved that the city of Yekaterinoslav was founded for the first time on the left bank of the mighty Dnieper.  It happened on a river called Kilchen, just in the place where it merges with Samara.  Hence the name Ekaterinoslav-Kilchensky.  In this area, it was planned to lay not just an ordinary city, but a real fortress, which would be surrounded by swamps and forests.  She was supposed to be practically inaccessible to enemies.  But later it turned out that it turned out to be the same practically unsuitable for habitation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thus, on April 16, 1776, a decree was announced, according to which the construction of Yekaterinoslav was to begin eight miles from the left bank of the Dnieper.  Governor V. Chertkov personally occupied the place for construction work.  The construction project was led by N. Alekseev.  According to his developments, Ekaterinoslav (modern name - Dnepropetrovsk) was to consist of nine parishes.  Each of them had its own area.  Scientists suggest that it was intended for a market or church.  Most of the buildings were to be built of wood.  The future city was surrounded by <span>impassable forests</span> and deep waters. </p><h2>  The city as it was </h2>

    <p>  By the summer of 1778, more than 50 structures were built.  These included: the office, the house of the provincial prosecutor, the barracks, the church and the house of the governor.  There was also a pharmacy, prison and house of boundary officers.  Housing for clergymen, merchants and philistines was completely suitable for living.  Already in 1781 in Yekaterinoslav there was a postal yard, several churches, a bathhouse, an infirmary, schools, a court and a brick factory.  At this stage, the fortified city boasted the presence of almost 200 yards.  By decree of the <span>Government Senate, it was</span> announced that the construction of the settlement was almost complete. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But a little time passed, and Mr. Yekaterinoslav was in trouble - an epidemic of swamp malaria began.  The doctor, who arrived from St. Petersburg himself, conducted a rigorous and lengthy study.  In the end, he stated that Yekaterinoslav-Kilchensky is a terrain absolutely unsuitable for human settlement.  The authorities decided to close the settlement, and move the city to the right Dnieper coast. </p><p>  So, Yekaterinoslav (the modern name is indicated above) lasted only eight years.  After that, his status was lowered to county and gave the name Novomoskovsk.  But by 1794, the new settlement fell into complete decline.  He was transferred to the village of Novoselitsa, which was located higher in Samara.  Here today there is a city called Novomoskovsk. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ekaterinoslav city" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/614096.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  On the right bank </h2><p>  On the right bank of the Dnieper, the choice of place for the new Yekaterinoslav was personally dealt with by <span>Potemkin Grigory</span> Alexandrovich.  Many well-known engineers and architects helped him in this.  According to the new plan, it was assumed that the center of the settlement would be on Sobornaya Gora.  At that time there was nothing on it, only grass grew.  There were no swamps in this area.  It had a wonderful climate and even better views of the steppes and the Dnieper.  In a word, it was the exact opposite of the places on which Ekaterinoslav Kilchensky was founded. </p><p>  Potemkin conceived a colossal project for the construction of a settlement.  Dnepropetrovsk (Yekaterinoslav) was to become the center of cultural and economic life of the southern part of Russia.  It was assumed that he would become the center of New Russia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mr. Yekaterinoslav" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/614095.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Catherine's visit </h2><p>  Potemkin invited Empress Catherine II, whose fame he wanted to devote to the future city, to visit Crimea and New Russia.  He wanted the queen to get acquainted with this unsurpassed area.  Catherine agreed, and on <span>St. Nicholas Day,</span> May 9, 1787, on Sobornaya Gora, she laid and cemented the first stone of the future Transfiguration Cathedral. </p><p>  But this temple was not lucky enough to become a full-fledged church.  As soon as the foundation was flooded, Potemkin stopped further construction work.  Preobrazhensky‚Äôs pledge was conceived solely in order to hint to other states the military and economic power of the Russian Empire.  According to one version, it was 1787 that became the date when Ekaterinoslav was founded, whose modern name can be found in our article. </p><h2>  Pavel and Alexander I </h2><p>  In 1796, Catherine II died.  Power was inherited by her son Paul.  He also renamed Yekaterinoslav to Novorossiysk, his provincial status lowered to the county and generally forgot about the existence of the village as such.  As a result, the population began to leave the borders of this settlement in the same way as they had fled from Yekaterinoslav-Kilchinsky.  But all this did not last long: when the throne came under the control of Alexander I, the city again received its legal name and the ‚Äútitle‚Äù of the provincial center. </p><h2>  Some more names </h2>

    <p>  Yekaterinoslav (the modern name of the city is Dnepropetrovsk) at one time or another historical time had other names.  So, after the tsarist regime was tumbled down, and a civil war was raging in the courtyard, the city was unofficially called Sicheslav.  Thus, the legendary Cossack past of this region was noted. </p><p>  In 1924, when the communists came to power, they could not figure out the name of the settlement.  Its options were proposed as Krasnoslav, Metallurg, Leninoslav and others.  At the next congress of Soviets, it was decided to rename the city to Krasnodniprovsk, but this name was eventually rejected.  In 1926, the modern metropolis received the name Dnepro-Petrovsky.  After the reform of the Ukrainian language, it became Dnepropetrovsk. </p>
