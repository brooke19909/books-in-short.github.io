    <p>  Politics is a complex social phenomenon that arose 25,000 years ago.  Its goal has always been to orient society towards a development path by identifying a general direction that will have a creative basis.  The structure of politics is a complex phenomenon that includes its main elements and depends on the complexity of the <span>structure of society</span> in which it is implemented. </p><p>  For the first time this concept arose in Ancient Greece, and by it was understood the art of government. </p><p>  The current understanding of politics is divided into two categories: </p><ol><li>  Here, politics is presented as a way of managing society.  This is a classic scientific understanding of politics.  This also includes the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãpolitics as a way of relations between different social groups and segments of the population. </li><li>  Another idea of ‚Äã‚Äãit has a more radical color: here, by politics we mean the struggle between individuals and groups for power. </li></ol><p>  The abstract perception of a concept lies in its intangibility, however, it is fixed as a social institution with the help of state power and this allows us to perceive it as a manifest social phenomenon. </p><p>  The complex social structure of society implies a complex political structure reigning in it. </p><p>  <strong>Policy Structure: Key Elements</strong> </p><p>  The basic elements of politics are, first of all, political relations, by which they understand the forms of interaction and interconnection of political actors.  For example, domination and submission: some segments of the population are subordinate to a group of people who are given political power.  In modern states, political relations are regulated by law.  Among other political relations, the main ones are: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Consent. </li><li>  Conflicts </li><li>  Partnership </li></ul><p>  Other elements of politics are power, organization, culture, consciousness.  These elements are an integral part of politics, and their quality defines such broad concepts as the political, economic and political system. </p><p>  <strong>The essence and structure of politics</strong> </p><p>  Since it is aimed at <span>regulating social</span> and personal relations between people, it has a dual structure that defines its participants: animated subjects and inanimate elements.  The latter reveal the effect of the former. </p><p>  <strong>Policy structure: animated actors</strong> </p><p>  Such subjects are individuals, social groups and strata, as well as organizations that take part in <span>political processes</span> (they exercise state power or try to influence it themselves). </p><p>  Also, animate entities include various social institutions, which are represented by political parties, the media, trade unions and international organizations.  Indeed, these social elements take part in the political life of the country, somehow influencing it. </p><p>  <strong>Policy structure: inanimate actors</strong> </p><p>  They are types of relationships between people, groups, and organizations.  So, there are institutions that represent the interests of certain groups of the population.  They can be public or have a private founder, however, the influence on political life will be provided and therefore the relationship of the organization with the society fits the definition. </p><p>  Here we also understand the expression of attitude to political phenomena and their analysis.  This is largely carried out by the media. </p><p>  Also included here is the concept of political consciousness, which generally covers the presence of ideologies, political motives, and the psychology of power. </p><p>  The structure and functions of politics as a social institution: </p><ol><li>  Ensuring the stability of society. </li><li>  Mobilization of common activities. </li><li>  Regulation of social processes. </li><li>  Political socialization. </li><li>  Creation of guarantees of rights and freedoms. </li></ol><p>  These functions do not always find implementation, but they are an ideal that is achieved in developed countries, and is still ephemeral in lagging states. </p>
