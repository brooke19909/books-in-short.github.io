    <p>  Since Soviet times, it has been the custom that methodologists and teachers of pre-school educational institutions are very fond of dressing children with little chickens.  And no wonder!  What could be nicer than the small white and yellow lumps that dance a funny dance and strive to tell their poem the loudest! </p><h2>  Costumes for the very young </h2><p>  Not only for a celebration in kindergarten you may need a chicken costume.  He will look very cute and touching on babies from a year to three.  At a costume photo shoot in honor of Easter in such a costume, your baby will become a real star, and a simple dance on New Year's Eve, performed in such a costume, will certainly rip ovations from the hands of grandparents. </p><p>  When choosing a costume for a very small child, do not forget that the baby will not sit still.  The outfit should not constrain movements.  It is desirable that the material was as natural and pleasant as possible for the body, the suit conveniently ‚Äúsat‚Äù on the figure, did not slip and did not rise. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  All the decor elements of the product must be very securely fixed, since very young children put all the objects of interest to their mouths and can easily choke on a torn bead or button. </p><h2>  Buy or sew by yourself? </h2>

    <p>  In the markets and in children's stores, on the eve of the matinees, a mass of children's carnival outfits appears.  They represent the main characters of kindergarten theater scenes.  Among them there is sure to be a chicken costume. </p><p>  A simple outfit can be bought at a very reasonable price.  But such an acquisition has several drawbacks: </p><ul><li><p>  Firstly, the quality of inexpensive suits is very far from ideal, they are sewn from synthetic materials, cut at random.  As a result, they can hardly stand one performance. </p></li><li><p>  Secondly, the assortment contains one or two models.  If you want your child‚Äôs costume at the matinee to look original, this is unlikely to succeed with a purchased product. </p></li></ul><h2>  DIY chicken suit fast and easy </h2><p>  If you do not know how to sew a chicken suit, do not despair.  It does not have to be completely sewn.  You can study the wardrobe of the baby and, perhaps, there are suitable things in yellow.  It‚Äôs enough for the girl to pick up a sundress or dress, and the boy will need a t-shirt and pants.  On top of this kit will complement a loose cloak cut out on the principle of a musketeer cloak.  It can be decorated with a ribbon of artificial feathers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Particular attention should be paid to the choice of fabric.  Give preference to bright and saturated shades.  Then your child will stand out from the crowd of kids. </p><p>  The texture of matter is also very important.  Faux <span>fur,</span> fleece, satin or organza will be a good choice. </p><h2>  How to sew a hat with a comb <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to sew a chicken costume" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19526/385515.jpg?1398890229824" width="360"></div></h2><p>  Almost the most important element of the carnival costume is the headgear.  It is he who concretizes the image, makes it recognizable from afar. </p><p>  The kit described above will perfectly complement the cap with a scallop.  The principle of its manufacture is shown in the photo. </p><p>  You will need a white children's hat, red felt, a synthetic winterizer and a gun with hot glue.  According to the template, we cut out two details in the shape of a scallop, sew them, fill them with a synthetic winterizer to add volume, because the scallop is always in an upright position.  Then with glue we attach it to the cap.  Everything is quick and easy! </p><h2>  Fluffy chick with funny paws </h2>

    <p>  If you want your kindergarten to fill your chicken costume for a long time, you should decide to create a more complex, but really chic model. </p><p>  Small and tidy, all in feathers, funny yellow legs on his feet - this is how you can describe a child in a photograph.  Such a chicken costume looks like a work of a professional designer. </p><p>  But in fact, the secret of its creation is simple and accessible to everyone.  Hard to believe?  Most will ask: "How to make a chicken costume?" </p><p>  You will need a knitted T-shirt, a ribbon with artificial feathers (or boas), red felt and a white children's hat, as well as yellow <span>household gloves</span> made of rubber. </p><p>  To get started, pick up a comfortable knitted T-shirt or turtleneck.  It is desirable that the color is discreet.  It should not stand out, as it will serve as the basis, a "clean sheet" for the future volumetric top of the suit. </p><p>  It is advisable that the matched T-shirt or turtleneck be as long as possible.  Then you don‚Äôt need to pick up shorts or a skirt to match the set. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY chicken costume" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19526/385512.jpg?1398890440695" width="600"></div>

    <p>  On the chosen top of the costume, wash the boa, just as it is done in the product in the photo.  The required length of the ribbon with feathers will directly depend on the size of the suit and the style of the base shirt. </p><p>  When the top is ready, you can start making funny yellow paws.  To do this, we make holes in household gloves and use glue to fix them on shoes in which the baby will act during the matinee. </p><p>  Finished paws can be decorated with remnants of feathers.  This will make them more touching and chicken.  In addition, with the help of feathers, you can hide all the seams and creases that occurred during gluing. </p><p>  Well, the basic elements of the costume are ready.  They should be supplemented with a cap with a scallop.  The manufacturing process is described above. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chicken costume" class="if" height="268" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19526/385517.jpg?1399138972638" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Do not forget about the details.  Choose solid yellow pantyhose.  They will visually continue the legs, the chicken costume will look holistically and very stylish. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chicken costume" class="if" height="275" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19526/385511.jpg?1399139001829" width="240"></div></h2><h2>  Masterpieces from true craftswomen </h2><p>  Well, those whose sewing experience is by no means modest can safely embark on sewing more complex models of chicken costume.  Unfortunately, the finished pattern is unlikely to be found.  All options available on the web and in various print media revolve around basic wraps and coveralls.  They will become a convenient foundation.  Decor products have to come up with their own. </p><p>  Useful ideas for creating a truly designer costume with the loving hands of mom or grandmother can be gleaned by looking at the photos.  A little imagination - and from simple things and the remnants of materials for creativity, a real masterpiece will be born. </p>
