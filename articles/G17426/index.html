It would be dishonest not to warn that below we will talk about a strong push-button phone with a brutal appearance Ruggear RG128.  And by the way, the company Power Idea Inc., which created it, just specializes in the production of just such devices. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  In addition to the phone itself, the square box, which is predominantly black-orange, also contains a charger, a USB cable, instructions, a wired headset and two lithium-ion batteries (650 and 1400 mAh).  And this is not a picker mistake. </p>

Apparently, they hint that in such situations it is unlikely that a socket will be at hand to recharge the device.  Therefore, we decided to make such an unusual move.

    <h2>  Design and controls </h2><p>  Even with a fleeting glance at the model, it is immediately clear that it has protection, and at the highest level (IP68).  Nevertheless, the device looks compact and surprisingly comfortable in the hand.  Typically, the cases of such models are not much different from each other, but the materials from which they are made have their own differences.  For example, this applies to rubber, which in this model is so soft that it does not slip in the hands, even when wet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

Here, the not quite standard arrangement of the phone controls is noted.  After all, there are no side buttons, but only connectors that are tightly covered with reliable plugs.

    <p>  Above, next to the entrance under the headphones, is the place of the flashlight.  Below is the microUSB input.  And the back cover is held by two rotary screws located in special grooves.  They definitely do not let water pass.  Yes, and the tightness itself does not get lost over time, as indicated by the reviews left on the Ruggear RG128 Mariner. </p><p>  Under the battery there are slots for two SIM cards and 8 GB of additional memory.  In terms of assembly, there were no negative aspects, and the model has only one color - black. </p><h2>  the front of </h2><p>  The top of the front of the phone is decorated with a speaker.  Behind it, in the downward direction, is the display, and then there is a rubber button and a fairly comfortable keyboard. </p>

Although there are cons, and they are in low resolution (176 * 220).  There is nothing much to say about the image; it is too weak for this.  Considering information in bright sunshine will be problematic.  But if you consider that the Ruggear RG128 phone, except for calls and SMS messages, is no longer suitable for anything, this disadvantage can be omitted.

Moreover, a less capacious battery (650 mAh) is capable of supporting the life of the device for about 4 hours in talk mode, while the second one does this twice as long.  This is an excellent indicator, especially for a phone that they take with them on a camping trip, fishing or a long walk.  Two batteries together will provide him with about 600 hours of standby time, that is, within 25 days you can not think about charging.  Of course, there are already such long-playing devices, but there are very few of them. </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  The Ruggear RG128 Mariner Black's phone book is the most common.  However, like other similar models.  The application holds no more than 1000 positions, and each contact can be attached to only one number without any additional information and setting the picture.  True, you can choose a melody, both your own and one of the 14 standard ones. </p><p>  The speaker built into the phone plays loudly despite being covered for security reasons.  It's just that it's big, so it‚Äôs unlikely that you can miss a call even in a noisy room. </p>

True, the Ruggear RG128 Black phone will always ask which SIM card to do it with.  It‚Äôs good that any of them can be turned off without removing it from the slot.  The downside is that all numbers are displayed in one list, with small icons next to each other that differ in color.  A solution to the problem could be sorting contacts into groups.

    <p>  The rubber buttons on the keyboard are marked in two languages.  They have a soft stroke and are well highlighted in blue.  There are also buttons to quickly turn on the camera and flashlight. </p><h2>  Protection </h2><p>  Speaking about the protection of such phones, we mean protection against physical damage, presented in the form of a durable case, as well as protection against dust and moisture.  And with the Ruggear RG128, they are both to the maximum extent.  Therefore, if the phone accidentally falls on a tile or in water, then in about 95% of cases it will easily ‚Äúsurvive‚Äù it. </p>

To stay on the surface of the water, it will only be paired with a battery of a smaller capacity.  Otherwise, you have to dive after him.

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  A small, low-resolution, non-sensor-loaded screen, weak specs, a completely useless camera and a nondescript appearance.  All this is about the Ruggear RG128.  And at this moment the question arises: why buy this phone at all? </p><p>  Yes, the claims are quite serious, and many, having learned about them, will instantly lose interest in this device.  But he also has positive qualities, which are determined by the presence of two batteries, the maximum degree of protection and low price (about 5000 rubles).  And if in terms of aesthetics and technology, the Ruggear RG128 phone is not suitable for office work, shooting photos and videos, as well as games and applications, then it is simply irreplaceable for outdoor activities. </p>
