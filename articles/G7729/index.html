    <p>  Tunisia has a rich and ancient history.  The Carthaginian empire was exactly on this site, the ruins of the legendary city are constantly visited by archaeologists, tourists and researchers from different countries.  Later, the country was influenced by Turkey, and from the 19th century - by France.  Until now, this country is called "Africa in French" - one of the few African countries that have a special European charm.  The country gained independence only in 1956, the republic was proclaimed in 1957. Arabic is recognized as the official language, and the second official language is French.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  <span>Rest in Tunisia</span> - hotels </h2><p>  All possible hotels in Tunisia are slightly different from hotels in Turkey or Egypt.  Basically, their construction took place in the 80-90 years of the last century, when land on the country's coast was relatively inexpensive.  Therefore, the adjacent areas are large - 15-20 hectares.  Hotels, as elsewhere, vary in stardom - categories from 2 to 5 stars are assigned by the Ministry of Tourism of Tunisia.  In order to get stars, a hotel must comply with the necessary requirements - to have a certain number of pools and restaurants, a set of services, room size, etc. It often turns out that the hotel only formally corresponds to the declared star rating, and the service between different categories does not differ much.  Tunisia 4 * hotels is much better than a 3 * hotel in <span>Egypt or Turkey,</span> but they are inferior to European hotels of the same category.  In addition, it should be borne in mind that all hotels in Tunisia, starting from 3 stars, offer an all inclusive - all inclusive.  Travelers who used to be in Egypt or Turkey believe that this means round-the-clock service and free services.  In fact, in Tunisia, "all inclusive" provides for the opening hours of restaurants - a certain time for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Alcohol is almost everywhere paid, spa centers and procedures too.  If the hotel has its own beach, then umbrellas and sun loungers are included in the price, and towels sometimes have to be paid separately.  Or leave a special deposit, which will be returned when leaving the hotel.  It is worth considering that in the high season there are a lot of tourists, there are practically no free rooms in hotels, and all the free services will have to wait in line.  However, one of the most popular destinations is Tunisia.  Hotels, prices for accommodation in the country can be very different, for any tourist and at any income level. </p><h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  What pleases visitors to Tunisia - the <span>Bella Vista</span> Hotel <span>(Bella Vista</span> 4 *) is located near the airport, 8 km from the city of Monastir.  It has its own sandy beach, belongs to the category of hotels on the first coastline - these are hotels that are no more than 200 meters from the sea.  Most suitable for a relaxing family holiday with children, for a romantic getaway or business trip. </p>

    <h2>  "Dessole Bella Vista" (Tunisia) - reviews </h2><p>  Throughout its existence, Bella Vista 4 * was visited by many tourists from all over the world.  Russian tourists leave mostly positive reviews.  Travelers are pleasantly surprised that the hotel is located very close to the airport, and this neighborhood practically does not cause inconvenience.

The balconies offer excellent views of the area. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="all hotels of tunisia" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20113/444216.jpg" width="550"></div>  It should be borne in mind that most vacationers note some insecurity of the sea - there are a lot of jellyfish that can sting and cause inconvenience, the sea is quite shallow, and therefore you can walk to buoys rather than swim.  Many people write that it is more pleasant to lie in a sun lounger by the pool, and not on the beach - any garbage is often thrown out of the sea on the beach and the beach can be dirty.  In addition, in the high season you just can not find a free sun lounger and umbrella.  It should be understood that the hotel is large - up to 1000 people stay there at the same time, and queues can not be avoided - both in restaurants during breakfast, lunch and dinner, and on the beach.  There are even queues for clean dishes.

    <h2>  What to bring from Tunisia </h2><p>  Most often, tourists bring a ‚Äúsand rose‚Äù - this is almost a national souvenir, which is a petrified crystal formation that looks like a flower.  Silver national jewelry and chasing are appreciated.  Very high quality local wines, coffee, sweets and olive oil.  Local dates are recognized as the best throughout the world.  Local carpets are real masterpieces of weaving art, they are made from silk and cashmere.  Costly products are best purchased in large stores and supermarkets so as not to buy a fake.  It is customary to bargain at bazaars - this is a local custom.  Almost everything that is sold to foreigners is sold more expensive several times, at least three.  Therefore, bargaining is useful, and the locals greatly respect people who know the art of bargaining.  Even if the price has not been reduced the first time, the buyer pretends to leave - and the seller throws off significantly more than he intended at the beginning.  When buying hookahs, you need to keep in mind that tourists are often offered a souvenir option that cannot be used for its intended purpose. </p><p>  Holidays in the Arab countries are always exotic, waiting for an oriental tale and a special touch.  Tunisia always lives up to the expectations of guests - the gentle sea, the sun, and excellent hotels or hotels with well-trained staff and a wide variety of services are created as if specially to give pleasure to vacationers. </p><p> "Dessole Bella Vista" (Tunisia) is an excellent choice for anyone who wants to comfortably relax from the bustle of the city, soak up the beach, enjoy the sea and devote time to wellness treatments.  Here you can have a good rest with children, this trip will remain in the memory of the child and will become one of the most vivid childhood experiences.  Tourists traveling in the hunt for new experiences will surely enjoy a trip to the legendary Sahara desert, sea diving and exploring the ruins of the legendary Carthage. </p><p>  In a word, no matter what the traveler wishes, Bella Vista 4 * (Tunisia) is always ready to serve the tastes of the most demanding customers. </p>
