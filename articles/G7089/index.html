    <h2>  Ras Al Khaimah </h2><p>  This area is considered the most tourist in the Emirates after Dubai.  But this emirate is rather recommended for a relaxing beach holiday.  It is not as rave as Dubai or Abu Dhabi, but here you can buy alcohol and tobacco, because there is no dry law adopted in the rest of the UAE.  This is a very picturesque region.  Beautiful views are obtained thanks to the mountains approaching the sea.  It is not only calmer than in other places, but also more comfortable and cheaper.  There are many hotels with their own beaches, although in Dubai such hotels are quite rare. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Of course, the Mangrove <span>Hotel 4 * (Ras al-Khaimah) is</span> not on the shore.  But then another resort of the same line has its own beach, where the guests of Mangrova bathe.  In addition, the coast itself is very beautiful, with natural white and golden sand.  In the south of the resort, in the Haat region, there are healing mineral waters.  In the old town you can see the ancient walls, towers and the fort, as well as a mosque made of coral.  One of the most popular attractions of Ras al-Khaimah is the new Ice Land water park, which is located near the hotel.

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Guests characterize Mangrove as a very decent, good, inexpensive hotel.  They praise the local guide who organizes excursions exactly as vacationers wish.  Unlike the beach Bin Majid, it is a more modern hotel.  It is new, pleasing to the eye in style and design.  The rooms, cleaning and service are very good, do not cause any complaints.  Tourists who came here did not regret the money spent.  The reception here is so welcoming that even travelers who have previously visited Turkey, Egypt, Greece and Thailand rated it very highly.  Hotel Mangrove is recommended for relaxing with friends, company or for romantic couples.  With children, it may be somewhat problematic, for this Bin Majid is more suitable.  But for a beach holiday and travel, this is it! </p>
