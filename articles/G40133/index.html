    <p>  The foundation of the famous museum-reserve dates back to the reign of Nicholas II.  Then the village of Mikhailovskoye was bought from the heirs of the great poet, and it began to belong to the state.  In 1908, a fire broke out and the estate burned down, but it was rebuilt in 1911 and a museum was opened in memory of the poet along with a colony for elderly writers.  At that time, the museum‚Äôs researcher was the writer Timofeeva-Pochinkovskaya Varvara Vasilievna, who once worked as secretary to F. M. Dostoevsky.  She played the role of a guide to the Pushkin Museum.  The village of Mikhailovskoye suffered a lot, history loudly speaks of all the events that left their mark on the fate of the estate. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  History tour </h2>

This is the February Revolution of 1918, when not one thousand manors of the Pskov region were ruthlessly burned.  Among them, Trigorskoye, Petrovskoye, and Mikhailovskoye burned down.  Only the small house of the nanny and the huge stone barn that Pushkin's son built were saved from the fire.  In the years 1931-1934 in this protected area was a pig-breeding complex.

This man was to restore numerous buildings from the ruins, to eliminate the dugouts, to put in order parks and the surrounding area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe reserve.  S. S. Geychenko fulfilled his task brilliantly and even made sure that the territory of the historical museum-reserve began to look exactly the same as during the poet himself.  He restored Trigorskoye, Mikhailovskoye, Petrovskoye, there were museums and the "Water Mill" in the village of Bugrovo, and the "Pushkin Village".  Under him, the Assumption Monastery of Svyatogorsky was revived, which was given with great difficulty.  This object caused special battles, and each time I had to prove that it was needed and important for posterity.

Mikhailovskoye is distinguished not only by reconstructed buildings and things, but also by long paths, hills, quiet lakes and wooden bridges over the water.  Here, all buildings, landscape, forests and parks are guarded by a special service.  Very old trees have survived, for example, an oak growing by the poet‚Äôs grandfather grows, as well as the well-known Anna Kern alley, which was founded during the time of Hannibal.

Someone here celebrates the birthday and death day of the great poet, someone attends festivals and museum events.  Creative natures come here for inspiration, and nature lovers catch simple fish in the lakes and pick mushrooms in the forests.  And someone, having rented a bicycle at the camp site, rides along the paths that Pushkin himself once walked on.  If you go to the outskirts of Mikhailovsky, you will have a picturesque view of the Malenets and Kuchane lakes, the Sorot rivulet and Savkina Gorka.  Standing in the famous <span>Petrovsky park</span> on the shore of a small lake Kuchane, you can admire its beauty, the estate Mikhailovsky and Savkina hill.  Walking through the Trigorsky park, you can see the road to Mikhailovskoye, the church of the city of Voronich and with delight enjoy the view of the Trigorsky Dal. </p><h2>  Travel Features </h2>

    <p>  When visiting a museum, it is important to remember the following.  If you drive to its territory by private car, you must pre-purchase the coveted pass on the territory of the Scientific and Cultural Center of the Pushkin Reserve.  It is located at: st.  Novorzhevskaya, building 21 in the village of Pushkinskiye Gory.  The price depends on the number of seats in the transport: the more they are in the car, the higher the price of the pass.  For example, driving a car for 7 or less passengers will cost 200 rubles.  If there are more places, then a pass to the reserve will be more expensive. </p><h2>  Important events </h2><p>  His visit to the A.S.
