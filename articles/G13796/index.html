    <h2>  Visa-free transit </h2><p>  Certain states allow Russians to stay on their territory without a visa.  In this case, the stay is extremely limited.  In order to legally spend time in a country that is on the route of a tourist, you must have a foreign passport and a valid ticket, which confirms that the tourist has the right to stay in this territory for a certain time. </p><p>  For example, during the day a tourist can stay in Aruba, Bonaire, Curacao, Sint Maarten.  Only 9 hours is permitted to travel in Panama.  If you have a visa to Romania, and that is where the passenger follows, then Bulgaria will receive a transit guest for 36 hours.  If the traveler went to Cyprus or has a <span>Schengen visa,</span> Romania will accept it for 5 days.  Within 72 hours, you can transit in Japan and Brunei, while Singapore and the UAE accept transit tourists for 96 hours. </p><h2>  Two week trip </h2><p>  As a rule, the vast majority of Russians go to distant countries to relax.  Two weeks is enough for this.  In this connection, individual states provide an opportunity for tourists from Russia to come to their territory, get acquainted with culture and attractions without having to apply for a visa.  For 2016, including Tunisia, the Netherlands Antilles, Laos, Hong Kong and Vietnam. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  It should be noted some features of the visa-free regime of various states.  In particular, the Republic of Fiji allows Russians to live legally on their territory without a visa for up to 120 days, and in Armenia you can stay for as long as six months! </p><p>  A very interesting tourism system in China.  In each region, Russians are allowed to live without visas for different times.  For example, 14 days in Hong Kong, a whole month in Macau and only 72 hours in the capital of this state.  This is due to the fact that in each province there are regional authorities and their own laws. </p><p>  In Tunisia, a visa-free regime applies only to those tourists who arrived in an organized package tour.  The authorities of South Korea allow without a visa to be only on a separate island of Jeju, in addition, a tourist should be a regular in this country (visit her from ten times). </p>
