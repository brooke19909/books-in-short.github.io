After the emergence of the threat and internal unrest, the emperor could not provide proper support to Britain, it was out of work, becoming an independent province.  After the collapse of the Roman Empire, the territory of the former Britain was attacked by the Saxons, Jutes and Angles, as a result of which it was divided into seven independent kingdoms. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="England in the early Middle Ages" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33726/2059638.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The first kingdom of Kent, created by the Yut tribes, is located in the southeast of the island.  Saxon tribes founded three kingdoms in the south: Essex, Wessex, Sussex.  And the northern and central parts of Britain were occupied by three kingdoms created by the Angles: Northumbria, Mercia, and East Anglia.  All of these kingdoms in the era of the early Middle Ages waged an ongoing struggle for leadership. </p><p>  The rivalry between the seven kingdoms ceased only when a real threat from the outside arose.  In the face of regular attacks by the Normans in the 9th century, Alfred the Great managed to unite all seven kingdoms. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Egbert - King of Wessex (802‚Äì839) </h2><p>  In many writings, Egbert the Great is considered the first king of England, since he united most of the lands of modern England.  But still, officially, he did not use the title of king.  The time of his reign coincides with the period of the birth of England in the early Middle Ages as a state. </p><p>  It was King Egbert who created the state authority - Withenagemot.  The council consisted of an influential nobility, only together with the ‚Äúassembly of the wise‚Äù did it make important decisions for the state. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="medieval england" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33726/2059652.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Withenagemot </h2><p>  Withenagemot (withenagemot), or, as it was called, the "meeting of the wise", is the royal council existing in the Anglo-Saxon period, consisting of the nobility and representing the highest authority. </p><p>  The ‚Äúmeeting of the wise‚Äù was formed in the 7th century, after which almost four subsequent centuries all decisions were made with their participation.  All questions concerning the state, clergy, and politics were decided by the king exclusively in consultation with the council.  Only with the approval of Withenagemot could the king pass new laws, hold government events, and make any important decisions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Reign of Alfred the Great (871‚Äì899) </h2><p>  For the first time, Alfred the Great, who ruled Wessex from 871 to 899, was officially named king of medieval England.  He was an outstanding fair ruler.  In addition to successful military activities, he carefully strengthened his kingdom, made a lot of efforts to develop the culture, clergy and education of his people.  Contributed to the development of science.  Among other things, Alfred is considered the founder of the English fleet.  He initiated the creation of the famous Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="john landless" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33726/2059654.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The heirs of King Alfred the Great continued his endeavors, being worthy rulers.  Some of them became famous, but nevertheless they failed to surpass their great ancestor in achievements. </p><h2>  "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" </h2><p>  The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle is the oldest English record in several books.  The oldest manuscript source describing the chronicle of historical events in England from the 5th to the 12th century.  The compilation and compilation of a chronicle of events began in the 9th century by order of King Alfred the Great. </p><p>  The basis of the early years described in the annals is taken from the ‚ÄúStories‚Äù of the monk Beda Venerable, various legends that survived fragments of the Wessex, Mercian chronicles.  As for the later period, manuscripts and scriptures have significant differences of facts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  England in the early Middle Ages: the conquest of the Normans </h2><p>  Starting from the end of the eighth century, and then about three centuries in a row, the English lands were subjected to severe attacks by the Normans, also called the Vikings.  The lack of land and the thirst for conquest pushed them to regular raids and the conquest of new territories.  They were Scandinavian natives.  Their raids were brutal and unpredictable.  The Vikings carried a real threat to medieval England.  The ships of the Normans, thanks to their structure, kept perfectly on the water even in a strong storm, and were also well-suited for long trips. </p><p>  In the 9th century, the Normans managed to capture the eastern part of medieval England, forcing Alfred the Great to hide in the south.  Following this, a peace treaty was concluded between the king and the Vikings, according to which the country was divided into two parts.  The southwest was ruled by King Alfred the Great, and the northeast called Denlo belonged to the Vikings.  However, the king could not fully trust the Normans, for this reason, despite the peace treaty, he began to build defenses, the navy, and also significantly improved the army. </p><p>  The heirs of Alfred the Great successfully continued his work, gradually conquering the captured English lands from the Vikings.  Under the rule of King Edgar (959‚Äì975), the entire territory was returned to England, and the Vikings were driven out of the land. </p>

    <h2>  Battle of 1066 </h2><p>  The bloody <span>battle of Hastings</span> (1066) between the Norman forces and the Anglo-Saxon army is one of the most significant historical events that influenced the further fate of England. </p><p>  Duke William of Normandy chose a good time for hostilities, since the English army was exhausted after many other battles, the soldiers needed rest.  King Harold Godvinson was unsettled, suggesting that the Norman forces were predominant in number, but it was not the number of soldiers that played the main role in this fight. </p><p>  The Anglo-Saxon army in the Middle Ages, although inferior in strength, took a good position in the battle and gave a powerful rebuff to the Norman attacks.  The outcome of the battle was predetermined by a cunning tactical move invented and successfully applied by William.  It was a false retreat.  The Norman army very smoothly imitated the unrest in their ranks and began a retreat.  The main objective of this tactical move was to lure the army of King Harold from their advantageous positions. </p>

    <p>  The maneuver was successful largely due to the fact that it was not a separate unit that participated, but in fact the entire Norman army.  Such a trick managed to lure a significant part of the British army, after which William's army turned around and captured the enemy in the ring.  However, the British stubbornly repelled the attacks until the arrow of the Norman archers hit King Harold.  After the death of the ruler and his two brothers who commanded the army, the Anglo-Saxon army was demoralized and then completely destroyed by the Normans.  In the future, such tactics have repeatedly brought success to William. </p><p>  Victory at the Battle of Hastings (1066) brought the Duke William the coveted crown. </p><h2>  The reign of <span>William I the</span> Conqueror (1066-1087 gg.) </h2><p>  It was with the Norman conquest by William at the Battle of Hastings that the subjugation of England by the Normans began.  For almost a century, Normans have been crowned in English lands.  During the reign of William I the Conqueror, power was completely centralized, and the state became a feudal monarchy. </p><p>  One of the most significant achievements of King William during the reign of the state is the first complete land census of English possessions, carried out in 1086 and recorded in two volumes of the Doomsday Book. </p><p>  In general, thanks to the introduction of feudalism, the structural social system has become tougher and more hierarchical. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="England in the early Middle Ages the conquest of the Normans" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33726/2059655.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  The reign of Henry I (1100-1135 gg.) </h2><p>  King Henry I restored the unity of the Anglo-Norman monarchy.  During his reign, he significantly strengthened royal power, put forward many reforms, primarily aimed at centralizing power.  The supreme body of state financial management and the court, the Chessboard Chamber, was created.  During his reign, he mainly adhered to the Anglo-Saxon legal system, but at the same time practically did not issue any new laws. </p><h2>  Checkerboard chamber </h2><p>  Under the reign of King Henry I of England, the supreme financial management body, the Chessboard Chamber, was founded.  Initially, this body performed administrative, judicial and financial state functions in England.  The members of the chamber were involved in resolving financial disputes, as well as cases related to material values ‚Äã‚Äãthat directly related to the interests of the crown. </p><h2>  The reign of John Landless (1199-1216 gg.) <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="early middle ages" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33726/2059656.jpg"></div></h2><p>  His reign is considered one of the most utopian in the history of England.  The king was distinguished by a rather cruel disposition, but this did not help him at all in the management of England.  During his reign, an unreasonable foreign policy led to the loss of most of the possessions on French lands.  John Landless neglected the laws, frankly abusing power, allowing himself to take away the lands of the barons, executed them without a court order.  He regularly violated feudal customs, arbitrarily raised state taxes, increased levies, and even opposed those sections of the population who had previously supported his methods. </p><p>  One of the most significant events of his reign was the conclusion of a legal document called the Magna Carta, which he was forced to sign. </p><h2>  Magna Carta </h2><p>  On June 15, 1215, a legal constitutional document was signed - the Magna Carta.  It differed from previous decrees in that it determined the rights of all social classes at once simultaneously. </p><p>  The history of England in the early Middle Ages suggests that the articles of the charter regulated many issues related to taxes and requisitions.  The norms of <span>feudal duties</span> were established <span>, the</span> penal system was relaxed, the rights to personal freedom were established, and the judicial system was significantly improved.  From now on, arrest, as well as property punishments, could only be based on law.  The purpose of many articles of the charter was to stop abusing the king‚Äôs power, limit his influence, and equalize the rights of all classes of society.  The document gave certain advantages to the British, protected the rights and granted citizens certain privileges. </p>
