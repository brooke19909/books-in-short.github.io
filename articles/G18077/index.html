    <h2>  As People's Commissar of Defense </h2><p>  After the death of M. Frunze Voroshilov became chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council of the USSR and headed the country's naval department, and in 1934-1940 - the People‚Äôs Commissariat of Defense of the Soviet Union. </p><p>  In total, he spent almost 15 years at this post, which is a kind of record for the Soviet period.  Voroshilov Kliment Efremovich (1881-1969) had a reputation as the most devoted supporter of Stalin and rendered him effective support in the fight against Trotsky.  In October 1933, he went with a government delegation to Turkey, where together with Atat√ºrk he hosted a military parade in Ankara. </p><p>  In November 1935, by decision of the CEC and the Council of People's Commissars of the USSR, he was awarded the newly established title of Marshal of the Soviet Union. </p><p>  After 5 years, he was removed from the post of People's Commissar, as he did not live up to Stalin's expectations during the Finnish War.  However, Voroshilov was not dismissed, but was appointed to the post of head of the Defense Committee at the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Clement Voroshilov growth" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1239036.jpg" width="600"></div>

All who fell into them were subsequently shot.  So, Voroshilov‚Äôs signature is found on 185 lists, in which were the names of 18,000 people. </p><p>  As a member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the CPSU, Kliment Voroshilov approved many so-called limits, that is, quotas for the number of repressed.  In particular, in April 1938, he, together with Stalin, Kaganovich, Molotov, and Yezhov, signed an affirmative resolution, according to which the number of people who were to be shot was increased by 4,000 for the Irkutsk region. </p><p>  As people's commissar of defense, Voroshilov Kliment Efremovich took an active part in the repressions against the Red Army command staff, which in the first years of the war had catastrophic consequences.  So, on one of the lists, consisting of the names of 26 commanders, he wrote: ‚ÄúTo Comrade Yezhov.  Take all the scoundrels ... " </p><h2>  During the Great Patriotic War </h2><p>  Since the beginning of the war, K. E. Voroshilov, as a member of the State Defense Committee, also held the following positions: </p><ul><li>  Commander-in-Chief of the North-West Command (until 05.09.41); </li><li>  Commander of the Leningrad Front; </li><li>  representative of the Headquarters for the formation of troops; </li><li>  Head of the Trophy Committee at T-bills; </li><li>  Commander-in-chief of the <span>partisan movement</span> ; </li><li>  Chairman of the Armistice Commission. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Post-war activities </h2><p>  In the first years after the war ended, Marshal Voroshilov headed the Allied Control Commission in Hungary.  In parallel with this, until 1953 he was deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR.  And then for 7 years he led the Presidium of the <span>Supreme Soviet of the USSR.</span> </p><h2>  Death and funeral </h2><p>  Clement Voroshilov, whose career growth in the last decades of his life was suspended due to senile infirmities, died on December 2, 1969 at the age of 89.  Marshal was buried in the capital, near the Kremlin wall, on Red Square.  According to contemporaries, this was the first such a large-scale mourning ceremony of farewell to a statesman of the USSR in the twenty years that passed after Zhdanov‚Äôs funeral. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to Clement Voroshilov" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1239038.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Family and Children </h2><p>  The wife of Voroshilov Kliment Efremovich - Gold Davidovna Gorbman - was of Jewish faith, but for the sake of marriage with her lover she was baptized and took the name Catherine.  Such an act provoked the anger of the Jewish relatives of the girl, who even cursed her.  In 1917, Ekaterina Davidovna joined the RSDLP and for many years worked as the deputy director of the Museum V.I. Lenin. </p><p>  It so happened that in the Voroshilovs friendly family there were no children of their own.  However, they brought up the children of M.V. Frunze who remained orphans: Timur, who died at the front in 1942, and Tatyana.  In addition, in 1918, the couple adopted the boy Peter, who later became a famous designer and rose to the rank of lieutenant general.  From him, the couple had 2 grandchildren - Vladimir and Klim. </p><h2>  Awards </h2><p>  Klim Voroshilov is a holder of almost all the highest awards of the USSR.  Including he twice received the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. </p><p>  He has 8 orders of Lenin and 6 of the Red Banner and many other awards, including foreign states.  In particular, the military leader is a hero of the MPR, a knight of Finland‚Äôs Grand Cross, and also an honorary citizen of the Turkish city of Izmir. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Clement Voroshilov biography" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1239032.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  To this day, Voroshilov streets are in dozens of cities of the former USSR.  Among them are Goryachiy Klyuch, Tolyatti, Brest, Orenburg, Penza, Ershov, Serpukhov, Korosten, Angarsk, Voronezh, Khabarovsk, Klintsy, Kemerovo, Lipetsk, Rybinsk, St. Petersburg, Simferopol, Chelyabinsk and Izhevsk.  In Rostov-on-Don, there is also Voroshilovsky Prospect. </p><p>  The <span>breastplate</span> for awarding the most well-aimed marksmen, approved at the end of 1932 and called the Voroshilovsky shooter, deserves special mention.  According to the recollections of people whose youth fell on the pre-war years, it was prestigious to wear it, and the youth sought to be sure to be awarded such a badge. </p><p>  In honor of Klim Efremovich, a series of KV tanks manufactured at the Putilov factory was also named, and in 1941-1992 he was named after the Military Academy of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the USSR. </p><p>  The monument to Clement Voroshilov is installed on his grave.  And in Moscow, at house number 3 on Romanov Lane there is a memorial plate informing about this. </p><p>  Now you know some facts about the biography of the famous Soviet military leader and party leader Klim Efremovich Voroshilov.  A wonderful family man and a great patriot of his homeland, he, nevertheless, during the years of the Stalinist repressions sent several thousand people to death, most of whom were not guilty of what they were accused of and talked about to be shot. </p>
