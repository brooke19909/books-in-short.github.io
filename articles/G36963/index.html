No one spends his time soaking, washing, boiling, rinsing and washing.  Everyone appreciated the help of washing machines in housekeeping.  Therefore, when housewarming, these electrical appliances acquire immediately after buying a refrigerator. </p><h2>  What prevents to install a machine in the villages </h2><p>  Things are slightly different in <span>rural areas.</span>  Small incomes, lack of water supply or lack of necessary water pressure in its pipes, the inability to equip sewage systems do not always allow the installation of a washing machine in the countryside. </p><p>  Summer residents even less often install cars for the same reasons.  Their houses often have a small area.  It seems that there is nowhere to accommodate the machine.  Dirty clothes have to be washed by hand or transported to the city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tank with linen" class="if uuid-3157246" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112584/3157246.jpg"></div><h2>  How to wash in a typewriter without running water in the village </h2><p>  There are models designed for installation in areas without running water.  As a rule, these are semi-automatic electrical appliances equipped with only one washing compartment. </p><p>  Warm water is poured into such small washing machines.  Its heating in such models is not carried out.  Powder is poured for activator machines or hand wash.  Laundry for pressing is transferred by hands to a special compartment, if any.  Typical representatives of the brands are Baby, Alesia, Fairy, Saturn. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Do not forget about the obligatory discharge.  At the end of the operating cycle, the device pumps water through a hose.  It is worth taking care in advance that the dirty soapy water goes into a drain hole or into another designated place. </p><h2>  Use of an automatic machine in the country </h2><p>  You can greatly simplify the problems associated with washing things by purchasing an automatic machine.  A washing machine with a water tank is an excellent solution from a European manufacturer of household appliances if there is no central water supply or there are interruptions in the flow of water. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Semi-automatic machine" class="if uuid-3157238" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112584/3157238.jpg"></div><h2>  About the car with integrated tank </h2><p>  The Slovenian brand Gorenie produces washing machines for the countryside with a water tank.  It is placed on the side or attached to the back of the case. </p><p>  You can load into such a machine about six to seven kilograms of things.  Spin is carried out at 800-1000 rpm.  The volume of the drum is 42 liters.  Programs are similar to those installed in other models of automatic washing machines: "cotton", "hand wash", "wool", "fast", "anti-allergy", "downy things".  Thus, there is the possibility of quick washing, which means saving time. </p><p>  Dimensions of these washing machines for rural areas are: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  width - 60 cm; </li><li>  height - 85 cm; </li><li>  depth - 66 cm. </li></ul><p>  The cost of automatic washing machines "Gorenie" with a tank is about 22,000 rubles.  This is a good option in the absence of water supply. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fabalabs.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Washing machine with tank" class="if uuid-3157235" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112584/3157235.jpg"></div><h2>  How can I use a regular automatic machine </h2><p>  As a rule, everything that is outdated or not useful in the city is taken to cottages.  Permanent villagers are trying to purchase new washing machines.  For the village, any electrical appliance that facilitates the washing process is suitable, most importantly - in working condition.  He must perform the entire work cycle after water collection, including rinsing and spinning. </p><p>  You can purchase a small washing machine for cottages.  For normal operation, you need to set the water tank to a sufficient height so that the machine gains it under pressure.  If possible, you should raise the barrel higher, for example, to the level of the roof or the second floor. </p><p>  If there is a well or a well, a washing machine for the countryside is connected using a pump.  It helps to pump the required amount of water. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kh.gorenje.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sunroof car" class="if uuid-3157240" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112584/3157240.jpg"></div><h2>  Where to pour water into a horizontal loading automatic machine </h2><p>  If it is not possible to pull the tank to a great height, there is no pump or the source of water itself, you can still use the automatic machine. </p><p>  Many kulibins pour water through the powder compartment.  You need to turn on the washing machine in the mains.  Pour the powder into the compartment.  Then fill it with water.  She will wash off the detergent and enter the washing department.  If enough fluid is poured, the machine will start to work.  Usually you need ten liters of cold water. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Open washing machine" class="if uuid-3157237" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112584/3157237.jpg"></div><p>  After the main wash cycle, the machine drains the water and draws it for rinsing.  At such times, about ten liters must be poured through the washing powder compartment again.  If the machine rinses, drains in the normal mode, which means that there is enough water. </p><p>  During a long work program, it may be necessary to refill the rinse twice.  If there is an electronic display, you should follow the rinse indicator.  As soon as it lights up, you immediately need to fill in the water.  Therefore, you should take care in advance so that the container with it stands next to the machine. </p><p>  The amount of water needed depends on the tank volume of the washing machine, the selected washing program, and the number of loaded items.  In rural areas, narrow washing machines require less.  The maximum load of such devices is usually 3-5 kilograms of linen. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Even if there is no running water in the village, you can still simplify the washing process.  To do this, it is enough to buy <span>an activator-type washing machine, an automatic machine</span> with a water tank, or try using the usual ‚Äúwashing machine‚Äù with horizontal loading.  In any case, do not forget that after the end of the operation, the device needs to drain the water somewhere.  With frequent washing, it is worth equipping a special moat or pit. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Open machine" class="if uuid-3157239" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112584/3157239.jpg"></div><p>  If there is a well for using a washing machine in the countryside, you need a pump.  You can set the water tank above the level of the washing machine to create the necessary pressure, or simply fill it through the powder compartment. </p>
