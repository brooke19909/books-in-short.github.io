Those with such abilities were called visionaries.  They existed at all times and used to obtain information in completely different ways.  How many such people were in history is not known, because the names of a few seers have survived to this day.  Who are the most famous foretellers of the world? </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Famous forecaster" class="if" height="451" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1705005.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Soothsaying technology: how does this happen? </h2><p>  Scientists from the nineteenth century have been trying to determine how some people manage to predict the future and describe it in such detail.  Unfortunately, so far the mechanism of divination has not been disclosed.  Although clairvoyants themselves claim that every person is capable of this without exception.  It‚Äôs just that most people don‚Äôt know how to use it, but rare lucky ones managed to awaken a gift in themselves and use it for the benefit of other people. </p><p>  Surprisingly, each seer uses various techniques to enable him to penetrate the future.  Some fall into a trance for this purpose, while others hear voices.  There is a category of clairvoyants who use aids such as cards, coffee grounds or various crystals.  Such predictions are often confused with fortune telling, therefore, in the terminology of the study of the unknown, there is a definition of soothsayers.  They mainly include people who are able to talk about future events without auxiliary means.  Therefore, we will be guided by this definition in search of someone who can be awarded the title of "most famous forecaster of all time." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Famous forecasters: who are they? </h2><p>  Over the entire history of the existence of human civilization, more than once appeared people who possessed the powerful gift of divination and who were able to look ahead centuries.  Therefore, it is quite difficult to find out which of them is the most famous predictor.  After all, the prophecies of many seers have already come true, but the time of others is just coming.  Moreover, almost any person, faced with a come true prediction, experiences sacred horror and begins to be more attentive to the words of the seers. </p><p>  Recently, the theme of clairvoyants was raised in one well-known entertainment program, "100 to 1".  The most famous forecaster was named by the Russians, who were randomly questioned on the streets of Moscow.  The opinion of the townspeople was as unanimous as possible; they named six names.  Predictors known to Russia are as follows: </p><ol><li>  Wang. </li><li>  Nostradamus. </li><li>  Globa. </li><li>  Messing. </li><li>  Juna. </li><li>  Longo. </li></ol><p>  These names are known to almost any Russian.  After all, each of these people seems to the inhabitants as a predictor.  But is it really so?  And what exactly do we know about these clairvoyants? </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The most famous predictor" class="if" height="347" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1705007.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Soothsayers Known to Everyone: Wang </h2><p>  This woman has long been considered one of the most legendary personalities of the twentieth century.  The girl born in 1911 turned out to be extremely far-sighted and was able to make a lot of predictions to ordinary people and heads of government of different countries.  In the family of the future seer, no one expected that the girl would be so gifted.  She grew up an absolutely ordinary child until she was twelve years old when she lost her eyesight during a hurricane.  During World War II, in the village where Wang lived, they talked about her extraordinary abilities.  Over time, the clairvoyant glory spread around the globe, she received the same attention with ordinary people and powerful people of this world. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Wang herself said that she sees the future as a window in which the whole history of human life is scrolled.  A voice ringing in my head comments on what is happening, especially dwelling on what exactly needs to be revealed to those who come to Wang for help. </p><p>  The seer predicted the defeat of Hitler, the death of Stalin and the change of regimes in various countries.  Much of what the clairvoyant talked about has not yet come true.  Before her death, she managed to make predictions up to the five thousandth year.  It is during this period, according to Wang, that the end of the world will come and the death of all mankind will occur.  Whether this will be so is unknown, but so far all her predictions have the property to come true. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Predictors known" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1705006.jpg" width="411"></div></h2><h2>  Nostradamus: The Secret of the Quran </h2><p>  Famous forecaster <span>Michel Nostradamus</span> is a very mysterious figure of the past.  He encrypted his predictions and recorded them in the form of verses - quatrains.  Over the centuries since the seer's death, his katrana have been deciphered more than once.  Moreover, each author proposed a completely new version of the prediction.  It is believed that Nostradamus was not only clairvoyant, but also an astrologer, alchemist and poet.  Many historians claim that in the sixteenth century, when for the slightest hint of magic one could fall into the sight of the Inquisition, it was a very dangerous occupation.  It promised litigation and a bonfire.  That is why Nostradamus carefully encrypted his predictions and made them somewhat blurry. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Some researchers of the prophecies of the great astrologer believe that he wrote his quatrains based on the texts of another predictor who lived in the fourteenth century.  His name was Rainier Nero, and many contemporaries called him the Black Spider.  Despite some similarities in the texts, it is difficult to say that Nostradamus copied them.  In addition, he managed to make predictions until the year 2240, when humanity (in his opinion) came close to his death.  But the astrologer himself did not claim that the end of the world would happen.  He believed that humanity could well survive, and then a new era of prosperity and peace on the planet would begin. </p><h2>  <span>Pavel Globa: an</span> astrologer of our time </h2><p>  Almost every Russian knows the name of Pavel Globa.  He was born in the middle of the last century and is currently a very controversial figure in the world of the unknown.  The fact is that it belongs to the category of people who stood at the origins of modern Soviet astrology.  He managed to organize his own center and even led several television programs. </p><p>  Unfortunately, many of Globa‚Äôs predictions are unfulfilled.  According to experts, there are more than fifty percent of them. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the most famous foretellers of the world" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28188/1706408.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Wolf Messing: The Man of Legend </h2><p>  The life and work of Wolf Messing is surrounded by a halo of secrets and mysteries.  Some consider him a brilliant telepath and hypnotist, while others are just a talented artist and psychologist.  Until now, an exact definition of his talent does not exist, because many of Messing's words were not confirmed during a detailed and thorough verification. </p><p>  Many contemporaries of the hypnotist claim that he conducted his performances in an atmosphere of high emotional intensity, which prevented viewers from realistically assessing the events and abilities of the artist. </p><h2>  Juna - healer and astrologer </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the Russians consider Juna a fortuneteller, she herself identified herself as a healer.  This was her main gift, which glorified a woman throughout the Soviet Union.  Juna's abilities were seriously studied and tested by Soviet specialists.  Clients of the healer were the first persons of the state who believed in her gift and found it very powerful. </p><p>  In addition to healing, Juna was engaged in creativity and said that she receives energy from space and from higher forces.  A mysterious woman died in 2015 at the age of sixty-five. </p><h2>  Yuri Longo: magician and illusionist </h2><p>  Yuri Longo, too, can hardly be called a man with paranormal abilities.  He was born in the middle of the last century.  Longo was very sensitive to new trends expressed in interest in everything mystical.  He conducted the first Soviet television shows in which he tried to resurrect the dead and heal the sick.  Modern experts argue that Yuri Longo can be attributed to charlatans who made a fortune on the deception of ordinary people. </p><p>  Surprisingly, if we analyze the activities of those who at one time claimed the title of magicians and soothsayers, there are quite a few scammers and charlatans among them.  But besides them, there were real visionaries, whose predictions still plunge scientists into a state of bewilderment and shock. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="100 to 1 most famous predictor" class="if" height="319" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1705008.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Edgar Cayce - the "sleeping" seer </h2><p>  The famous forecaster of the future American Edgar Cayce was an extraordinary person and clearly belonged to real clairvoyants, to whom any distances and times are available.  This man possessed a phenomenal gift of foresight, and most of his predictions have already come true. </p><p>  Casey was born in the late nineteenth century in the family of a simple American farmer.  At nine years old, the boy showed paranormal abilities.  He could not learn a lesson, and an enraged father hit the boy in the ear.  When he fell, Casey heard a voice telling him to sleep.  In the future, the boy went to bed on a textbook and literally a few minutes later knew everything that was necessary for the lesson. </p><p>  It was for his ability to receive information in a state of trance, like a dream, that Casey was called the "sleeping" prophet.  Throughout his life, he made a lot of predictions about the fate of peoples, talked about past civilizations and impending disasters.  In his predictions, Casey paid a lot of attention to Russia and its future.  He argued that after a series of disasters that would virtually destroy America, Europe and part of Japan, Russia would be the hope of peace.  It is she who will revive human civilization and bring it to a new round of development. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Famous forecaster of the future" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1705009.jpg" width="497"></div></h2><h2>  Seers of the past </h2><p>  The most famous predictors of the world, who left their mark on history, have appeared in all ages.  In Greek mythology, the soothsayer Kassandra occupies a special place, about which there is still a debate among historians and scholars.  Presumably she was the daughter of King Priam and was able to predict the death of Troy from a huge horse.  In ancient Greek sources about the abilities of Kassandra collected very conflicting information. </p><p>  For example, Homer, recognizing her as a surprisingly beautiful girl, does not focus on a special gift.  Aeschylus in the Agamemnon tragedy referred to the girl‚Äôs foresight abilities that she received from Apollo.  Having deceived God, she was punished by the unbelief of people in her gift.  Ultimately, this led to the fall of Troy. </p><p>  Later she became the wife of Agamemnon and bore him two sons.  Historians claim that she often testified about the fate of other people and foresaw even her own death. </p><h2>  Famous fortune tellers of the world: Maria Lenormand </h2><p>  Legends have always circulated about this Frenchwoman.  She was born extremely ugly, besides she was lame.  Even the girl‚Äôs parents were amazed at her ugliness and by the age of five she was happy to give her up for education in a monastery.  It was during this period of time that the child began to manifest strange abilities that frighten parents. </p><p>  By the age of sixteen, Mary returned to her father's house.  She received a pretty good education, and the study of books on esotericism and numerology gave her a lot of new information, which she easily applied.  In Paris, where the girl went in search of a better life, she began to fortune-tell everyone and quickly gained unprecedented fame, since all her words always came true.  Any famous predictor of our time could envy the gift of Lenormand.  She could do almost everything - cards, clairvoyance, palm reading, and many other methods of predictions were available to her. </p><p>  One of the most famous predictions of Maria Lenormand is the death of Queen Marie Antoinette, who during the French Revolution climbed the scaffold.  Clients of the lame-footed seer were revolution leaders, noble nobles, and even Napoleon himself.  A woman told him about the future rise and inglorious sunset of his life.  It was this that led to the fact that, becoming emperor, Napoleon tried to kill the fortuneteller. </p><p>  There is historical evidence confirming that the Russian Emperor Alexander I and the future Decembrists, who ended their life on the gallows, came to Mary Lenormand.  Once a woman laid out the cards on herself and saw her death, which came to her after fourteen years exactly as she had predicted. </p>

    <p>  It is difficult to determine which famous predictor is the best, because each era gives birth to its heroes and prophets.  This means that pretty soon people will hear about a new seer who will become the most famous in the twenty-first century. </p>
