    <p>  One of the main events in the history of Tiberias is the destruction of the Second Temple and the subsequent expulsion of the Jewish people from Jerusalem.  It was at that time that the spiritual center of the country was formed here.  A meeting of the Sanhedrin took place in Tiberias, the famous Jerusalem Talmud was completed, many outstanding religious figures of the country and the whole world lived here. </p><p>  But prosperity did not last long.  In the 12th century, the city underwent almost complete destruction.  It was rebuilt only after four centuries.  Today, two important areas of the city are medicine and tourism. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  The weather in Tiberias can be described as extremely mild.  It is never cold here, the temperature rarely drops to -10 degrees.  Most often, it is kept at a level from 0 to +8.  In summer, the air warms up to +36 degrees. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tiberias Israel Attractions" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47310/1796622.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Tiberias Attractions </h2><p>  This city has a lot of interesting places, and there is a wide variety of recreation.  But there are mandatory points of any excursion program, where you can visit on your own. </p><p>  Here is a basic list of what to see in Tiberias (Israel): </p><ul><li>  Monastery on the Mount of Sermon on the Mount.  The height of this hill is a little over 100 meters.  At the beginning of the 20th century, monks excavated here, as a result of which parts of the ancient cathedral were discovered.  A modern architectural monument was erected only in the 30s of the last century.  One of the most beautiful places in the monastery is a small hall, the walls of which are painted with icons, and in the center there is a beautiful throne.  The upper part of the cathedral is decorated with colored stained-glass windows on which the commandments are written in Latin letters. </li><li>  The town of Capernaum.  Located near Tiberias.  According to historical information, Capernaum is a native city for many holy apostles.  Today it is the national protected area of ​​Israel, where about 500 people live permanently.  Tourists here can see the historical monument itself and several monasteries. </li><li>  Saint Paul's Cathedral.  It is located in the center of Tiberias.  The main feature of this place is that the prayer hall and the church altar are made in the form of a boat designed for fishing.  The stained glass windows decorating the interior of the cathedral also feature Paul's fishing scenes. </li><li>  The hot springs.  They are located near Tiberias.  Tourists are invited here not only to swim and improve their health, but also enjoy stunning views of the highlands of Golania.  In the park opposite the health complex you can take a walk and explore the ruins of ancient bath complexes. </li><li>  Mount Barniki.  Here is the national conservation area "Switzerland", which is especially popular with tourists.  The nature of this park is significantly different from the local area.  Wooded thickets, numerous shrubs, forests and lakes - all this, rather, resembles a recreation area in any European town.  In addition to natural ones, wonderful views of other sights of Tiberias (Israel) open from here: various monasteries and churches, seascapes, the city itself. </li><li>  Hamat Tiberias National Park.  Located in the southern part of the city.  Here you can walk and admire the remains of the oldest synagogue, which was built somewhere in the 3rd century BC.  e.  It was destroyed, rebuilt and destroyed again by an earthquake.  In addition to architectural monuments, the park still has about 20 hot springs. </li><li>  Scottish <span>hotel-museum.</span>  <span>Hotels</span> in Tiberias (Israel) a large number.  But only one is an architectural landmark.  This is a whole hotel complex, which also houses a restaurant and a swimming pool.  The building is more than a hundred years old.  Everything is done in the style of past years, and the premises convey the original appearance of the ancient structure. </li><li>  Jewish courtyard.  Only passing through the gate, you can appreciate the beauty and significance of this place.  Each building and structure inside has its own unique story that can tell about the life of Jews in the Jordan Valley. </li><li>  <span>Falling tower.</span>  It is located in the fortress wall near the sea coast.  The peculiarity of its structure is a sign of neglect of the building, therefore, the tower does not represent special value for the inhabitants of Tiberias.  Near the monument is a temple, inside which there is a small interesting exhibition. </li></ul><h2>  Active entertainment </h2><p>  Tiberias is not only a historical center with many attractions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tiberias city in Israel" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47310/1796621.jpg"></div>
