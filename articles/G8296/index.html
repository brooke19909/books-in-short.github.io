    <h2>  Hotel Infrastructure </h2><p>  <span><span><span>On the territory of the hotel, tourists can use:</span></span></span> </p><ul><li><p>  <span><span><span>outdoor pool;</span></span></span> </p></li><li><p>  <span><span><span>bike rental;</span></span></span> </p></li><li><p>  <span><span><span>rest room.</span></span></span> </p></li></ul><p>  <span><span><span>Vacationers can wash the dirty things in a laundry.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>True, you will have to pay for this service separately.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>This hotel also has a convenient fitness center.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>But his visit, unfortunately, is also not free.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>At the hotel reception there are 4 mountain bikes, which you can take for free for a while (unless, of course, they are no longer occupied by other tourists).</span></span></span> </p><p>  <span><span><span>Among other things, the hotel also has a large conference room for up to 70 people.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The hotel also has a gym.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Tourists can relax and unwind in the jacuzzi.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>In addition to a bicycle, guests can rent a car at the rental desk.</span></span></span> </p><p>  <span><span><span>For children in this hotel are provided:</span></span></span> </p><ul><li><p>  <span><span><span>shallow pool;</span></span></span> </p></li><li><p>  <span><span><span>playground;</span></span></span> </p></li><li><p>  <span><span><span>kids club.</span></span></span> </p></li></ul><p>  <span><span><span>Guests can order a crib in the room without any problems.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>To rent it, you just need to contact the reception.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>In some cases, parents can leave the child under the supervision of an experienced, highly qualified nanny.</span></span></span> </p><h2>  Infrastructure Reviews </h2><p>  <span><span><span>Opinion about the hotel Dessole Sea Lion Resort for vacationers, as already mentioned, was simply wonderful.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The service provided here is praised by almost all former guests.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The hotel's pool is open around the clock, which is rare in Thailand.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Tourists also like this hotel because it is always quiet on its territory.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Roads and noise of any night bars in the hotel courtyard and in its rooms are not audible.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Mostly Russian tourists live in the complex.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>There are no fussy Chinese and Koreans here.</span></span></span> </p><p>  <span><span><span>With regard to all kinds of entertainment, the Dessole Sea Beach Resort</span></span> <span><span>hotel did not provide very good reviews from tourists.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>To do in the evenings in this hotel, according to most of his former guests, there is absolutely nothing.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>But this complex is simply an ideal option for those who want to relax from the hustle and bustle and completely relax in nature.</span></span></span> </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">The</span></span> <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">rooms of guests at this hotel are usually populated quickly.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">However, sometimes it happens that a tourist is denied accommodation even if the rooms have been booked in advance.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">This hotel motivates the lack of free apartments.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Of course, while vacationers are invited to stay in another hotel until the room is released.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">If you wish, you can agree to this or not.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Often, with the categorical refusal of the tourist to temporarily move to another hotel, reception staff still finds free rooms.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">This option to stay in a hotel is most suitable, of course, for older people or tourists with children.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">For ordinary vacationers, temporary relocation is not likely to be too much inconvenience.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Moreover, in this way you can even somewhat diversify your vacation in exotic Thailand.</span></span></span> </p>
