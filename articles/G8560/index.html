    <h2>  Short hotel description </h2><p>  IC Hotel Residence 5 * in Antalya is very well known to both guests of the country and local residents.  Most of it is made in the Asian style, which is very uncharacteristic for Turkish hotels.  However, just such a design creates a unique atmosphere of the hotel complex, which in the future will attract travelers to come here at least once more. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  IC Hotels Residence 5 * was built about ten years ago, but so far it has not been updated.  And the point is not that the hotel administration saves money on its guests.  It‚Äôs just that the hotel was originally built in accordance with luxury standards, so over the years of operation it has not lost its chic and charm. </p><p>  In the tourist catalogs IC Hotels Residence is listed as a boutique hotel.  At the same time, he fully justifies his high status and the five stars given to him.  If you want to relax without a single unpleasant moment, then you should come here.  The hotel complex is part of the famous IC Hotel chain in Turkey.  It includes four hotels, three of which are located in Antalya. </p><p>  Guest reviews often provide information that vacationers can use the entire infrastructure of the nearby IC Hotels Green Palace Residence.  This significantly expands the capabilities of the guests and makes their stay more eventful. </p><p>  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel is about seventy thousand square meters.  Almost all of it is occupied by a huge pool and a flowering garden, in which one-story and two-story villas lurk.  There are forty-four of them in the hotel complex. </p><p>  I would also like to note that all hotel guests use the VIP-service, which will provide, if necessary, not only comfort, but also privacy. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Located IC Hotels Residence 5 * in Kundu.  This tourist center is literally created for relaxation, from where it is quite easy to get to Antalya, where there are a lot of attractions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The location of the hotel is convenient and proximity to the international airport.  Only twenty kilometers are separated from it by vacationers.  They can be overcome in literally twenty minutes.  It is nice that in IC Hotels Residence 5 * there is such a service as a free shuttle service.  Comfortable transport will be waiting for you at the airport terminal upon arrival in Turkey and will quickly bring you to the destination tired after a long trip of tourists. </p><p>  IC Hotels Residence 5 * is located not in the center of the resort village, but on its outskirts, which, however, only contributes to a good and relaxing holiday.  The hotel is located on the first coastline.  To the sea you need to walk less than two hundred meters.  This attracts families with small children to this hotel complex. </p>

    <h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  It is noteworthy that the hotel complex operates on an ultra all-inclusive system.  Such a system is rarely found in Turkish hotels, but it is always very impressive to guests.  Having once relaxed in this way, they try the next time to book a hotel complex of the same level. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews of IC Hotels Residence 5 *, none of the guests expressed any complaints about the food.  It is interesting that during all meals guests who want a special treatment can order dishes from the menu.  They will be brought almost instantly, and the cost will not hit tourists' wallet too much.  A similar approach characterizes the hotel as a complex that takes care of its guests. </p><p>  Many say that the hotel restaurant looks very comfortable and has a good meal.  It differs significantly from the usual dining rooms of Turkish hotels. </p><h2>  Children at the hotel </h2><p>  Since many people go on holiday to Turkey with their children, they are primarily interested in the conditions created in the hotel for young guests.  Be sure - they are very comfortable and well at the hotel complex. </p><p>  For children, a special playground with a large number of different facilities is equipped.  Kids can also spend time in a separate pool and kids club.  Here they are looked after by experienced animators who every day come up with new entertainments for funny naughty people. </p><p>  At the restaurant, upon request, parents will be provided with a comfortable highchair and a special menu.  I would like to note that among the usual assortment of dishes, you can choose something suitable for the baby.  The restaurant is often steamed, which is the best suited for feeding a child. </p><p>  You can always put an extra bed in the room, and if necessary, call a nanny for several hours at an additional cost. </p><p>  In conclusion, it must be said that the hotel is ideal for a relaxing holiday with your family or with your friends.  Moreover, each of the guests can make their vacation the way he would like.  Therefore, even members of the same family with different interests can enjoy spending time in this luxurious five-star hotel. </p>
