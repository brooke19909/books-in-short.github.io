This remote country can offer a great time, but you should carefully prepare for the trip.  All the necessary information for any traveler about this state is present in this article. </p><h2>  Location and general data </h2><p>  First of all, tourists should know about where the islands of Fiji are, and some more data.  In fact, the state is an archipelago.  The origin of the islands is coral or volcanic, the main ones are Vanua Levu and Viti Levu.  The latter is home to about seventy percent of the entire local population.  Here, a huge part of the tourism sector is concentrated due to the location of three large cities - Suva (capital), Lautoki and Nadi.  The state is located in the Pacific Ocean, more precisely in its southwestern part.  The closest reference point is New Zealand, which is located at a distance of 1770 kilometers from Suva. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fijibulabible.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fiji island" class="if uuid-2392806" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2392806.jpg"></div><h2>  the trip </h2><p>  Due to the location of the Fiji Islands, tourists have to carefully plan their travel itinerary.  If you fly from Moscow, it is best to fly to Seoul, and from there with a transfer to the city of Nadi.  This option will cost less than others.  The opportunity to fly to the archipelago is also present from Japan, Australia and New Zealand.  You can take a ticket to any of these countries and fly to a place of rest with a transfer.  A visa is not required for the Republic of Fiji to Russian citizens if the period of visit is not more than three months.  Medical insurance is issued at will, but it is better to be safe.  At customs, you should be careful not to take plant products, as well as any other food, as this is prohibited.  You can import an unlimited amount of money, and export only five thousand Fijian dollars or the equivalent amount in another currency.  It should also be remembered that leather products, corals, bird feathers are not prohibited, but they can only be exported with special permission. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.cl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fiji island where is it located" class="if uuid-2392808" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2392808.jpg"></div><h2>  Climate and trips around the archipelago </h2><p>  Fiji Islands is a holiday center for lovers of hot weather all year round.  In summer, the temperature keeps at around 26 degrees above zero, and in winter drops by three divisions of the thermometer.  The hot season is accompanied by a large amount of precipitation, and the colder drier, although here these concepts are almost erased.  The windward slopes are known for constant rains, which almost never cease.  The least precipitation falls in the lowlands, which travelers should remember.  Another point about climate will be hurricanes.  The country is located in the center of the cyclone belt in the Pacific Ocean, and this natural phenomenon is not uncommon here.  To make it convenient to travel throughout the territory, it is best for tourists to rent a boat.  A car will need international rights, and roads are present only on the two main islands.  In other places, the need for them disappears due to the small area. </p><div class="photo" data-original="edition.cnn.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fiji island photo" class="if uuid-2392809" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2392809.jpg"></div><h2>  Beaches and Hotels </h2><p>  The Fiji Islands are a unique holiday destination also because there is a great selection of diverse hotels.  For lovers of relaxation and relaxing time on small islands, original buildings have been built where you can settle for a certain time.  Another advantage of settling in hotels in small areas of the archipelago are calmer waters.  There is a strong surf on the main island of Vitu-Levu, although here you can also rent bungalows right on the shore.  Such a rest can be called more extreme, because the sound of water will accompany a person every minute, and when swimming you have to fight with the elements.  The best beaches in the country are also present on small islands.  Each hotel in this place takes care of the presence of a sandy coastline.  The facility provides free admission;  sunbeds, hammocks with umbrellas can be used for your pleasure.  In the morning, tourists can observe the ebb and how the sea pushes the boundaries by two tens of meters, and in the evening returns to its place. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fiji island vacation" class="if uuid-2392812" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2392812.jpg"></div><h2>  Money and Kitchen </h2><p>  Holidays on the Fiji islands are accompanied by a waste of local currency - Fijian dollars.  The ratio to the ruble is approximately 1 to 28, depending on fluctuations in the exchange rate, the amount may vary slightly.  For one American dollar, you can get a little more than two Fijian.  You can stock up on currency in advance or after arriving at the archipelago.  Each visiting tourist is recommended to experience all the delights of local cuisine in catering establishments.  There are several specialties that are not found in other regions.  These include fish marinated and stewed in coconut sauce with lime juice, which is called "cacoda."  The local population also practices cooking in an earthen stove.  They can be ordered in the kit, which is called "lovo".  In restaurants, in addition to local cuisine, you can enjoy delicious products of Indian, Japanese or Chinese origin.  Anyone will find a favorite gourmet dish for themselves. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of Fiji" class="if uuid-2392817" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2392817.jpg"></div><h2>  Various interesting entertainments </h2><p>  If the questions about how to get to the islands of Fiji, about currency, hotels and beaches are exhausted, then it's time to think about entertainment.  There are a huge number of them for every taste.  In addition to the beautiful lagoons with clean beaches, visitors are advised to try night or day diving.  Rafting is suitable for lovers of rafting on rivers and enjoying waterfalls from the side.  Water skiing can be arranged in any form.  A boat, skis, kayaks and more - all this is provided for rent to tourists.  Of the more relaxing types of recreation, fishing, sea cruises and helicopter travels can be noted.  Do not forget about the night discos in the open.  In season, people from all over the world have a rest on the archipelago, and this is an excellent occasion to make new acquaintances.  Tourists are also encouraged to watch the dances of the local population, which with songs and an incredible atmosphere turn into a unique show. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bookme.com.fj" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fiji island pacific" class="if uuid-2392877" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2392877.jpg"></div><h2>  First attractions </h2><p>  If the islands of Fiji in the photo seemed attractive to you, then with a more thorough acquaintance a genuine sense of admiration will appear.  Sightseeing only contributes to this.  The best place to start is from the capital of the state where the Fiji Museum is located.  In this building you can get acquainted with the history of the formation of the state and learn more about the culture of the population.  An interesting stop on the route of exploring the state will be the church with the long name St. Francis Hsavier High.  The temple rises on a hill in the capital Suva and can attract beautiful frescoes on the arches inside the building.  After this, it is recommended to go to the island of Bek, where a unique tribe lives.  People in it honor the ancient religious tradition of walking on coals.  Such a spectacle is worth seeing at least once in a lifetime and marvel at the resilience of these men and women.  The ceremony is unique in its kind, and it will not be possible to see it anywhere else. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thinglink.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fiji island how to get" class="if uuid-2392888" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2392888.jpg"></div><h2>  Continuation of sightseeing </h2><p>  Fiji Islands in the Pacific attract tourists primarily by beach vacations and various water activities.  Seeing places of interest in the region can be a great alternative and add variety.  To do this, you should go to the shores of the island of Kandava, where the Astrolabe Reef is located.  This fifty meter long coral formation attracts diverse marine inhabitants.  In the vicinity of Sigatoka there is also one interesting place called Sigatoka Send Dunes National Park.  This natural formation of sand dunes attracts visitors with its secrets.  According to legend, a variety of treasures are hidden in the depths of clusters.  The next stop on the trip should be the city of Nadi, where one more temple with the long name Swami-Shiva-Sri-Subramania will be immediately noticeable.  It is dedicated to the three Indian gods, but it is primarily interested in its architecture.  During the construction, multi-colored materials were used, and the total height was thirty meters. </p><h2>  Travel completion </h2><p>  Among the attractions of the Fiji Islands is the Garden of the Sleeping Giant.  This is a unique area on which two thousand orchids bloom.  The park is located in the foothills of Nausori and annually attracts a large number of tourists.  In terms of popularity with visitors, the village of Lovoni can compete with this garden.  It was built right in an extinct volcanic crater, and a trip here will be accompanied by incredible emotions.  Orchid Island is the last attraction in the country.  It is an ancient cultural center with a variety of educational and cultural parks.  Here you can stock up on souvenirs, as well as spend some time exploring the territory. </p>
