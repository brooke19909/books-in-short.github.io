    <h2>  Carnival </h2><p>  Many travelers say that in El Salvador the carnival is completely different from the celebration held in Rio.  The local festival has retained much more traditions, it is characterized by a more conducive to a full and measured rest atmosphere, saturated with national charm. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Samba is the rhythm of Africa, which pulsates in the blood of Brazilians, and it is at the carnival that the residents pour out all the passion boiling inside.  To witness a great show, visitors pay a lot of money.  At the same time, the older generation prefers to leave the city center for a carnival week, as young people from poor neighborhoods are attracted here, since for many of them this is the only carnival in their life.  So how can this be missed?  All to Salvador! </p><p>  Brazil can offer an incredible number of prospects for an interesting holiday.  Exploring architectural sights, relaxing on the beaches, walking through galleries and museums, as well as tasting delicious delicacies are just some of the attractions available to guests of this city. </p><h2>  Salvador, Brazil: Fonte Nova Stadium </h2><p>  The stadium was opened in 1951, but in 2010 it was demolished.  In place of the former arena, the construction of a new stadium began in the same year.  Comfortable stands were erected here with amazing views of the lagoon.  Interestingly, the stands create interesting visual effects due to their color and blue finish.  At the new stadium, the seats were divided into 3 tiers. </p><p>  The design of the Fonte Nova was entrusted to architects from Germany - Marc Duve and Klaas Schulz.  In accordance with the concept of the architectural workshop, the stadium was equipped with lightweight membrane flooring, and the space between it and the lagoon is used as a stage for concerts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mr. Salvador Brazil" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/487274.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Colonial Buildings of Pelourinho </h2><p>  Let's take a walk and see the main historical sights of El Salvador.  Brazil tremulously preserved the buildings of the colonial times, the construction of which took place in the XVII ‚Äì XIX centuries.  To begin acquaintance with the monuments of the past, you need to walk around the Pelourinho area.  Its name literally translates as "shameful pillar."  This is explained by the fact that in the center of the district there is an ancient square where a pillar for whipping offenders has been preserved.  Here in the colonial period slaves were punished.  Not far from the central square, the richest citizens built their houses.  At the moment, the Pelourinho district is a real museum located in the open air, where priceless historical monuments are found at almost every step. </p><h2>  Church of san francisco </h2><p>  This is one of the most ambitious architectural monuments of the city.  The church is a single complex with the Franciscan monastery, preserved here.  This complex was built in the XVIII century and is considered a monument of colonial architecture.  Directly in front of the church is a magnificent square and several equally interesting buildings in which the ground floors are occupied by shops and cozy restaurants. </p><h2>  Cathedral Salvador </h2><p>  The Cathedral of Salvador is a unique architectural monument, whose gloomy and austere appearance mesmerizes.  It was built at the end of the XVII century.  Initially, it was the main Jesuit temple of the city.  Today, the beautiful cathedral is the main residence of the Archbishop of El Salvador. </p><p>  Prospect Vitoria-Corridor is one of the best places to view the architectural panorama.  Not far from it are the magnificent palaces of the colonial era, whose impeccable appearance is complemented by thickets of centuries-old trees. </p><h2>  Elevator lasedera </h2><p>  The Lower and Upper Town are interconnected by an elevator Lasedera.  It is one of the main symbols of the city.  Salvador (Brazil) is proud of it, since the elevator was built back in 1873.  Initially, he had two cabins.  To date, the elevator is equipped with four cabins and is available around the clock.  The lower city, which is located in the coastal zone, was from the very beginning a place of residence for poor families. </p><h2>  Lighthouse fortress </h2><p>  Over the Bay of All Saints, a lighthouse fortress dominates, where the navigator <span>Amerigo Vespucci</span> in 1501 for the first time dropped anchor.  Around the lighthouse subsequently arose one of the first cities of Salvador da Bahia - the main military port and administrative capital of the country until the end of the XVIII century. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Brazil Salvador photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/487273.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the center of the fortress rises a black and white lighthouse.  Inside the building is the Maritime Museum, in which a permanent exhibition traces the stages of the development of navigation from the 16th century to the present day. </p><p>  In addition to models of yachts, schooners and all kinds of sailboats, there is a collection of archaeological finds of maritime signaling, navigation instruments, submarines, miniature models of boats of different origin, as well as an exposition on the history, geography, culture and anthropology of the bay. </p><h2>  Fort Mont Serrat </h2><p>  This fort in the city of Salvador is the best example of the military architecture of the colonial era in Brazil.  The fortress, which became a <span>symbol of victory</span> over the Dutch, was transformed into a museum of civil and military weapons.  The architecture of the fort is a polygon with round turrets and parapets.  On its territory barracks, a two-story building and other structures have been preserved. </p><h2>  Fort San Marcelo </h2><p>  This fort, popularly known as a sea fortress, is located 300 meters from the shores of All Saints Bay, near the historic center of the city. </p><p>  A fortress with a design in the style of the Renaissance is a sandstone fortification with a round central tower with a diameter of 36 meters and a height of 15 meters.  A perimeter courtyard separates the tower from the defense ring.  Under the tower are dungeons, tanks, chapels, a barracks and a powder warehouse. </p><p>  The museum of this fort displays exhibits that tell about old navigable routes, the history of the city and the lives of soldiers.  In this place you can see guns of the XVIII century, see prison cells, old photographs and paintings. </p><p>  The highlight of this complex is the rise to the top of the tower, which offers an amazing panoramic view of the city of Salvador and the bay. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="salvador brazil stadium" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/487272.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Port of barra </h2><p>  The main decoration of the port is the <span>old lighthouse.</span>  Its area is great for relaxing walks.  It should be noted and the incredible number of museums available to visit.  One of the most interesting is the Afro-Brazilian Museum, whose exposition is dedicated to the colonial era.  Among the countless exhibits, a collection of historical household items and documents deserves special attention. </p><h2>  Museums in Salvador </h2><p>  A good way to experience Brazilian culture is to visit the Salvador Museum.  It contains old maps and photographs of the city, a wonderful collection of costumes and dolls.  It consists of 3 museums: Archeology and Ethnology, Medical, as well as Afro-Brazilian, which shows the development of the country's culture and its <span>African religion.</span>  The art museum presents a collection of wooden statues of various saints, paintings, church silver jewelry.
