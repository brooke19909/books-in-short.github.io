It is no secret that not every family, much less a young one, can afford to purchase their own housing, so more and more people are interested in what a mortgage is and how to get one.  What are the advantages of this type of lending and is it worth the effort? </p><p>  The essence of the mortgage is that if you do not have good relatives who can lend money for housing for free, and you really want to have your own apartment, you can contact the bank and get the necessary amount.  However, this type of loan is somewhat different from a regular consumer loan, to which we are already accustomed.  What exactly - we will understand. </p><h2>  What is a mortgage and how to get it without problems </h2>

In addition, the security in this case most often becomes the acquired object itself - an apartment, a store, an industrial premises.  Therefore, it can be argued that the <span>mortgage of real estate</span> to secure obligations to creditors is a mortgage.  By the way, banks accept not only housing - a pledge can be a car, a yacht, a land plot.  However, the peculiarity of this type of lending is that the object acquired in this way becomes the property of the borrower immediately from the date of acquisition.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In Russia, the most common version of this method of lending is a mortgage on housing.  Moreover, as a rule, it is the purchased apartment that is pledged to the bank, although, as an option, the existing real estate can also be mortgaged.  Almost all banks offer this type of service - Sberbank, Gazprombank, Alfa-Bank, and VTB.  Mortgages to any credit institution are always beneficial, because even if the borrower does not have the means to pay the debt, the bank will still have a deposit.  That is why the latter willingly give out such loans, vying to offer "favorable" conditions. </p><h2>  Who will be given a loan and what is needed for this </h2>

    <ol><li>  First of all, age - the ideal range is from 23 to 65 years. </li><li>  Reliability level - you will need a perfect credit history.  If you do not have one, then before applying for a large loan, take a couple of consumer ones and pay them carefully.  Of course, a consumer loan is not as big as a mortgage, you will pay a much lower installment, but having two or three loans paid on time will have a very positive effect on your image in the eyes of the bank. </li><li>  Work experience - more than two years, and at the last place of work - at least 6 months. </li><li>  The presence of "white" income sufficient to pay off the monthly payment. </li><li>  Well, of course, you have to collect a huge list of documents, and the more serious the bank, the more papers, certificates and receipts you will be asked. </li></ol><p>  Of course, the requirements described above are a generalized version, in advertising brochures you can find slightly different indicators.  For example, some banks on the pages of their prospectuses declare that they are ready to issue mortgages to people from the age of 18.  Or another option: supposedly for a positive answer, you do not need a certificate of income.  So, know: most often this is just an advertising move.  Clients who, from their own experience, know what a mortgage is and how to get it, say: if you do not meet the above requirements, they will not give you a loan for an apartment.  And who is guaranteed to count on a positive answer? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So, you will most likely be given a loan if: </p><ul><li>  you have at least 20% of the cost of housing purchased for down payment; </li><li>  your official salary is at least twice the monthly payment; </li><li>  a mortgage is issued for an apartment, and not for a land plot or a private house; </li><li>  all able-bodied family members have official employment with a "white" salary; </li><li>  there is another property that already belongs to you by the right of ownership (mortgage will not be required either); </li><li>  you do not have outstanding loans and other debt obligations; </li><li>  You do not act as a guarantor for the loans of relatives or friends; </li><li>  seniority at the last place of work is more than 2-3 years; </li><li>  you can provide one or two solvent guarantors (required quite often, but not always). </li></ul><h2>  Documents </h2>

    <p>  The generalized list looks like this: </p><ul><li>  bank profile; </li><li>  mortgage application - sometimes you can apply for it online by visiting the official website of the institution; </li><li>  photocopy of a civil passport or equivalent document; </li><li>  copy of certificate of pension state insurance; </li><li>  certificate (copy) of tax registration in the Russian Federation (TIN); </li><li>  men of military age will also need a copy of a military ID; </li><li>  photocopies of documents on education - diplomas, certificates, etc .; </li><li>  copies of marriage / divorce certificates; </li><li>  marriage contract (copy), if any; </li><li>  a photocopy of the work book (all pages) with an identifying record of the employer; </li><li>  any documents confirming the amount and source of your income - personal income tax form 2, bank statements, receipts of alimony or regular financial assistance, etc. </li></ul><p>  Some banks have enough of these documents, but most often a mortgage loan requires a much larger amount of securities.  For example, you will most likely need to prepare: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  Form 9 - certificate of registration at the place of permanent residence; </li><li>  photocopies of civil passports of all people living with you, as well as immediate relatives (parents, children, spouses), regardless of their place of residence; </li><li>  a certificate of the amount of the pension and a copy of the pension certificate for non-working relatives of the corresponding age; </li><li>  copies of death certificates of all deceased immediate relatives - spouses, parents or children. </li></ul><h2>  And again the documents </h2>

    <p>  As long as you own shares, bonds, etc., you will have to provide an extract from the register of securities owners. </p><p>  Mortgage for housing - a responsible matter.  So, you must provide documents confirming your reliability - a credit history, copies of receipts for timely payment of telephone and utilities, rents for the past few months, or better for a year or two. </p><p>  If you have bank accounts - card, current, deposit, credit, demand, etc., - you will need documents confirming their availability. </p><p>  In addition to everything, in order to apply for a mortgage loan, be sure to stock up on a certificate confirming that you are not registered with a neuropsychiatric or narcological clinic. </p><p>  When contacting the bank, you will need not only copies, but also the originals of the above papers, and if you have a co-borrower, he will have to prepare the same package of documents. </p><h2>  And again the documents </h2><p>  Additional documents may be needed by those who work "for themselves" and have their own business.  These can be copies of constituent documents, accounting statements on profit / loss for the past few years, staffing, copies of key agreements, balance sheets - in general, any documents that can confirm the financial stability of your company and its ability to dynamically develop. </p><p>  If you are an individual entrepreneur without the formation of a legal entity, then the bank will most likely ask you to provide: </p><ul><li>  registration certificate; </li><li>  receipts of taxes and contributions to various funds; </li><li>  copies of bank statements for the past few years; </li><li>  the book of the account of expenses and incomes (if any); </li><li>  photocopies of premises rental agreements and other documents confirming your stability and solvency; </li></ul><p>  As you can see, an apartment in a mortgage is a rather troublesome business.  After all the necessary documents have been submitted, it is necessary to wait for the bank's decision to issue a mortgage.  Usually, the review period can take from one day to several weeks, but some banks offer the ‚Äúexpress mortgage‚Äù service, when a decision can be made in two to three hours.  Having received preliminary approval, you can begin to search for an apartment. </p><h2>  How to choose a bank: the most profitable mortgage loans </h2>

It's clear that paying off a mortgage is a long and rather expensive process, and as you know, nobody wants to overpay.  What to look for when choosing a credit institution?

    <ol><li>  First of all, you should carefully study the programs offered by banks.  At the same time, try to pay attention to institutions operating in the market for more than one year and having a proven reputation. </li><li>  If you already have a card (any) of any of the banks, and you are generally satisfied with its work, then first of all pay your attention to this particular enterprise.  The fact is that, to regular customers, many financial institutions offer special, more favorable credit conditions than people who first contacted them. </li><li>  Pay attention not only to the interest rate, but also to the probable number of one-time payments, the amount of which may turn out to be quite large.  Such ‚Äúcommissions‚Äù may be charged by the bank for issuing various certificates, insurances and other services. </li><li>  Be sure to explore the possibility of early repayment of the loan.  For example, in a bank such as VTB, the mortgage can be repaid ahead of schedule without any problems, and other credit organizations in this case oblige the client to pay additional fines and penalties.  It may also affect your choice. </li><li>  Almost every banking institution has its own website where you can easily find a mortgage calculator.  This is quite convenient: by filling in the appropriate fields, you can approximately calculate how much you will have to pay monthly.  Compare these indicators by going over the pages of several banks and determine the most advantageous offer. </li></ol><p>  In order not to get confused with a large number of offers, you can create a small table for yourself, where the terms of the loan are the columns, and the rows are several banks offering a mortgage.  Be sure to use a mortgage calculator - it will greatly facilitate your calculations and help determine the total overpayment and the size of the monthly payment. </p><p>  Columns (criteria) may be as follows: </p><ul><li>  mortgage term; </li><li>  interest rate; </li><li>  monthly payment; </li><li>  third-party fees, one-time payments; </li><li>  the need for proof of income; </li><li>  early repayment option; </li><li>  size of the initial mandatory contribution; </li><li>  penalties for late monthly payments; </li><li>  promotional offers. </li></ul><p>  Of course, you can supplement the proposed list of criteria at your discretion.  Do not rush to choose a bank with the lowest interest rate - perhaps all other conditions will turn out to be not so beneficial.  So evaluate all the items in the complex. </p><h2>  Social mortgage loan </h2><p>  There is another point that you need to pay attention to when choosing a bank.  The fact is that for some categories of citizens there is a so-called social mortgage - soft loans aimed at providing housing for vulnerable people who are simply not able to purchase an apartment as part of a ‚Äúcommercial mortgage‚Äù. </p><p>  The main difference between this type of lending is the cost of one square meter of purchased housing.  In order to participate in the program, it is necessary to write an application for improving housing conditions and register with the Administration at the place of residence.  There, your application will be considered and a decision will be made.  One of the main criteria for such registration is compliance with the Decree of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Tajikistan No. 190, from which it follows that the norm for providing the total area of ‚Äã‚Äãhousing per person is 18 m <sup>2</sup> . </p><p>  Participants in the Social Mortgage program can be, for example, state employees.  A loan can be issued at only 7% per annum and for a period of up to 28.5 years, and most often it does not even require a down payment. </p><p>  However, not all banks work with this type of lending.  The necessary information on where it can be issued, as well as on whether you can apply for it, can be found in the city (district) administration.  Most often there is a department responsible for <span>housing policy.</span> </p><h2>  Lending to a young family </h2>

    <p>  Each young family can participate in the federal program and apply for a state subsidy for the purchase of their own housing.  The normal area for a family of 2 is 42 square meters.  Such a family may qualify for a subsidy of 35% of the cost of housing.  If a young couple has children, then the housing rate is calculated as 18 m <sup>2</sup> per person, and the size of the subsidy increases to 40% of the cost of the apartment. </p><p>  A state mortgage for young people can be provided not only if they are married - ‚Äúloners‚Äù can also apply for a soft loan.  To do this, the practice of student construction teams, which are formed in many universities, is being revived throughout the country.  After a fighter of such a detachment fulfills one hundred and fifty shifts ‚Äúfor the good of the Homeland,‚Äù he gains the right to register a mortgage for an apartment at cost.  Thus, with a little work, you can buy a home 2-3 times cheaper than its market value. </p><h2>  Mortgage for the military </h2><p>  The national program ‚ÄúMilitary Mortgage‚Äù is another option for supporting the population.  The program is aimed at <span>improving the living conditions of</span> military personnel through a funded mortgage system.
