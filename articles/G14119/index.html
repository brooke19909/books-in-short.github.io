They call it chic, wonderful, beautiful.  The hotel staff is awesome, helpful.  Wherever you go, a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãsmiles will meet you.  Animators - funny and positive, work from the heart.  The hotel has a great atmosphere and positive energy.  This allows you to let go of problems and worries somewhere far away, and just enjoy the sea, the sun, wine and good food.  Two weeks, tourists claim, is not enough even to just try everything that is on the menu of the main restaurant. </p><p>  The hotel is intended primarily for Europeans.  Most vacationers are Germans with families.  But there is information that this year the concept of the hotel will be completely changed.  Haven will become an adult-only hotel with a focus on honeymooners and honeymoon trips.  And the neighboring hotel - "Lira" (the same owner) - will become family.  This hotel already surpasses all expectations of tourists, and the future promises many more pleasant surprises! </p>
