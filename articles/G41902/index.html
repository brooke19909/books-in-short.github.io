Appointment, a complete set, characteristics and an order of use</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Ralink RT5370 wireless Wi-Fi adapter is a highly specialized device.  The main scope of its use is <span>satellite receivers</span> and TVs with support for the Smart TV function.  But you can also apply it as part of a personal computer.  It is his capabilities that this material will be devoted to. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pt.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ralink rt5370 adapter" class="if uuid-2279667" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2279667.jpg"></div><h2>  Purpose of the wireless adapter.  Equipment </h2><p>  The discrete Ralink RT5370 network card is designed to create a wireless connection using a Wi-Fi signal. </p><p>  Most often, it is installed in the USB port of satellite receivers.  This allows you to play them videos from the youtube.com portal and view various Internet resources.  You can also activate the g-share option and thereby decode some channels that were not available until now. </p><p>  Another possible use case of the adapter in question is televisions with the active Smart TV function, but at the same time they do not have such a built-in transmitter or have failed.  In this case, such a network card is an alternative means of connecting to the Internet and allows you to play various multimedia content. </p><p>  Also, such an adapter can be connected to a PC.  In this case, it will act as a wireless network card. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The delivery list of this network card consists of itself, a CD and a warranty card.  The validity of the latter may be 3 months or six months.  In addition to the drivers, there is also an instruction manual on the CD. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Technical characteristics of the wireless Ralink RT5370 WiFi adapter considered in this material are as follows: </p><ol><li>  The connection connector is USB. </li><li>  Support for 802.11 b / g / n wireless networks. </li><li>  The maximum speed of the wireless connection is 150 Mbps. </li><li>  The signal gain level of the external antenna is 20 dB. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="pt.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wifi ralink rt5370" class="if uuid-2279668" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2279668.jpg"></div><h2>  The setting procedure.  Verify wireless connectivity </h2><p>  The specialized Ralink RT5370 adapter considered in this review is configured in such cases as follows: </p><ol><li>  When installed in a TV or a modern satellite receiver, just plug it into the appropriate port.  After that, you need to turn on the device and go to its settings, in which we search for available connections.  We choose the one from which we plan to receive information.  If necessary, enter the access code. </li><li>  If the adapter is used as part of the PC, then the algorithm differs only in that after connecting to the connector, you need to install the driver.  Everything else is identical. </li></ol><h2>  The price of the adapter.  Reviews </h2><p>  At the moment, Ralink RT5370 can be purchased for 200-220 rubles.  Disadvantages of this network card by default can not be.  But the owners in the reviews include its advantages, reliability, ease of setup, the ability to receive even a weak signal, low cost and very compact size.  The only important point that you need to clarify before buying such an adapter is the availability of support for this solution as part of the device.  Moreover, if this is a PC, then there will certainly be no problems.  But in the case of a TV or receiver, verification is required. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.alibaba.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ralink rt5370" class="if uuid-2279669" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2279669.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  On the one hand, a truly universal device is the Ralink RT5370.  But his main problem is that in most TVs, computers and receivers, such transmitters are already integrated.  Therefore, it is advisable to purchase it only in case of breakdown of the built-in such adapter or its absence. </p>
