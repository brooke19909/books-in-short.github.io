    <p>  The peninsula of Halkidiki, resembling a trident in its shape, is an eternally green paradise.  It surprisingly combines the liveliness and bustle of a large settlement with tranquility and silence.  Magnificent Greece - Halkidiki, Kassandra in particular, will be the topic of our conversation today. </p><h2>  Myths and legends </h2><p>  According to myths and legends, the territory that we call today the Halkidiki peninsula, consisting of such parts as Kassandra, Sithonia and Mount Athos, was inhabited by the titans.  Once a battle ensued between them and the gods.  In ancient times this land was called Flegra, which means "fiery place." </p><p>  Legend has it that under one of the rocks the titan Enkelad is buried alive.  Sometimes he wants to free himself, a terrible roar sounds, the earth shakes under his powerful blows.  And then what happens is what modern man calls an earthquake. </p><p>  Locals claim that in ancient times the titans Athos and Seaton quarreled over the beautiful mermaid Pallini.  They angered Poseidon.  He threw his trident, and a peninsula appeared with three “fingers” - peninsulas. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Halkidiki beaches" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/459725.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  At the site of an ancient settlement ninety kilometers from the city of Thessaloniki is the resort of Sani - one of the most famous in the country.  Often it is called "Monte Carlo of Greece." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In summer, expensive yachts call at the harbor of this resort, which deliver their hosts for a holiday in Halkidiki.  Tours to the peninsula are becoming more and more popular every year. </p><p>  Afitos, according to many vacationers, is the most beautiful resort of Kassandra.  An old village with cobbled streets stands above a wonderful bay with white sand.  Two sandy beaches are fenced by low cliffs and bays, where you can easily spend your vacation relaxing from the bustle of the city. </p><h2>  Weather </h2><p>  The most favorable season for relaxing on the peninsula is summer.  The <span>weather</span> here is just great <span>.</span>  <span>Greece,</span> Halkidiki, Kassandra in particular, in many ways attract tourists from all over the world to their beaches.  The best months to stay are July and August.  At this time, the peninsula is always clear and calm.  Rains in these months are extremely rare.  Evenings and nights are very warm, which contributes to the scope of club life in Kallithea - the capital of Kassandra.  Only in October rains begin and cold winds are felt. </p><h2>  Resorts Features </h2><p>  You should know that on the Halkidiki peninsulas the beach season is somewhat shorter than in other resorts in Greece.  It ends in September.  However, this drawback is more than compensated by a clear advantage: despite the fact that in summer the air temperature can rise above thirty-five degrees, it is very dry here, which is why the heat is almost not felt.  Mountains reliably close the peninsula from piercing and cold winds.  The water in the sea is always warm and calm, so it is very comfortable to relax with children here. </p><p>  For many tourists, the most desirable place where they would like to spend their next vacation is Greece.  Halkidiki, Kassandra, Sithonia - peninsulas that can realize everyone's dream of a perfect vacation.  I must say that the rest on them is different.  For example, the atmosphere in Sithonia is more peaceful and calm than in Kassandra.  Therefore, lovers of a quiet family holiday should choose Sithonia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather greece halkidiki cassandra" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/459728.jpg" width="600"></div>
