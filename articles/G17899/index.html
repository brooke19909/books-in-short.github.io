    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Pension "Rainbow" (Anapa) is located in one of the most beautiful corners of this resort town.  This area is called Dzhemete, and it is a real gem of the Black Sea coast.  Fame among tourists and a large influx of guests stimulated the development of this resort area, turning it from a small seaside village into a center of entertainment and recreation. </p><h2>  What is so special about it? </h2><p>  We will return to what ‚ÄúRainbow‚Äù boarding house (Anapa) is, and for now we will devote some time to natural beauties.  The terrain here is really wonderful.  Just five kilometers from the resort center - and you find yourself surrounded by golden dunes.  Nature has created all the conditions for a wonderful holiday with the whole family.  For those who love the hot sun, beaches and dunes, where there is nothing but golden sands and sunshine, will be an ideal option.  If you have children, then they will probably be more interested in a shallow and very warm sea.  And if older people come with you, they will be very pleased with the location of the guest houses, which allows you to get to the beach in a matter of minutes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pension rainbow anapa reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1288345.jpg" width="600"></div>
