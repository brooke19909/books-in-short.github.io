  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to set up mms on iphone</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Having acquired a modern sophisticated novelty - iphone, the owners of an electronic device are lost, not knowing how to make the necessary settings.  Often in such cases resort to the help of special service centers.  But there is an opportunity to figure it out yourself, for example, with the question of how to set up MMS on iphone. </p><p>  <strong>Errors in</strong> <strong>iphone</strong> <strong>settings</strong> <strong> </strong></p><p>  Usually, right after the phone‚Äôs SIM card is activated, it‚Äôs mms settings.  But, quite often, owners of iPhones encounter such a problem when MMS messages are not sent or received by the device.  In such cases, it is recommended to delete and re-establish Internet access points, following the sequence: ‚ÄúMMS access points‚Äù, ‚ÄúInternet access points‚Äù.  Their settings need to be taken from sites owned by mobile operators.  It is enough to make corrections to the address of the MMS message server - and the problem will be solved. </p><p>  <strong>How to set up MMS - useful tips</strong> </p><p>  Automatic settings are not always working.  Therefore, when embarking on the development of a new electronic device: a tablet, iPad, iPhone, you have to do everything manually.  But do not be afraid of an unfamiliar device, since setting up MMS is not difficult even for a person who is far from technology.  Before setting up MMS, you need to check that the <span>iphone firmware is</span> at least 3.0. </p><p>  Consider the whole process in order.  First you need to open ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù on the device‚Äôs screen.  Then find in the menu item "Basic", then - "Network".  If your mobile operator supports, and the characteristics of the electronic device allow, enable 3G.  But it should be borne in mind that the batteries can drain quickly.  To use the Internet, you must turn on "Cellular Data."  In the menu, select "Cellular Data Network."  To set up MMS, you need to call your mobile operator and request automatic settings.  Or you can do it yourself.  The Internet service ‚ÄúNavigator‚Äù can also help. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After performing the necessary steps that were given above, the phone should be rebooted.  Settings may vary according to the region of residence of the owner of the electronic device.  This applies to MTS.  As a subscriber of this cellular company, to get the settings you need to go to the operator‚Äôs website and select a menu called ‚ÄúHelp and Maintenance‚Äù.  In the list that opens, select "MMS settings".  In the proposed form, enter your phone number, which is indicated in a seven-digit format. </p><p>  Since it is impossible to configure MMS without activating the GPRS / EDGE function, it is necessary to send the operator the Ussd command * 111 * 18 #.  There is another option for ordering settings for mms.  To do this, an SMS message is sent with the text MMS to number 1234. When the connection is made, be sure to send some message so that you also have the opportunity to receive MMS.  There is another useful number that you can use in order to activate the MMS service - 0876. </p><p>  If you need to learn how to set up MMS for Megafon subscribers, then just visit the official website of the mobile operator and fill out the form there.  After that, the settings for activating the MMS service will be sent to the phone.  You need to save them, and this method helps to get settings for the Internet along with MMS.  It is possible to obtain the necessary data via an SMS message containing the number 3, which must be sent to number 5049. When contacting the Center to support subscribers of the Megafon cellular company, number 0500 must be used to name the model and brand of the mobile phone, after which an order for automatic settings is issued for mms. </p><p>  For subscribers of the Beeline mobile operator, the order of settings is carried out using the Ussd-request * 118 * 2 #.  The phone model is automatically determined by the operator.  After receipt, the settings must be saved with the password 1234. Otherwise, they will not work. </p><p>  Now, having studied the possibilities of automatically receiving settings for MMS depending on the mobile operator or having read the step-by-step instructions for manually entering them, you will be able to deal with the problem yourself. </p>
