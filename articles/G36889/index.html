Non-state pension funds</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today it remains to be determined which Stalfond NPF has a rating among other funds.  You will also have to understand how this organization is stable and reliable.  After all, it is not so easy to choose a non-state <span>pension fund</span> for the formation of the funded part of the pension.  Therefore, you will have to pay attention to numerous factors that influence the opinions of customers.  Reviews often help to judge the integrity of an organization.  And in the case of Stalfond, the situation is exactly the same.  What do clients and employees say about the pension fund?  How well does he provide his services?  And what places in the <span>ranking of private pension funds</span> does Russia currently occupy?  To understand all this is not so difficult.  Only after the formation of a complete picture of the NPF is it worth making a decision to open a deposit and start accumulating funds for old age. </p><h2>  About Activities </h2><p>  What does NPF Stalfond do?  Rating among other funds, indicators of trust and profitability - all this is very important.  But first, customers should be aware of why they should contact the company. </p>

    <p>  "Stalfond" is a pension fund that provides insurance to citizens.  That is, it allows the formation of pensions.  In addition, as managers assure, when opening a deposit, you can slightly increase the cash available in the account.  This is profitability. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For the nature of their activities, NPF <span>Stalfond</span> receives mostly positive <span>reviews</span> .  No cheating, no specific features.  It‚Äôs just a place where it is proposed to form accumulations for old age, and also to increase them in a passive form. </p><h2>  Around the country </h2><p>  The next nuance that is taken into account is the distribution of the fund throughout the country.  Large organizations are more trusted.  Just such is the Pension Fund "Stalfond". </p><p>  He has been working since 1996.  The company has branches in almost every city in Russia, even in the smallest towns.  On the official page of "Stalfond" you can see the exact addresses of the organization in a particular region.  There are no problems with this. </p><p>  Many are pleased that Stalfond is a large company.  This, as potential and real customers assure, inspires confidence.  In any case, a large pension fund is unlikely to close quickly.  So, the money will not be lost.  This opinion is shared by many residents of the Russian Federation.  Thus, the scale of the organization indicates that you will not have to work with scammers </p>

    <h2>  Popularity rating </h2><p>  What is the rating of Stalfond among other funds?  It is very difficult to answer this question.  After all, statistics show different places.  Much depends on the public being interviewed, as well as on the main evaluation criteria. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As a rule, Stalfond is among the top 15 non-state <span>pension funds in Russia.</span>  Most often, you can see this organization in 10-12 places.  It is on this indicator that people are advised to orient themselves. </p><p>  It turns out that this fund is not the best in Russia.  He has his own shortcomings that push the organization far from a leading position.  Nevertheless, NPF Stalfond has a far worse rating among other funds.  You can trust this company, but you should not consider it ideal.  Some disadvantages still need to be prepared. </p>

    <h2>  Profitability </h2><p>  The next evaluation criterion, which often turns out to be decisive, is the return on deposits.  What is the profitability of NPF Stalfond?  This question interests most potential customers.  After all, far from all set themselves the only goal - the preservation of pension savings.  Some want to get a good return when opening a deposit. </p><p>  In this area, "Stalfond" earns very mixed reviews.  There are even negative opinions.  Why?  This is all due to the fact that initially Stalfond NPF JSC promises an annual return of 18%.  But in practice it turns out that per year the increase is about 8-8.5%.  The difference between the real picture and the promises is serious.  It repels some. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  However, this phenomenon is easily explained.  It's all about inflation.  In the current crisis, it is not possible to provide the desired profitability.  A similar situation with profitability is present at all NPFs.  Only one thing is clear - the Stalfond Pension Fund does increase savings.  Not too strong, but the return is still there. </p>

    <h2>  Trust </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the level of trust also plays a role.  It indicates how strongly the population believes in the stability of the organization.  At present, Stalfond NPF JSC is not at the highest place in terms of trust. </p><p>  However, trust is still high.  According to statistics, it is rated by A + or AA.  This is a characteristic that reflects the status of High Confidence.  However, the best indicator of a trust is AAA or A ++.  Before him, "Stalfond" did not reach.  And for all the time of its existence, a similar mark has not been reached. </p><p>  This is not a reason to refuse investments.  After all, the confidence of the population is still quite high.  So, you should not be afraid of cooperation with the organization.  In any case, it gives its customers a sense of security for the money invested.  That is how some contributors express themselves. </p><p>  there is only one thing - the Stalfond Pension Fund does increase savings.  Not too strong, but the return is still there. </p>

    <h2>  Service </h2><p>  Another component is the quality of customer service.  This factor plays an important role in the direct evaluation of the company.  NPF "Stalfond" has a "Personal Account".  It allows you to work on the network with the services of the organization without any problems.  If necessary, you can order a certificate of personal account status.  Or even get employee advice.  Only, as many customers say, "My Account" works with some interruptions.  Inquiries are made for a long time, authorization is not always obtained.  Small, but still flaws. </p><p>  But in the offices of Stalfond, things are different.  The speed of service leaves much to be desired, but according to the opinions of visitors, employees answer all questions.  They are doing their best to attract new investors.  To some, such initiatives seem suspicious.  But at the same time, no direct negative is expressed. </p><p>  The conclusion of contracts occurs without any problems.  Only, as some claim, "Stalfond" is not the best way to explain the rights of investors.  Because of this, there are opinions according to which the pension fund under study are scammers.  At the same time, do not forget that the organization has won the trust of visitors and has been working in Russia for a long time.  So, such accusations are not substantiated by anything. </p><p>  From now on, it is clear how the Stalfond NPF Personal Account works, as well as offices.  In general, there are no serious complaints.  But on some shortcomings, the population draws attention. </p>

    <h2>  About Payments </h2><p>  How does a <span>non-state pension fund</span> produce pensions?  In this area, NPF Stalfond earns customer reviews, as in most cases, ambiguous.  Why? </p><p>  On the one hand, cash is paid.  If desired, a citizen at any time has the right to terminate the contract and transfer the savings to another organization.  On the other hand, payments sometimes come with delays.  Similar situations occur in almost all non-state pension funds, but rating leaders in Russia usually do not take them so seriously into account. </p><p>  Despite the delays, Stalfond still transfers the set amount of funds to its customers.  So, it fulfills obligations.  Accordingly, it is not worth completely refusing to cooperate. </p><h2>  Wonderful merger </h2><p>  The last thing potential investors should consider is that in 2016, Stalfond ceased to exist as a separate organization.  He merged with another <span>private pension fund.</span>  And now its name is "Future."  This is the same as the Stalfond NPF.  Head office address: Moscow, Tsvetnoy Boulevard, Building 2. </p><p>  "Future", as practice shows, is in great demand in Russia.  The level of trust in this A ++ foundation, this organization occupies the same positions as its component ("Stalfond"). </p>

This is far from the best place to form the funded part of the pension.  But not the worst.  If you wish, you can save and even multiply a little money in the "Stalfond". </p>
