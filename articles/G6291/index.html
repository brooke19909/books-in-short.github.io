At that time, Tsar Nikolai II, who ruled at that time, understood that his own son Aleksey, who had hemophilia, would not be able to fully manage the state.  Therefore, he abdicated in favor of Romanov, and he became a full-fledged king.  However, he was not destined to rule for a long time. </p>

    <p>  He was born in 1878, December 4, in St. Petersburg.  His father was Tsar <span>Alexander the Third.</span>  Michael had four brothers, among whom was the youngest.  Subsequently, he became the successor of his brother Nicholas, who during his life made him king.  Mikhail Romanov was not only a <span>grand duke,</span> but also an excellent <span>military leader, lieutenant general,</span> member of the Council of State. </p><p>  Mikhail Romanov suffered a martyrdom.  It happened in Perm in 1918, June 12.  At this time, the Bolsheviks came to power and the prince was expelled from the capital.  The reprisal against him and his entourage was previously planned and carried out by local authorities.  He was tricked out of the city and shot.  The only desire of Romanov was to say goodbye to his secretary and close friend Johnson.  However, he was deprived of this. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Testimonies of contemporaries</strong> </p><p>  You can judge the nature and achievements of the last Russian Tsar by referring to the reviews of his contemporaries who knew and respected him.  The famous writer Alexander Kuprin said that he was a rare person, almost the only one in the world in beauty and purity of soul. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mikhail Alexandrovich Romanov" class="if" height="453" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6836/66943.jpg" width="330"></div>

    <p>  Russian diplomat Dmitry Abrikosov was once a fan of Natalia Sheremetevskaya, who later became the wife of Mikhail Romanov. </p><p>  He talked about the first visit to the couple.  He wrote that the charm and <span>nobility of this</span> man smoothed out the awkwardness and he quickly felt comfortable. </p><p>  <span>The great commander who</span> commanded armies during the <span>First World War,</span> General A. Brusilov  wrote that he loved this sincere, pure-hearted and honest man. </p><p>  He never participated in intrigues and did not take advantage of the imperial family.  Whenever possible, he avoided squabbles and troubles both in office and in family life. </p><p>  He was a man of rare spiritual qualities and moral principles.  Few monarchs could compare with him in this. </p><p>  During his exile, Mikhail Romanov was acquainted with Vladimir Gushchik, the commissar of the Gatchina Palace.  Having opposing views and interests, the commissar was able to appreciate the former king. </p><p>  He wrote that the Grand Duke was gifted with three rare qualities: honesty, simplicity and kindness.  Representatives of all parties respected him and did not in any way dislike. </p><p>  So in our eyes today appears the last Russian Tsar, who was not destined to rule, but who left a deep and indelible mark in the history of the country. </p>
