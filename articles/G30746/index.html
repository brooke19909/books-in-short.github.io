Wireless Charger for Phone</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In today's world, a person simply can not do without a cell phone.  These devices have become very firmly entrenched in our lives, and even sometimes it is not clear how they could have been dispensed with before.  The phone runs on battery power, and she needs the energy she receives through a special power supply.  It is about them that we will talk today.  We will figure out how to choose a charger for the phone.  We begin to understand the topic in order. </p><h2>  How to choose a charger for your phone? </h2><p>  Many choose by price.  If the charger is broken, then you need to go to the nearest store and buy the cheapest option - if only the connector fits.  This is not the right approach to business.  Yes, undoubtedly, the moment with a suitable connector is important, but there are some more nuances that deserve attention. </p><p>  If you look closely at the model, then its parameters will be written in small print on it.  The original device is ideal for charging the battery of your mobile phone.  And it will be good if those memory devices that you buy instead of the broken original one will be identical to all of these characteristics. </p><p>  If complete identity cannot be achieved, then it is worth choosing a model with the most suitable parameters.  But you should understand that your battery can best be charged with the original.  If the analog will have slightly changed parameters, then it will charge the battery worse. </p><p>  If we are talking about a one-time case, for example, you lend a charger to one of your colleagues at work, then you can not worry about the above parameters.  But if we are talking about memory for constant everyday use, then talking about the parameters is relevant. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Charger Options </h2><p>  When choosing a memory for your mobile device, it is extremely important to pay attention to the electrical characteristics of the future power supply.  These include: </p><ul><li>  rated voltage; </li><li>  current; </li><li>  device power. </li></ul><p>  The charger converts alternating current with a voltage of 220-240 V and a current of 5-6 A into direct current with the necessary parameters (5-18 V and 0.5-2.1 A). </p><p>  The current filling rate of the device‚Äôs battery will directly depend on the current strength.  The larger the value of this parameter, the faster the memory will restore the battery supply of your device.  But each power supply is rated for its current.  So, high rates can ruin it completely.  In this case, a low current can lead to the fact that the device will not be charged at all.  You need to know about this. </p><p>  2-2.1 A is the value that will suit almost all modern flagship devices, and 0.7 A is an option for the oldest phones.  It is also worth mentioning that manufacturers of low-cost memory devices often overestimate the strength of the output current.  For example, a device that says 1 A in fact produces only 0.5 A. </p><p>  Almost all modern gadgets, if other information is not indicated on them, are designed for a voltage of 5 V. This standard is used, for example, in computer USB ports. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rosegal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Classic Charger" class="if uuid-3177620" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3296/3177620.jpg"></div><h2>  Original memory or equivalent? </h2><p>  As we just found out, "native" is the best option.  How to choose a charger for the phone, if the original is very expensive?  You can monitor prices at several points of sale.  After all, it is possible that only one store is overpriced, for example, because it is located in a busy place.  Or, conversely, where there are no other stores that could impose competition on it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If it‚Äôs not the point of sale, but the brand or model of your phone and the charger for it is more expensive than you can afford, then you should consider analogues or turn to offers for the sale of used memory devices. </p><h2>  Secondary market </h2><p>  A used original power supply can almost always be found in popular services with ads.  The price for them here depends directly on the requests of sellers.  We can safely assume that prices here are more interesting than in stores for new original memory devices.  How to choose a charger for the phone, buying it from hand?  Need to check it out.  That is, the purchase or sale should take place where there are power outlets to verify the purchase. </p><p>  Also, it is not superfluous to check the integrity of the wire.  Sometimes it can be broken or there are traces of teeth of pets on it.  The whole should be not only the wire, but also the connector, which should sit tightly in the charging socket of your mobile device and work stably. </p><p>  If everything is in order and there are no flaws, then you can safely purchase a power supply, of course, if the transaction price suits you.  Now you know how to choose a good charger for your phone, bypassing the offers of stores. </p><h2>  Solar panels </h2><p>  Relatively recently, no one knew about such things to power mobile phones.  But now it is quite relevant.  It may come in handy if you are traveling out of town.  A solar powered phone charger can sometimes help you out.  In addition, he sometimes just does not have an alternative. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  You can find such a memory for your phone on popular sites in China, where they are very inexpensive.  You can buy such a power supply from us in Russia.  But it‚Äôs worthwhile to understand that the Russian seller bought it in China, and now he is selling it to you, receiving very, very decent money for mediation.  Do you want to pay more? </p><p>  Such devices can be designed as a classic solar panel, or they can be styled, for example, in the form of a deciduous green tree, where at the end of each branch there is a small solar panel.  This is a good gift and a reference to the fact that it is an environmentally friendly charger. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.survivalfrog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Solar charger" class="if uuid-3177622" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3296/3177622.jpg"></div><h2>  Powerbank </h2><p>  Another solution to the modern world.  This is a kind of mobile USB charger for phones.  Structurally, it's just an external battery.  Initially, you power it from the network, and then you charge your mobile device from it.  All this is quite convenient. </p><p>  Such an external charger for the phone can be useful when traveling outdoors.  Or you just need to keep it with you if you work a lot with your mobile device and its internal battery is not enough even for your full time job. </p><p>  Today you can buy both small ‚Äúelectric power banks‚Äù, from which you can power one or two mobile phones, and devices with solid capacity that can fully power several laptops.  Of course, the prices of external phone chargers vary widely, but that's another matter. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidcentral.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Classic Powerbank" class="if uuid-3177623" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3296/3177623.jpg"></div><h2>  Car Phone Charger </h2><p>  Cars have entered our lives as densely as mobile phones.  With their help, we move around the city, we go out of town to them, and so on.  The average resident of the city spends a lot of time in his vehicle.  For this reason, the charger for the phone in the car is a very, very useful thing.  Especially for travel lovers. </p><p>  Such a charger can be ordered from China, or can be bought in Russia (analogy with the situation about an external power supply for a solar-powered phone).  This was discussed a little higher.  Choose such a memory should be for your phone (according to the parameters of the original power supply of your smartphone). </p><p>  If you give any advice here, then we can say that there are similar chargers for two or more devices at once.  You can also advise choosing options with a network wire-spring, as in a limited space of the car it will be convenient. </p><p>  There are options for such devices in the car immediately with a built-in wire.  And there are options for a USB charger for the phone, that is, the memory has a standard USB outlet.  And already to it you connect your wire from a mobile device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitaltrends.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Car charger" class="if uuid-3177625" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3296/3177625.jpg"></div><h2>  Old Wireless Power Supply </h2><p>  This refers to the original dock from the manufacturer of your mobile gadget.  Such a wireless charger for the phone usually comes with the device in some limited series.  It is worth noting that the relevance of this venture fades in the eyes of manufacturers every year. </p><p>  Buying such a storage device can be a significant waste of your budget.  Sometimes the prices for such things are simply amazing.  Although each person has their own income level, and for someone it‚Äôs just trifles for convenience or an original gift to a loved one.  A wireless charger for the phone is connected to a wall outlet, and the docking station has special contacts for a rechargeable device, through which it will be powered from the network. </p><p>  But this is not quite right.  After all, if the phone is powered with a dock via contacts, and it is powered with a power outlet through a wire, then this is only a relatively wireless charger.  But there is also a modern option. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.shoppinghungama.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Charger in the dock" class="if uuid-3177626" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3296/3177626.jpg"></div><h2>  New Wireless Charger </h2><p>  The principle of operation of such a gadget is very simple.  It consists in the fact that you put your device on a special panel and that‚Äôs it (the charging process begins).  The principle of operation of such an accessory is based on the operation of a conventional induction coil.  But in the modern world, this technology has been dubbed Qi.  All major players in the mobile device market liked the idea.  In 2015, one world-famous company began selling home furniture, which already has a module for such wireless charging. </p><p>  Today, all the flagship models of famous smartphones support Qi technology.  We have to wait until the transmitters (modules) appear in public places (airports, train stations, restaurants, cafes, cinemas, shopping centers).  In fact, this will make life easier for all people who use modern mobile devices. </p><p>  Man is actively entering a new era.  In it, it will not be necessary at all to carry various wired chargers with you everywhere for all of its many devices. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.belkin.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Qi Charger" class="if uuid-3177624" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3296/3177624.jpg"></div><h2>  Other modern solutions </h2><p>  Ecology is in fashion today.  And this is beginning to affect the charging of mobile devices.  The solar-powered memory, which we examined above, just falls into this number of environmentally friendly solutions.  But if the option with solar energy already seems standard and mundane, then other modern and environmentally friendly options are simply amazing. </p><p>  For example, there is data about such a charger for mobile phones, which is suitable for those who like to spend time outdoors.  Although maybe someone will use it at home.  The device is a foot air pump.  Inside the enclosure is a mechanism that converts energy from the flow of air into electricity.  In short, you connect the phone to the pump, and it charges while you pump air. </p><p>  There is another solution, which is also connected with the flow of air.  Option suitable for cyclists.  The device is a kind of hard case for a mobile gadget, on top of which a fan is installed.  Wind flows from driving will rotate the fan blades, and a small generator of electric energy is built into the fan.  Thus, while you pedal, the phone is charging. </p><p>  Here you can recall bicycle dynamos originally from the times of the USSR, which received rotation from the bicycle wheel, and this energy fed the lighting devices on it.  You can refine this option for mobile devices. </p><p>  And this is not a complete list of environmentally friendly, that is, the best chargers for the phone.  The list of such solutions is constantly updated. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.offgridenergyindependence.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The original &quot;charger&quot;" class="if uuid-3177621" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3296/3177621.jpg"></div><h2>  Brands </h2><p>  Many major players in the mobile gadget market are very concerned that users of their products in the event of an original device breakdown try to get away from the original in favor of an analogue.  This happens due to the price difference between the original and the copy. </p><p>  The best example is the owners of the notorious iPhone.  Power supplies for these gadgets are expensive and do not differ in durability, and the batteries of devices hold a very poor charge.  That is why Russian fans of the "apple" brand always have a full set of non-original options for recharging their device (PowerBank from China, solar charger from there, a car charger of a non-original brand, an AC adapter also without a logo with a bitten apple). </p><p>  Apple wanted to cheat when it gave its devices non-standard connectors for power, but demand dictates the offer.  Third-party companies, which are mostly based in China, very quickly set up their chargers for American connectors. </p><p>  Perhaps this useless move of the American manufacturer will be a lesson for other companies that produce mobile devices, and we will not return to those times when each gadget of a particular brand required its own memory.  This was due to the fact that all had their own connectors.  Although there are rumors that the charger for the Samsung phone may well acquire its own personal connector.  And this is not a joke. </p><p>  What can we say about the manufacturer from Korea, if there is the same information regarding the Xiaomi phone charger from China.  Although it is the guys from this country that make the world of all users of mobile gadgets easier.  But it is possible that China is a large country, and there are many opinions there. </p>
