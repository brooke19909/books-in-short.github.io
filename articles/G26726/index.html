He is already more than two thousand years old, and he is primarily famous for his amazing monuments of architecture, which have been preserved since ancient Rome. </p><p>  This city will allow you to enjoy the majestic and beautiful architecture of the Roman era when it was at the zenith of its power. </p><h2>  What is worth knowing about this city? </h2><p>  Merida in Spain is located on the banks of the Guadiana River.  The city is the capital of the autonomous community that belongs to the province of Badajoz.  About 55.7 thousand people live in the city.  The settlement was founded before our era during the reign of the Roman emperor Octavian Augustus.  Like most <span>Spanish cities,</span> Merida contains the features of several historical eras: Roman rule, the times of Arab conquests, as well as a medieval chivalrous atmosphere. </p><p>  Scientists have calculated that on the territory of the city there are a huge number of monuments of the era of ancient Roman architecture, a variety of statues, paintings and mosaics, which are of great value for the historical and cultural memory of mankind.  In 1993, the city received the status of "Humanity" from the UNESCO World Organization. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="roman spain merida" class="if uuid-2564686" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81922/2564686.jpg"></div><h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  Merida in Spain was founded in 25 BC.  e.  Initially, the city was called Emerita-Augusta and was the capital of the province of Lusitania.  The settlement received this name from the Latin word ‚Äúveterans‚Äù, since those warriors who helped to conquer this territory from the Basques and Cantabras for the Roman throne settled here.  Thus the emperor decided to thank his faithful legionnaires for valiant service. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The soils around the settlement were fertile, and the planted olive gardens impressed with their views.  This attracted many residents from all counties to relocate to Emeritu.  The city developed and expanded, becoming more influential and wealthy.  Already in the IV century, during the reign of Emperor Constantine, he became one of the most influential settlements in all Spanish territories. </p><p>  Since the beginning of the VIII century, the history of Merida in Spain is no longer so carefree.  Armies of Arab conquerors poured onto the Iberian Peninsula.  For almost five hundred years they have been masters of this city.  Many monuments and buildings created by the Romans were destroyed and destroyed.  Often buildings were dismantled for building materials, so that with their help they could build mosques or other buildings.  For example, on the ruins of a dilapidated fortress, the Arab Alcabas was erected, which could survive to our time. </p><p>  In the XIII century, the king of Spain Alfonso IX conquered the city from the Moors.  After that, the knighthood of St. James was placed here.  In the XV century, this once large and prosperous city again turned into a modest provincial settlement.  Fortunately, the King of Spain Philip was an ardent admirer of the history of Ancient Rome, so he tried his best to preserve the cultural monuments remaining from that era.  In 1560, according to his decrees, the popular architect <span>Juan de</span> Herrera carefully studied the Roman heritage that remained on the territory of the city and its environs. </p><p>  The events of the Napoleonic battles, as well as the industrial revolution, left a very unpleasant imprint on the appearance of the city.  Nevertheless, now you can come to Spain to Merida to rest and enjoy the view of the majestic architectural monuments. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The cultural heritage of the city </h2><div class="photo" data-original="tomoab.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Spain Badajoz and Merida" class="if uuid-2564684" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81922/2564684.jpg"></div><p>  Events of a thousand-year history did not spare the city building.  It is not at all what it was during the construction or when Arabs lived here.  Nevertheless, the city still managed to save a large number of various architectural monuments here.  Outside the city, you can often find excavations and groups of researchers that explore the rich history of the settlement.  Almost all the objects found are sent to study at the National Museum of Roman Art, which was created by architect Rafael Moneo.  Inside are statues of gods and emperors, mosaics, household items of the ancient Romans, Arabs and knights, as well as jewelry and other various cultural artifacts. </p><h2>  Bridge over guadiana </h2><div class="photo" data-original="wikitravel.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Merida city in spain" class="if uuid-2564685" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81922/2564685.jpg"></div><p>  Of great historical value is the bridge built back in the days of the Roman Empire.  He helps to get to the other side of the Guadiana River.  The bridge was made of hewn granite during the reign of <span>Emperor Trajan.</span>  Initially, the bridge was 755 meters long and consisted of 62 spans.  However, up to now only 60 flights have survived.  However, this quantity is enough to make it the longest bridge that has survived to our time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Through the bridge you can reach another attraction in Merida, Spain.  This is a large Alcazaba fortress that was built by the Arab conquerors in the 9th century.  The bridge is quite suitable for movement along it, but only on foot.  Thus, you can save this design for longer.  Along the Guidiana River, you can also watch the delightful Los Milagros aqueduct. </p><h2>  Bridge over Albarregas </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Merida Spain" class="if uuid-2564699" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81922/2564699.jpg"></div><p>  In the city of Merida in Spain there is another ancient unique bridge.  He is thrown across the Albarregas River.  A bridge was erected at the beginning of our era and it was necessary in order to transport the mined silver from the mines to the metropolis.  The bridge was an important link in the so-called Silver Way.  The length of the structure is only 100 meters, which is less than that of his brother in the city.  Nevertheless, this does not prevent the bridge from being one of the most beloved and preferred places for walks and meetings with the local population. </p><h2>  Arch Trajano </h2><p>  Merida - "Roman Spain", so often called this city.  So many buildings of the ancient Roman culture have been preserved here that it is in no way inferior even to some Italian cities.  One of these buildings is the fifteen-meter arch of Trajano.  It is located on the main street of the city.  Previously, the arch was used as a city gate and was made of wood.  But already in the II century it was rebuilt using granite slabs processed using special technology. </p><h2>  Temple of Diana </h2><p>  A very important monument in the city, which dates back to the times of the Roman Empire, is the temple of Diana.  It was built at the beginning of the II century of our era.  It was a religious building, because it was supposed to exalt the power and glory of the emperor.  The columns of the temple impress with their beauty, which are wonderful examples of the delightful school of Roman architecture. </p><p>  In the XVIII century, the temple ceased to be the property of the city authorities, passing into the possession of the Countess de Corvos.  She used the temple during the construction of her own palace.  Fortunately, she did not make any changes to the temple itself. </p><h2>  Ancient Theater </h2><div class="photo" data-original="davidsbeenhere.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Merida Spain" class="if uuid-2564682" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81922/2564682.jpg"></div><p>  Inside the city‚Äôs theater and amphitheater, you can still feel this unrivaled theatrical spirit.  These two buildings were able to survive to this day in almost pristine condition.  The theater delights with its magnificent size and beauty.  The wall is thirty meters high, huge columns made of marble, its perimeter is decorated with statues of ancient gods and Roman rulers.  Inside accommodates up to 6,000 people. </p><p>  Every year in July, the Classical Theater Festival is held here.  This is a unique sight.  On ancient scenes, plays are played again, the heroes of Seneca, Euripides and Sophocles return to this haven of theater muses. </p><h2>  Amphitheater of Merida </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.citiestips.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Merida Spain Attractions" class="if uuid-2564691" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81922/2564691.jpg"></div><p>  Not far from the theater is an amphitheater.  Unfortunately, he is already in a dilapidated state.  It was built back in the eighth year BC.  Here gladiatorial battles were often held, as well as terrifying battles of people against wild predators.  Periodically, chariot races and horse races were also held here. </p><h2>  Attractions in the area </h2><p>  The city is located in the central part of the autonomous community of Extremadura.  From here it is very easy to get to the southern regions where the picturesque Natural de Cornalvo Park and Sierra Bermeja are located.  This nature reserve protects many rare plants and animals living in these parts. </p><p>  You can take the train to the capital of the autonomous community.  Badajoz and Merida in Spain are famous for their delightful architecture.  The historic center of Badajoz is completely surrounded by the still strong city wall, and on the central square of the city we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist. </p><p>  Reviews about Merida (Spain) are always very pleasant.  It is beautiful, picturesque region, and people are welcoming and friendly. </p><h2>  How to get to the city? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="spain.aricaustermann.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Spain Badajoz and Merida" class="if uuid-2564693" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81922/2564693.jpg"></div><p>  Merida is located at the Madrid-Lisbon transport hub, which is connected by a railway network.  Thus, even without transfers, you can get here from almost anywhere. </p>
