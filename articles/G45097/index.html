    <h2>  The opinion of experts and users.  Real reviews of chips based on this architecture.  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  <span><span><span>Of course, a landmark event for the world of mobile devices was the emergence of the architecture of microprocessor devices ARM Cortex A7.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The best proof of this was that devices based on it have already been successfully sold for more than 5 years.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Of course, now the capabilities of A7-based CPUs are no longer enough even to solve mid-level tasks, but the simplest program code on such chips continues to function successfully to this day.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The list of such software includes video playback, listening to audio recordings, reading books, web surfing and even the most simple toys in this case will start without any problems.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>It is on this that the attention is focused on the leading thematic portals devoted to mobile gadgets and devices, both leading specialists of this plan and ordinary users.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The key minus of the A7 is the lack of support for 64-bit computing.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Well, the main combination of it can be attributed to the perfect combination of energy efficiency and productivity.</span></span></span> </p>
