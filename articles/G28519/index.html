It was opened in 2002. </p><h2>  Millennium Park (Kazan) </h2><p>  The address of this favorite walking place among the city residents is Spartakovskaya street, building 1. Both children and adults come here.  Kazan Millennium Park is located on the territory bounded by Aidimov, Ostrovsky, Salimzhanov streets, and from the north - the shore of <span>Lake Kaban.</span>  The building is adjacent to the complex "Tatenergo". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kazan Millennium Park" class="if" height="383" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1684052.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The construction of a huge complex with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãfive and a half hectares was completed in the shortest possible time.  The old buildings were demolished, and in their place a huge number of lindens, birches, oaks, mountain ash, pine trees were planted.  The final touches were even carried out directly on the day of its opening. </p><p>  Almost immediately, <span>the Millennium Park</span> appealed to the townspeople.  In warm weather, students' companies are conveniently placed on its lawns, preparing for exams, parents and children, elderly people are walking along the alleys.  In winter, a Christmas tree is set up here, and festive lights and garlands are hung on the trees.  Kazan Millennium Park is completely pedestrian.  All its paths are covered with paving stones. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  History of creation </h2><p>  Once on this place in the park, the streets of Poperechno-Georgievskaya (present Aidinova) and Uzenkaya (Ostrovsky) intersected.  The first connected Georgievskaya Square with Myasnitskaya right on the shore of Lake Nizhny Kaban.  Often in the reservoir the level rose and the whole area was flooded. </p>

    <p>  Until the beginning of this century, a private one-story building was located directly at the site of the complex, however, by 2005 it was demolished, and landscaping was carried out on the wasteland and in a very short time - in just a few months - the Millennium Park was built. </p><p>  Heads of many states were invited to its opening, who planted blue Christmas trees on the main avenue. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  It was decided to enclose the territory with a wrought-iron fence, in the patterns of which national motifs are visible.  In total, eight gates are arranged, the main of which are decorated with figures of zilants - snakes with wings, which, according to mythology, are symbols of Kazan. </p><p>  Alleys stretching from all the gates of the park converge in its center, forming a crossroads.  This idea is very symbolic, since the capital of Tatarstan is at the intersection of two parts of the world - Europe and Asia. </p><p>  At a crossroads on an elevated platform, a fountain is made in the form of a cauldron.  In addition to him, here you can see the monument to the famous Bulgarian poet Kul Gali, who wrote the poem "The Legend of Yusuf."  It is set in the middle of the alley that leads to the southeast gate.  An outstanding representative of medieval literature of the Volga-Bulgarian period died during the Mongol invasion in the thirteenth century.  The authors of the monument are Balashov, Minulin and Nurgaleeva.  The opening of the monument was timed to the opening date of the complex - in August 2005. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Kazan Millennium Park is divided into several functional zones.  In addition to the Central, called the "Crossroads" and symbolizing the role of the capital of Tatarstan as a meeting place between East and West, four more are provided.  Holidays are periodically held on the main square in Millennium.  According to the authors, in the future Kazan Millennium Park will also consist of several gardens that were given the original names: "Origin", "Maidan", "Oriental", "Garden of Sorrows" and "Garden of Love". </p><h2>  Zilates and the fountain </h2><p>  Kazan is a city with many attractions.  It is an ancient, beautiful city.  And for some time now, the Millennium Park can also be attributed to them.  Kazan has been for many years, but it is precisely this complex that is destined to symbolize the long path of development of the city.  Therefore, both the fountain and the zilant serpents, appearing in the legends about its foundation and supporting the cauldron, have become the place where the newlyweds come on their wedding day.  It is here that they throw coins for good fortune.  The width of the fountain is thirty-six meters.  Eight zilants were installed around the perimeter.  At the time of the construction of the park, the cost of each sculpture was about three hundred thousand rubles. </p><p>  There is a legend that explains both the name of the capital of Tatarstan and the choice of location for its foundation.  According to her, the Bulgars, who chose a place for the construction of the future city, the sorcerers ordered to build a settlement exactly where a boiler with water, dug into the ground, boils without fire.  After long searches and wanderings, such a unique site was discovered near Lake Kaban.  Hence the name of the city - Kazan.  It is this long-standing legend that the Kazan fountain symbolizes in the center of the Millennium Park. </p>

    <h2>  It is interesting </h2><p>  Not only on weekends, but also on weekdays, noisy wedding processions come here.  Literally from the first months of the appearance of the park on the city map, an interesting tradition has been established, according to which the newlyweds throw coins together in the boiler fountain, while declaring their wishes. </p><p>  I must say that the figures of the Zilants are periodically attacked by vandals.  There was even a case when several sculptures were destroyed at once, which, however, were immediately restored. </p>
