Today this museum in Helsinki offers its visitors an extensive exhibition consisting of more than seven and a half thousand paintings.  Among them are the works of such famous masters as J√§rnefelt, Simberg, Halonen. </p><h2>  Museum of Design </h2><p>  This museum in Helsinki is one of the oldest in the city.  It was founded in 1873, when there was not even such a term as ‚Äúdesign‚Äù.  At that time, the Craft Society existed in the city.  It was it that laid the foundation of the museum collection, acquiring hundreds of design items at the Vienna Exhibition.  They were visual aids for students studying at the School of Applied Arts, as well as exhibits that lovers of grace and beauty admired. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Helsinki Museum of Modern Art" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1802094.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  For a century, the collection has been replenished with designer exhibits.  In 1978, the museum was transferred to a building built by architect Nyustrem in 1895.
