    <h2>  Varieties </h2><p>  Conducting state final certification for secondary school graduates is carried out in the form of a single state exam.  In addition, since 2015, the final essay has been additionally introduced.  There are certain rules and an algorithm for holding such events, which should be mentioned in more detail. </p><h2>  Final essay for graduates </h2><p>  State certification in this form was introduced last academic year.  The expediency of introducing a similar form was determined by the president of the country.  The children are offered various topics on which they must write their essays in the form of reasoning (essay) for three academic hours.  Evaluation of work is carried out according to five criteria.  To qualify, you must use three criteria. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The minimum essay rate is 250 words.  Upon receipt of a credit in the spring of the current school year, graduates are given the opportunity to rewrite the composition.  Note that without a positive mark (credit) for this type of certification, graduates are deprived of the right to take compulsory subjects that give the right to receive a certificate of secondary education. </p>

    <h2>  Procedure </h2><p>  What is the feature of the state final certification?  Educational institutions must provide the regional center for assessing the quality of education with a complete database of graduates by February 1.  In addition to the passport data of each child, the database indicates additional items selected for delivery in the form of the exam.  Each child writes a statement addressed to the head of the educational institution, in which he indicates all the subjects, puts a personal signature. </p><p>  Parents of the student must also give their consent.  After February 1, there must be a good reason for adding new subjects to the database, and the child has the right to refuse to take optional subjects until the day of the exam itself. </p><p>  On the day of the exam, a graduate with a passport comes to the point of delivery of the unified state exam, brings with him a Russian passport, a black (gel) pen. </p><p>  Depending on the specifics of the subject being handed over, the use of additional subjects is allowed on the exam.  At the exam in chemistry and physics, for example, you can bring a non-programmable calculator.  A graduate passes into the audience, he gives personal things to the organizer, they are placed in a special safe during the exam. </p><p>  Among the latest innovations is the use of surveillance cameras during the final certification.  Any attempts to use the prompts by the mobile phone are recorded by the organizer in the protocol, the results of this student are canceled. </p><p>  The results of the final certification can be found in the educational institution in which the final certification was held.  In addition, it is possible to find the results on the official website. </p><p>  The program of state certification in all subjects, as well as the dates of the exams, the planned days for issuing the results, are presented on the official website of the unified state exam.  They can also be found in a comprehensive school, in which a graduate will undergo final certification. </p>
