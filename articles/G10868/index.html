    <h2>  Hotel Reservation </h2><p>  How do we usually book a hotel room?  As you know, this happens in two ways: </p><ul><li>  independently; </li><li>  through a travel agency. </li></ul><p>  In the first case, you look at various sites for a long time, read reviews and compare the cost of rest.  Naturally, thanks to this approach, you find the very hotel that is ideal in terms of price-quality ratio.  This is exactly the essential plus of independent travels - you always control the entire process of paperwork, hotel reservation and ticket purchase yourself.  Therefore, you are unlikely to face an unforeseen situation for which you will not be ready.  In addition, when it comes to traveling to Thailand, so beloved by our compatriots, it is difficult to expect any serious problems associated with the trip.  Pattaya, where Russians usually go, has long been a native and familiar.  Many claim that they come here several times a year, as if to a country house.  The only minus of independent travel to Thailand may be the fact that they need to be planned in advance.  It is advisable to book hotels and purchase tickets five to six months before the proposed trip.  A certain category of Russians does not have the opportunity to approach their vacation so responsibly, so they turn to a travel agency for help. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In this case, all the formalities fall on the shoulders of the specialists of a particular agency.  They will select a tour for you, talk about the hotel and take full care of your comfort and safety.  That's just, unfortunately, in recent years, the cost of trips has increased significantly, which reduced the flow of tourists to sunny Thailand and other countries.  But what to do when you really want to relax, and finances do not allow you to turn around?  To give up the sea and the sun in the beloved Pattaya?  Not at all.  For this category of vacationers, the Fortuna Pattaya 3 * system was invented, which allows you to fulfill your dreams for relatively little money. </p>

    <h2>  New hotel booking system: essence and features </h2><p>  So, you are planning a vacation in Pattaya.  Let's imagine that this is not the first time you are here, so we understand perfectly well the inexpediency of chasing the starryness of a hotel.  Indeed, in Thailand, you can relax in a three-star hotel, located a stone's throw from the treasured snow-white beach.  If these are your main criteria when choosing a hotel (do not forget about the affordable price), then you can freely book a hotel through Fortuna Pattaya 3 *. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Thailand (Pattaya) is not the first country where you can use this system, but it was here that it received the greatest distribution.  After all, it is in this exotic country that hotels are far from the main thing that attracts tourists.  So what is the essence of Fortuna Pattaya 3 *? </p><p>  Each agency or ordinary tourist can use this tour booking system when the thought of rest came spontaneously, and there is no time to wait for confirmation of booking from other hotels.  In this case, you use the Fortuna 3 Pattaya 3 * system (Thailand, Pattaya) and arrange a ticket for the required number of days.  You do not need to choose a hotel and compare prices, because the program itself will decide which hotel complex in the resort you will be accommodated.  You will only find out about this upon arrival in Bangkok. </p><p>  We can say that Fortuna Pattaya 3 * is a kind of data bank that collects almost all the "treshki" in Pattaya.  By the time you arrive in the country, the operator will know which hotel is available, and that is where you will get. </p><h2>  Risks of Fortune </h2><p>  Of course, not everyone can decide to check into a hotel that he did not even see.  But do not forget that even with a different booking system, no one guarantees you that the hotel will look like in the photo in the catalog.  There are a lot of reviews on the Internet about an unsuccessful vacation, when tourists are lodged in the wrong wing or the hotel itself is much older and dilapidated than expected.  If you take this into account, then a hotel from Fortuna Pattaya 3 * is not such a big risk. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Also, do not think that you will find yourself in some terrible place where you will have to tremble with fear and disgust every night.  In many cases, tourists are populated in the best "treshki" at the resort, which they themselves once looked through in catalogs with great pleasure.  Therefore, you may find yourself in even better conditions than planned.  Everything is in the hands of Fortune, and she, as you know, the lady is very moody. </p>

    <h2>  Advantages of the new system </h2><p>  If you are interested in Fortuna Pattaya 3 *, the reviews of those who have already used this budget way to travel will allow you to find out all the positive aspects of such a trip.  First of all, all tourists admire the cost of the tour, because it is usually fifteen to twenty percent less than a regular tourist ticket to Thailand.  Compared to this savings, minor household inconveniences that you may encounter at a hotel are fading into the background. </p><p>  Keep in mind that if you choose Fortuna Pattaya 3 * (we have given photos of possible hotels in this article), then the travel agency will never offer you a hotel below the stated "three rubles".  And they are pretty good in Thailand, it will tell you to anyone who has been here at least once in a lifetime. </p><p>  Fortuna Pattaya 3 * (often mentioned in reviews) is also often chosen by those who love adventure and risk.  Often these are young couples or large companies, which are much more important to get new impressions and emotions from Thailand than to admire a room in a hotel complex.  In addition, in this country the hotel should only spend the night, because there are so many interesting and new things around that it‚Äôs just a sin not to take the opportunity to plunge into a completely different and unfamiliar world. </p><p>  Summarizing all of the above, we can say that when you plan a trip to Pattaya, then Fortuna Pattaya 3 * is an excellent choice.  Its advantages: </p><ul><li>  cost savings; </li><li>  search for new experiences; </li><li>  unpretentiousness; </li><li>  the suddenness of the trip. </li></ul><p>  Do not forget that in this way you can travel to other countries. </p>

    <h2>  General Description of Fortuna Hotels </h2><p>  As we already said, a tourist can be accommodated in any of the hotels in Pattaya of the indicated star rating.  Therefore, you can scroll through the catalog in order to have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe settlement options. </p><p>  Keep in mind that any hotel with three stars will offer you the following services: </p><ul><li>  Room with one or two beds; </li><li>  a bathroom with a shower and a hairdryer; </li><li>  food (breakfast); </li><li>  air conditioning; </li><li>  a tea set; </li><li>  towels and bed linen on request; </li><li>  the use of sun loungers on site. </li></ul><p>  This is a very average list of services, because some hotels offer additional free services: </p><ul><li>  sightseeing tour; </li><li>  safe; </li><li>  mini bar; </li><li>  welcome fruit basket; </li><li>  bathrobe and slippers; </li><li>  trial massage session; </li><li>  use of the pool and gym. </li></ul><p>  Of course, until the very moment of settlement you will not know in what conditions you will have to live.  But in any case, you will have a clean room, delicious food and friendly staff.  Indeed, without these three components it is difficult to imagine a hotel complex in Thailand. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  Most tourists are concerned about the location of Fortune hotels.  After all, no one wants to get to the beach and back every day through the dusty streets of a bustling resort town.  Therefore, we are in a hurry to please you - all hotels are located in close proximity to the beach.  Usually they are located on the famous Jomtien beach, which is famous for its cleanliness and reasonable rental prices for sunbeds. </p><p>  Many tourists said that they had their own piece of the beach, while others reached it in just five minutes.  All this, of course, speaks in favor of Fortuna Pattaya.  By the way, those tourists who came to Pattaya for the first time are very surprised by the fact that the best five-star hotels are located deep in the city far from the coastline.  But the banal and democratic ‚Äútrois‚Äù are in the most favorable places.  How did this happen? </p><p>  The answer to this question lies in the history of Pattaya.  The fact is that a small fishing village, which later turned into a famous resort, was built up very chaotically.  In addition, a few decades ago, cozy and small hotels on the first coastal line were popular.  Over time, the city became upset and began to need more expensive hotel complexes, which had to be erected away from the beaches.  It so happened that the most budget hotels in Pattaya are located in the best places of the resort. </p><p>  Therefore, when you book a three-ruble note, you can be sure that an emerald and warm sea will be sure to be within a five-minute walk from you. </p><h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  In this matter, it is much more difficult to give a general description, because each hotel attracts guests in its own way.  Therefore, it is quite difficult to take into account all the nuances, but still try to do it. </p><p>  Usually every hotel with three stars has a small green area.  Thais treat nature with great trepidation and are happy to plant cozy courtyards with various exotic plants that delight tourists with their bloom. </p><p>  In many "three rubles" there is at least one pool, some hotel complexes boast two pools.  Therefore, in addition to the sea, you will have the opportunity to comfortably spend time on sunbeds in the courtyard of your own hotel. </p><p>  Do not hope that there will be some facilities for children in the hotel complex.  In Thailand, this is not accepted, so even in hotels of a higher class you can not find playgrounds and corners.  In rare cases, water slides are installed near the pools. </p><p>  The average three-star hotel in Pattaya has one restaurant and bar.  Here you can eat in the morning and evening.  Breakfast is usually included in the price of the ticket, but you have to have dinner for your money. </p><h2>  The cost of trips on this system </h2><p>  As we have already said, many travelers are attracted by the cheapness of packages that can be purchased from Fortuna Pattaya 3 *.  For example, a tour for one person from Moscow will cost from fifteen to eighteen thousand rubles.  Attractive price, isn't it? </p>

    <h2>  Fortuna Pattaya 3 * (Thailand, Pattaya): reviews </h2><p>  If you are still confused by the trip in this way, then you should study the reviews of other tourists who have already decided on a similar adventure.  So what do people say? </p><p>  In seventy percent of cases, tourists were very pleased with the trip.  They note that the hotel is fully consistent with the specified characteristics.  Therefore, we did not find any complaints on this issue in any comments left. </p><p>  Almost all vacationers specified that they lived very close to the sea, shops and markets.  Therefore, they had no problems with entertainment and nutrition.  From the hotel to get to anywhere in the resort town was not difficult for tourists. </p><p>  It is interesting that more than fifty percent of the people who left reviews will be happy to use this tour booking system once again. </p><h2>  Fortuna 3 * Pattaya (2 hotels 3 stars): features </h2><p>  Sometimes you can find an offer to book a tour on this system, but with two hotels.  Many are interested in how this option differs from the previous one and whether it is worth using it. </p><p>  Of course, it all depends on the <span>personal preferences of</span> vacationers.  Indeed, in this case, you will know for sure that you will be accommodated in one of the two hotels mentioned when booking.  Not always this option involves a choice.  Usually both proposed hotel complexes are far from the best places of rest in Pattaya.  But to someone, this option seems safer. </p>
