More often due to the fact that companies are trying to meet the preferences of modern consumers.  This applies, as a rule, not only to the quality of services, but also to design.  This is not the first time that the most noticeable event in the financial market has been the rebranding of Sberbank. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.elenayarosh.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank logo rebranding" class="if uuid-3192898" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3192898.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of the current style </h2><p>  The corporate identity of this financial organization forms the well-known logo, as well as graphic design. </p><p>  It must be said that the current symbol of the company was chosen for a reason.  He is very ambiguous. </p><p>  The circle is associated with a perfect geometric figure, complete and holistic.  He, as it were, hints at the impeccably debugged business processes taking place inside the company. </p><p>  However, there is alternative information that carries the opposite meaning.  In accordance with it, the logo can be perceived as some isolation and closeness.  For this reason, even before rebranding, Sberbank used a broken circle. </p><p>  So experts recognize the current logo of this organization as the most concise and at the same time endowed with colossal meaning.  Moreover, it can be perceived as a symbol of some concepts inextricably linked with banking.  This is a round coin, piggy bank or wallet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  No less important is the choice of color that Sberbank uses for corporate identity.  Green is perceived as a source of internal strength.  It calms, improves tone, respectively, creates pleasant emotions for potential as well as current customers of a financial organization. </p><div class="photo" data-original="akket.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank rebranding efficiency" class="if uuid-3192901" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3192901.jpg"></div><h2>  Logo Author </h2><p>  Sberbank's rebranding should not touch on a style that everyone recognizes.  After all, consumers have known it for decades and are firmly associated with a reliable financial institution. </p><p>  The logo was created by an artist named Lyudmila Morozova.  Its approval took place in 1991.  Moreover, the same font is always used to write the name of the bank.  It was chosen, as it somewhat resembles Old Russian and therefore emphasizes the nationality of a financial organization. </p><div class="photo" data-original="m.news.yandex.uz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank rebranding title" class="if uuid-3192902" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3192902.jpg"></div><h2>  Reason for change </h2><p>  Why do we need another rebranding of Sberbank?  This question is asked by many users.  Indeed, in their opinion, the corporate identity of this organization does not need any transformations.  However, management argues differently. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It should be reminded that an impressive network of branches scattered throughout the country is used as the main channel for increasing brand recognition. </p><p>  At the same time, there was a curious situation in which existing offices cannot boast of the unity of style.  Despite the presence of corporate identity, not all branches corresponded to it, since this procedure required impressive financial costs from the company.  It was this reason that became the basis for the rebranding of Sberbank. </p><p>  Indeed, the uniform style of branches throughout the country allows you to create the image of a prestigious organization that enjoys the trust and respect of its own customers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="news.myseldon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank rebranding the essence" class="if uuid-3192903" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3192903.jpg"></div><h2>  Essence </h2><p>  Sberbank's rebranding aims to bring all existing branches to a single style, eliminating fragmentation. </p><p>  For a long time, no updates were made to the existing style, as the organization was weakened by stability and the observance of traditions in customer service. </p><p>  The company's specialists regularly monitor the opinions of their own customers.  Often they remain dissatisfied with the duration of the service, as well as rudeness on the part of employees.  Another reason for rebranding is an attempt to overcome the prevailing stereotype among the population about the presence of impressive lines and incompetent employees. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lastview.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bank rebranding" class="if uuid-3192904" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3192904.jpg"></div><h2>  Previous change </h2><p>  The effectiveness of Sberbank rebranding is obvious.  However, changes in corporate identity only indirectly affect the financial performance of the organization. </p><p>  The previous rebranding took place in 2009.  The changes affected not only the corporate identity, but also the services provided by the company.  The new style has gained a well-known logo, as well as the familiar color.  However, it is worth noting that the changes were not dramatic.  The brand is still recognizable. </p><h2>  Expenses </h2><p>  Any changes in corporate identity are expensive.  The costs of the previous rebranding amounted to about twenty billion rubles.  According to experts, such expenses were justified and allowed the company to clearly indicate its own transition to a new level of development. </p><p>  The current rebranding will also cost Sberbank a lot of money.  The organization plans to spend tens of millions of dollars on corporate identity transformation.  However, the exact numbers are unknown. </p><h2>  Directions </h2><p>  After rebranding, the name of Sberbank should be somewhat reduced.  According to the current head of the company, the current name does not fully reflect the variety of services provided.  For this reason, the word "bank" should disappear from the name.  According to German Gref, the list of services and offers that the company provides is somewhat wider than that of a traditional bank. </p><p>  However, not everyone supports this solution.  For example, Anatoly Aksakov believes that rebranding is too expensive an event for the company.  At the moment, the brand is strongly associated with a reliable company that is trusted.  Accordingly, the current logo and name fully perform their own task.  Moreover, companies that have a long history, on the contrary, strive to maintain their own name, rather than abandon it. </p><p>  But back to the essence of rebranding.  Why does the head of the company deny the need to use the word "bank" in the name?  The thing is that at the moment this organization is something more.  In addition to financial services, it provides the services of a telecom operator, trading platform, etc. </p><p>  Moreover, the future plans of Sberbank indicate an even farther departure from traditional business standards.  A single brand unites an increasing number of services, which are less and less directly related to the banking sector. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.likeni.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank rebranding" class="if uuid-3192905" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3192905.jpg"></div><p>  Summing up, it is worth noting that the next rebranding of Sberbank does not bring significant or dramatic changes.  If they are, then they are insignificant and, most likely, turn out to be completely invisible to most customers.  However, the changes should affect not only the external picture, but also the organization of work inside the bank.  New technologies will be introduced, credit programs will be developed and payment services will be provided.  In addition, the almost complete absence of queues, as well as the availability of convenient terminals, will become a pleasant surprise. </p>
