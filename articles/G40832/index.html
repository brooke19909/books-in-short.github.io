    <h2>  What is in your name? </h2><p>  Vysokinsky got its name, because it seems as if it rises above the Gulf of Finland.  Although this is a visual hoax.  The bay is located nearby.  And if you go to him, the road will go down and down. </p><p>  There is a version that the name arose because the lake is located in the middle of a tall pine forest.  Or maybe because there is a high shore on the north side?  As you can see, we can only guess about the origin of the name. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Lake Vysokinsky of the Leningrad Region is located in the Vyborg District.  Kilometers 12 in the southeast side of the city of Primorsk and 150 km south of St. Petersburg.  You can get to the place both by rail and by road.  Of course, it‚Äôs more convenient to use a personal car along the Primorsky highway.  A diesel train will deliver from Zelenogorsk to the Ermilovo station, and then a 6-kilometer walk.  And here it is, Vysokinsky Lake. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake Vysokinskoye, Leningrad Region" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1154532.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Secret object </h2><p>  Since the middle of the last century, between the Gulf of Finland and Vysokinsky there is a military facility - a test complex.  Its names have changed more than once.  At one time there was a strict security zone, guarded by the troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.  Within a radius of 5 km there were no settlements, forest and agricultural activities were prohibited.  That is why a large-scale tourist destination did not capture Lake Vysokinsky.  The plant and the entire surrounding area have long been closed to the press.  Dangerous tests related to <span>rocket fuel</span> (fluorine) were conducted here.  The plant was closed 20 years ago. </p><h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  It is surprising that in the special regime zone deciduous trees had no obvious signs of fluoride damage.  In the 60s of the XX century a new forest was planted in these areas.  Soon there appeared a brood of grouse, as well as other species of rare birds.  And this is definitely a good sign. </p><p>  Oddly enough, but the water in the lake is cleaner than in neighboring bodies of water.  The coastline is weakly overgrown with reeds.  And thanks to the special bottom, the water is very clear, which diving enthusiasts will really like. </p>
