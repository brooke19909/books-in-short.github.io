For example, make rafting on the rivers of Siberia. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stormy freestyle" class="if uuid-2762401" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104214/2762401.jpg"></div><h2>  Water tourism </h2><p>  River rafting is a kind of sports tourism.  This is a trip, the route of which goes along the rivers, and a person spends most of his time sitting in a boat (in a kayak, kayak, raft, catamaran).  It may seem physically easier than a hike: you don‚Äôt need to go carrying heavy backpacks, you can just sit and admire the surrounding beauty.  However, in reality, the physical preparation necessary for the alloy should be good enough. </p><p>  Water routes can have varying degrees of difficulty: from the lungs, which can be walked even by people without experience, to the very difficult ones, which few can go through or that have not been walked yet, including waterfalls, canyons and other dangerous obstacles. </p><p>  Water trips also vary in duration: they can be either one-day or very long - weeks or even months. </p><p>  Different equipment is needed depending on the complexity and duration of the alloy.  For a one-hour boat trip along the nearby river, you can use an ordinary inflatable boat and simple clothes, but for multi-day rafting, the number of necessary things increases: this is the supply of provisions, and tents, and sleeping bags, and replaceable clothes, all of which must be hermetically packed.  The most extreme routes in Russia are rafting along the rivers of Siberia.  Due to their length and complexity, they are interesting for professionals who can demonstrate and hone their skills, however, beginners will be able to find a suitable route for themselves. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.argophilia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Putorana Plateau Krasnoyarsk Territory" class="if uuid-2762430" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104214/2762430.jpg"></div><h2>  Feature travels in Siberia </h2><p>  Siberia is famous for its vast territory and untouched nature, and this gives traveling around this region a special charm and unusualness.  Here you can visit truly wild and deserted places, take a break from everyday worries, society and the noise of the metropolis.  Rafting along the rivers of Siberia allows you to feel like a part of pristine nature, enjoy its beauty and power.  However, this remoteness from civilization has its drawbacks. </p><p>  Firstly, if you live in the European part of Russia, then you will need a sufficiently large amount of time and money to get to the place of the campaign.  And even if you are already in Siberia, for starters you need to get to where the water part of the route begins.  Depending on the transport accessibility of the starting point of the rafting and on your financial capabilities, this can be done by car, horse, all-terrain vehicle, on foot.  Often when rafting along the rivers of Siberia, you can get to some inaccessible place only by helicopter. </p><p>  Secondly, since alloys usually take place in uninhabited places, in case of problems or an accident it will be difficult for you to get help.  Therefore, you do not need to go alone in the rafting on the rivers of Siberia without an instructor, if you do not have much experience in this type of tourism. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theadventurejunkies.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="with a kayak fishing rod" class="if uuid-2762406" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104214/2762406.jpg"></div><h2>  Who will be interested in rafting on Siberian rivers </h2><p>  River tourism may be of interest to those who already have experience in camping life, and those who had never before gone camping.  It can be a wonderful family vacation, uniting children and parents, teaching them to deal with difficulties together.  For fishing enthusiasts, rafting on the rivers of Siberia can provide an opportunity to get to the most inaccessible corners and go fishing in ecologically clean places where the fish is not poisoned by harmful substances entering the water.  For photographers - the opportunity to get rare photos of wild animals and natural beauties. </p>
