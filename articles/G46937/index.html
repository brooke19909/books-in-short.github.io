Description and classification of the endings of chess games</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Chess fights have been popular for more than a century.  Originally from the East, this game won the recognition of Europeans and took pride of place among sports.  As befits a serious sport, chess has its own structure, its own rules and, accordingly, its own terminology.  One of the basic <span>chess terms,</span> which will be discussed below, is the endgame.  This is the third, final stage of the game.  The term comes from the German language.  The literal meaning of the word “endgame” is “end of game”.  However, not every party ending can be called this term, so you need to understand it in more detail. </p><h2>  Endgame Features </h2><p>  So, the endgame - these are the conditions of the game when a small number of pieces remain on the board.  As a rule, in such cases complex combinations and attacks on the king are impossible.  Therefore, in the endgame there are slightly different principles of the game.  Speaking about the essence of the final part of the game, one should not forget about the characteristic strategic features that are characteristic of intellectual competitions, one of which, without a doubt, is chess.  The endgame involves tactics aimed not at arranging a trap for the king, but at promoting a pawn to return the primary pieces, mainly the queen.  Therefore, in comparison with other stages of the game, the value of pawns especially increases in the endgame.  Often, the outcome of a game can be determined by the advantage of a player in just one ordinary figure. </p>

    <p>  Another feature that distinguishes the endgame from other game endings is the activity of the king.  Since he is practically not threatened with mate, the king takes part in attacks and strategic formations along with other figures. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If in the middle of the game, when the game is filled with pieces, a numerical superiority on one side can be an advantage, then the endgame is a situation where the outcome of the battle is not affected by the number of pieces, but by the clear, well-coordinated interaction of the few remaining ones. </p><h2>  The meaning of the figures </h2><p>  The endgame is a difficult stage of the game.  Based on the positions, available figures and strategies of the players, different types of endgames are distinguished.  The choice of one of them depends on many factors.  In any case, it is important to provide all of your figures with sufficient activity.  This also applies to pawns, because sometimes it is their role that comes to the fore, and the outcome of the game depends on their coordinated movements on the board.  On the other hand, the need for activity also applies to other pieces, since if they only cover pawns, they will lose their game potential in vain.  At the same time, it is necessary to limit the mobility of the opponent’s pieces as much as possible, repairing the pawns and forcing their pieces to remain passive, playing only a defensive role. </p><p>  A correctly played endgame often leads to zugzwang. </p>

    <h2>  Classification Basics </h2><p>  Since the endgame is a game of few figures, it is easy enough to study, analyze and classify.  The theoretical preparation of the player here matters more than ever.  Some positions in the endgame have only one possible winning solution, and therefore it is easy to play it to those who are prepared for the game. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A detailed classification of possible endgame variations is based on two factors - the amount of forces available and their quality.  Regular tournaments and games of outstanding players offer numerous endgame options for analysis and study.  Their number is constantly growing.  Those that have already been thoroughly studied are called theoretical.  Based on them, general patterns, tactics and strategic rules of the game are revealed.  Many of the theoretical endgames have been around for centuries, and some have entered the professional world of chess along with the game itself from its ancient prototypes. </p><h2>  Endgame Types </h2><p>  There is no main type of it.  Gold, diamond or diamond endgame, like any other "very-most" - these are only the <span>personal preferences of</span> this or that player. </p>

    <p>  In general, there are six main types: </p><ol><li>  Pawn - endgame, where, except for the king, there are no other pieces on the board. </li><li>  Konevoy is an endgame in which, in addition to pawns, horses also play. </li><li>  Endgame, where one of the sides has an elephant, which is opposed by the opponent's horse. </li><li>  An endgame in which an elephant or horse is forced to fight an enemy boat. </li><li>  Rook - endgame when opponents are chopped by rooks. </li><li>  An endgame where an enemy queen plays against a piece of one player. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  To flawlessly play the endgame, the player needs not only to be able to flawlessly calculate moves and predict the actions of the opponent, but also to know the internal laws and mechanisms of chess competitions.  Good luck in the endgame situation has virtually no place. </p>
