Waterpark in Dubai Wild Wadi: photos, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>The United Arab Emirates</span> is a highly sought after tourist destination.  It attracts travelers from different countries with snow-white beaches, a dry and hot climate, futuristic architecture of their cities, as well as shopping.  But what about relaxing with the kids?  Shopping is boring for little tourists, and the beaches are boring with their monotony.  Given all this, the UAE authorities are building water parks at the resorts.  Yes, what!  To match the architectural masterpieces like the hotel "Bourge-al-Arab" or the Palm Islands.  The maximum dose of adrenaline is provided to you, and moreover, complete safety is observed.  Today we‚Äôll talk about Wild Wadi.  This water park is not the largest in the country, but the most breathtaking.  Young guests, and adults (those who are young in soul), will receive a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãimpressions here. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Wild wadi water park" class="if" height="226" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/482837.jpg" width="250"></div>

    <h2>  Where it is and when it works </h2><p>  Wadi - that‚Äôs the name of a river that fills with water only when it rains.  And the rest of the time it‚Äôs a dry gorge.  "Wild River" - so literally called the water park Wild Wadi, Dubai (UAE).  This island of water pleasures is located in the Jumeirah district, on Jumeirah Road.  Numerous photos of the water park show a beautiful high-rise building resembling a sail.  This is <span>Jumeirah Beach</span> Hotel.  By the way, the guests of this hotel, as well as all the guests of the <span>Jumeirah</span> Group <span>hotels (Bourge</span> al-Arab, Madinat, Emirates Towers), admission to the water park is free.  Guests staying at the Jumeirah Beach Hotel can drive up to the Wild Wadi gates on a buggy.  The rest can use taxi services.  It will cost about 5-7 –Ñ.  Every taxi driver in Dubai knows where Wild Wadi (water park) is located.  Alternatively, you can take bus number 8. Its route starts in the Golden Souk (Golden Bazaar) area in Deira and follows along the coast of Jumeirah.  The water park operates seven days a week, but opening and closing hours vary depending on the season.  In summer, guests can enjoy the rides and pools from 10.00 to 20.00, and in winter from 11.00 to 18.00. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Waterpark Wild wadi photo" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/482398.jpg" width="415"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Wild Wadi Waterpark, whose photo captivates with its dynamics, is located on an area of ‚Äã‚Äãonly five hectares.  This is far from a record among similar institutions in the UAE.  But it captivates with its more modern equipment, well-designed theme of attractions and guaranteed their safety.  We can say that this water park is the most expensive project in the Emirates.  And the scariest one.  A storm of emotions, an explosion of adrenaline and a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãpositive will be received here without exception.  Attractions are united by a common theme - the adventures of Sinbad the sailor.  But each of them has its own legend.  The magical "Wild Wadi River" will carry you and its turbulent waves past the rocks and oases.  Guests of the park will find a joyful screeching, rafting, diving in the azure waters of the pools and even surfing on the steep ocean waves. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Waterpark in Dubai Wild wadi" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/482402.jpg" width="437"></div>

    <h2>  Wild Wadi (water park): prices </h2><p>  As in all advanced cultural institutions, Wild Wadi has a flexible pricing policy.  A typical entrance costs 130 dirhams for adults, and 110 AED for children (4-12 years old).  Translated into European currency, this equals approximately 27.6 and 23.4 –Ñ, respectively.  But if you come to the water park "at sunset", then pay 100 dirhams for an adult and 85 for a child.  This corresponds to 21 and 18 –Ñ.  The concept of "sunset" varies depending on the season.  In winter, it is three hours before closing time, that is, from 15 to 18.00.  If you suddenly forgot at home bathing suits, beach shoes or sunblock, these things can be purchased at the "medieval bazaar" in the park.  Towel rental will cost you ten dirhams (2.1 euros).  The use of a locker for storing especially valuable things costs the same amount.  When buying a ticket, they put a bracelet on your wrist that contains a waterproof electronic card.  You can put any amount on it and then pay with it for food, souvenirs and individual attractions.  Unused money is returned to you upon exit.  When you visit the water park again, you are entitled to a discount. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Waterpark Wild wadi Dubai UAE" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/482400.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Rides </h2><p>  Through the entire territory of the water park, the Juha's Journey artificial river flows 360 meters in length, which makes unexpected turns, forms lagoons and even creates an eighteen-meter-high waterfall.  Twenty eight slides of different lengths work here - from 12 to 130 meters, and another 23 swimming pools, including those with an ocean wave.  The total length of the entire water artery, tangled like a maze, is almost two kilometers.  The water temperature in both winter and summer is maintained at +28 ¬∞ C.  The main thing that attracts visitors to the Wild Wadi <span>water park in Dubai</span> is the Jumeirah Sceirah attraction.  It represents the highest water slide in the Old World - 33 meters!  Moreover, it is replete with all sorts of turns, and the raft with a passenger at the end of the path reaches a speed of 80 km / h.  Those who think it is too much can ride the Master Blaster - eight slides connected to each other by one pipe, from which they move in single and double circles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Wild wadi water park reviews" class="if" height="474" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/482401.jpg" width="310"></div>

    <h2>  Vacation with children </h2><p>  It should be noted right away that some visitors are not allowed on some attractions.  They are weeded out by height, checking the child with a scale on the wall: if it is higher than 110 centimeters, it passes, if it is lower - no.  But Wild Wadi (water park) takes care of the leisure of its youngest guests.  Especially for them, a shallow lagoon Juha's Dhow with a stranded ship is equipped.  Many fountains, slides and waterfalls will not frighten the peanut, but will delight him.  Nearby, there is a children's playground with amusing swing-carousels.  If your young child is a brave dozen, welcome to Family Ride - an alloy on a large inflatable raft.  There is also a slow river Lazy River, lazily flowing throughout the park. </p><h2>  Wild Wadi (water park): reviews </h2><p>  Most of all, visitors liked the fact that they did not need to climb, panting along the long stairs, so that then they would slide down a hill for a minute.  You will be taken to the top of the attraction by a special device - "a waterfall, flowing the other way around."  Everything looks like this: you get on the raft and rescuers push it to the pipe.  Special nozzles push water upward, moving you too. </p><p>  Guests also remember the pools with artificial surf.  Waves sometimes reach 2.5 meters.  This is where you can safely surf, because about fifty rescuers are constantly watching the vacationers.  Visitors also joyfully noted the fact that, in addition to the Shahbandar's Quay bazaar with snacks, Sinbad's Galley eatery and Julshan's Kitchen restaurant, there are many picnic places in the water park.  So you can stock up on provisions and go there all day. </p>
