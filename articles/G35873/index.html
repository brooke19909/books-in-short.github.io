They are attracted, first of all, by the capital.  Exquisite architecture will surprise and delight even the most sophisticated tastes.  The city has a lot of entertainment, including a zoo.  Prague is considered to be the most beautiful place in all of Europe. </p><p>  Ancient unique castles are scattered throughout the country.  Entire towns have also been preserved, the architecture of which has not changed since the XVIII century.  A great place for families for city residents and guests of the capital is the zoo.  Prague is famous for its brewing traditions and attracts connoisseurs of original recipes and tastes. </p><h2>  Long preparation </h2><p>  Long before the appearance of the complex in a form familiar to visitors, there were various menageries.  So in 1881 a letter was published calling for the opening of the zoo.  Then in 1981, attempts were made to organize the necessary space.  Even a project was drawn up according to which a zoo was to appear in one of the Czech parks.  Prague, however, did not wait for its implementation.  In 1899, they again tried to come to an agreement. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Prague Zoo" class="if" height="444" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34978/873693.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The implementation of the idea to open a zoo in Prague is due to Professor Jiri Jandu.  From childhood he was fond of the animal kingdom, and later became a famous ornithologist.  In many of his works he put forward and developed the theme of creating a zoo.  In 1904, the government allocated the scientist to create the complex ≈†tvanice island.  But he believed that the land received was too small.  Then the war began, and the construction was frozen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Commissioning </h2><p>  In 1919, the government returned to the idea that the city needed a zoo.  At that time Prague had 14 different options for plots to equip space.  The land was best approached near the capital in the town of Troy, which was donated by the agricultural magnate Alois Liberty. </p><p>  But due to various difficulties, construction was slow.  By the end of 1927, the fence of the future zoo was ready.  Professor Jirja Yanda kept some of the animals that were donated to the fund of the complex in his villa, since the enclosures were not ready for them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Prague Zoo Photo" class="if" height="421" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34978/873692.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  September 28, 1931 for the first time opens its doors to visitors to the zoo in Prague.  Photographic materials and memoirs of contemporaries suggest that he was not yet completed, but the positive impressions of meeting with animals overshadowed all the repair flaws.  Pavilions and enclosures with livestock became so popular that the administration had to increase the number of days and increase hours of work for visits. </p><h2>  The inhabitants </h2><p>  Among the first animals were the she-wolf of Lot, the <span>horses of Przewalski</span> Mink and Ali.  In 1932, the tigers Mitau and Bengali settled in the premises.  Twelve months later, they brought the first litter.  Then cubs of a rhino, baby elephant, hippo get into the walls of the safari.  The team is presented with two sea lions.  Further, in a rock, to which the territory adjoins, a cat's house is cut down.  Two years later, employees presented to the public the first circus performance.  Then a lot of rare animals and cubs left without parents went along the route Czech Republic - Prague - zoo.  Photos of many saved babies are stored in the archives of the organization. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zoo in Prague how to get there" class="if" height="403" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34978/873691.jpg" width="600"></div>

Due to heavy rains, the Vltava River overflowed the banks and flooded a huge amount of space.  A natural disaster erupted rapidly - water arrived at a speed of 5160 cm per second.  Therefore, employees were unable to evacuate part of the animals from the bottom of the complex.  134 animals died, property was significantly damaged.  The 2013 flood caused slightly less damage. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get to the zoo in Prague" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34978/873695.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The zoo complex in the Czech Republic has a huge scale.  Currently, the area is 60 hectares, 50 of which are reserved for indoor premises, aviaries and pens for animals.  The creators of the zoo tried to create conditions for all inhabitants as close as possible to natural conditions.  The landscape is naturally divided into two parts.  From the highlands to the valley and back you need to travel by funicular. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Czech Republic Prague Zoo photo" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34978/873690.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  Here you can see about 5 thousand animals.  Themed pavilions are equipped.  The brightest is called the "Indonesian Jungle."  Tropical plants, animals and birds feel very comfortable in it. </p><h2>  Route </h2><p>  If you decide to visit the zoo in Prague, how to get there, and some other questions regarding the route, it is better to clarify in advance.  Of course, you will not be able to get lost, because each passerby will show the way.  But due to the language barrier, you are likely to lose the cherished time, which can be spent not on wandering around an unfamiliar city, but on communicating with the animal world. </p><p>  So how to get to the zoo in Prague?  For those traveling by car, the location coordinates are 14 ¬∞ 24'41.585 ‚Ä≥ E, 50 ¬∞ 7'0.513 ‚Ä≥ N.  Free parking at Troy Castle.  For people who do not have personal transport, there are two options for moving.  Easier, faster and more convenient to get on the subway and bus.  So, the traveler needs to get off at Nadrazi Holesovice station.  Then find a stop, it is located near the exit of the subway.  The bus runs at intervals of 5-7 minutes.  The journey takes an average of 10 minutes. </p><p>  But a trip on a ship will become more romantic and interesting.

From it you need to walk another 30 minutes. </p><h2>  timetable </h2><p>  The complex is open all year, all days of the week.  Opening hours vary according to season.
