The hotel is suburban, relatively new.  It was built in two thousand and five.  The hotel is a network hotel, belongs to the Intercontinental line.  Travel programs are organized here by the international Holiday Inn group, which has opened its second hotel in Sanya in the last ten years.  Both of these companies offer you relaxation and service that meets the requirements of all international standards.  No wonder the number of Russian tourists both on Hainan Island as a whole, and in Sanya, is growing every year.  Rest here is prestigious, not very expensive and completely safe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holiday Inn Sanya Bay" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1632243.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get and when it is better to go </h2><p>  Sanya is a Chinese resort hosting tourists all year round.  Although formerly guilty officials were exiled to the area, everyone is now happy to visit local beaches.  Even the rainy season in Sanya is almost invisible, and temperature fluctuations are minimal.  The high season depends on the holidays that tourists come to celebrate, and not at all on the weather or climate.  The fewest people in Sanya are in the summer, when the sun can burn, and strong waves rise at sea.  Typhoons are possible in October or September, but in practice they are rare.  Sanya has the Phoenix International Airport, which is located eleven kilometers from the city center and very close to our hotel.  Regular flights of Aeroflot, South and East Chinese Airlines fly here, as well as Hainan Airlines.  True, only charter planes arrive here from Moscow without changes.  A transit stop is best done in Wuhan.  A big plus of the Holiday Inn Sanya Bay hotel, the photo of which will satisfy any tourist with taste, is that if you fly directly to Sanya Airport, then you will be brought here first and taken last.  But if you do not arrive in Phoenix, but in another hub, know that you will have to drive from three to five hours to the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holiday Inn Resort Sanya Bay 5" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1632255.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sea and sun baths </h2><p>  The Municipal Beach is literally a few steps from Holiday Inn Resort Sanya Bay Park.  Reviews assure: in order to get there, you need to cross a narrow road with very little traffic.  The water is clean, the entrance to the sea is sandy.  There are not very many people.  The sand is small, pleasant.  The water temperature in winter is not tropical - about twenty-three degrees or slightly higher, but it gives a feeling of coolness.  In the summer, she warms up to thirty.  There is always a small surf that does not stop swimming at all.  The beach is safe, security guards work.  The bathing area is surrounded by buoys.  There are umbrellas and sunbeds.  By regular bus directly from the hotel you can still get to one beach - Yaluvan, insanely beautiful, with clear turquoise water.  In the hotel beach towels are issued without any problems and deposits.  And the sea can be accessed directly in the hotel bathrobe.  From nine in the morning until eleven in the evening, the Holiday Inn Resort Sanya Bay 5 has a tropical thermal pool.  Depth is different.  Around him there are many sunbeds.  After sunset, a barbecue is arranged by the pool.  There is a children's "paddling pool" in the hotel. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Of course, tour operators will not leave you alone at the Holiday Inn Sanya Bay.  Reviews, however, advise buying excursions from local residents.  Otherwise, you will be taken to the center of Chinese medicine and offered a small sightseeing tour.  If you contact your local travel agency, you will be provided with a good car with a driver and an individual program.  Of course, on this island there are no ancient temples or palaces, but the lush nature may well replace them with you.  Landscapes "End of the World" is a kind of "rock garden" where bizarre boulders with romantic names are scattered along the sea.  Admire nature and on the mountain "Deer turned his head."  It is especially beautiful there in the evening.  But in the daytime, you can have a great time there, especially since you have a lot of attractions at your disposal, in particular, toboggan.  Be sure to visit the Pearl and Plantation Museum where it is grown. </p><h2>  Holiday Inn Sanya Bay 5: reviews </h2><p>  Hotel guests praise both the hotel and the surrounding area primarily for a comfortable climate for relaxation.  There is no heat, no suffocating wet heat.  A cool breeze often blows here, but it does not get cold at all.  Guests really like the proximity of the hotel to the sea - from any room to the beach no more than three minutes walk.  Vacationers responded positively that it is quiet, the public is mostly decent.  True, many complain about the restrictions of the Chinese government regarding Internet access.  For example, Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter are banned in the country.  Catering tourists organized very competently.  Many people like that often you can choose a dish raw or as a semi-finished product, and everything else is prepared with you and add those sauces and seasonings that you specify.  Although “all inclusive” works here, most of the guests eat half-board at the Holiday Inn Sanya Bay 5 *, and dine in the city (unless, of course, there is still room in the stomach after such an abundant “buffet”).  The most popular dishes are Peking duck and lobster.  You can call a free transfer from the hotel to any cafe or restaurant in the city, which, of course, cannot but please tourists. </p>
