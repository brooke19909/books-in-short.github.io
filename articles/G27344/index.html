    <h2>  History </h2><p>  The Tsar‚Äôs Trail in Crimea was created in order to connect 2 settlements - Livadia and the village of Gaspra.  However, few people know how it all began. </p><p>  Back in 1861, the imperial family acquired the Livadia Palace from the heirs of Count Potocki.  The path to it passed only on <span>Lower Oreanda</span> (Crimea), but then there was a need to connect the palace with Cape Ai-Todor. </p><p>  We thought for a long time how best to make the road, and soon it was decided to lay a trail through the mountains.  At first glance, nothing special, but the task should be carried out in such a way that there would be no differences in elevation and pressure along the entire path. </p>

    <p>  Despite the difficult terrain, the task was completed in full, and the trail received another name - "Horizontal".  And indeed, there is not the slightest sensation along the way that uphill begins somewhere or that there will be a steep descent.  Everything is done as if the walk is on a straight path. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The people also called it the "health path", because during the trip it was possible to breathe clean, mountain air, which very well helped in the treatment of pulmonary diseases. </p>

    <p>  In 1900, Emperor Nicholas II was about to leave for St. Petersburg, but before doing this, he gave the commission to the administrator Livadia Evreinov.  The order was for the workers to pave the path from the "Pink Gate", which is located in Livadia, to the road in Upper Oreanda (Crimea). </p>

    <p>  A year later, all work was completely completed and the Tsar‚Äôs Path in the Crimea was completely completed. </p><p>  This tourist route was given the modern name <span>"Sun Trail"</span> under the Soviet regime, since the mention of words related to the royal family was extremely undesirable.  By the way, the name "sunny" is not entirely appropriate here, since there are places where the sun does not break through at all due to dense thickets. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  There is a "Health Path" or "Royal Path" in Yalta, and more precisely in the Yalta city district.

This can be done in different ways, for example, by bus or private car.  Let's consider both options in more detail. </p><h2>  Bus </h2><p>  One of the most popular ways to get to the trail is, of course, by bus.  They often go, especially in the midst of the tourist season, there are no problems with them.  In addition, some flights depart from the bus station, which is located near the airport.  This, of course, is a positive moment for those who decided to get to Crimea by plane. </p><h2>  To Yalta </h2><p>  To get by bus to Yalta is not difficult.  There are many flights from different bus stations.  Travel time is approximately 1 hour 50 minutes - 2 hours.

From <span>Yalta bus station there</span> are two direct minibuses: No. 11 and No. 100 (5).  You need to take a seat not at the bus station itself, but at the stop at the Oktyabr cinema.  To reach it is not difficult and will not take more than 5 minutes.  As for the total travel time, it is 30-35 minutes for minibus No. 11 and 25 minutes for minibus No. 100 (5). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Car </h2><p>  The option with a personal car is perfect for those who want to travel around the <span>Crimea on their own.</span>  From the Kerch <span>ferry</span> to the Livadia Palace there is only one road, and it is quite long.  Travel time will be a little more than 5 hours.  For convenience, it is recommended to use the car‚Äôs navigation system or install the appropriate application on the smartphone. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  You can get acquainted with all the key points on the route using the pointer, which is located near the beginning of the trail in Livadia Park.  In principle, the road does not bode of difficulties, and getting lost somewhere is very difficult, so you can travel without a map. </p><p>  The total length of the route is 6711 meters, which can be read on the welcome stone.  By the way, such signs are located along the entire trail.  On each of them there is information about the distance traveled, about how much more is left to go and the height number.  Here, in fact, and a photo for a better example. </p><p>  Some time ago, most of these signs were destroyed by vandals, but, fortunately, today the local authorities not only restored them, but also make sure they are clean and well read. </p>

    <p>  Of course, the main feature of the ‚ÄúRoyal Path‚Äù in Crimea is its ‚Äúhorizontalness‚Äù.  As already mentioned, the road was made in such a way that elevation differences are not felt here, although they exist.  For example, at the starting point, the height above the level is 135 meters, and closer to the end it reaches 203 meters. </p><p>  Of course, there are also benches for relaxation, where you can take a breath, have a bite to eat if necessary, or just admire nature, breathing in the clean mountain air with aromas of coniferous trees. </p>

    <p>  Also on the route there are observation platforms with a wonderful view.  More on this below. </p><h2>  Route </h2><p>  It's time to go to the route, more precisely, its detailed description: what it consists of, what you can see, what to pay attention to and so on.  You can start the journey both from the Livadia Palace, and from the sanatorium to them.  Roses Luxembourg in the village of Gaspra.  It all depends on where the person is at the moment. </p><p>  As an example, a trip from the Livadia Palace will be considered.  So, just a few minutes after passing the welcome plate, you will be able to meet a sundial, a map and a bench.  I immediately want to warn that the clock shows inaccurate time and you should not navigate by it.  The map is also of little use, since it was applied directly to the stone surface and eventually became unusable. </p><p>  The further part of the trail passes in the shade due to dense thickets of trees.  The sun's rays hardly break through, it even gets a little cool.  On the way, you will meet the first statue.  This girl, carved in a stone block, bears the name of Jalita or Echo, who calls it what.  The first means "Yalta" in Arabic, and the second more symbolizes the forest spirit. </p><p>  Further on the way there will be 2 sections of the road that cross the path.  At the first intersection you should go straight ahead, and near the second there will be a large rock with a pointing arrow to the right.  There you should go.  Just after the next turn, wonderful views of the Lower Oreanda will begin to open. </p>

    <p>  Going a little further, you can enjoy all this beauty from the first viewing platform - ‚ÄúThe Royal Arbor‚Äù or as it is also called ‚ÄúRotunda in Oreanda‚Äù.  The main attention is drawn to the view of the sea and Cross Mountain. </p><p>  Move on.  The next attraction on the way is the same Mount Krestovaya or Stavri-Kae.  Its feature is that it has an almost vertical plumb of 90 degrees.  Climbers gather here quite often to try their hand.  You can climb to the top of the mountain along a special path marked with red markers.  It is located next to the natural monument.  A cross is installed on top, but it is more mesmerizing than the view that opens from there.  This place can be safely attributed to another viewing platform. </p><p>  After the Cross Mountain, you can also admire an excellent view of the church of the Holy Archangel Michael, another famous mountain in the Crimea - Ai-Nikola and the White-headed Massif. </p>

    <p>  Then again there will be several intersections and forks.  First you need to climb the stairs up and after a while go down.  Then at the fork, you must continue straight ahead, and there will already be signs with arrows. </p>

    <p>  Now we can see the famous Swallow's Nest, located in the village of Gaspra.  You can also go down to it along a special path, which is located near the stone sign. </p><p>  If you continue straight ahead, then the Tsar‚Äôs Path will go on the track and will go along it for some time.  Having reached the sign with a mark of 6,200 meters, there will be an opportunity to admire gorgeous views of Ai-Petri, Shaan-Kai and simply beautiful landscapes.  Further down the road will be another sign with an arrow that will direct you to another fork, and then to the children's sanatorium named after  Roses Luxembourg.  Nearby you can find a stone, informing that the route has been completed. </p><p>  All that remains to be done after this is to go along the path to the Sevastopol-Yalta highway, take the bus and go in the right direction, for example, to Livadia or Yalta. </p>
