The recipe for success was probably in a large hull and turret, ease of maintenance, reliability and a reliable chassis, which allowed to expand the array of weapons, compared with the Panzer III.  Starting from model A to F1, early versions that used a short 75 mm barrel were gradually replaced by ‚Äúlong‚Äù ones, from F2 to H, with a very efficient high-speed gun inherited from the Pak 40, which could handle the Soviet KV-1 and T -34.  In the end, the <span>German</span> T-4 <span>tank</span> (photo presented in the article) completely surpassed the Panzer III in both numbers and capabilities. </p>

    <h2>  Krupp prototype design </h2><p>  Initially, it was assumed that the German T-4 tank, whose technical characteristics were determined in 1934 by the Waffenamt, would serve as an ‚Äúaccompanying vehicle‚Äù in order to hide its true role, prohibited by the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Heinz Guderian took part in the development of the concept.  This new model was supposed to become an infantry support tank and placed in the rearguard of <span>tank divisions.</span>  It was planned that at the battalion level, one such machine should be for every three Panzer III.  Unlike the T-3, equipped with a standard version of the standard 37 mm Pak 36 gun with good anti-tank characteristics, the short barrel of the Panzer IV howitzer could be used against all types of fortifications, block houses, pillboxes, anti-tank guns and artillery positions. </p><p>  Initially, the weight limit of the combat vehicle was 24 tons.  MAN, Krupp and Rheinmetall-Borsig created three prototypes, and Krupp received the main contract.  The suspension was first completely new, with six alternating wheels.  Later, the army demanded the installation of rod springs, providing the best vertical deflection.  Compared to the previous system, this made the move smoother, but the need for a new tank stopped further development.  Krupp has returned to a more traditional system with four twin wheeled trolleys and leaf springs for easy maintenance.  A crew of five was planned - three were in the tower (commander, loader and gunner), and the driver with the radio operator - in the building.  The fighting compartment was relatively spacious, with improved sound insulation of the rear engine compartment.  The German T-4 tank inside (the photo in the material illustrates this) was equipped with an on-board communication system and a radio. </p><p>  Although this is not very noticeable, the Panzer IV is asymmetrical, the tower is offset 6.5 cm to the left, and the engine is 15 cm to the right.  This was done in order to directly connect the tower ring to the transmission for its faster rotation.  Ammunition boxes were therefore located on the right. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The prototype, designed and built in 1936 at the Krupp AG plant in Magdeburg, was designated by the Land Forces Arms Directorate as Versuchskraftfahrzeug 622. Nevertheless, in the new pre-war nomenclature it quickly became known as Pz.Kpfw.IV (Sd.Kfz. 161). </p><p>  The tank had a Maybach HL108TR gasoline engine with a capacity of 250 liters.  with., and the SGR 75 box with five forward and one reverse gears.  The maximum speed for testing on a flat surface was 31 km / h. </p><p>  75 mm gun - low speed Kampfwagenkanone (KwK) 37 L / 24.  This gun was intended for firing <span>high-explosive shells</span> at concrete fortifications.  Nevertheless, some anti-tank ability provided Panzergranate armor-piercing projectile, the speed of which reached 440 m / s.  He could pierce a 43-mm sheet of steel at a distance of 700 m. Two MG-34 machine guns completed the armament, one coaxial and the other in front of the machine. </p><p>  In the first batch of Type A tanks, the thickness of the hull armor did not exceed 15 mm and the tower - 20 mm.  Although it was hardened steel, such protection could only withstand light firearms, light artillery, and fragments of grenade launchers. </p>

    <h2>  Early Short Preliminary Series </h2><p>  The German T-4 A tank was a kind of preliminary series of 35 units produced in 1936. The next was the Ausf.  B with a modified commander‚Äôs dome, the new Maybach HL 120TR engine, developing a capacity of 300 liters.  with., as well as the new transmission SSG75. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Despite the extra weight, the top speed increased to 39 km / h, and the protection was strengthened.  The thickness of the armor reached 30 mm in the front inclined part of the hull and 15 mm in other places.  In addition, the machine gun was protected by a new hatch. </p><p>  After the release of 42 vehicles, production switched to the German T-4 C tank. The thickness of the armor on the turret increased to 30 mm.  The total weight was 18.15 tons.  After delivering 40 units in 1938, the tank was improved by installing a new Maybach HL 120TRM engine for the next hundred vehicles.  It is quite logical that the modification D. was followed. The ‚ÄúDouro‚Äù can be distinguished by the machine gun newly installed on the body and the embrasure brought out.  The thickness of the side armor increased to 20 mm.  In total, 243 machines of this model were manufactured, the last of which was at the beginning of 1940.  Modification D was the last pre-production, after which the command decided to increase the scale of production. </p><h2>  Standardization </h2><p>  The German T-4 E tank was the first large-scale series to be produced during the war.  Although many studies and reports indicate a lack of penetration of the 37 mm Panzer III gun, its replacement was not possible.  Looking for a solution to test one prototype Panzer IV Ausf.  D A modification of the medium speed 50mm Pak 38 gun was installed. The initial order for 80 units was canceled after the end of the French campaign.  In tank battles, in particular, against the British Matilda and the French B1 bis, it finally turned out that the thickness of the armor was insufficient and the penetration power of the gun was weak.  In Ausf.  E left the KwK 37L / 24 short-barreled gun, but the thickness of the front armor was increased to 50 mm, with 30 mm steel plate overlays as a temporary measure.  By April 1941, when this modification was replaced by Ausf.  F, its production reached 280 units. </p>

    <h2>  Last ‚Äúshort‚Äù model </h2><p>  Another modification significantly changed the German tank T-4.  The characteristics of the early F model, renamed F1 when the next one appeared, changed due to the replacement of the front cover plate with a 50 mm plate and an increase in the thickness of the side parts of the hull and turret to 30 mm.  The total weight of the tank grew to more than 22 tons, which caused other changes, such as increasing the width of the tracks from 380 to 400 mm to reduce ground pressure with the corresponding replacement of two idler and drive wheels.  F1 was produced in the amount of 464 units until it was replaced in March 1942. </p><h2>  The first "long" </h2><p>  Even with the Panzergranate armor-piercing shell, the Panzer IV low-speed gun could not withstand well-armored tanks.  In the context of the upcoming campaign in the USSR, a decision was to be made on a major upgrade of the T-3 tank.  The now available Pak 38L / 60 gun, the effectiveness of which was confirmed, was intended to be installed in the Panzer IV turret.  In November 1941, the creation of the prototype was completed, and production was planned.  But during the first battles with the Soviet KV-1 and T-34, the production of a 50-mm gun, also used in the Panzer III, was discontinued in favor of the new, more powerful Rheinmetall model based on 75 mm Pak 40L / 46 guns.  This led to the appearance of the KwK 40L / 43, a relatively long caliber equipped with a <span>muzzle brake,</span> which reduced recoil.  The initial velocity of the Panzergranade 39 projectile exceeded 990 m / s.  He could penetrate 77-mm armor at a distance of up to 1850 m. After the creation of the first prototype in February 1942, mass production of the F2 began.  By July, 175 units were manufactured.  In June, the German T-4 F2 tank was renamed the T-4 G, but for the Waffenamt, both types were designated as Sd.Kfz.161 / 1.  In some documents, the model is referred to as F2 / G. </p>

    <h2>  Transition model </h2><p>  The German T-4 G tank was an improved version of the F2 with changes regarding metal saving by using progressive frontal armor thickened at the base.  The frontal glacis was reinforced with a new 30 mm plate, which in total increased the thickness to 80 mm.  This was enough to successfully confront the Soviet 76-mm gun and the 76.2-mm anti-tank gun.  At first, they decided to bring to this standard only half of the production, but in January 1943 Adolf Hitler personally ordered a complete transition.  However, the weight of the car grew to 23.6 tons, revealing the limited capabilities of the chassis and transmission. </p><p>  The German T-4 tank underwent significant changes inside.  Tower viewing slots were removed, engine ventilation and ignition at low temperatures were improved, additional holders for spare wheels and brackets for track links on the glacis were installed.  They also served as temporary protection.  The headlights were updated, reinforced and modified the armored dome. </p><p>  In later versions, in the spring of 1943, side armor appeared on the hull and tower, as well as smoke grenade launchers.  But most importantly, a new, more powerful KwK 40L / 48 gun has appeared.  After the release of 1275 standard and 412 improved tanks, production shifted towards the Ausf.H. </p><h2>  Main version </h2><p>  The German T-4 N tank (photo below) was equipped with the new KwK 40L / 48 long-barreled cannon.  Further changes concerned the facilitation of production - side viewing slots were removed, common parts with the Panzer III were used.  In total, until the next modification of Ausf.  J in June 1944, 3774 cars were assembled. </p><p>  In December 1942, Krupp received an order for a tank with fully inclined armor, due to the additional weight that required the development of a new chassis, transmission and, possibly, an engine.  Nevertheless, production began with an updated version of Ausf.G.  The German T-4 tank received a new ZF Zahnradfabrik SSG-76 gearbox, a new set of radio stations (FU2 and 5, and intercom).  The thickness of the frontal armor increased to 80 mm without patch sheets.  Weight H reached 25 tons in combat equipment, and the maximum speed decreased to 38 km / h, and in real combat conditions - to 25 km / h, and much less over rough terrain.  By the end of 1943, the German T-4 N tank was covered with Zimmerit paste, air filters were updated, and an anti-aircraft machine for MG 34 was installed on the tower. </p>

    <h2>  The latest simplified model </h2><p>  The last tank, the German T-4 J, was assembled at Nibelungwerke in St. Valentine, Austria, as Vomag and Krupp now performed other tasks, and was subjected to simplifications that focused on more mass production and rarely found support from crews.  For example, the tower‚Äôs electric drive was removed, the guidance was carried out manually, which made it possible to increase the fuel tank volume by 200 liters, increasing the operating range to 300 km.  Other modifications included the removal of a tower observation window, loopholes and an anti-aircraft machine in favor of mounting a smoke grenade launcher.  Zimmerit was no longer used, as were the Sch√ºrzen anti-cumulative ‚Äúskirts‚Äù replaced with cheaper mesh panels.  The engine radiator housing has also been simplified.  The drive has lost one reverse roller.  There were two silencers with flame arresters, as well as a mount for a 2-ton crane.  In addition, the Panzer III SSG 77 transmission was used, although it was clearly overloaded.  Despite these casualties, due to the constant bombardment of the Allies, supplies were in jeopardy, and in total, up to the end of March 1945, only 2,970 out of 5,000 tanks were built. </p>

Some of them were equipped with the new Soviet heavy machine gun.  They took part in battles for the Golan Heights during the 1965 war and the <span>Six Day War of</span> 1967. Today, German T-4 tanks are part of museum displays and private collections around the world, and dozens of them are still in working condition. </p>
