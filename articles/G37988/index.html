The shell belongs to Nokia. </p><p>  On <span>the lock screen,</span> you can see the time and date.  There are notifications that send applications and utilities, player keys, and so on.  To enter the menu, you just need to swipe the screen either left or right.  You can go to the utility by moving its shortcut.  It‚Äôs easy to remove a notification - just slide it to the top of the screen. </p><p>  After unlocking the display of this ‚ÄúNokia‚Äù model on the basis of ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù, the person gets into the installed applications.  The desktop looks standard, as for the Android operating system.  But the utilities are arranged in the form of tiles, as in the "Windows Background".  All icons were arranged by developers in one row of three pieces. </p><p>  In the notifications there are special indicators that are responsible for the network signal.  Here you can turn on wireless and mobile Internet, "bluetooth". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia based on android model" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2010480.jpg"></div>

The device has support for 2 SIM cards, a processor that runs on 2 cores and the Android operating system.  Among the minuses, a not very good camera and the lack of support for "Google applications" should be noted.  Due to the low cost and other advantages, it is easy to forget about the disadvantages of the device.  This phone has an interesting design and quality materials.  In addition, it gives a new look at smartphones running the Android OS.  It combines the low price and good quality.  Popular among youth. </p><p>  The interface of the Nokia X phone is considered a combination of various elements from many operating systems.  We are talking about Asha, "Android" and "Windows Background."  Moreover, the home screen is unlikely to make it clear to the person that the device operates specifically on the "green robot".  It resembles the Background.  All applications are displayed on the desktop as a standard tile. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia android models reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2010481.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Nokia XL </h2><p>  Considering another Nokia model on Android, it should be noted that it is distinguished by the variety of passwords that can be set.  There are only two (and not three) lock options - pin and graphic.  In principle, it is quite difficult to understand immediately and without the help of an instruction that this system has a base in the form of a ‚Äúgreen man‚Äù.  This interface is as redone as possible.  The ideology of Android is forgotten.  Installed on top of the Fastlane concept. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In the main menu, there are tiles that are found in the "Windows Background".  All utilities are on one screen.  You can create a folder yourself, and then fill it.  Icons are allowed to swap.  Built-in curtain, in which there are 4 shortcuts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia android model photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2010482.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Nokia XL device design </h2><p>  For this Nokia model on Android, the manufacturer tried to add special details.  Often, developers create unique designs for phones.  The most successful experiment is considered "Nokia Lumiya".  In it you can watch a cheap case, but a quality assembly.  In the described smartphone Nokia XL use plastic, the cost of which is low, and there is also a collapsible housing. </p><p>  It should be said about an excellent feature - the phone is presented in a variety of color options.  Most manufacturers try not to sell several shades at once, while Nokia considers this solution to be unique.  Accordingly, the buyer can choose what suits him. </p><p>  The phone is slightly compact.  It weighs almost 200 grams.  If you hold it in your hands for the first time, it may seem that it is too wide.  Angles at 90 degrees create special discomfort.  Many customers call the device a "heavy brick."  However, the manufacturer created this smartphone directly for fans of large phones, and it is these people who are completely satisfied with the model. </p><p>  Ergonomics are standard and familiar to everyone.  On the right is a key for changing the volume, below it is a button for turning the phone on and off.  Above is the headphone port.  It is standard and is designed for a 3.5 mm plug.  On the bottom there is a connector for charging and working with a computer.  On the left side there is nothing. </p><p>  The back of the smartphone is ordinary.  There is a speaker, 5-megapixel camera matrix, flash.  The panel also has the company logo.  On the front surface is a camera that allows you to take a photo or speak via video.  Under the screen there is only one button - the central one.  If you click on it, it will return the user to the previous menu.  A long touch will allow you to enter the desktop.  Not all consumers like this solution, but getting used to it is easy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nokia Android Model Description" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2010483.jpg" width="491"></div>

    <h2>  Feature Nokia XL </h2><p>  The interface of this phone is a combination of elements "Windows Background", "Android" and Asha.  To turn on the device, tap on the end or press the side key.  On the lock screen are notifications that have been received: messages, mail, calls, and so on.  If you want to get into the utility, you need to swipe your finger to the side. </p><h2>  Nokia XL Performance </h2><p>  The Nokia model on Android runs on the Qualcomm model processor.  Unfortunately, the chipset that is built-in is already considered outdated, but its performance characteristics are pretty good.  It operates on two cores, each has a frequency of 1 GHz.  The graphics processor allows you to play slightly resource-intensive games, and launching "heavy" applications is not recommended.  Its performance is too low.  This phone belongs to the budget option, but among all competitors its characteristics are average.  The reason is precisely the processor, which is now noticeably losing to rivals.  But if the consumer does not plan to use games or run utilities that require high performance, then this phone is ideal for him.  All new Nokia models on Android work in this mode. </p><p>  The internal memory has 4 GB, operational - only 768 MB.  All devices that run on a Qualcomm processor need a lot of RAM.  In this they differ from the competitors operating on MediaTek.  After a person turns on the phone and background processes are activated, only 326 MB of RAM will remain free.  The storage management is excellent in Android, so the lack of parameters is rarely noticeable. </p><p>  There is not enough free internal memory, only 1.30 GB is available in telephone memory and 1.20 GB as an additional storage device.  You can always use a flash card.  Its maximum capacity is 32 GB.  However, the minus of the operating system is that you can only install applications on the phone.  You cannot do this on a memory card, and this problem is present in all new versions of Android. </p><p>  In other moments, this phone is not much different from other smartphones running the described operating system.  You can transfer files via bluetooth.  Built-in wireless network module. </p><p>  The Nokia XL phone works with two SIM cards at once.  But due to the fact that the radio module is the only one, only one cell number is active in the talk mode.  At the moment, such an implementation of the technology is considered familiar.  The phone works with several networks at once: 900/2100 MHz.  In the options of the smartphone, you can choose a priority SIM card for calls, messages and the Internet.  The corresponding menu indicates which card or which call was made. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia android models description and reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2010484.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Phone Reviews </h2><p>  Summing up the description of ‚ÄúAndroid-models‚Äù from ‚ÄúNokia‚Äù, the reviews should be characterized separately.  All buyers note that devices rarely slow down.  They are distinguished by the speed of the interface system.  The appearance of the phones themselves is practically no different from other options. </p><p>  Buyers of the minuses only notice that the operating system is not clean, but mixed with some Nokia users that are already familiar to users.  There are very few models on Android, but they are in demand. </p>
