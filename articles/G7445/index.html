    <h2>  Myth or reality? </h2><p>  Local residents tell a legend about Lake Selyava: as if on August 28, 1942, an American Pe-8 plane was shot down over the lake, transporting four tons of gold on board to the UK.  Most likely, this is just a myth, a beautiful fairy tale for visitors, as the reservoir is not so deep that divers could not see it.  However, the legend has a place to be. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Why is the lake named "Selyava"?  What does this word mean?  There are two theories. </p><p>  According to the first version, the pond got its name thanks to the merchant family of Selyavichs, who possessed huge tracts of land, where the lake also fell.  The second version says that the pond gained its name because of the fish - vendace, which in large quantities lives in its waters.  Belarusians call it "mudflow". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Selyava lake rest with tents" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1145743.jpg" width="600"></div>
