Moreover, there is a temptation to distort historical facts for the sake of the existing ideology.  But, as you know, facts are a stubborn thing.  The reasons for the victory of the Reds in the <span>Civil War are</span> more than convincing. </p><h2>  White and Red Leaders </h2><p>  It is suggested that the “red” won because the “white” lost.  They could not win.  This decaying demoralized army, not united by a common idea, is perfectly shown in the film "Two Lives".  And no matter how the representatives of the white movement are ennobled, they, as Lenin said in relation to completely different people, are "terribly far from the people." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reasons for the victory of the Reds" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/581700.jpg" width="554"></div>

    <p>  No matter how sorry the shot, drowning in the icy water of Kolchak, no matter how disgusting the red commander, lighting a man just shot by a silver cigarette case from a silver cigarette case, the death of a white officer was not able to unite and raise troops for the offensive and drive them to the Pacific Ocean.  And Chapaev’s death could. </p><h2>  Aversion to own people </h2>

But the most important of them is <span>ideology.</span>  The Bolsheviks managed to convince the masses that they were right, that a bright future was theirs.  After all, they did not go to the Red Army with the aim of enriching and plundering, and there were no apolitical people or pacifists in it.  People went to die, defending their ideas at the cost of life.  Such an army, especially if it has managed to establish work in the rear, to ensure strict discipline, is invincible.  The “whites” had nothing to oppose to such an idea that V. Mayakovsky said best of all: “They filled our mouths with lead and tin.“ Renounce! ”Roared, but only three words came out of the burning throat:“ Long live communism! ”And about white terror of humane tsarist officers. They poured mouth with lead and tin? They poured it. Hated “cattle” to the teeth grinding? They hated. They do not win with such attitude.

    <p>  It is not necessary to look for the reasons for the victory of the “Reds", they can only be ascertained based on the classics: "The lower classes did not want to live in the old way."  Of course, one of the significant reasons is the presence of a leader, in our case, a leader.  We will not touch on the person himself, but about what he was for the Red Army, for the entire population of post-revolutionary Russia, the descendants are best told by photographs and documentary footage of Lenin's funeral.  Who else in the world have so escorted the last journey?  Nobody.  Even Bauman’s funeral, when all of Moscow took to the streets in 1905, is just a hint at the mountain that swept the country in the winter of 1924.  You can’t imagine such a thing.  You can, of course, declare the people, as the "white bellies" do, drunk.  It is in this approach to the interests of the vast majority of the country's population that we must look for the reasons for the victory of the "Reds" in the Civil War, in which, as some say, there are no winners.  This view of the problem from outer space is akin to reasoning that each has its own “truth”.  But the truth is always one.  Despising one’s own people, considering them “cattle,” is bad. </p><p>  In addition, the white movement did not have a leader.  The "nobles" will never have it - they are all god-like, it is impossible to find the most worthy.  There were always troubled times in Russia, until a leader appeared, after whom one could or needed to go into fire and into water.  With the advent of the leader, Russia flourished.  This is one of the answers to the question why the Reds won. <strong><br></strong> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The “whites” had no allies </h2><p>  In addition, the countries of the Entente, supposedly helping the white movement, did not do this (neither weapons nor supplies were supplied in proper quantities).  Rather, they discredited the white movement in the eyes of the majority of the population.  Help was not included in the plans of the interventionists, their goal was to undermine Russia or completely destroy it.  The more Russians kill each other, the better.  Now, a century later, despite all the reservations and distortions, we know that, having won the victory, the Bolsheviks not only held it, but also built a powerful power that managed to defeat Hitler, the leader of the nation on which the Germans prayed.  There is only one conclusion - the truth was on their side, which is why the Reds won. <strong><br></strong> </p><h2>  Voluntary, but not competent </h2>

    <p>  We can say that there was no community among the White Guards, there were monarchists who supported the <span>Provisional Government,</span> and also <span>"every creature in pairs":</span> anarchists, kulaks who fought only for their piece of land, which had the idea of ​​a "united and indivisible Russia" was not needed at all. </p><p>  But many nationalists, this idea annoyed and repelled from the white movement.  Many gangs raged in the rear of the White Guards: the “green”, “black” and other chieftains who robbed the population and set it against the authorities, who were not able to restore order in the controlled territories.  Yes, these are also the reasons for the victory of the Red Army and the defeat of the white movement.  But they look, rather, <span>aggravating circumstances.</span>  The main thing is that the White Guards did not fight for the Great Homeland (they write a poem about Russia, they sing about gold epaulettes - and it seems to be easier), but they fought with the hated "reds" in stinky footcloths licking seeds. <strong><br></strong> </p><h2>  All-conquering idea </h2><p>  And the Red Army was already strong, pure and victorious.  And the reasons for the victory of the "red" movement, as already noted above, are in a high and beautiful idea.  They fought for their homeland, in which after the victory everyone will be equal and happy.  All strata of the population, the best representatives of all classes who could make inconveniences and sacrifices for the sake of the idea, joined in this struggle for a bright future.  The sabotage of officials was quickly suppressed, the class of state Soviet servants was born, the slogan “everything for the front, everything for victory” came up. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="civil war why the red won" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/581704.jpg" width="537"></div>  Of course, all plants remained in the territory controlled by the Bolsheviks.  But they earned because the workers were "red".  It is very bad when a brother goes to war against his brother, when a civil war torments the country.  Why did the Reds win?  Because the vast majority of the country's population was with the Bolsheviks or sympathized with them.
