    <p>  Taking up the brand new <span>smartphone TurboPhone4G</span> 2209, already at a subconscious level you are preparing to find the entire list listed above in it.  Nevertheless, he managed to refute many clich√©s, and some, alas, to confirm. </p><h2>  First impressions </h2><p>  When the device is in your hands, it seems that you have some kind of flagship of the year 2010 or even 2012. On the one hand, it seems to be a compliment, but on the other - it‚Äôs already quite an annoying form of ‚Äúsoap dish‚Äù.  This format is quite suitable for some (it doesn‚Äôt cut a hand around the edges), but to someone it will seem completely outdated and extremely unattractive, like, for example, TurboPhone4G 2209. User reviews on this subject are very different and divided approximately equally, so this moment is better leave at the discretion of the future owner. </p><p>  Function buttons are located in approximately the same sequence as the acclaimed Galaxy S3 - on the sides and exactly opposite each other.  The device sits well in the palm of your hand, and using it with one hand is quite comfortable.  There is no sensible texture on the case, so the gadget glides easily.  Touch control is highlighted only at the moment of pressing and is located not quite typically - with a large interval, and the ‚ÄúBack‚Äù button for some reason turned out to be far to the right. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The review will be presented in the form of a ladder, that is, we will go down from better to worse. </p><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  The gadget comes in a pretty nice box made of hard cardboard, where you can see a list of the main technical characteristics and the name of the smartphone itself.  Everything is packed in good conscience and there are no complaints about the conveyor. </p>

Therefore, in terms of ergonomics, everything is in order. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  The device feels great at 4G speeds in standard frequencies for GSM (1800 MHz) - a very thoughtful and tricky move by the company.  The signal is stable even in "impenetrable" rooms.  The only negative is the lack of support for old sim cards on 3G.  The gadget is tightly ‚Äúlocked‚Äù, therefore, it only accepts cards operating at a frequency of 1800 MHz, but this moment also occurs with more expensive devices, and not just with the budget TurboPhone4G 2209. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The feedback on this subject is very different: someone has been working at high speeds for a long time and forgot about the outdated 3G connection, and someone needs this very low speed for various reasons (lack of coverage, specific web surfing, etc. .).  Nevertheless, the smartphone‚Äôs connection is high-quality and ‚Äúpunchy,‚Äù which pleased many owners of the gadget. </p><h2>  Filling </h2><p>  The four-core processor with a frequency of 1 GHz of the MTK6735 series is responsible for the performance of the device.  On board there is 8 GB of internal memory and 1 GB of RAM.  For the budget employee TurboPhone4G 2209 (price - about 5000 rubles) has a very attractive set of characteristics.  And in practice, it shows itself on the positive side: applications are processed quite quickly and there were no serious slowdowns or friezes.  Casual games like Plants vs. Zombies 2 or Subway Surfers run great and work without problems. </p>

    <p>  Despite the fact that the smartphone has 8 GB of internal memory, only 4.2 is available to the user - the rest is reserved for system files for the TurboPhone4G 2209 to function correctly. Owner reviews on this subject are very optimistic: the problem is solved by purchasing micro-SD cards, since the device supports all popular formats and volumes. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The model has very good screen characteristics for a budget employee: a 5-inch smartphone with a resolution of 960 by 540 pixels.  And all this works on a modern IPS-matrix.  A small bit depth of the screen adds speed to the gadget, and a decent margin of brightness will make it easy to work on a sunny day. </p>

    <p>  Viewing angles do not differ in good performance and with strong bends, the colors begin to invert, and in different scales and depending on the side (vertical or horizontal rotation).  Nevertheless, you can flip through a photo or watch a movie in the company of one friend without problems with TurboPhone4G 2209. Owner reviews note a significant drop in screen responsiveness in the cold season, and the glossy surface of the display collects fingerprints and other dirt very actively, therefore You can‚Äôt do without a cover. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that non-standard screen resolution is not supported by any third-party player that you need, due to the simplicity and unfriendliness of the built-in software.  The maximum quality of the available image in our case will be 480p.  On the one hand, maybe it‚Äôs good - the battery will last longer, but on the other hand, I want a better picture, after all, a 5-inch smartphone, and in the yard in 2016 with FullHD realities. </p><h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  The 2000 mAh battery is clearly not enough, especially considering how much space it takes in the gadget's case.  Even with the modest operation of the device (calls, SMS, a couple of times to look at the Internet), he will live a maximum of 24 hours. </p>

    <p>  Active use of the gadget, such as watching a video in maximum resolution, will put him in about two hours, that is, one movie is enough to watch.  Wandering around the Internet for more than three to four hours will not work. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The last point that can disappoint.  The device is equipped with a 2MP front camera and a 5MP main camera.  Before, during and after the shooting, you will be tormented with artifacts, friezes, the absence of any sensible settings, it is unclear how a distorted picture even in perfect lighting, etc. Probably, the only thing that such a camera will do is avatars. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  There are a lot of branded gadgets, of which TurboPhone4G 2209 is.  They are littered with almost all the more or less famous distribution networks.  Some companies manage to place their products in an even more modest segment than "up to 5000", and with almost the same capabilities of the devices.  The same MTS, Beeline and Megafon flooded store shelves with their devices.  But in defense of the respondent, we can say that, unlike the mentioned venerable representatives of the market, TurboPhone4G 2209 does not suffer from a peculiar corporate design and an incomprehensible interface. </p><p>  The audience of a smartphone is students, schoolchildren, or any other consumer without any claims to performance, watching high-resolution video and battery life.  Otherwise, it is a completely successful and well-assembled model with good communication capabilities. </p>
