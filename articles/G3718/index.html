    <p>  Ferry companies do not offer cruise offers on this route, but it can be combined.  For example, Viking Line offers regular flights from Helsinki to Stockholm with the Mariella and Gabriella ferries.  And from Stockholm you can take advantage of the Tallinn company offer, buy a ticket for the Stockholm - Tallinn ferry to visit the <span>capital of Estonia.</span> </p><p>  The Mariella and Gabriella ferries have similar characteristics to those described above in terms of quality and quantity of amenities and entertainment on board.  Cabins are also of a similar class, including internal equipment. </p><h2>  What time of year is better to swim </h2><p>  Ferry lines operate year-round, and most ferries leave the route daily. </p><p>  Reviews of vacationers call spring, summer and autumn the best time to travel by ferry.  The upper decks are already open, on which you can climb and admire the surrounding beauties, it is no longer cold and the sun is shining, under the spring and autumn rays of which it is so good to warm up, and under the summer - to sunbathe. </p><p>  In addition, with the advent of summer days, various outdoor activities are available on the open decks of the ferries. </p><h2>  Booking and prices: reviews </h2><p>  The higher the tourist season, the higher ferry prices.  But the cost depends not only on the season, but also on the class of the chosen cabin and the included services.  So, when buying a full package, including, for example, accommodation in a cabin, breakfast, dinner, transfer, the price will be the most favorable. </p><p>  If the trip takes place lightly, and its emphasis is on visiting cities, it is quite possible to save by booking an economy-class cabin.  It is worth noting that buying food on board costs a little more than if you purchase it in advance. </p><p>  Also, to save money, it is best to book a ferry in advance, as a rule, carriers make very good discounts on early bookings.  Closer to departure dates, prices are on the price list, and such a wide selection of cabins and meals may simply not exist. </p><p>  If the trip takes place with a car, the ferry companies often offer interesting packages, including a cabin, meals and car seats on board at very competitive prices. </p>
