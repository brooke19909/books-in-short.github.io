Our compatriots mainly come to Antalya, Marmaris, Fethiye.  Icmeler is not so noisy, but there is a perfectly clear sea, amazing healing air given by the coniferous forests surrounding the town, and many hotels of different price categories.  Hotel Idas is considered one of the budget.  It is perfect for anyone who likes to relax with mood. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Icmeler is a small town, until recently the former suburb of Marmaris, and now it is completely autonomous.  Idas Hotel 4 is located on one of its green streets and flowers, Kayabal Cad. Idas Hotel 4. Marmaris, an elite and extremely popular resort, is 8 km from here.  You can get to it by minibuses, the following every 10 minutes, or by boat. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel idas" class="if" height="297" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/472362.jpg" width="453"></div>  Dalaman (the city where the international airport is located, where planes arrive from Russia) is located about 96 km from Icmeler.  The road takes two hours if you drive along the coast, and a little less if you pave the way for less picturesque villages.  Further along the highway from Icmeler (about 20 minutes by bus, which is called dolmushi here) lies another tourist village - Turunch, famous for its magnificent bays.  Not far from the hotel, on the main street of the town, there are many bars, restaurants, souvenir shops, as well as a post office and bus station, from where buses go to Antalya, Pamukkale and other tourist centers of Turkey.

All this happens on the basis of the buffet.  The menu has many different dishes from baked, stewed and boiled vegetables, pancakes with and without filling, pastries, fish, chicken, veal, sausages, meatballs, Turkish soups, fruits (depending on the season), mousses, pasta, rice, french fries .  Some vacationers are complaining about the lack of variety of food served in Idas Hotel 4. Turkey is a country where they cook a lot and tasty, but each person has his own preferences.  Some people think the food is fresh, some too spicy.  The hotel has an √† la carte restaurant where you can order meals individually (for a fee).  In addition, there are many restaurants on the city streets and on the promenade, so it is impossible to stay hungry.  Drinks at the hotel are free until 11 pm.  Beer, wine, rakia, Russian vodka, cola, water, coffee are offered. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ida Village 3 Apart Hotel" class="if" height="297" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/472368.jpg" width="395"></div>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Hotel Idas does not have a private beach.  However, other hotels do not have them either, as it was decided that the entire sea coast belongs to the city.  This is formal, but in reality beach areas are assigned to individual bars, which are located close to one another.  On the beaches you can use sun loungers and umbrellas provided that you buy something in these bars or pay for an equipped place in the Turkish sun.  But you can sit on your towel for free without a single problem, since the beach is sandy with a small shell rock.  The sea in Icmeler is crystal clear, transparent, like a tear.  Entering the water is quite gentle and comfortable.  Directly offshore and in depth, you can observe different animals, including biting fish.  This fact is especially pleasing to diving enthusiasts.  There are always a lot of people on the city beach in season, but if you go a little further beyond the port, it will turn out to be conveniently located in a less "densely populated" territory.  The entrance to the sea is good there, but the depth begins almost immediately.  Majestic mountains covered with pine trees surround this <span>wild beach</span> .  Moving along the coast in the opposite direction from this wonderful place, you can reach Marmaris in about an hour.  From the hotel to the sea about 7-10 minutes leisurely on foot, which will be 700-800 meters.  This is called the 2nd line. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Idas hotel reviews" class="if" height="291" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/472367.jpg" width="407"></div>

    <h2>  Animation </h2><p>  An excellent relaxing holiday awaits tourists at Idas Hotel 4. Marmaris, located nearby, is famous for its noisy parties, nightclubs and enchanting shows.  Icmeler also has bars and clubs, but here everything is much more modest.  The maximum that can be expected here is the live performance of Turkish music in restaurants, discos in individual hotels, as well as pleasure flights on yachts.  There are several noisy bars here, but in general the evenings go quietly, and by midnight life generally subsides.  The usual animation for a vacation in Turkey is not in Idas Hotel 4. Reviews of most tourists mark this as a definite plus.  However, other hotels are located nearby where entertainment programs are possible. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Icmeler is an unusually beautiful town lying in a frame of mountains.  Their slopes are covered with pines, cedars and other conifers, and at the foot are orange, mandarin and lemon groves.  Flowering trees and needles create an unusual aroma that is felt immediately upon entering the city.  The air here is extremely healthy, especially for people with lung problems.  Therefore, the main value of relaxation for all who come to Idas Hotel 3 * (or 4 stars) is wellness.  In some sanatoriums this is called aerophytotherapy, which vacationers get here for free and in unlimited quantities.  You can diversify your leisure time by taking sightseeing tours.  Among them are a boat trip and the Aegean islands, trips to Ephesus, Pamukkale, Marmaris, Dalyan.  Also, if you have a European visa, there is a wonderful opportunity to visit Rhodes, which is only 40 minutes on a high-speed ferry.  Sightseeing tours can be purchased either at the hotel or at one of the agencies located on the streets of the town. </p><h2>  Climate features </h2><p>  Icmeler is located in the bay.  For some tourists, the sea here resembles a lake, since it is covered by an island from the vast expanses of water.  This natural wall, as well as the high ridges surrounding the town, create a special microclimate that allows not only in the summer, but also in the velvet season, as well as in spring, to have a great rest at Idas Hotel.  Marmaris is located in a more open area, so the sea is cooler here, there are also quite high waves.  And in Icmeler almost always calm.  The shallow depth within the beaches allows the water to warm up perfectly and reach + 28 + 29 degrees in the summer, and + 25 + 26 in May and the end of September.  At the same time, the air temperature is quite high, even if there are clouds in the sky or it is raining.  At the beginning and at the end of the season, the hotel does not have an influx of tourists, so the rest is more relaxed, there is a better choice of rooms, there is no bustle in the restaurant. </p><h2>  Prices </h2><p>  Trips to Idas Hotel (Marmaris, Icmeler) are offered by many travel agencies in Russia and Ukraine.  The price depends on the number of persons, availability of children, food system, season and duration of rest.  On average, for two adults without children for 7 nights and 8 days, a tour in the month of August 2014 costs from 30 thousand rubles, or 850 dollars.  The price is based on full board.  Some agencies have last-minute tours, the cost of which may be slightly lower.  In addition, there are flexible discount systems, so everyone who wants to relax in this hotel should directly contact the operator and discuss the cost. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Idas Hotel 4 reviews" class="if" height="288" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/472365.jpg" width="385"></div>

    <p>  As you can see, there are more advantages, and they are much more serious than the noted minor flaws. </p><h2>  Ida Village 3 * Apart Hotel </h2><p>  For comparison, we offer information on a three-star hotel in Greece on Crete.  Many tour operators do not explain to their customers that Ida Village there are two at once, separated by a fence.  Apart Hotel is located a little higher than I&amp;II, on a hill that needs to be overcome.  This is the only negative.  All vacationers at this hotel note the absolute cleanliness of the rooms, starched sheets, the responsiveness and friendliness of the staff, rushing to the aid upon request, perfectly fresh, although not very varied food, wonderful hotel grounds, a delightful sea with attractions located very close by, and low prices.  For the cost of this hotel - rather "kopeck piece" than "treshka".  A big plus for a budget holiday and for parents with small children is the presence of a kitchen in their rooms, and next to the hotel there is a wonderful supermarket where only fresh products are sold, and inexpensively.  The rooms of Ida Village 3 * Apart are simple but comfortable.  TVs in them are not in all rooms, air conditioning is paid (7 euros per day), but, according to guests, it is not too needed, because the sea constantly gets cool.  Breakfast at the hotel is classic Greek.  They consist of cereal, milk, cottage cheese with honey, baking, slicing sausages and cheese, coffee, juice, fruit.  For dinner, meat, seafood, vegetables with various side dishes are served.  To make it more convenient to relax in this hotel and travel around Crete, ‚Äúexperienced‚Äù vacationers are advised to rent some kind of vehicle. </p>
