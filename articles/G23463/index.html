The Pontic Kingdom and its role in the history of the Black Sea</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The ancient Pontic kingdom, located in the east of <span>Asia Minor,</span> was one of the most prominent <span>Hellenistic states of</span> its time.  It had a great influence on neighboring countries and the subsequent development of the Black Sea region.  All the ancient states in the south of modern Russia, one way or another, adopted something from this power.  The Pontic kingdom is known to modern science much more than other similar countries.  This is due to the fact that his sovereigns fought for a long time with Rome.  There is no doubt that the threat posed by the kingdom of Pontus was reflected in the internal political system of the republic. </p><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Throughout its existence in the III - I century.  BC.  The Pontic kingdom changed borders many times, mainly due to its own expansion.  The center of the state was North Cappadocia on the southeast coast of the Black Sea.  In ancient times, it was known as the Pontus of Euxinus, and that is why the kingdom began to be called Pontic, or simply Pontus for short. </p><p>  The nature of the state was largely determined by its advantageous geographical position.  What territories are part of the Pontic kingdom?  These were lands between Central and Forward Asia, the Balkans and the Black Sea.  Consequently, Pontus had trade relations with all these regions, which made his rulers rich and influential.  Merchants from Northern Mesopotamia, the <span>Iranian Highlands</span> and Transcaucasia came to them.  Rare oriental goods brought a lot of <span>money.</span>  <span>Coins of the</span> Pontic Kingdom were minted in gold and had a unique appearance.  Archaeologists continue to find them in Turkey and Russia, in Ukraine and the Caucasus. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Society </h2><p>  In the Pontic state, the traditions of many peoples were mixed.  Asia Minor, Anatolian, Iranian and Hellenic traditions took root in this kingdom.  For the most part, the population was engaged in agriculture, which was favored by a mild climate.  Cities in Pontus were relatively few.  They were mainly on the Black Sea coast.  These were the policies that the ancient Greek colonialists founded. </p><p>  According to ethnicity, the population belonged to the Cappadocians, macrons, Khalibs, Kolkhs, and Kataons.  All sorts of aliens lived here, for example Phrygian tribes.  In the Pontic kingdom there have always been many Iranian-speaking Persians.  This whole kaleidoscope was a dangerous powder keg.  Different peoples were united thanks to the great Hellenic (Greek) culture.  The east the tribe lived, the weaker this influence.  The population of the Black Sea coastal policies remained the most Hellenized. </p><h2>  Pontus Foundation </h2><p>  The Pontic state was founded by King Mithridates I in 302 BC.  By origin he was a Persian who served the Macedonian king Antigonus.  For unclear reasons, the nobleman fell into disgrace from his monarch and fled to distant Cappadocia, where he founded a new power.  In his name, the entire subsequent dynasty of the kings of Pontus became known as Mithridates. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It should be noted the conditions against which this state appeared.  The Pontic kingdom, whose history began at the end of the 4th century BC.  e., arose on the wreckage of a great power created by Alexander the Great.  This commander first conquered Greece, and then spread the Hellenistic culture to most of the Middle East.  His power was short-lived.  It broke up into many principalities immediately after the death of Alexander in 323 BC. </p>

    <h2>  Heyday </h2><p>  The descendants of Mithridates I continued to strengthen and develop the Pontic state.  They were helped by the political fragmentation of neighbors and the struggle of potential competitors for influence in the region.  This ancient power reached its heyday under Mithridates VI Eupator, who ruled in 117 - 63 years.  BC. </p><p>  At a young age he had to flee his native country.  After the death of his father, the mother of Mithridates VI opposed the fact that the son occupied the proper throne.  The hardships of exile undoubtedly tempered the future king.  When he finally managed to return to power, the monarch began wars with neighbors. </p><p>  Small principalities and satrapies quickly submitted to Mithridates.  Contemporaries deservedly called him Great.  He annexed Colchis (present-day Georgia), as well as Tauris (Crimea).  However, in front of the king was the most important test - several campaigns against Rome.  The republic at that time was increasing its expansion to the East.  She had already annexed Greece and now aspired to Asia Minor, where the kingdom of Pontus was located.  Between the two powers began endless wars. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Relations with the provinces </h2><p>  Having created a huge state that was already like an empire, Mithridates faced a natural problem - how to keep all his acquisitions.  He tried to find a balance in relations with the new provinces, giving them different status.  For example, some small tribes of the south formally became its allies, while Colchis and Tauris turned into a material and raw material base for the state economy. </p><p>  Most of the funds went to the salary and food of the army.  This is not surprising, because the Pontic kingdom under Mithridates forgot about what peace is.  The sovereign made the northwestern Black Sea region the main grain-supplying region.  Endless bread needed an army for long-distance raids in the Roman provinces. </p><h2>  External and social contradictions </h2><p>  Mithridates VI tried to enlarge the Pontic state with the help of Hellenization policy.  He declared himself the protector and patron of the ancient Greek culture.  But this course could not but lead to a conflict with another ancient power in the person of Rome.  The republic on its eastern borders did not need a powerful Pontic kingdom. </p><p>  Mithridates, in addition, tried to strengthen his country by increasing the privileges of policies.  By this he attracted the city class to his side.  But against such domestic politics was a powerful aristocracy.  Its representatives did not want to share wealth and influence with policies. </p>

    <h2>  Domestic Policy of Mithridates VI </h2><p>  Ultimately, the aristocracy delivered an ultimatum to the ruler.  He was supposed to support her interests or suppress a major riot, sponsored by the thick wallets of the elite.  The king, who constantly fought with Rome, could not expose himself to a blow in the back.  He had to make concessions to the aristocracy.  They resulted in the emergence of a tyrannical class that exploited the ordinary population. </p><p>  Because of this contradiction, the Pontic kingdom, the army of which was built according to the ancient Greek model, actually could not get rid of the features of the <span>eastern despots</span> in its state system.  It is also important that this great power existed only thanks to the charismatic and powerful figure of the great king.  After the death of Mithridates VI, it was bound to fall apart. </p>

    <h2>  Doom of the kingdom </h2><p>  Today the Pontic kingdom and its role in the history of the Black Sea region are studied by researchers from various countries.  But regardless of who it is in question, each specialist pays attention to the era of Mithridates VI, since under him the state reached the peak of its development. </p><p>  But even this great monarch had his mistakes and difficulties, which he could not overcome.  In addition to the internal problems described above, the king had to face the absence of any serious allies in the fight against Rome.  Behind the republic were numerous provinces of the Mediterranean - Greece, Italy, Gaul, Spain, Carthage, etc.  No matter how effective the ruler Mithridates was, he, by his objective capabilities, could not long resist Roman expansion. </p>

    <h2>  The death of Mithridates </h2><p>  Autumn 64 BC  King Pontus was able to gather a colossal army of 36 thousand people at that time and conquer the Bosporus.  However, his multinational army did not want to continue the campaign and go to Italy, where Mithridates wanted to go to strike right in the heart of Rome.  The position of the monarch was precarious, and he retreated. </p><p>  Meanwhile, a conspiracy was ripening in the army.  The soldiers were unhappy with the war, and in addition, there was a man who wanted to encroach on power in the Kingdom of Portia.  This ambitious was the offspring of Mithridates VI Farnak.  The plot was uncovered, and the son was caught.  The king wanted to execute him for treason, but his close associates dissuaded him and advised him to let him go.  Father agreed. </p><p>  But this act did not help to avoid rebellion in the army.  When Mithridates realized that he was surrounded by enemies, he took poison.  He did not work.  Then the monarch persuaded his bodyguard to kill him with a sword, which was done.  The tragedy erupted in 63 BC  The Romans, learning about the death of Mithridates, celebrated for several days.  Now they rightfully believed that the Kingdom of Pontus would soon submit to the republic. </p>

    <h2>  Decline and fall </h2><p>  After the death of Mithridates VI, Pontus fell into decay.  The Roman Republic, having won the war with its neighbor, made the western part of the kingdom its province.  In the east, the nominal power of the Pontic monarchs remained, but in fact they became dependent on Rome.  The son of Mithridates Farnak II tried to revive the power of his father.  He took advantage of the outbreak of <span>civil war in Rome</span> and attacked the republic.  Farnak managed to return Cappadocia and Lesser Armenia. </p><p>  However, his success was short-lived.  When Caesar freed himself from internal turmoil, he went east to punish Farnak.  In the decisive battle of Zela, the Romans won an unconditional victory.  It was then that the Latin catch phrase ‚ÄúVeni vidi vici‚Äù appeared - ‚Äúcame, saw, won‚Äù. </p><p>  Julius Caesar, however, left the formal royal title in the hands of the heirs of Mithridates.  In return, they recognized themselves as vassals of Rome.  The title was finally abolished by the <span>emperor Nero</span> in 62 A.D.  The last ruler of the Pontic kingdom, Polemon II abdicated without any resistance, since he did not have any resources to fight Rome. </p>
