    <h2>  Where is Sudak </h2><p>  We decided to start the overview of routes by specifying the location of the city.  If you look at the map of the wonderful peninsula of Crimea, Sudak will be found on its southeastern coast, about halfway between Alushta, which is 47 km straight, and Feodosia.  To the last in a straight line, respectively, 42 km.  Closer than other settlements from Sudak is the famous village of New World.  It is only 7 km away.  It is so small that sports vacationers can walk there.  The rest in 10 minutes any minibus will dominate.  The next remotest point and also very popular among tourists is Cape Meganom.  It is twice as far from it than to the New World.  The distance is 15 km and the journey time is about 25 minutes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Almost all vacationers are interested in where Sudak is located in relation to the capital of the peninsula Simferopol.  This question is not idle, but practical, because it is precisely here that airplanes arrive from Russia.  So, Sudak lies from Simferopol 107 km to the southeast. </p><p>  Also important is the location of Sudak in relation to Kerch, where the ferry to the peninsula is carried out.  On the highway between these cities 153 km. </p><p>  The distance between Sudak and other significant <span>settlements of Crimea is</span> as follows: </p><p>  - to Feodosia by road 55 km; </p><p>  - to Alushta on the highway 93 km; </p><p>  - to Yalta - 131 km; </p><p>  - to Sevastopol - 181 km. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mr. Sudak Crimea" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1967282.jpg" width="501"></div>

    <h2>  The nature of Sudak </h2><p>  Tourists who are going on vacation to see many interesting and beautiful places are interested in where Sudak is located in relation to natural attractions.

From the cold northern winds the city is covered by a mountain range, overgrown with beech forests and oak groves, in which there are continually interspersed with pine forests and juniper groves.  From the west, the peace of Sudak is guarded by Mount Krepostnaya, at the foot of which it is located, and from the east - the <span>cape Alchak,</span> popular among vacationers <span>.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to get to Sudak quickly and comfortably </h2><p>  You can get to the Crimea in the following ways: </p><p>  - by plane; </p><p>  - by train; </p><p>  - by bus; </p><p>  - by car. </p><p>  It is more convenient and faster, of course, to fly by plane.

    <h2>  How to get to Sudak by rail </h2><p>  It used to be easy, cheap and comfortable to travel from Russia by train.  Now this option has become somewhat more complicated, and the number of trains has decreased.  How to get to Sudak on the "piece of iron" at the moment?  You need to follow to any city located near the Kerch crossing.  These are <span>Krasnodar, Rostov-on-Don,</span> Novorossiysk, Slavyansk, Anapa.  Cross the strait by ferry.  Then take a bus ticket, for example to Simferopol or to Feodosia, and if flights are suitable on time, then directly to Sudak.  From Simferopol to go to him for about two hours on a flat road.  Serpentine starts just a few kilometers from the city, and flights to the capital of Crimea are always enough.  The route from Feodosia is shorter, but the road is winding, which is not suitable for all people because of their health, and buses run once an hour.  There are no direct trains from Russia to Crimea yet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sea ​​temperature in Sudak" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1967268.jpg" width="507"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How to get to Sudak by road </h2><p>  Here you can choose from two options.  The first is to take a regular bus.  Now routes to the Crimea in the city of Sudak exist from many Russian cities.  In particular, buses leave Moscow from the Novoyasenevskaya station.  There are also private carriers whose transport departs from different points of the capital.  It will take about 30 hours to travel by regular bus.  This option is chosen by those who like to enjoy the views from the windows on the road.  It is not very convenient for anyone who is not very interested to travel in the bus in the summer in the heat for more than a day, especially with children. </p><p>  By car, earlier it was possible to get perfectly to the Crimea along the Simferopol highway.  Now the route is much more complicated.  Russian motorists must follow to the Kerch crossing, take a ferry ticket, and then go to Sudak.  By the way, regular buses from Russia follow the same route, but they are passed out of turn on a ferry. </p><h2>  Single ticket </h2><p>  Now in the Crimea - in the city of Sudak and other settlements of the peninsula - you can get on a single ticket.  The idea of ​​the Russian authorities was good and consisted in the fact that passengers bought one ticket, which included <span>train</span> travel <span>to Anapa</span> or Krasnodar, transfer to a bus to the ferry, following the ferry through the Kerch Strait, then travel by bus to Kerch, and from there by another bus to the desired city of Crimea.  This method is convenient because you don’t have to jostle in queues at the ticket office, because dedicated vehicles are waiting for passengers on the entire route.  The disadvantages of this method are that people have to make transfers repeatedly, which means they unload and load their luggage. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pike perch in the summer" class="if" height="265" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1967299.jpg" width="518"></div>

    <h2>  Climate </h2><p>  The fact that Sudak surrounds mountains on both sides plays an important role in the formation of special weather conditions that make vacation in this resort especially pleasant.  Precipitation here is half as much as in Yalta, and the sun shines in the sky in the year 2550 hours.  The sea temperature in Sudak is slightly warmer than in other Black Sea resorts, since there are practically no cold currents in the coastal waters.  But still, in June, the water is still cool, as it manages to warm up only to 19 ° C.  Thermometers also show about the same in October.  The swimming season for adults and children opens here in July and lasts until the second decade of September.  The sea temperature in Sudak during this period reaches 23 ° .  From about the 15th of September, Voditsa starts to cool significantly.  By the end of the month, its temperature drops to 20 ° C, but many vacationers in the afternoon, when the sun is shining generously, still bathe. </p><p>  The air temperature in Sudak is quite comfortable in June and early autumn, and in the peak season heat prevails here, sometimes reaching 38 ° . </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Sudak by the sea" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1967269.jpg" width="503"></div>

Cafes, canteens and restaurants are abundant here, and the closer to the coast, the higher the prices, although this does not affect the quality of the dishes.
