  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Vendian rebellion and its significance in the history of France</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Venetian rebellion is an event in the history of France, which is also called the Vendee War.  It lasted for three years - from 1793 to 1796.  In fact, the Vendee mutiny is a peasant counter-revolution, the main driving force of which was the inhabitants of the rural outback.  They were less politicized than the townspeople.  Even in the uprising was attended by nobles and representatives of the clergy.  The rebels spoke out under Catholic and monarchical slogans. </p><h2>  Features of the territory </h2><p>  Apart from Vend√©e itself, the regions of counter-revolutionary uprisings and rebellions in France were also parts of the territories of Poitou, Brittany, and Anjou.  In total, it was a space with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 22 thousand km <sup>2</sup> .  It is washed by sea waters for almost 170 km.  About 800 thousand people lived here at the end of the 18th century. </p><p>  The territory of Vend√©e, according to topographic properties, was a forest, marshy and flat terrain.  Most of the areas were occupied by forests and copses.  Villages, individual huts and fields were surrounded by moats and hedges.  Between them were narrow roads, which in rainy times were almost impassable. </p><p>  Marshes, many lakes and ditches were located near the ocean coast, it was also very difficult to get between them along the paths.  I had to use boats and long poles. </p><p>  Next, we consider the political situation in this region on the eve of the peasant counter-revolution in France. </p><h2>  The situation in the Vendee </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="French peasants" class="if uuid-3075012" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3075012.jpg"></div><p>  The inhabitants of this area were very different from other residents of France in their somewhat wild character, economic development and spiritual needs.  Located in the west of France, Vend√©e was one of the most backward and undeveloped areas of the country. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, the abyss that until 1789 in France separated (socially) the third estate from the representatives of the nobility and the clergy was absent in the Vendee.  Its Celtic population, with its untouched Christianity, as well as the lack of culture inherent in the townspeople, was very different from the rest of France. </p><p>  The Vendeans were not much constrained by the previous orders, although such a situation was observed throughout the country.  They were strongly influenced by the clergy, which were numerous in the area.  These factors contributed to the lack of sympathy and even hostility to popular uprisings in the country and contributed to the further peasant counter-revolution. </p><p>  Back in 1792, at the same time as riots in neighboring Brittany, private unrest began.  They were supported by the machinations of British emissaries, emigrants, as well as the harsh behavior of the revolutionary authorities. </p><h2>  "Trigger" </h2><div class="photo" data-original="it.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="French revolution" class="if uuid-3075015" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3075015.jpg"></div><p>  One of the reasons for the uprising is the forced recruitment of recruits into the revolutionary army.  In March 1793, a draw was held, as a result of which an additional 300 thousand people were sent to the war.  Thus, the situation in the villages was extremely tense.  Fulfillment of recruitment service prompted the inhabitants of the west of the country to take up arms. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It was from this that the Vendee revolt in France began.  He was the largest amalgamation of the lower royalists during the Great Revolution.  However, the indicated fact of recruitment was rather a ‚Äútrigger‚Äù for further events.  Whereas the reasons for the counter-revolutionary events under consideration were more profound. </p><h2>  Reasons for the Vendee mutiny </h2><p>  They were as follows: </p><ul><li>  Firstly, this is the dissatisfaction of the peasants with the agricultural policy pursued by the Convention.  His decision - to destroy feudal obligations - continued to remain on paper.  The division of the peasantry into two categories - active and passive citizens - led to the fact that the latter were deprived of the right to vote.  The introduction of new rules, according to which the more affluent peasants now manage the affairs of the community.  The gathering that existed earlier in the secular villages was destroyed by the Constituent Assembly. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="yzgeneration.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="King Louis XV" class="if uuid-3075009" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3075009.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Secondly, this is the execution of King Louis XVI.  The reprisal against him led the Vendeans to conclude that the Parisians took the life of the monarch because he wanted the common people good.  Many of them, expressing their displeasure, took to the streets to show their devotion to the young son of executed Louis.  At that time he languished in Temple Castle. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="bcenud.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Three estates" class="if uuid-3075017" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3075017.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Thirdly, this is the support of the rural population from priests and nobles.  They managed to skillfully use the masses' commitment to monarchism and their religiosity, directing them against the republic. </li></ul><p>  As a result, tens of thousands of people took up arms, but at first their forces were scattered. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The beginning of the uprising </h2><p>  During the recruitment process in 1793, youth from the town of Cholet massacred the commander of the national guard operating here.  After a week in Mashekul, a clash occurred between opponents of recruitment and the Republicans.  Among the supporters of the republic, there were already hundreds of victims. </p><p>  A rebel detachment was formed on the banks of the Loire River.  Soon (in mid-March) one of the small republican armies, numbering three thousand people, collided with him, she was defeated.  The Vendeans were supporters of Catholicism and the monarchy.  Their army was called the Royal Catholic Army. </p><h2>  Rebellion is growing </h2><div class="photo" data-original="viticodevagamundo.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Katelino's invitation to command" class="if uuid-3075001" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3075001.jpg"></div><p>  After thousands of peasants, united, drove republican officials from the town of Saint-Florent, Jacques Catelino, who traded the canvas, was chosen as the commander of the rebel squad.  Soon they were joined by a detachment led by forester Jean Stoffle, and others behind him. </p><p>  In the first weeks of the Vendee mutiny, groups began to be led by natives.  Then, local noblemen and officers were attracted to the leadership of the newly created armed associations.  For several days, the ringing of the alarm bell, calling for an uprising, did not fall silent in all the Vendee church parishes.  As a result, approximately 30 thousand peasants took up arms. </p><h2>  Rebel Cruelty </h2><p>  In the process of the French counter-revolution, great cruelty was shown, first of all, by the Vendeans.  The villagers expressed their aggression on the townspeople, whose standard of living was higher than theirs.  And also on those who were on the side of the new order, these were: merchants, wealthy citizens, money-lenders, city officials. </p><p>  The Vendeans had their own identification mark in the form of the heart of Jesus Christ, made of bright red cloth.  It was present on their jackets in the form of embroidery.  And they were also distinguished by white cockades. </p><p>  The convention declared that carrying weapons and symbols of the Vendee would be punishable by death.  In response, the "whites" only continued to arm the peasants and townspeople.  For several weeks they managed to capture almost the entire edge, while they almost did not meet resistance.  Their headquarters has become a kind of alternative to the government.  He issued his own decrees, which were contrary to the decrees of the Convention. </p><p>  Together with the betrayal of General Dumurier and the defeat of the French army in Belgium, the uprising in the Vendee was a pretext for the formation of the Revolutionary Tribunal, as well as the publication of some strict laws.  Thus, the law punishing the rebels was used when most executions of the ‚Äúenemies of the revolution" were carried out. </p><h2>  Development of events </h2><p>  By the summer of 1793 there was a union of the Vendee forces.  Their number approached 40 thousand people.  The Supreme Military Council was convened, appointing Jacques Katelino commander in chief.  In June, the city of Saumur was occupied by the troops of the Vendee.  Thus, the road to Paris was opened.  However, the rebels did not dare to march on the capital. </p><p>  They turned to the west and headed to the city of Angers, which both the authorities and the defenders left.  In late June, with the expectation of help from the British, an attempt was made to siege Nantes.  The townspeople put up desperate resistance, while among the attackers there was no unity. </p><p>  Jacques Catellino was mortally wounded, street battles were lost, and the Vendians, being demoralized, lifted the siege.  This was followed by a temporary lull, but the advantage was still on the side of the rebels.  Although the peasants returned to their fields, they were ready to fight at the first signal. </p><h2>  Defeat of the Vendians </h2><div class="photo" data-original="viticodevagamundo.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Retreat through the Loire" class="if uuid-3075026" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3075026.jpg"></div><p>  The authorities of the republic for a long time could not dare to take decisive measures.  Finally, in early August, the Convention decided to destroy Vend√©e and sent troops under the command of Generals Marceau and Kleber.  But the forces of the Republicans were utterly defeated on September 19.  In October, the Western Army was sent to the rebellious lands. </p><p>  And in the middle of this month, Cholet, who became the heart of the rebellion, was defeated by the rebel forces.  Being defeated, the ‚Äúwhites,‚Äù led by Laroche-Jacqueline, quickly retreated in the direction of the Loire. </p><p>  They carried families along, trying to avoid the ‚Äúrevolutionary‚Äù retaliation that threatened them.  When they managed to cross to the other side, a difficult campaign began in Normandy.  Here the Vendians hoped to get the help that the British promised.  These events marked the beginning of the complete defeat of the Vendee mutiny. </p><h2>  Rebel violence </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.nybooks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The persecution of churchmen" class="if uuid-3075019" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3075019.jpg"></div><p>  During the uprising and at the end of it, the "infernal columns of General Turro" became infamous.  They crushed the Vendee rebellion and participated in punitive expeditions against the rebellious population. </p><p>  Then more than 10 thousand people were killed without trial, including relatives of the participants in the uprising, members of their families, as well as ministers of the church, monks and nuns.  During the genocide directed at the population of Brittany, the so-called Nantes drowning occurred, which replaced the executions on the guillotine due to their mass character and greater speed. </p><p>  The civil war, which erupted in the west of France in 1793, played a special role in its subsequent history.  The word "Vend√©e" has become symbolic.  Her rebellious spirit has repeatedly declared itself in difficult historical moments.  For example, this was in 1814-1815, in the war against Napoleon, and also in 1832, when support was given to the legitimate monarch.  In the following years, Vend√©e voted for the most conservative political parties in all elections, as is done today. </p>
