This short number is actually very functional.  And he helps to work with finances on a bank card of Sberbank.  In addition, it would be nice to figure out how to replenish the account of a mobile device (one‚Äôs or another‚Äôs) using ‚Äúplastic‚Äù.  It is not very difficult.  The main thing is to understand that any opportunity has its own algorithms, rules and restrictions.  Let's try to understand for a start how to put money on the phone through 900. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to put money on your phone through 900" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1139974.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <h2>  What is it </h2><p>  For starters, it‚Äôs worth knowing what we‚Äôll be dealing with.  Indeed, the number 900 is not just some strange combination.  It has a very normal name - "Mobile Bank". </p><p>  This service was created specifically for the quick work of Sberbank customers.  Using an attached mobile number, they can work with their bank cards without unnecessary problems.  True, you will have to learn all activation rules for each task.  And many do not quite understand how you can put money on another phone through 900 (or on your own).  Let's try to figure it all out. </p><h2>  Limitations </h2><p>  Let's start with the restrictions that apply to remittances.  The main problem that some Sberbank customers face is the amount of payments. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The thing is that it varies depending on whose mobile number you recharge.  For example, if you want to put money on your phone, then the minimum payment should be 50 rubles, and the maximum should be 10,000. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="put money on another phone through 900" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1139973.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  But in the case of someone else's number, everything is a little more complicated.  The minimum payment amount remains the same and amounts to 50 rubles.  But the maximum will decrease.  Another's phone number can be replenished with a one-time payment of no more than 3,000. It is quite an impressive amount.  Yes, most customers do not transfer such large payments, but this is the case. </p><p>  In addition, pay attention - you can put money on someone else's phone through 900 (or on your own) even if you have several bank cards linked to a number.  How to do this, find out a little later.  So it‚Äôs not necessary to panic that funds will be debited from all linked cards. </p><h2>  To myself </h2><p>  Now we‚Äôll try to understand how to put money on the phone through 900. The ‚ÄúMobile Bank‚Äù from Sberbank allows you to implement the idea in several ways.  And the first of them is the replenishment of your own mobile phone, which is tied to a card.  This is a typical case when one ‚Äúplastic‚Äù is tied to one number. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In this case, simply compose a message and send it to 900. In the text, it is enough to indicate only the payment amount.  The main advantage of using "Mobile Bank" is that this service does not require any additional charge.  That is, how much you indicate in the message, so much money will come to you on your mobile. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="put money on someone else's phone through 900" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1139972.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Important: if you try to act in a similar way when recharging your number that is not tied to a card, then you can not hope for success.  The given example is relevant only for attached phones.  Otherwise, all SIM cards bought in your name are also recognized as outsiders.  And they will have to use other tricks. </p><h2>  When multiple cards </h2><p>  How to put money on your phone through 900, when you have several cards tied to one number?  This rarely happens, but it happens.  And in this situation, the algorithm of actions changes a little.  In general, everything remains, as last time, you need to create a special message and send it for processing to the "Mobile Bank" from Sberbank. </p><p>  But the text of the message needs to be slightly modified.  In it, indicate the amount of payment, as last time.  And then through the space you need to write the last 4 digits of your bank card.  The one with which to write off funds.  Otherwise, you will not have any result from the operation.  Now send a message to 900 and wait for a response from the system.  Nothing difficult, right?  So even the presence of several bank cards tied to one telephone cannot complicate the process of replenishing the balance with the help of Mobile Bank. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to put money on your phone through 900 to your megaphone number" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1139971.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Third party numbers </h2><p>  We sorted out my phone.  But how to put money on the phone through 900 to another subscriber?  Here, as you might guess, you will also have to write an SMS request.  Approximately the same as before, but with some changes.  After forming the message, you will need to send it to 900 short number. </p><p>  What is the format of the letter in case of replenishment of someone else‚Äôs mobile?  In this case, the client of Sberbank must write: "TEL - number - amount".  Please note that the number to which funds are sent is written with a space.  And the amount too.  "TEL" preferably printed in capital letters.  This will protect you from minor system failures that could interfere with the transfer of funds.  Nothing difficult, right? </p><h2>  Aliens and some cards </h2><p>  We already understand how to put money on the phone through 900 to your number (‚ÄúMegaphone‚Äù or any other operator - it doesn‚Äôt matter) when you have several cards attached.  But what to do if you need to replenish your account with relatives or friends? </p><p>  In this case, the algorithm of actions is also not too different from the techniques we have already studied.  In the text of the message we write "TEL", then through the space - the phone number of the subscriber.  Now again we make a ‚Äúgap‚Äù and set the accrual amount.  Everything ends with the last 4 digits of the desired bank card written in a space.  We send a message for processing and wait for the results.  You don‚Äôt have to do anything else.  If you did everything correctly, you will have a message about the successful completion of the operation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to put money on your phone through 900 to your pay number" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1139970.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  the confirmation </h2><p>  Another important point.  If you are thinking about how to put money on your phone through 900 to your MTS number (or someone else‚Äôs, another operator), you will have to confirm your actions.  The thing is that after sending the request you will receive two messages.  The first is the operation confirmation code.  If actions are not confirmed, the transfer process will not be completed.  And the second (it will come after sending the code) will already display the overall result. </p><p>  How to confirm the transaction through the "Mobile Bank"?  Just send a message with a code that was delivered via SMS to 900. This will be activation.  All operations are absolutely free.  Even with a negative balance, you can send a message. </p><h2>  Online </h2><p>  Now we know how to put money on the phone through 900. But there is another very interesting way to transfer funds from the card to mobile.  This is nothing but Sberbank Online.  This service is great for managing the map using the Internet.  And replenishing a mobile account with her is very convenient. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to put money on the phone through 900 to another subscriber" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1139969.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  To implement the method, you will have to go through authorization on the Sberbank Online website.  Now, when you get into the system, select "Payments and Transfers" - "Mobile Account".  In the window that appears, select the card from which money is debited (relevant for cases when several "plastics" are attached to one number), then write down the recipient's number and the transfer amount.  Click "Pay" and wait a little while.  So easily and simply you can replenish absolutely any account with a Sberbank credit card.  This method is well suited when the Mobile Bank does not work (such cases occur) or you are not comfortable using mobile for money transfers. </p><p>  By the way, the number 900 can be used to activate the USSD command.  She also transfers money to the recipient's account.  To do this, dial * 900 * 12 * number * money #.  Another quick way that pleases some customers. </p>
