    <h2>  Payments </h2><p>  Frankly, there are not many options for the development of events.  But few people even guess about them.  Can I find out the <span>loan debt?</span>  Yes.  And the first, most obvious scenario is the receipt of a notice of payment thereof directly to the post office. </p><p>  That is, it is enough to wait until you receive the appropriate receipt at the postal address.  Usually she comes once a month, at the very end.  In it, you can easily see the amount of payment and your debt, if any.  Among other things, it is worth paying attention to the fact that the size of the penalty payment is also indicated here.  Nothing difficult. </p><p>  Only this is not the most reliable option.  Why?  Because often payment documents are faked.  And citizens become victims of scammers.  How can I find out if there really is a loan debt?  This is not so difficult to do! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Credit history </h2><p>  For example, you have every right to <span>check your credit history.</span>  It is important that the data is yours.  In extreme cases - a close relative.  Third parties without special authority cannot be verified by this method. </p><p>  What is required of you?  The first thing to find out in which BIC is your data.  This is done using a certain service located on the official website of the Bank of Russia.  There you enter your data and look for the appropriate office. </p><p>  Once the case is completed, contact the organization in person.  Carry a passport with you.  Maybe in electronic format you will also be processed a request for checking debts, but usually this method fails. </p><h2>  Visitors </h2><p>  How to find out if there is a loan debt?  Understanding this is not so difficult if you know where to start.  The thing is that when a citizen has a desire and time, he has every right to apply to the bank, where he took a loan, and then get all the information he is interested in. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Can I find out the loan debt" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1254796.jpg"></div>

    <p>  This option is good when you have either a loan agreement or a receipt for payment (even a fake).  You apply to your bank with a passport, it gives you information about the existing debt in return.  Or about the absence thereof.  Nothing difficult.  Perhaps this option is in greatest demand.  You cannot be deceived in principle.  You can also request an account statement.  If it is positive, there are no debts. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Court </h2><p>  How do you know if you have a loan debt?  Another rather interesting option is to appeal to the judiciary.  More precisely, in the FSSP.  Both personally and on the Internet.  You can check whether you are being dealt with in connection with your existing debt.  It is enough to either enter your <span>personal data</span> on the corresponding page on the network and look at the result, or personally contact the organization in your area. </p><p>  True, this alignment is not always effective.  It is relevant in cases where there is a likelihood of a large debt arrears.  So do not be surprised if there is no information about you in the FSSP, and <span>payment receipts</span> do not come.  It only means that <span>court proceedings</span> have not yet been brought against you <span>.</span>  So, you can easily figure out how to find out if there is a loan debt, and then pay it off. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out if there is a loan debt" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1254797.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Internet banking </h2><p>  But there are more interesting as well as simple methods for solving our current problem.  The modern world is developing rapidly, banks are coming up with more and more services every day that will help control finances and debts.  So, you can rely on offers from credit organizations. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  What is it about?  Where and how to find out loan debt?  The modern method of solving the problem is <span>Internet banking.</span>  A variety of online services (official, this is important) from banks.  Usually, it‚Äôs enough to register with them (all clients do this), and then just visit the page dedicated to loans.  Enter your data there and fulfill the request for the issuance of an extract on debts to you.  Not so hard. </p><p>  The main problem is finding the right page.  Most often, the corresponding item is in your "My Account".  Each bank has its own menu responsible for issuing information on loans and borrowings, but in general there are no significant differences from each other. </p><h2>  Question answer </h2><p>  Another solution to the problem is the use of the so-called question-answer form.  <span>How to find out your</span> loan debt?  All methods, to be honest, are pretty easy to learn.  Some of them do not immediately become relevant.  And most of them allow you to get the necessary information right from home. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how can I find out if there is a loan debt" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1254798.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  The application of the question-answer form relates precisely to these.  It exists on the sites of many credit organizations and banks.  Write your request and personal details to the consultant (do not forget about registration), and then wait for an answer.  Usually they will just tell you if there is a debt or not.  There is nothing difficult or supernatural in this. </p><h2>  Feedback </h2><p>  How to find out if there is a loan debt?  Another method, although not the most reliable one, is to access a service called Feedback, which is available on the official pages of many credit organizations and banks.  Something reminiscent of the previous version, but this method, as a rule, is distinguished by its reliability and timeframe.  Not too fast, it‚Äôs worth noting. </p><p>  What is required of you?  Form a request in the form of a message indicating personal data and a request to provide you with a credit history statement (or simply inform you if there is a particular loan debt).  After sending the appropriate form, you will have to wait.  Usually replies come directly to email.  From there you can find out all the information you are interested in. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out if you have a loan debt" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1254799.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  How to pay </h2><p>  Suppose we find out that there is a loan debt.  What to do now?  It all depends on the situation - if it comes to court, you have to come to the appropriate meeting.  So far, is it not so serious?  Then just pay the debt and sleep peacefully.  Fortunately, there are so many options for solving the problem.  Which ones? </p><p>  For example, if you have the details of the recipient bank (and they must be mandatory), as well as a payment, you can contact her at the cash desk of a credit institution with a passport and money.  Pay and save a receipt.  Not the most modern, but very effective way. </p><p>  You can also use the Internet banking and online services of your credit organizations.  They search for the recipient (preferably by TIN), enter your data, then confirm the payment.  Usually, in the presence of debt, the required amount is displayed in the appropriate field. </p><p>  Virtual wallets are another solution to the problem.  Log in to the desired service, find the recipient bank (again, preferably by TIN), then confirm the payment with the preliminary entry of your data and verification of details. </p><p>  ATMs, payment terminals are used in a similar way.  At the moment, the first ‚Äúmachines‚Äù, as well as Internet banking and electronic wallets, have become especially popular.  As you can see, paying a debt is not really a problem. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where and how to find out loan debt" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1254800.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Scammers </h2><p>  Often, after citizens verify in one way or another their debts on loans and credits, it turns out that they become victims of fraudsters.  What to do in this case?  Especially if threat collectors are already calling you to get money out of you. </p><p>  There are not so many options for solving the problem.  Firstly, you can contact the anti-collection organizations.  They will help for a moderate fee to resolve any conflict with the collectors, even if you have debts. </p><p>  Secondly, just ignore all calls, payments, threats.  If you really do not have debt, then ignoring it will not lead to anything dangerous.  Most likely, scammers will simply try to intimidate you for extorting money. </p><p>  Thirdly, if a specific bank is indicated in the receipt, contact there to resolve the issue.  As an option - appeal to the court or the police.  In any case, if you check your credit history, and you do not have any debts, the option of dealing with fraudsters and injustice is only for you to choose. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  So we figured out how to find out if there is a loan debt, and also what to do if it turns out that money is being illegally requested from you.  Modern methods of solving the problem offer us a fairly wide and extensive range of services.  You can choose the approach that you like the most.  True, not all paths fit right away.  Some options, such as judicial review, are relevant only as a last resort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to check loan debt" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1254801.jpg"></div>

    <p>  If it turned out that you were the victim of a scammer, you will have to take appropriate measures.  First, make sure that there is no real debt, and then inform the police about the incident.  Most likely, a check will be carried out, and then all charges will be dropped from you.  In no case should you pay fictitious debt.  At the moment, fraudsters are very fond of manipulating loans and loans in order to profit from gullible citizens. </p><p>  As you can see, it‚Äôs not so difficult to understand how to check a loan debt.  You can deal with this problem literally in two counts.  You just need to know where to start.  Always keep your passport and registration data with you.  Without them, it will not be possible to bring the idea to life.  Even with the help of the Internet. </p>
