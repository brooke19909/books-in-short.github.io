Options, prices</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Philips, in principle, never claimed to be the technologically advanced organization in the field of mobile phones, as a result of which it specializes more in the production of standard models, characterized by a sufficiently large battery capacity.  And Philips Xenium X623 was no exception.  If you decide to purchase this phone, then, unlike the vast majority of modern smartphones, the first thing you notice is that you don‚Äôt need to think about the operating time of your device at all. </p><h2>  What is he like? </h2>

    <p>  The Philips Xenium X623 has a 5-megapixel camera, equipped with fully automatic focusing, a fairly high-quality screen matrix, an additional microphone that provides effective noise suppression during a conversation, as well as a specialized light sensor that automatically adjusts the screen backlight to the surroundings. </p><p>  The positioning of this model is quite simple.  Given the extremely powerful battery present, as well as the possibility of using two SIM cards at the same time, the device will become interesting for those who want to purchase a mobile device for communication.  At the same time, the price for <span>Philips Xenium X623</span> is around 5000 rubles, which is a very, very good and affordable option for most. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Design </h2><p>  The design of the device is strict and classic.  The Philips Xenium X623 is rectangular and has only slightly smoothed edges.  The upper half is slightly flattened, while the lower half is slightly sharpened.  The back cover, the rim of the camera and a certain part of the front panel are made of specialized metal, which is painted black.  The lower edge and the edging are also black, but in this case, the material is already semi-gloss plastic.  A bronze insert located on the upper end of the mobile phone is also made from it. </p><h2>  How reliable is the case? </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="headset for phone" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32280/971109.jpg" width="481"></div></h2><p>  During the long-term operation of this device, no creaking, backlash or crunching appears even if the phone is squeezed hard enough.  Of course, against the background of standard mobile devices that most modern users are used to, such a device will be somewhat heavy, but at the same time it is quite comfortable in the hand thanks to its pleasant streamlined shape, small width and extremely balanced weight. </p><p>  Fingerprints and other traces can remain exclusively on the Philips Xenium X623 display, and at the same time erasing them is not so easy as it might seem at first glance, so many users of this device recommend using all kinds of protective films. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At the top of the front panel there is a specialized light sensor.  This device is intended to automatically change the power of the backlight depending on how lit is the whole room.  In the predominant majority of cases, it is customary to install such sensors on modern touchscreen smartphones, because there is a fairly strong energy consumption in screens with a large diagonal. </p><h2>  Speaker </h2><p>  Special attention should be paid to the fact that the Philips Xenium X623 cell phone has a fairly quiet speaker, as a result of which it often becomes difficult to talk with the other person in a noisy place, but the developers compensated for the speaker volume not too high with an extremely high degree of intelligibility and clarity of sound.  The device has a special system of subtractive dynamic noise reduction, that is, any sounds are initially passed through a large series of filters and only then are sent cleaned to the subscriber. </p><h2>  Keys and controls </h2>

At the bottom there is a specialized handle for attaching the strap, while on the left there is a microSD slot.  Special attention should be paid to the fact that this phone provides a hot-swap function. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  On the right side there is a mechanical button that activates the camera, as well as two separate keys designed to control the volume.  It is worth noting that the keys extend slightly above the body, so it‚Äôs quite easy to feel them with your fingers, which is a pretty pleasant moment for most people.

    <p>  The display of this device is quite standard, and its diagonal is 2.4 inches.  The resolution of this screen is 240x320 pixels, while its density is 166 pixels per inch.  The matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãmanufactured in accordance with TFT-IPS technology and has the ability to reflect approximately 262 thousand color shades.  Installing such a display in devices such as the Philips Xenium X623 black mobile phone is a rather interesting solution. </p><p>  It is worth noting the fact that the performance of this display remains at its best, since the viewing angles are the maximum possible, and in the case of a strong tilt, the brightness only slightly decreases.  However, it is worth noting that the brightness itself is not very high even for standard <span>office lighting,</span> and in the light the screen can completely fade.  For this reason, the light sensor in this case does not play any significant role. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="substrate for philips xenium x623" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32280/971107.jpg" width="357"></div></h2><p>  The battery for Philips Xenium X623 is quite voluminous, and the charge indicator is located in the upper right part of the screen and provides for two divisions. </p><p>  The mobile phone itself includes a lithium-ion battery with a capacity of 2000 mAh.  The manufacturer says that in standby mode the device can work for more than 50 days, while while maintaining a constant conversation will work for 23 hours.  Thus, on average, the Philips Xenium X623 battery allows you to maintain the phone in working condition for about a week. </p><p>  During testing, the information received by the manufacturer was only partially confirmed, because during the conversation this phone lasted only 17 hours, while in standby mode it remained in working condition for about a month.  If you listen to music on the phone, the battery lasts about 30 hours, regardless of which headset is used for the phone. </p><h2>  Charging </h2><p>  Charging in the kit is delivered rather weak, since with its help to fully recharge the battery you need to spend more than three hours.  However, if you use a standard USB cable, the total time of this process will increase even more. </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  As mentioned above, the device has a 5 megapixel camera equipped with an auto focus function.  There is also a flash, but user reviews of this device suggest that the efficiency of its use is small.  The maximum possible resolution of photographs is 2592x1944, while video can be shot at a resolution of 480x320, and even at a speed of no more than 12 frames per second. </p><p>  Thus, it is worth mentioning that you can take very, very good photos, since the camera‚Äôs capabilities in terms of taking photographs are characterized by a fairly high image quality.  Users note the correct <span>white balance</span> and the definition of exposure, very good detail, the complete absence of any geometric distortion, as well as a small focusing distance of about 3 cm. The video is shot far from the best quality, as the impression greatly spoils the allowable number of frames , not going to any comparison even with those features that offered phones of the same year of release. </p><h2>  Performance and menus </h2><p>  The device operates on the so-called proprietary operating system, but during this time almost none of the users said that it slows down or freezes during its operation.  Also, there are no complaints about the way the phone responds to keystrokes and menu switching if a normal substrate is used for the Philips Xenium X623. </p><p>  If the phone is in a locked state, the user is presented with information on the status of the battery, network, operator, as well as time and date.  Locking and unlocking the device is quite simple, so even a person who is not very versed in such equipment can cope with these procedures. </p><h2>  Two cards </h2>

    <p>  Work with two SIM cards is quite standard for phones in which this feature is present.  In order to dial a number from a specific card, you will initially need to select it from the contact list, then press the upper left button and select which card to use in this case.  For ease of use, each card is initially assigned a specific name of the operator to which it belongs. </p><p>  In the "Contacts" section there is a complete list of the phone book with various numbers.  Immediately it is worth noting the fact that initially neither the memory in which this number was stored, nor the number of the card to which it is attached is initially displayed.  The search option provides only the introduction of a first and last name.  In this regard, you have to constantly remember which location you chose for each individual contact.  The phone has the ability to store 2,000 cells, however, you can optionally place it on the card itself.  You can copy or transfer numbers stored in the phone to the SIM card and back. </p><p>  After the dialing takes place, the time and various settings begin to be displayed on the screen.  If necessary, you can quickly switch to messages, phone book or any other menu items.  By pressing the ‚ÄúOK‚Äù button, the speakerphone is standardly activated.  Special attention should be paid to the recorder, which allows you to record a conversation while retaining both voices. </p><p>  All these functions (except handsfree) can be used without problems, regardless of whether the headset is used for the phone. </p>
