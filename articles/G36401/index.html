And this is true: the island‚Äôs landscapes truly resemble ancient Eden - they are unique and diverse.  Corfu is buried in citrus orchards and olive groves.  Here, mountains are replaced by plains, and rocky shores are replaced by beaches, lagoons pass into picturesque lakes and rivers.  All this, combined with a developed tourist infrastructure, makes the stay on the island romantic and full of unforgettable impressions. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lido Corfu Sun Hotel" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/675031.jpg" width="600"></div>  Holidays in Corfu </h2><p>  According to legend, the god Poseidon, falling in love with the beautiful nymph Kerkyra, abducted her and brought her here.  Fearless Argonauts who fled from King Colchis found refuge on the island.  Here, the marriage of the beautiful Medea with the brave Jason was consecrated. </p><p>  Modern Corfu has turned into a world famous resort, loved by many tourists.  Here everyone finds a vacation that meets his ideas about an ideal vacation. </p><p>  Hotels in Corfu, as, indeed, throughout Greece, do not correspond to the generally accepted classification.  Their level is indicated by letters.  For example, the category De Luxe denotes three or four stars, A - three with a plus or four, B - average "three rubles", and C - respectively, the cheapest.  At the same time, within one letter, prices for hotels in Corfu may vary significantly: it depends on the infrastructure. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Lido Corfu Sun 3 * </h2>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Judging by the impressions of Russians, many people liked this hotel.  Particularly satisfied with the price, which compared to other hotels on the island is quite affordable.  Lido Corfu Sun Hotel, reviews of which are mostly positive, relatively new.  The rooms are tastefully decorated.  They are always clean.  Staff unobtrusively vacuuming rooms, changing towels and bedding.  This is done for the most part in the mornings, when guests leave for breakfast. </p><p>  As for nutrition, some complain about the monotonous dishes, but there are also opinions that the cuisine in the restaurant is excellent.  Many tourists believe that the designation "three stars" (or category B) for this hotel is somewhat underestimated.  With regard to the sea, everyone agrees: both the water and the sun on this part of the island are magnificent. </p><p>  In addition, our compatriots staying at this hotel separately note the silence, which on vacation is sometimes simply necessary.  The staff speaks five languages: Serbian, Croatian, English, Greek and Czech - but the receptionist has a girl who communicates with the Russians in their native language.  Therefore, many, finding it difficult to explain, invite her. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lido Corfu San Hotel" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/675025.jpg" width="550"></div>
