  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Review of headphones Dexp H-520</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Almost every modern person working at a computer or just keen on games faces the problem of choosing a headset.  Which manufacturer is better?  Which model to choose?  What characteristics should I pay attention to?  All these issues concern the minds of many.  But today we will answer them: meet the Dexp H-520 headphones. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The headphones are delivered to the market in a stylish white-red box made of strong and dense cardboard with an almost full-size photo of the device applied over the main coloring.  In the lower left corner you can see a small footnote, where the main characteristics of the product, as the manufacturer suggests, are taken out.  Looking ahead, we say that the advantages turned out to be more, but everything has its time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mcgrp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dexp headphones" class="if uuid-2563891" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44269/2563891.jpg"></div><p>  Inside the box, the headphones are fixed with cable ties in a pallet made of synthetic thin plastic, which prevents them from being damaged during transportation, which means they will arrive safe and sound at the buyer.  However, it should be noted that Dexp headphones, bearing the proud title of gaming, should be packaged presentably.  The presence of at least a soft bag as a headphone case would be clearly out of place. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition to the headphones, there is a standard set in the box: a warranty card and short, but very sensible instructions for use.  Highly recommended reading. </p><p>  Attention!  For those who refused to read the instructions: for the headphones to work correctly, additional software drivers are needed.  A disk with this software is not included in the package, so there will be a photo below that shows a section of the instructions explaining how to install the drivers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="club.dns-shop.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dexp h 520 headphones" class="if uuid-2563906" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44269/2563906.jpg"></div><h2>  physical characteristics </h2><p>  At first glance, the headphones look very massive.  The headset is made of high-quality black high-impact plastic with red inserts.  The work of designers is visible: on the speaker case, on the outside there are decorative recesses that form a very catchy angular pattern.  We must pay tribute to Dexp - headphones 520 models in terms of design look decent. </p><p>  In addition to everything, the device is equipped with dynamic backlighting: side translucent red inserts begin to flicker while listening to music.  Headphones Dexp H-520 have a very comfortable and large headband, for greater comfort, covered with foam rubber and synthetic leather.  Thanks to the four soft foam tabs on the inside, they do not slip, sit tight, but do not press, which often happens with such headphones.  The headband is adjustable in terms of girth, so that even on a person with a big head they sit perfectly. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A swivel microphone is mounted on the left speaker.  Unfortunately, it does not have any flexibility, as is often the case on some devices.  Soft ear cushions fit your ears tight and guarantee good suppression of external noise.  Also, the manufacturer did not forget about the rest of the device.  On this model, a wire 2.5 meters long is completely braided with red-black nylon, which contributes to greater wear resistance. </p><p>  The volume control panel is made in accordance with the overall design and is represented by three buttons: add sound, decrease sound and the mute / unmute button. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dexp.club" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dexp 520 headphones" class="if uuid-2563892" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44269/2563892.jpg"></div><p>  Also, the device pleases with a massive USB plug.  With it, you can easily and reliably connect the headset to a computer and not be afraid of accidentally removing the plug from the socket.  However, you need to understand that with such dimensions, the use of an additional adapter from USB to MiniJack 3.5 may be accompanied by some inconvenience.  In general, the 520th model in terms of performance and overall design is very similar to the Dexp H-350 headphones, but significantly modified in comparison with its predecessor. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  Contrary to expectations and warnings from the Dexp manual, the earphones at first connection immediately come into combat readiness.  At the same time, the sound quality coming from the speakers can pleasantly surprise an ordinary user.  Very clear and surround sound will be appreciated by movie and music lovers as well as avid gamers.  Due to the wide range (20-20.000 Hz), you will have access to various sound options in excellent 7.1 quality, which, according to conservative estimates, surpasses the usual stereo for all. </p><p>  The built-in microphone, by the way, also pleases with quality.  Being in the working position, it easily picks up sound, but which is inherent in other similar microphones, it does not work well at high volume, so we advise you to speak as calmly as possible. </p><p>  Worth mentioning about drivers.  As it turned out, their only purpose is to expand the headset settings, but not to improve its performance.  However, when you try to install them using the specified link, there is a chance to encounter technical problems, the only way to solve which would be to remove this software.  So do it at your own peril and risk. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dexp.club" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dexp h 350 headphones" class="if uuid-2563890" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44269/2563890.jpg"></div><h2>  Total </h2><p>  Dexp 520 - headphones of really good quality.  For an insignificant price, you get fully working, stylish, durable headphones with high quality performance and, most importantly, sound. </p><p>  The only significant drawback of this headset from Dexp is that the headphones are not equipped with good drivers that would reveal the full potential of the device. </p>
