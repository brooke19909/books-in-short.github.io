The thing is that such proposals are far from being the first time heard in the government.  But until the direct cancellation has not yet reached.  Often, this payment is of concern to many drivers.  After all, they already have to pay a lot for the maintenance <span>of the vehicle.</span>  Therefore, more and more often citizens are interested in when the transport tax is canceled in Russia.  And in general - whether it will be done.  Let's try to understand this issue. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="when will the transport tax be canceled in Russia" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1190767.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What it is? </h2><p>  At the moment, in Russia there is one very important rule: all drivers for transport pay the corresponding annual fee.  It is called the transport tax.  This is the payment of funds by the owner of the car for its registration in the country. </p><p>  Relate such charges to the regional.  Each city has its own sizes, reporting forms, and benefits.  But when will the transport tax be abolished in Russia?  And will such a decision be made?  Such proposals have been made many times.  Should we hope for the indulgence of the government? </p><h2>  Who does not pay? </h2><p>  It is simply and unequivocally impossible to answer this way.  Indeed, in modern legislation, there are already some features and rules that help either reduce the percentage of the tax rate, or even free citizens from the corresponding payments.  There are not so many limitations.  But not everyone knows about them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When will the transport tax be canceled in Russia?  The question is difficult.  Indeed, at the moment, drivers who have row boats (and motor boats) are completely exempted from this.  True, the power of the engines of such funds should not exceed 5 horsepower. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="when Russia will cancel the transport tax" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1190769.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Passenger transport (cars) equipped for transporting people with disabilities or obtained with the help of social protection bodies is also not subject to any payments to the state treasury.  There is also a slight restriction: the presence of an engine is not more powerful than 100 horsepower. </p><p>  Transport for the carriage of passengers owned by a private entrepreneur, as well as sea and river fishing vessels, agricultural vehicles owned by producers, as well as federal vehicles, airplanes and helicopters of medical services - all this is also not subject to taxes.  Therefore, the drivers of the listed vehicles may not think when they will cancel the transport tax in Russia.  This change will not affect them in any way. </p><h2>  Do I have to pay? </h2><p>  If you do not fall into any of the above categories, then the corresponding payments will need to be paid annually.  This is known to many.  Therefore, it is interesting whether the transport tax in Russia will be abolished. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Transport tax in Russia canceled" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1190768.jpg" width="600"></div>

And restrictions are imposed only on the tax reporting period.  That is, the corresponding cash payments must be paid by each owner of the vehicle until April 30. </p><p>  The same applies to filing a tax return when paying.  Without it, you cannot pay tax.  As a result, a debt will appear.  And problems with the law.  Therefore, the issue of solving the problem must be thought in advance.  Nevertheless, many, having heard that it is proposed to abolish the transport tax in Russia, try not to think about this issue at all.  This is in vain.  At the moment, there is no specifics.  We can‚Äôt hope that the payments will be canceled.  Yes, and in the near future.  While there is no exact solution, it‚Äôs better to prepare yourself and prepare a tax return. </p><h2>  Promises </h2><p>  Recently, a tendency has often been observed to introduce proposals on changing the terms and procedure for paying taxes in Russia.  Similar actions are undertaken by various factions in the Government.  Most of them, as practice shows, are not considered seriously at all. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Will the transport tax be abolished in Russia" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1190770.jpg"></div>

    <p>  So, people wondered when they would cancel the transport tax in Russia, after the proposals of the Just Russia faction.  But such an initiative was discussed back in 2012.  And then it did not seem effective.  In 2015, Fair Russia already proposed applying this measure in the current crisis.  Instead, the idea was expressed to include vehicle tax in some other payments.  Transform it, thereby reducing it. </p><h2>  Eternal talk </h2><p>  What is the result?  Will the transport tax be abolished in Russia?  As has already been said repeatedly, an exact answer will not be given now.  After all, this innovation has not yet been fully considered in the Government of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  Instead, the Just Russia‚Äôs proposal has gained widespread acceptance among citizens.  From this came the eternal discussion on this issue.  On the World Wide Web you can now find information that from January 1, 2016, the transport tax in Russia is canceled.  In fact, this is not so at all.  There were no such decisions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="in Russia it is proposed to abolish the transport tax" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1190771.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Nevertheless, instead of just waiting for decisions from the government, citizens zealously discuss this issue.  But still they cannot come to a common opinion.  Someone assures that cancellation can be expected in the near future.  Others claim the opposite.  And some believe that if the <span>tax on transport is</span> canceled, then other payments to the state by the population will be raised several times.  And then there will be no such tax on vehicles, and you need to pay money either as much or even more. </p><h2>  Tale or reality? </h2><p>  So how are things really?  In fact, the news that the transport tax has been canceled in Russia is a lie.  And talking about the adoption of this bill in the near future is also a lie. </p><p>  Remember, in 2016, the transport tax will not be canceled for sure.  In any case, if this happens, then only at the end of it.  Neither in January nor in March, these amendments entered into force.  Moreover, they did not even pass the audition.  It turns out that all the promises so far remain just a fairy tale.  The dream of drivers, which is not given to come true. </p><h2>  How to be </h2><p>  What remains for taxpayers to do?  It is not necessary to think about when the transport tax in Russia will be canceled.  Instead, just get ready for the next payout.  At the moment, such a measure is simply unacceptable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Will the transport tax be canceled in Russia" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1190772.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  And keep in mind: if they do accept it, they‚Äôll either come up with a new type of tax, or they will really increase existing payments.  Therefore, there is no need to hope for complete liberation at all.  This does not happen.  Do not believe the yellow press, which assures the abolition of transport tax.  All this is a real lie.  At the moment, you can find statements that the transport tax will be abolished by April 1, 2016.  But many do not attach importance to this promise. </p>
