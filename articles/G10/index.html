    <h2>  About booking and room rules </h2><p>  At Sun Hall Hotel 4 * (Cyprus, Larnaca Town), check-in starts at 14:00, as in many other hotels.  But if the guest arrived earlier, but there is a free room booked by him, then he will be posted immediately.  Departure, as elsewhere, lasts until noon. </p><p>  The hotel can accommodate children of any age.  And for babies up to 2 years old a separate cradle will be provided.  And this, like a child‚Äôs stay, will be free.  It is better to warn the administration in advance about the necessity of installing a crib, even when drawing up the application - so that they can prepare everything. </p><p>  Better yet, take advantage of early bookings.  The hotel is popular, so by the beginning of the season there are few available rooms.  In addition, travelers who decide to take early bookings or reserve apartments for the fall or winter (not the most visited time) are often offered discounts. </p><h2>  About staff </h2><p>  The hotel employs polite and helpful people who are important to ensure that the guest is satisfied.  The rooms are cleaned daily and thoroughly, towels are changed with the same regularity.  Even a filter in the air conditioner once a week put a new one.  And if you need something (a white towel or new toiletries), you should just contact the reception. </p><p>  The territory is also clean, it's nice to be here.  Guests leaving reviews about staying at the Sun Hall Hotel 4 * (Larnaca) say that in case of any malfunction in the room, you should contact the administrator and they will fix it as quickly and efficiently as possible. </p>

    <h2>  What do the guests say? </h2><p>  In the end, I would like to talk a little more in detail about what kind of reviews they leave about staying at Sun Hall Hotel 4 * (Larnaca).  Most of them are positive.  Guests claim - this is one of the best city hotels in Cyprus.  Perfect location, comfortable rooms, polite staff - what else is needed for a relaxing and carefree vacation? </p><p>  The hotel is suitable for people who expect peace and comfort from the hotel.  This is mainly for lovers of fun, walks and attractions.  There are practically no guests with children, since for the latter there are not enough conditions - they will be bored. </p><p>  In the evenings in Larnaca it is noisy.  But if you turn on the air conditioning and close the balcony door, it will immediately become quiet. </p><p>  In the immediate vicinity of the hotel there is a bus stop, and from there you can go anywhere.  This is a definite plus, since taxis are expensive.  To Limassol, for example, 50 euros. </p><p>  By the way, many are worried that the hotel is in a busy corner, and there is no place on the beach.  But this is not so.  The beach at the hotel is private and clean.  To get there, you need to take a card at the reception.  However, there are plenty of beaches.  Many people like to stroll to the farther, along the way to peek into cozy pastry shops or cafes for freshly squeezed juices or hot pastries. </p><p>  In general, Larnaca is a very large youth resort with a huge number of shops, shopping centers, bars, cafes, clubs.  But here it is quiet.  In winter and fall.  At this time, a particularly romantic atmosphere reigns here.  And by the way, even in December it is quite possible to swim here.  Air temperature rarely drops below 19-16 degrees, and the sea in Greece is always 2-3 ¬∞ C warmer. </p><p>  In any case, having come here, you will have a good rest.  Numerous reviews confirm this.  And to make sure, you should go here yourself. </p>
