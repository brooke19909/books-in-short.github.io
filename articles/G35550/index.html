Today, beauty salons and numerous private masters offer for an affordable price to braid beautiful hairstyles in a wide variety of styles.  They can be asked to do absolutely any hairstyle: from the original dreadlocks to ordinary braided spikelets from a different number of hair strands. </p><p>  Learning how to <span>braid</span> <span>short hair</span> is not at all difficult.  All that is needed is a little practical training, material (hairpins, styling products, combs, etc.) and time for doing hairstyles.  It should be noted that many girls in a fairly short period of time master the most common and popular techniques such as braiding short hair.  Below is one of the most popular hairstyles. </p><p>  Instructions on how to make <span>braids</span> for short hair. </p><p>  Initial action. </p><p>  You need to create such braids on well-washed, dried and combed hair, which should be separated from the top of the head to the forehead with an even parting.  Near it, it is necessary to select a lock of hair and comb it, and then use it in order to weave braids for short hair. </p><p>  Next, you need to braid the pigtail itself, but do not forget that the hair in this case should not be pulled, because the hairstyle should be as dense as possible, but at the same time not tightened.  In order to braid a lot of braids, it is necessary to braid each of them from the selected strand to the very end, tie its tip with a thread, and then select a new lock of hair next to the already braided pigtail.  Then you need to comb it and start doing braiding for short hair in the same way as the first time.  In this case, it is necessary to highlight locks of hair that have the same thickness, because in this case, a hairstyle braided by short hair will look neat, beautiful and even. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The most popular weaving <span>for short hair</span> is the African braids.  In order to make voluminous and lush afrokos, you will need an artificial fiber such as Kanekalon.  It is woven into its own hair, so it must match their natural color.  It should be noted that with the help of such kanekalon it is possible to increase the length of the braids themselves and turn short waldos into long ones.  That is why it is very attractive to those girls who dream of distracting from their short curls, having turned in a rather short time into owners of long strands. </p><p>  In order to make afrokos, you need to divide your head into fairly small square sections.  At each such site, you need to select a lock of hair, comb it and begin to weave a neat and beautiful pigtail, braiding the same kanekalon, starting from the very roots.  At the moment when your short hair is over, you just need to continue braiding, using kanekalon.  Having reached the very end, you need to scald the ends with boiling water. </p><p>  Braiding braids from curly curls is much simpler than from straight strands.  This can be explained by the fact that on curly hairs, rough transitions from natural short curls to artificial fiber are less noticeable.  After weaving braids, you must definitely see if extra hairs stick out of the hairstyle.  If they prevail, then they can simply be cut with ordinary scissors.  It should be noted that popular afrokos often weave in cases where it is possible to go on vacation.  After all, such weaving is able to make hair not interfere with its mistress. </p>
