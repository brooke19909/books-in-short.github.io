Its water is known throughout the world for its medicinal properties, so many tourists and vacationers come here. </p><h2>  Geographical position </h2><p>  Located 20 km from the Greek capital Athens, Lake Vouliagmeni is a famous resort whose healing properties are determined by its water containing radon.  Near the 100 m behind the isthmus, which runs the intercity highway, is the Saronic Strait of the Aegean Sea. </p><p>  According to scientists, the lake was formed in the place where the crater of the volcano used to be.  It is his echoes in the form of hot springs that are the reason for the constantly warm water in Vouliagmen.  Its temperature + 21 ... + 24 °  is the most pleasant for bathing holidaymakers at any time of the year, especially for those who visit Greece in October-November or in winter. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="37.8078002" data-lng="23.78550180000002" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/3/0/5/6/13056.png"></div><p>  According to another version, the lake was formed on the site of a huge underground cave, the upper part of which collapsed after the earthquake several centuries ago.  In the Ottoman era, the lake was called “Vouliasmenos” and “Karachi”, which means “black water”. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Local legends and history </h2><p>  According to a legend told by locals, Lake Vouliagmeni was a favorite place where the Greek goddess Athena received water procedures.  The very first historical findings were made in 1924 by the pupils of an orphanage at the local church.  Digging in the sand, the children discovered marble columns, a pedestal and part of the slab on which the sanctuary of Apollo Zostiros was mentioned. </p><p>  In antiquity, the Vouliagmeni region and the adjacent Voula and Vari, due to their favorable location and proximity to the sea, on the one hand, and the mountains, on the other, developed due to the extraction of salt, also the inhabitants were engaged in fishing and cattle breeding (raised goats )  The territory was developed as early as the Neolithic period (3 thousand BC), later in the 6th century.  the cities were merged into the municipality of Ales Exonides and represented the Kekrop tribe. </p><p>  As a result of excavations in the territory of Vouliagmeni and neighboring cities, 2 saltworks, 3 pottery workshops, as well as residential buildings (consisting of several rooms, a kitchen and a bath) and an ancient road were discovered.  This indicates a high standard of living of the ancient inhabitants of this region of Greece. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.greece-is.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake view" class="if uuid-3001853" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46001/3001853.jpg"></div><h2>  Underground labyrinths </h2><p>  The bottom of the thermal lake of Vouliagmeni is a whole system of karst caves through which underground waters pass.  A total of 14 tunnels are located here, one of which, 88 m long, is recognized by scientists as the largest underground tunnel in the world.  Its width varies between 60-150 m, and the average depth is 80 m. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the center of the lake is the cave "Blue Devil's Well", its dimensions are very small (11 m - depth, 3 m - diameter).  It got its name, thanks to gloomy local legends that testify to the dangers that await scuba diving enthusiasts there. </p><p>  Such an underground structure of the reservoir aroused great interest among divers.  However, a complex system of underground labyrinths became the last refuge of several people, a series of deaths led to the closure of underground tunnels for general use. </p><p>  This served as a source for the creation of the legend of a mermaid living at the bottom of the lake and drawing young beautiful young men into her “nets”.  However, scientists attribute such tragic cases to the strong undercurrent, which can sometimes create whirlpools in tunnels. </p><p>  One of the underground sights is the recently discovered geological monument - a huge stalagmite, which, according to scientists, is an ancient karst formation.  It is located at a depth of 105 m, near the entrance to the underground cave.  This discovery refuted the version of many scientists about the recent date of the formation of the Mediterranean Sea, because stalagmites are formed only on land. </p><div class="photo" data-original="spyroskollas.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Underwater world" class="if uuid-3015916" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46001/3015916.jpg"></div><h2>  Town of Vouliagmeni </h2><p>  Geographically, Lake Vouliagmeni is part of the municipal region of Vari-Vula-Vouliagmeni, which was created in 1935 with a population of about 10 thousand inhabitants.

Of the 34 columns, only 15 are now preserved. </p><p>  The choice of the place of its construction - at Cape Sunio - was due to the fact that it was here that, according to ancient legends, King Aegean jumped from a rock, giving his name to the Aegean Sea.  For many centuries, the temple served as the first symbol of the house for Greek sailors sailing to Athens. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.grecotel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt=".Poseidon Temple" class="if uuid-3015881" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46001/3015881.jpg"></div><p>  In the vicinity of Vouliagmeni, curious travelers can also visit Argolida, where the ancient Greek theater Epidaurus has been preserved.
