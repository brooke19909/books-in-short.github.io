    <p>  First entry: "Suzdal, year 1024."  The city suffered a severe drought, which led to crop failure and famine.  In already Orthodox Russia, loyal worshipers of idols - pagans - still remained here.  They took the problem of lack of food as a sign and raised a rebellion, showing their dissatisfaction with the departure from the faith. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To solve the internal problem, the Grand Duke of Kiev himself arrived - Yaroslav the Wise.  He did not begin to kindle the fire of hostility and, as always, acted deliberately and rationally.  Just bought a lot of bread and distributed to the population.  The problem was resolved; there was no reason for further unrest. </p><p>  This is not to say that the history of Suzdal was simple: epidemics, fires, ruins, captured by enemy nations.  However, he retained his best features and today happily reveals them to tourists. </p><h2>  Sights of Suzdal </h2><p>  The first interest in the city appeared in the seventies.  Tourists gathered here, admiring and marveling at a beautiful picturesque place.  After all, <span>Suzdal</span> has <span>attractions</span> that can be called primitive, historically valuable. </p><p>  Today the city has become a huge museum, reserve, a real treasury of Russia. </p><p>  Another distinguishing feature is the holidays.  The authorities, entrepreneurs and museum workers of the city made a lot of efforts, but achieved incredible success. </p>

Almost all the buildings are collected in different parts of the country, but they all perfectly reflect the true history and life. </p><h2>  The Wax Museum </h2><p>  On the Kremlin street you can see an unremarkable building of the nineteenth century, but its contents are fascinating and even slightly scary.

    <p>  Our contemporaries took a step further.  Today, the city of Suzdal stores wax figures that are not just similar to their originals.  They are immersed in the small world of celebrities.  Special clothes, interiors, decorations - all this makes the images complete. </p><h2>  Posadsky house </h2><p>  A variety of monasteries of Suzdal are popular with tourists.  On the territory of one of them, Spaso-Efremovsky, the Posadsky house is located. </p><p>  It differs from other structures of the city.  Elongated sharp back roof, carved shutters.  The house is made like its wooden counterparts, but its main material is stone.  This happened due to historical events.  Residents of the city, engaged in trade, gradually began to grow rich and build more reliable and expensive houses. </p><p>  The building became a museum only in the seventies.  Today, the interior creates the impression that they still live in the house, and the owner only temporarily absented. </p><p>  The interior has preserved such furniture details as built-in benches, carved tables, cabinets covered with oil paint. </p><p>  It can be seen that the museums of Suzdal are distinguished by historical notes.  Those who want to get acquainted with the life and living conditions of the 9-11th century will be able to get a lot of impressions and touch the history. </p>

    <h2>  Suzdal Kremlin </h2><p>  Many buildings of the city are rooted in antiquity.  Suzdal has kept its lively and interesting history.  Sights hide it in themselves and pass it on to a new generation.  One such place is the Kremlin. </p><p>  In its present place many centuries ago a city was born.  <span>There is no</span> known date for the first settlements.  Various scientists and archaeologists put forward versions about the appearance of buildings in the 10th or 12th century. </p><p>  If you have chosen the Golden Ring of Russia for a tourist trip, Suzdal should definitely be included in your itinerary. </p><p>  Its Kremlin has many historical exhibits that attract the attention of visitors and arouse keen interest.

    <h2>  Spaso-Euthymius Monastery </h2><p>  The northern part of the city, the left bank - here is another famous place.  The Transfiguration Monastery was once renamed the Euthymius Monastery.  That was the name of the first abbot. </p><p>  Initially, the buildings were made of wood, but to this day they have not reached.  Today, tourists can watch the architectural structures created in the early 17th century.  The construction of such white-stone churches required a lot of funds, which were collected by the efforts of the nobility. </p><p>  The monasteries of Suzdal keep many cathedrals.  One of the most noteworthy is the Transfiguration of the Savior. </p><p>  Once it was one of the best fortresses in Vladimir land.  The monastery is surrounded by a huge stone wall, the height of which is more than a thousand meters.  Twelve towers with loopholes.  They are noticeable from afar and clearly stand out from the general background. </p><h2>  Pokrovsky convent </h2><p>  In addition to museum objects, the city of Suzdal has places that work to this day.  For example, the existing <span>convent,</span> called Pokrovsky. </p><p>  It appeared in 1936, and the peak of prosperity came during the reign of Basil III.  At the beginning of the fifteenth century, everything in it underwent a complete reconstruction by order of the king.  So the Cathedral of the Protection of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the Gate Church of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared. </p><p>  The novice of the monastery was the king‚Äôs wife, who for many years of marriage could not give the country an heir.  Even the rulers could not divorce in those days.  Rather, even such a concept did not exist.  That is why, by the order of her husband, Solomonia passed the tonsure and became a novice Sofia.  From this moment she did not leave the cloister.  And after death, her body rested in the church. </p>
