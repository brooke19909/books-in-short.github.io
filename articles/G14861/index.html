    <h2>  Plunge into history </h2><p>  Do you want to know what kind of fabric is gabardine?  Reviews indicate that its feature determines the method of weaving of threads.  Who owns the secret of making gabardine?  The development technique belongs to the Englishman Thomas Barbery at the end of the XIX century.

Even in his youth, he was often sick due to constant English rains.  The guy so wanted to plunge into the clothes, warming and saving from them.  As an adult, Barbury brought his dream to life.  He opened several shops and factories for the manufacture of outerwear.  The basis for the production of gabardine was <span>merino wool</span> from an Asian goat.  This soft and fine wool was impregnated with a water-repellent composition and interwoven with a diagonal weave, which is also called "ribbed".  In the photo above you can observe these scars, as well as see what kind of fabric is gabardine.  Reviews indicate the high quality of this material. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thomas later patented his invention, and production of gabardine material began.  For the name, the French word Gabardine was taken for a reason, so in the Middle Ages clothes for wet weather were called.  The coloring of four shades became especially popular: black, red, white, beige.  Such <span>checkered fabric</span> made the Burberry brand famous. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gabardine fabric description reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42358/2013339.jpg" width="600"></div>
