    <p>  In public places, vacationers have the opportunity to use free internet.  The hotel features a spa, dry cleaning, laundry and a beauty salon.  There are three restaurants, several bars and an Internet cafe for tourists.  At the reception there is a left-luggage office, which vacationers can use.  The complex has a very small, but at the same time very well-groomed and clean area. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The hotel is designed for families, it is located in a quiet place. </p><h2>  Sports and Entertainment </h2><p>  As for entertainment, their choice at Jomtien Palm Beach Hotel is not so huge, but still they are.

For tourists there is a karaoke club and a gym (his visit is included in the price).  A variety of water activities await vacationers on the beach. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The lucky location of the Jomtien Palm Beach Hotel Resort is one of the hotel's main strengths.  The complex is located on the first line from the sea, only the road separates it from the coast.  To get to the beach, tourists spend no more than two minutes.

Should I recommend Jomtien Palm <span>Beach Hotel Resort 4 * to</span> vacationers and what services does it provide? </p><p>  The main advantage of the hotel complex is its convenient location.  Not every hotel can boast such a close distance to the sea.  It is worth noting that Jomtien <span>Palm Beach Resort 4 *</span> is located in an area with developed infrastructure, therefore, next to the hotel there is everything that tourists need: shops, bars, restaurants, a market, an ATM and all kinds of entertainment.  The hotel is a bit far from the city center, you can get to it by tuk-tuk, which are very many near the entrance to the building. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jomtien palm beach hotel resort" class="if" height="312" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1798882.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Jomtien Palm Beach Hotel is a modern complex consisting of two high-rise buildings connected by a passage.  The number of rooms in the two buildings is slightly different, so you should pay attention to booked rooms if you have any special requests.  The most popular among tourists are Superior rooms.  They have a standard design and ordinary equipment.  According to tourists, the furniture and some elements of the decor of the rooms have traces of scuffs, but the plumbing is working properly, although not very new.  The rooms are not air conditioned.  At the moment, it is worth paying attention if the presence of an air conditioner is a prerequisite for you.  Unfortunately, in all apartments of the hotel there are no balconies and terraces, this is not very convenient, since wet beach items must be dried daily at the beach resort.  As a compensation, a rope is stretched in the bathroom, which can be used as a dryer. </p><p>  Superior rooms are quite spacious, they have everything that guests need.  Every day, maids leave bottles of drinking water, even if you have not yet run out of supplies.  Tea and coffee in the rooms are provided free of charge as a compliment from the hotel.  But for using the minibar you have to pay. </p><p>  Apartments are cleaned daily at Jomtien Palm Beach Hotel Resort, as is towels.  Bed linen is also changing according to the schedule - once every three days.  Regarding the quality of the work of the maids, some tourists complain.  As a rule, guests try to tip staff for cleaning, although this is not a prerequisite. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel jomtien palm beach" class="if" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1798884.jpg" width="475"></div>

    <p>  Not all rooms have a view of the sea coast, if this issue is of principle to you, then it is worth clarifying all the nuances when booking, since replacing apartments at the reception will cost money.  For any improvement in housing conditions, hotel employees offer to pay a surcharge. </p><p>  In general, the room fund of Jomtien Palm Beach Hotel 4 * is good for a quiet and relaxing holiday. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  Jomtien Palm Beach Resort offers different dining options.  According to guests, breakfast in the main restaurant is quite acceptable.  The restaurant hall is divided into two parts.  One serves European dishes, while the second has Thai and Japanese food for numerous Chinese tourists.  In principle, there is no strict separation, so you can choose any meal you like for breakfast. </p><p>  According to tourists, the assortment of food on the tables can not be called very large, but it is also impossible to stay hungry, you can always pick up something suitable.  Of the fruits, watermelons and pineapples are usually offered. </p><p>  The hotel is in a convenient location as there are numerous restaurants and cafes nearby where tourists can eat.  Living on the first line from the sea, you don’t need to worry about food at all, because in such places there is always a large selection of food establishments.  In addition, a ten-minute walk from Jomtien Palm Beach 4 * (Pattaya) there is a market that sells a variety of vegetables and deliciously delicious fruits.  Food is also prepared here, but not all tourists risk eating on the street.  Experienced travelers nevertheless recommend eating in appropriate establishments in order to avoid unpleasant consequences.  The fact is that in Thailand, rats are frequent guests on the streets, so you should not risk your health and rest, neglecting basic safety rules. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  Jomtien Palm Beach (Pattaya) is one of the most popular and sought-after attractions among our tourists.  It is focused on family vacations, but among the guests there are pensioners and young people.  The calm atmosphere of the complex is appreciated by all those who seek to find a quiet place for a good rest.  The main contingent of tourists is Russian and Chinese tourists.  The complex was built at the very beginning of the promenade, across the road from the city beach.  The hotel administration offers its guests a fairly large selection of apartments, among which there are rooms of different categories, as well as a good level of service and good food.  The affordable prices of the resort annually attract thousands of new tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jomtien palm beach hotel resort 4" class="if" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1798889.jpg" width="475"></div>

    <p>  Over the years, the hotel has found its regular customers who regularly come to Jomtien Palm Beach.  Guest reviews of the complex (mostly positive) are the best indicators of the work of its staff.  Along with many advantages, the hotel has some disadvantages.  However, they are not so significant as to spoil the positive impression of staying at the hotel. </p><p>  The attentive and pleasant staff of the complex deserves special praise.  Unfortunately, the reception staff do not understand English well, but they don’t know Russian at all.  On duty can be explained on duty phrases.  However, when there is a need to explain something, problems arise because the knowledge of workers is limited to a standard set of words.  The most resourceful tourists have adapted to use the Google translator on their gadgets to communicate with staff. </p><p>  The lack of free internet in the rooms can be attributed to the disadvantages of the hotel.  If you want to chat with relatives, you can only do this in public areas of the hotel.  You can also purchase a local operator card to access the Internet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jomtien palm beach resort 4" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1799074.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The guests of the complex express their admiration for the beautiful swimming pool surrounded by greenery and equipped with waterfalls and fountains.  For kids there is a small private pond.  In general, the hotel is comfortable enough to relax with children.  Of course, there are no entertainment events and children's clubs, as in the hotels of Egypt and Turkey, but the complex has a closed territory, which is not allowed outsiders. </p><h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  Experienced tourists recommend not limited to beach vacations, but certainly visit local attractions.  Thailand is an amazing country with an interesting culture and traditions that deserve close attention from the guests of the country. </p><p>  Tourists can book sightseeing trips at the hotel reception.  Vacationers do not recommend spending time on sightseeing trips around the resort, although they are free, they are focused on shopping.  In Pattaya, there are a lot of historical attractions, amusement parks and simply interesting places worth visiting. </p><p>  Acquaintance with the resort should begin with cultural and historical monuments.  One of them is the Big Buddha, located on a hilltop.  There are also observation platforms where you can admire the stunning landscape of the city and take beautiful photos as a keepsake. </p><p>  An interesting monument is the Temple of Truth, which has been under construction for 32 years.  It is believed that it should be erected without a single nail.  In fact, nails are used in construction, but they are only half clogged so that they can be removed before the construction is completed.  Many already doubt that the temple will be completed, because over the long years of its construction, many parts have gradually become unusable and need restoration. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pattaya jomtien palm beach" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1798896.jpg" width="475"></div>

It occupies more than 250 ha.  On its territory you can see stunning sculptures created from flower pots with plants.  Nong Nooch is not just a botanical garden, it is a whole complex of figuratively trimmed plants.  The park was created as a prototype of the famous Versailles gardens.  In order to go around it and see all the compositions, not a whole day will be enough.  In addition to the stunning vegetation, here you can see an interesting show of elephants playing volleyball and football. </p><h2>  Resort Attractions </h2><p>  Many tourists who come to Pattaya tend to plunge into its nightlife.  The adult entertainment center is located on the famous Walking Street, which after six in the evening turns into a bright alley of colorful lights.  There are restaurants, bars and clubs inviting to sex shows.  Pattaya is famous all over the world for transvestite shows.  Musical performances are delivered with great skill, they use modern lighting and music technologies.  The highlight of the performances are professional transvestite actors.  A vibrant music show is striking in its colors and dynamism. </p><p>  For couples, a visit to the water park will be an interesting adventure filled with amazing experiences.

Adults will certainly appreciate the complex with a jacuzzi and sauna, as well as a fitness center.  The entertainment complex also has a go-kart center equipped with freeways for beginners. </p><p>  A relatively new attraction of the resort is the floating market.  It began to function only in 2008.  The market is small in comparison with similar ground places.  However, he takes the first place among the world water markets.  Residential water village is a center with entertainment, shops and restaurants.  Here lovers of shopping and entertainment will certainly enjoy it. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  If you plan to spend your holidays in Pattaya and are looking for a good hotel on the coast of the resort, then you can pay attention to Jomtien Palm Beach.
