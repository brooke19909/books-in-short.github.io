The time of domination in the country of the only political force - the Hungarian Socialist Workers Party.  But there was also the first Hungarian republic, however, which did not last long.  Western historiography dubbed it like this: Hungarian Democratic Republic of 1918-1919.  The article briefly describes the history of Hungarian statehood in the 20th century. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hungarian People's Republic" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55362/2189977.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Hungarian People's Republic of 1918-1919 </h2><p>  Hungary was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which suffered a defeat in the First World War.  This could not but affect the mood in society.  The bulk of the people saw the causes of their troubles in the monarchy.  Therefore, the <span>bourgeois-democratic revolution</span> was the logical conclusion of the accumulated socio-economic contradictions. </p><p>  On November 16, 1918, a new state appeared on the world political map - the Hungarian People's Republic.  This became possible after the King of Hungary Charles 1 renounced power.  Count Mihai Caroly (in some sources of Karayi) became the president of the newly formed state. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Communist Party of Hungary was not satisfied with the results of the rise to power of the bourgeoisie.  Having good chances of victory (it was supported by the vast majority of soldiers, the proletariat, part of the peasantry), she took real steps to prepare the socialist revolution.  At the first stage, control of workers over production was established.  The Social Democrats in such conditions were thinking about a possible alliance with the Communists. </p><p>  The Entente intervened in the situation, complicating the position of the socialists.  The victorious countries in an ultimatum form demanded the rejection of part of the Hungarian territory under the plausible pretext of protecting the interests of national minorities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hungarian People's Republic 1918 1919" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55362/2189978.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Socialist revolution </h2><p>  The state no longer had its own army.  Around reigned political and economic collapse.  To withstand the threat of occupation under such conditions, consolidation was needed.  The Social Democrats by their decision to unite with the Communists received all the fullness of power.  The government of Carolla had no choice but to resign.  The government has changed, as well as the name of the country.  In fact, this was the end of the Hungarian People's Republic (1918-1919).  The main authority in the Hungarian Soviet Republic was the Revolutionary Government Council. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Second Hungarian Republic </h2><p>  The USSR inflicted a crushing defeat on fascist Germany and its allies, including Hungary.  Now the territory was controlled by Soviet troops.  Independent elections of the <span>coalition government</span> were held with the intervention of the Soviet side.  The bottom line was that the Communists held key posts. </p><p>  The year 1947 was marked by the holding of regular elections.  The Communists of Hungary, with the support of the Soviet army, simply arrested all dissenters.  Date - 08/18/1949, marked by the advent of the new Constitution in Hungary.  According to her, the presidency was abolished, and the name of the country changed.  The Hungarian People's Republic reappeared. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hungarian People's Republic photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/2190642.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  1956 uprising </h2><p>  Hungary began to intensively build a socialist lifestyle in the country.  Repression, terror, collectivization, the expulsion of the bourgeoisie from the cities, the post-war disruption, the need to pay indemnities to the victorious countries - all this complicated the life of ordinary citizens. </p><p>  The political leadership of the country had no choice but to drift within the framework of the course that was approved by Moscow.  This provoked anti-Soviet sentiment, which later grew into an uprising (1956), led by Hungarian Prime Minister Imre Nadim. </p><p>  However, it was severely suppressed.  The photo of the Hungarian People‚Äôs Republic of that period captures the terrible facts of atrocities on both sides: public executions and torture of the Communists.  Events in Hungary made us think in the Kremlin.  This was the first bell - the European communist system was crumbling.  Unity was maintained only thanks to Soviet bayonets. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hungarian People's Republic 1949 1989" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/2190591.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  The collapse of socialism in Hungary </h2><p>  In all areas of the Hungarian People's Republic (1949-1989), key changes took place after the Hungarian Labor Party came to power (later, after the 1956 uprising, the name changed to the Hungarian Socialist Workers Party).  The judicial, administrative system and self-government bodies underwent reforms. </p><p>  The censorship was liberal, and the citizens of this country could travel abroad without obstacles.  By socialist standards, the Hungarian People's Republic was quite successful.  There was practically no knowledge of the shortage of goods - the USSR provided comprehensive support to its ally. </p><p>  By the end of the 80s, the European socialist bloc began to crumble.  Socialism peacefully surrendered its positions in all countries of the Warsaw Pact.  One-party systems were canceled.  These were the first attempts to gain sovereignty and recognition of democratic values. </p>
