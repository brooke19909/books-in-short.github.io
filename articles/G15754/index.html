How many commemorative coins are "10 rubles"?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Collecting coins of Russian production with a face value of ten rubles began its development relatively recently.  The debut issue of money of such value in the new century started in 2000.  The first coin was dedicated to the 55th anniversary of the Victory.  The main feature is the reverse, which depicts the event, the subject, the inscription related to any event.  There are various types of commemorative coins of 10 rubles.  Since then, a huge number of people have been collecting this kind of money, not only in Russia but also abroad. </p><h2>  The main nuances </h2><p>  By tradition, among all the episodes that have been released, there are rare specimens considered the real pride of any numismatist and publicly accessible collection items.  It is worth noting that not all ‚Äúchervonets‚Äù belong to the category of <span>‚Äúexpensive coins‚Äù.</span>  10 rubles anniversary in most cases have a price not much higher than face value. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="expensive coins 10 rubles anniversary" class="if" height="285" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/36446/878433.jpg" width="577"></div>  All of them are made of base metal, and the very first are called bimetal.  This "name" was obtained for the use of two materials during production.

    <h2>  Materials of manufacture </h2><p>  Since <span>2011,</span> a separate series <span>has</span> appeared, completely made of steel: the golden edging has disappeared, and the main property has become the visual luster of the specimen, not subject to wear, like earlier types.  The color scheme contains mainly two tones - yellow and white.  In the future, monochromatic ‚Äúchervontsy‚Äù began to appear.  At the same time, the main feature distinguishing 10 rubles is anniversary, the price of which depends not on the material of manufacture, but on the year of manufacture and the event or object depicted on the reverse, is the variety of series and ongoing production. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="types of commemorative coins 10 rubles" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/36446/878419.jpg" width="440"></div>  In addition, it should be noted that the production process has been launched at two mints - St. Petersburg and Moscow.

The list was supplemented by a coin dedicated to the first flight into space of Gagarin.  It was minted on the back with an inscription on the 40th anniversary of the event.  The quantitative circulation remained unchanged.  Since 2002, the production of individual collections has become serial.  During this period, several individual collections are assembled at once, united by one symbol: the ‚ÄúMinistry of the Russian Federation‚Äù (created on the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the founding of the first institution of this type in the country) and the ‚ÄúAncient Cities‚Äù.  In the first case, seven coins were issued: </p><ul><li>  Military establishment; </li><li>  Ministry of Foreign Affairs; </li><li>  Justice Ministry; </li><li>  Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia; </li><li>  Ministry of Finance; </li><li>  Ministry of Economic Development and Trade (economic development and trade); </li><li>  Ministry of Education. </li></ul><p>  Each of them was produced in the amount of five million pieces and contained two metals - cupronickel and brass.  It is worth noting that both mints of the country were engaged in manufacturing: three were minted in Moscow, four were minted in St. Petersburg.  The series "Ancient Cities" of 2002 included three coins: </p><ul><li>  Derbent </li><li>  Staraya Russa; </li><li>  Kostroma. </li></ul><p>  The composition and number of copies did not differ from the collection of ministries of the same period.  It is interesting that the question of how much the jubilee 10 rubles cost with cities of the ancient type excites the public the most and generates a lot of rumors about fabulous prices.  In fact, due to the huge number of copies made, it rarely exceeds ten times the face value, despite the time elapsed from the date of issue. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Collections 2003-2005 </h2><p>  In terms of duplication and composition of base metals, the copies of 2003 have not changed.  During this billing period, only four coins with a face value of ten rubles were issued.  They belonged to the "Ancient cities": </p><ul><li>  Pskov; </li><li>  Dorogobuzh; </li><li>  Murom; </li><li>  Kasimov. </li></ul><p>  It is worth noting that only the third option was created by the forces of the capital's mint.  In 2004, three more copies from the same collection appeared: </p><ul><li>  Dmitrov; </li><li>  Kem; </li><li>  Ryazhsk. </li></ul><p>  2005 was already more eventful: a new direction appeared - ‚ÄúRussian Federation‚Äù, another commemorative coin (60th anniversary of the Victory) and the collection ‚ÄúAncient Cities‚Äù continued. </p>

    <ul><li>  Leningrad region; </li><li>  Tver and Oryol region; </li><li>  Tatarstan </li><li>  Krasnodar region; </li><li>  Moscow. </li></ul><p>  Reflecting on how much the jubilee 10 rubles cost with the cities of 2005, we can say that they do not have great value and are not out of the general row.  During this period, the collection replenished with four cities: </p><ul><li>  Kaliningrad </li><li>  Borovsk; </li><li>  Kazan; </li><li>  Mtsensk. </li></ul><h2>  2006-2008 Collection </h2><p>  The serial direction "Russian Federation" in 2006 continued, having received five coins: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  <span>Chita region</span> ; </li><li>  Primorsky Krai; </li><li>  Yakutia; </li><li>  Altai Republic; </li><li>  Sakhalin region. </li></ul><p>  The collection "Ancient Cities" was supplemented by three copies: </p><ul><li>  Belgorod; </li><li>  Torzhok; </li><li>  Kargopol. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how much are anniversary 10 rubles with cities" class="if" height="223" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/36446/878494.jpg" width="225"></div></li></ul><p>  The next year, the release continued with the only change - the RF series consisted of six pieces: </p><ul><li>  The Republic of Khakassia; </li><li>  Arkhangelsk and Lipetsk region; </li><li>  Bashkiria; </li><li>  Rostov and Novosibirsk region. </li></ul><p>  The collection "10 rubles, commemorative coins" Cities of Antiquity "- of three: </p><ul><li>  Great Ustyug; </li><li>  Gdov; </li><li>  Vologda. </li></ul><p>  In 2008, both series were replenished with four coins: </p><ul><li>  ‚ÄúRussian Federation‚Äù - Astrakhan and Sverdlovsk Region, Udmurt Republic, Kabardino-Balkaria; </li><li>  "Ancient cities" - Vladimir, Azov, Priozersk, Smolensk. </li></ul><h2>  Collection 2009-2011 </h2><p>  The tendency to issue coins of the two series continued in 2009: </p><ul><li>  ‚ÄúRF‚Äù - the Republic of Kalmykia, Kirov Region, EAO (Jewish), Komi, Adygea; </li><li>  ‚ÄúDG‚Äù - Kaluga, Vyborg, Novgorod, Galich. </li></ul><p>  In 2010, the collection of "Ancient Cities" brought two more copies to its piggy bank - Bryansk and Yuryevets.  But the ‚ÄúRussian Federation‚Äù has undergone changes in circulation, as the ten millionth production has decreased significantly: </p><ul><li>  Yamalo-Nenets (Yamal-Nenets) and Chechnya - one hundred thousand each; </li><li>  Perm Territory - two hundred thousand; </li><li>  NAO (Nenets) - a little less than two million. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="10 rubles anniversary price" class="if" height="307" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/36446/878486.jpg" width="320"></div></li></ul><p>  In addition, a coin was made dedicated to the census of the Russian population (2.3 million copies) and the 65th anniversary of the Victory (10 million).  In the latter case, the composition of the material has changed: steel coated with brass-galvanic paint was used.  This composition began to be applied in 2011 in a new direction - ‚ÄúCities of Military Glory‚Äù.  There were eight such coins: </p><ul><li>  Yelnya; </li><li>  Kursk; </li><li>  Eagle; </li><li>  Belgorod; </li><li>  Vladikavkaz; </li><li>  Rzhev </li><li>  Malgobek; </li><li>  Dace. </li></ul><p>  The old collections received two copies each: Voronezh Oblast and Buryatia (‚ÄúRF‚Äù);  Elets with Solikamsk ("DG").  There was also a commemorative coin dedicated to the 50th anniversary of Gagarin's conquest of space, created using the technology of the GVS series. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="anniversary 10 rubles list" class="if" height="298" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/36446/878462.jpg" width="600"></div>  It is worth noting that since this year the question of how much the jubilee 10 rubles cost with cities has acquired a double meaning, as the country's settlements depicted on a coin were divided into two different serial production: ‚ÄúAncient cities‚Äù and ‚ÄúCities of military glory‚Äù .

    <h2>  2012-2015 </h2><p>  Since 2012, <span>mints</span> began to reformat the issue in favor of the GVS series.  This is especially true of the material of manufacture.  Now almost all new specimens had a steel base <span>coated</span> with <span>a brass-galvanic</span> type.  This time, 10 rubles are jubilee, the price of which has practically not changed with the transition to another type of production, primarily due to the high circulation, replenished with only one coin of the ‚ÄúAncient Cities‚Äù.  It was Belozersk.  It can also be noted that the "Cities of Military Glory" annually receive eight new copies.  During this four-year period, several collections were launched, dedicated to significant historical events: </p><ol><li>  Victory over Napoleon. </li><li>  Anniversary dates dedicated to the confrontation with Hitler. </li><li>  Sports achivments. </li><li>  10 rubles anniversary "Crimea", dedicated to the return of the peninsula to the Russian Federation. </li><li>  Commemorative coins in honor of the statehood of the country. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Price variation of "urban" series </h2><p>  Any amateur numismatist who is about to start collecting ‚Äúchervontsy‚Äù in the recent history of Russia, wonders how much the jubilee 10 rubles with cities cost.  To date, the cost of such coins does not exceed 200 rubles.  The highest price depends on a few details: </p><ol><li>  Material of manufacture (first bimetallic specimens are cheaper). </li><li>  Year of production (the sooner the more expensive). </li><li>  A specific series ("Ancient cities" is traditionally more valuable than "GVS"). </li></ol><p>  Otherwise, both collections are classified as public coins. </p>
