Why it happened is still unclear.  As for the resort‚Äôs public, unlike Goa, the Russian population prevails in this area, not the foreign population. </p><p>  This is reflected in many factors, primarily in pricing, which is usually 2-3 times higher there than in other places of mass recreation.  Nevertheless, if you show some patience, you can easily find for yourself the best option, suitable for the price level and quality of service.  Morjim boasts the presence of several high-level Russian restaurants Glavfish and Tchaikovsky, which is named after the great composer. </p><p>  There are many hotel complexes near the coast of Morjim.  The most popular among tourists is the hotel La Conceicao Annexure 2 *.  Photos, descriptions and reviews of tourists about the hotel will be given in this article. </p><h2>  general information </h2>

    <p>  Russian holidaymakers of the resort will really like the magnificent beach with white sand and the most convenient access to the calm sea, which, by the way, is the cleanest and warmest here.  Depth does not begin immediately, and tides are very rare.  Families with little tots will definitely like this.  What is a little strange is the fact that this beach corner is never overpopulated by vacationers, which makes the rest as calm and measured as possible. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Morning is considered the most suitable time to visit this beach, since at that time there is still no that scorching, destructive heat, which prevents you from fully enjoying all the splendor of the surrounding landscape and climate.  In the south direction is the Chapora River, which gradually flows into the depths of the sea. <br>  This place is famous among a huge number of tourists for the fact that, starting in February, all turtles living in the sea regularly come here who wish to leave offspring by laying eggs.  Due to the fact that this place has the status of a nature reserve, there are even security stations deployed there. </p><h2>  Location Features </h2>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  All travelers have different attitudes towards India.  Most of those who are used to comfortable conditions of the European level do not want to visit this country.  This is justified.  In India, particularly in Goa, everything is not as fabulous as tour operators can talk about it.  Nevertheless, there is that unique atmosphere for the sake of which thousands of tourists with wealth and without it go to conquer the vastness of India. </p><p>  Hotel La Conceicao Annexure 2 * (Morjim) is designed for budget travelers.  But the conditions here for two stars are not so bad.  Like any hotel complex, this hotel has its advantages and disadvantages. </p><h2>  Main advantages </h2><ol><li>  The hotel is new, all the equipment works well, freshly renovated, nice design of the rooms. </li><li>  Close proximity to the beach. </li><li>  The sea is warm and very clean. </li><li>  The hotel is ideal for a quiet measured rest. </li><li>  In the complex itself and near it there are many places where you can have a tasty meal. </li></ol><h2>  Minuses </h2><ol><li>  Air conditioners do not work very well. </li><li>  Not very convenient to get to.  From the airport you must first go by bus, then by car. </li><li>  The hotel is a bit far from civilization. </li></ol><h2>  Beach vacation </h2>

    <p>  For those who love the beach and the sea, it is definitely worth choosing the La Conceicao Annexure 2 * hotel.  Reviews of <span>Morjim Beach</span> indicate that this is simply an amazing coast.  It was because of him that the small village of the same name became such a popular resort, especially among Russian tourists.  The azure waters of the Arabian Sea simply envelop in its warmth. </p><p>  From the hotel to the beach just a stone's throw.  The road is a picturesque alley with tropical vegetation. </p><p>  The length of the beach is several kilometers.  The sandy coastline with a shallow bottom is ideal for a comfortable swim with young children.  The coast is shallow, truly deep only after 50 meters.  There are practically no people on the beach, perhaps this impression is created due to its huge size. </p><p>  The coastline is quite wide.  Sometimes there are tides, and then part of the coast goes under water.  For this reason, sun loungers and umbrellas are at a decent distance from the coast.  There are also numerous cafes, near which there are also sunbeds.  To use them for free, you can order something, but this is not necessary.  Hindus are a very friendly people, they do not persecute anyone and do not swear. </p><p>  Along the coast you can see placers of stones of different sizes.  There are always a lot of people, and sometimes even spend holidays. </p><p>  Morjim is best served in winter.  In December, the water in the sea is the warmest, but sometimes there are small waves.  On the beach you can meet only foreign tourists.  Locals do not bathe, but work very hard.  Merchants with various goods constantly ply along the beach. </p><p>  On the beach you can find various animals, they come here for a walk.  Cows walk in herds, dogs constantly run.  But this does not bother tourists, but, on the contrary, touches. </p><p>  Among the shortcomings, it can be noted that the part of the beach that relates to the hotel is not cleaned very well.  There is a lot of garbage in the sand, sometimes it swims in the water.  But this is rather a problem not of staff, but of tourists who do not bother to clean up after themselves. </p><h2>  General impressions </h2>

    <p>  The main criterion for evaluating the hotel La Conceicao Annexure 2 * (Morjim) is the customer reviews.  The opinion about the rest here is not unambiguously good for everyone, but for the most part, tourists speak positively about this complex. </p><p>  The hotel service is decent, but the staff need to be monitored and clearly state their wishes.  Nearby there are many cafes with nice prices.  The food is very tasty, it is felt that they are prepared with love.  Drinks are almost always diluted, if you do not say in advance that they do not put ice and do not add water. </p><p>  The hotel is represented by apartments of various categories.  But even to afford a suite here can afford a person with an average level of income.  Moreover, there is no point in spending a lot of time in the room, because behind the windows there are such amazing landscapes.  Free time can be spent on the beautiful beach or go on a tour.  The hotel can suggest a good route and provide information on available attractions. </p><p>  From 7 am on the beach, fishermen sort out their catch.  You can buy seafood from them at good prices.  Here, on the beach, in any cafe, they will prepare it for you as you wish.  It‚Äôs worth all the penny. </p><p>  India is an ideal place for a winter holiday.  Beautiful beaches, warm sea, gentle sun and tropical fruits - all this is available to tourists in the coldest months of the year.  This resort is famous for its affordable prices.  In Europe, for the money you can only relax in cheap hostels, but in no European country can you find such color and exoticism as in Goa. </p>
