Only in 1945 the country declared war on Germany and Japan.  <span>Turkish soldiers</span> did not take part in the hostilities.  In this article we will consider the internal situation of the country and diplomatic relations with other states in 1941 - 1945.  and try to determine the role of Turkey in World War II. </p><h2>  The situation of the country before the war </h2><p>  Before the Second World War, the signs of Turkey's orientation towards France and England, which had been outlined since the 1930s, turned into a steady trend.  An active supporter of this line was Foreign Minister Sarajoglu, who took office in 1938.  After Albania was occupied by Italy in April 1939, Great Britain gave Turkey guarantees of security and independence.  In October 1939, an Anglo-French-Turkish mutual assistance act was signed in Ankara.  At the same time, the country tried to maintain diplomatic relations with Germany.  So, on June 18, 1941, a non-aggression pact was signed between the powers.  In general, Turkey in the Second World War tacked between the two blocs, trying to maintain neutrality. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey in World War II" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33430/828694.jpg" width="368"></div>

She completely switched to a position of neutrality, without denying a supportive attitude towards England.  However, the defeat of France and the further military-political successes of Germany prompted the government to negotiate with the Nazi leadership.  They culminated in the signing of the treaty of friendship and non-aggression on June 18, 1941.  It should be noted that before that, Germany successfully occupied the <span>Balkan countries</span> and came close to the borders of Turkey.  At the same time, rumors circulated in Ankara about a possible military threat from the USSR. </p><p>  Thus, in 1940, Turkey’s participation in World War II was in question.  The government continued the policy of maneuvering, concluding agreements with the warring parties.  The Turkish position takes on a more definite character after the entry into the war of the Soviet Union. </p><h2>  Turkey in 1941 </h2><p>  June 22, 1941 Germany brought down a powerful blow to the USSR.  The largest state in the world was drawn into a military conflict.  After the outbreak of the German-Soviet <span>war, Turkey</span> passed on June 25, 1941 to the USSR government a note, which confirmed its neutrality.  Ankara continued to adhere to its commitments.  But over the following years, especially after the repressions of the USSR against the Muslim peoples of Crimea and the Caucasus, anti-Soviet sentiments intensified in Turkey. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey during World War II" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33430/828733.jpg" width="600"></div>

The army was constantly increasing in number (by 1942 it amounted to 1 million soldiers and officers).  By 1945, military spending “ate” about half of the country's budget.  Turkey during the Second World War experienced a decline in the economy, agriculture and culture.  This was due to mass mobilization and the introduction of bread cards in Ankara and Istanbul.  Cities were deprived of labor, and prices for the most necessary products were rising.  In 1942, a property tax was introduced, which was collected from owners of real estate and the income of entrepreneurs.  This led to a deepening financial crisis, which was associated with abuse of officials. </p><h2>  The political situation in the country </h2><p>  Turkey during the Second World War experienced a rise in nationalism - pan-Turkism.  This was reflected not only in the foreign policy plans of the elite, which concerned the USSR.  This was clearly manifested in the internal actions of the Turkish government, which turned to the ideology of pan-Turkism, proposed by the Young Turks and the updated concept of racism, developed by Nihal Atsyz. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey during the Second World War" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33430/828707.jpg" width="304"></div>

    <p>  From 1940 to 1945, martial law operated in vilayets (provinces where national minorities lived).  In this regard, unreasonable confiscation of property has often occurred here.  In 1942, the government formed by Shyukru Sarajoglu launched a wide-ranging campaign of patriotic propaganda in a pan-Turkic style. </p><h2>  The question of Turkey joining the war </h2><p>  Since 1943, the <span>anti-Hitler coalition</span> began to make efforts to enter into conflict on its side, Turkey.  Churchill was especially interested in this.  Turkey’s entry into the war would open the Second Front on the <span>Balkan Peninsula</span> and avoid the appearance of Soviet troops in this territory.  In the winter of 1943, the Adana Conference was held.  Churchill made every effort to get the Turkish president to abandon his position of neutrality.  But these negotiations were unsuccessful for either side.  Turkey continued to remain neutral in World War II.  However, the sympathies of the government were already on the side of Germany. </p><p>  In October 1943, representatives of the Allied countries gathered at a conference in Moscow.  They decided to get Turkey to abandon its neutrality by the end of the year.  This issue was also discussed at the Cairo and <span>Tehran conferences.</span>  However, Turkey stated that it was not ready to enter the war. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey's participation in World War II" class="if" height="438" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33430/828728.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Turkey at the final stage of the war </h2><p>  Turkey during the Second World War pursued a dual policy in relation to the rival powers.  In 1944, the Allies stopped supplying weapons to the country.  In this regard, the Turkish government was forced to abandon the export of chromium to Germany.  However, in June 1944 several German military vessels entered the Black Sea.  This led to an aggravation of the situation, and the Allies demanded that Turkey break off relations with Germany.  On August 2, all agreements on economic cooperation between the countries were terminated. </p><p>  In February 1945, the Yalta Conference began.  During the negotiations, the Allies decided that only those countries that opposed the anti-Hitler coalition could take part in the formation of the United Nations.  In this regard, February 23, 1945, Turkey declared war on Germany.  Despite the fact that her army did not participate in the hostilities, the country received an invitation to join the UN. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey's role in World War II" class="if" height="420" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33430/828753.jpg" width="595"></div>

    <h2>  Straits Discussion </h2><p>  After the war ended, the question of the Black Sea Straits began to be discussed at the <span>Potsdam Conference</span> .  During the discussions, an agreement was signed.  The straits were supposed to be under the control of Turkey and the USSR, as the most interested powers.  In addition, for the sake of their security and peace in the Black Sea region, they cannot allow the use of these routes by other states with hostile intentions. </p><h2>  The international situation of Turkey in the postwar years </h2><p>  After the war, a pro-Western orientation was clearly defined in Turkish politics.  So, wanting to demonstrate loyalty to the United States, the government of A. Menderes sent his brigade to Korea in July 1950.  Turkey became the only country in the Near and Middle East that participated in the war on the Korean Peninsula. </p><p>  In October 1951, the country joined NATO, and also signed treaties with Pakistan and Iraq.  Under the auspices of England and the United States in November 1955, a new military bloc was created - the Baghdad Pact (Great Britain, Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan).  In 1959, it was transformed into the Central Treaty Organization, whose headquarters was located in Ankara. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey participated in the Second World War" class="if" height="451" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33430/828778.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Thus, it is impossible to say for sure whether Turkey participated in the Second World War or not.  Officially, the country maintained a position of neutrality.  But the government was constantly inclined to cooperate with one or the other howling party.  Turkey renounced neutrality only in February 1945, but its army did not take part in hostilities. </p>
