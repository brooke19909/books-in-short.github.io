There are beautiful beaches, well-developed infrastructure and many comfortable, small, home-like hotels, called guest houses.  One of them is Angelina.  Vityazevo will give you not only a bright festive fun of the southern resort village, but also quiet peace of mind if you choose this wonderful guest house for your stay. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Angelina Vityazevo" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1513383.jpg" width="494"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Regarding the convenience of location, ‚ÄúAngelina‚Äù (Vityazevo) has a double assessment.  The address at this private hotel is such - Slavnaya street, building No. 22.  This is a very quiet area away from many tourist business facilities, and the street, one might say, is one of the most extreme in the village.  Behind it begins a sand dune.  That is, the location of this hotel will seem ideal for lovers of silence and will not like at all those who expect enchantingly bright fun from their vacation.  The village of Vityazevo from the geographical center of Anapa lies no more than 11 km.  Therefore, you can always easily get to the airport <span>.</span>  <span>D. Station</span> or any entertainment center.  Another feature - the village lies on the spit between the Black Sea and the large <span>estuary Vityazevsky.</span>  From "Angelina" to both approximately the same distance.  Therefore, tourists have the opportunity to spend time on any of these two reservoirs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  It is most convenient to travel by car to the Angelina Hotel.  Vityazevo is a beautiful village, but its transport system is not very developed.  In the summer, there are only 4 city bus and minibus routes.  None of them reach Slavnaya Street, so guests of Angelina Guest House will have to get to the center either by taxi or on foot to the bus stops. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Anapa Vityazevo" class="if" height="343" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1513384.jpg" width="498"></div>  You can also arrive at Angelina by public transport from Vityazevo Airport, located just 4 km from the village of the same name.  With w.  Anapa railway station, you can get to Vityazevo by bus, and from there take a taxi to the guest house.  You can also get to Angelina with a pre-ordered transfer.  It is provided to Anapa's transportation hubs for free, and to the Tunnelnaya station for a fee.  Also, the administration of the guest house, by agreement for a fee, provides a transfer to a pharmacy and some infrastructure facilities of the village.

The entrance to the sea is very smooth, the depth starts quite far from the water's edge.  For children, the rest is incomparable.  The sea in this part of Vityazevo is mostly calm and, starting in June, warm.  Waves are rare, but then the water becomes less transparent, and a lot of algae nails to the shore.  Of the entertainment on this beach, riding a banana, a catamaran, a tablet, water slides, and excursions to the sunken bulk carrier, completely hidden under water, are offered.  This beach is also liked by many vacationers because there is no crowding of people here, even in peak season. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Angelina Vityazevo address" class="if" height="362" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1513390.jpg" width="489"></div>
