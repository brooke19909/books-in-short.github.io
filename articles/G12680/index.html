Its production was carried out by Airbus.  It is intended for flights over medium and long distances.  This aircraft is equipped with two turbofan engines.  The first commercial flight was carried out on 01.11.1992 on the A 330-300 airliner.  Airplanes of this model, equipped with two turbojet engines, an arrow-shaped wing and with single-tail plumage, conquered the vast air transportation market. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt=" 330 " class="if" height="354" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13849/486004.jpg" title="a 330" width="600"></div>

    <p>  574 Airbus “A 330” models were ordered as of June 30, 2006. Of these, about 420 units were transferred to use.  At that time, there was the following distribution of the model options: </p><ul><li>  322 units for the “A 330-200”.  Of these, 227 were delivered. </li><li>  252 units for the “A 330-300”.  Of these, 191 were delivered. </li></ul><p>  Engine options: Pratt &amp; Whitney, <span>General Electric</span> or Rolls-Royce implemented in all models of "A 330".  This type of aircraft is the most sought after, and this is definitely a reliable fact.  The newest model for today is the A 330-300X.  In many ways, this is an improved version of the “A 330-300”. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  From the history of the development of this aircraft </h2><p>  In 1972, work began on this powerful airbus.  The project listed another liner model.  Namely - “A 300-B9”.  This version of the aircraft belonged to the class of wide-body equipment.  It was designed to transport 322 passengers.  The following year, work on this model was suspended.  Then the designers were given another target designation.  It consisted in the creation of a board that would have a greater number of seats compared to previously produced aircraft.  The plan for this development was renamed "A300-B11."  This project was distinguished by the presence of four turbojet bypass engines (turbofan engines).  This was a determining factor for carrying capacity.  In 1980, the current project was amended.  Now developed an aircraft having a common glider design.  As a result, in 1986, drawings were made of the world-famous A330 airbus.  However, official documents confirming the start of work are dated 1987. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt=" 330  " class="if" height="221" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13849/486002.jpg" title="a 330 plane" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The main task of designers and managers was to oust Boeing from the global market.  That was the main goal at that time.  And in 1992, the first A330-300 airbus with two turbofan engines was introduced to the public.  From his predecessors, he borrowed an elongated fuselage of the A 300 model and a cockpit from the A 320.  A couple of months later, the second A330 was launched.  After lengthy tests and flight tests, the model entered mass production in 1994. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  "A 330" (aircraft): scheme </h2><p>  This perfect device was created on the basis of advanced technologies.  “A 330” in its family of airbuses has a unique design, which was considered one of the most modern.

    <p>  The unique characteristics of the aircraft allow you to serve medium and long-distance airlines.  The presence of a comfortable cabin, the optimal ratio of payload to maximum flight range, full quality unification in the interior are the main advantages of this liner.  The airbus crew cabin “A 330” is the same as in the “A 340” and “A 330” models.  This was one of the general tasks of the consortium, which is aimed at the production of long-range aircraft.  Namely: “A 319”, “A 320”, “A 321”, “A 330”, “A340”.  They have a unified avionics complex and a common cockpit design for all modifications, which greatly facilitates the process of moving the pilot crew from one aircraft to another. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt=" 330 300 " class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13849/485998.jpg" title="a 330 300" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The implementation of the A 330 Airbus project is the first of its kind, an unprecedented program.  It aims to provide the right to various airlines to choose from various models of the specified equipment, which will fully ensure the satisfaction of the ever-changing need for the development of the respective fleets.  The presence of various configurations is an excellent tool that ensures the effective implementation of the necessary potential in the changing market conditions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt=" 330 300  " class="if" height="82" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13849/486006.jpg" title="a 330 300 aeroflot plane" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  A number of model variations: Airbus "A 330" </h2><p>  World statistics show that by the end of 2011, 830 aircraft of this class had flown into the sky.  Among them are military, passenger and cargo versions. </p><p>  There is the following list of Airbus A 330 class aircraft: </p><ul><li>  "A 330-100."  Model with a shortened fuselage.  It is considered not the most successful variation. </li><li>  "A 330-200."  This aircraft has a less bulky fuselage.  It is capable of transporting 253 people. </li><li>  "A 330-200F."  This is a cargo plane.  Able to lift 65 tons of cargo into the air.  Its flight range is up to 7.5 thousand km. </li><li>  "A 330-200HGW."  This is a passenger type airplane.  They began to release it in 2010. </li><li>  "A 330-300."  This type is based on the model "A 300".  The elongated fuselage is equipped with the “A 330-300” (aircraft).  Aeroflot, among other airlines, also widely operates this model.  Available in three variations.  Namely: the first (440 people), the second (335 people), the third (295 people) - passenger capacity differs. </li><li>  "A 330-300P2F."  This aircraft is intended for transportation of goods.  He is currently under development.  According to preliminary information, this model will carry up to 59 tons of payload. </li><li>  “A 330-MRTT / FSTA” and “A 330-KC-30”.  These models are military variations of tanker aircraft.  They accommodate and carry on board up to 110 tons of fuel. </li><li>  "A 330 MRTT."  This type is a refueling aircraft.  It is under development.  Potentially, this is a multifunctional transport class aircraft. </li></ul><h2>  Popular views </h2><p>  To date, the most reliable and safe liners are the A 330-300 and A 330-200 models.  These are popular variations.  They have comfortable salons, high fuel economy and powerful reliable engines.  This is an essential fact.  As for the cabin, it should be noted a convenient width between the seats, as well as chairs, in the backs of which are built high-quality monitors.  On their screens you can enjoy watching your favorite movies or play an exciting computer game.  On long-haul flights, excellent food is provided, passengers are served by polite and well-trained stewards and stewardesses.  The only thing that can be called a minus in these variations is the eleventh and twenty-ninth rows of this airliner are not equipped with lifting armrests. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="  330" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13849/486000.jpg" title="Airbus A 330" width="600"></div>
