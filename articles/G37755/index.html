Starting its unhurried run in the northwest in the dense forests of the Tver region, it slowly carries its waters to the Caspian Sea.  For centuries, this has been the main road linking vast lands.  Famous merchants walked on it.  They brought wood, furs, grain, fish to the rich northern fairs.  The coast developed and grew rich.  At the end of the 16th century, a watch fortress was built near the mouth of the Samara and Sok rivers on the banks of the Volga; the first large berth for transshipment of goods appeared. </p><div class="photo" data-original="chronograph.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Merchant berth" class="if uuid-2455033" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81643/2455033.jpg"></div><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The successful location of the fortress on the banks of the great river made it possible to control the vast territory of the middle reaches from Kazan to Astrakhan.  Gradually, merchants settled next to the service people.  Grew, expanded the new city of Samara.  Since the middle of the XIX century, it is already a provincial city, on the territory of which three major fairs were held annually.  The largest quantity of wheat was shipped through its berths.  Samara Marina was rightfully considered one of the best in Russia. </p><div class="photo" data-original="chronograph.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Old station" class="if uuid-2455035" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81643/2455035.jpg"></div><p>  But the city really began to develop when the Soviet government decided to develop an industrial zone on this territory.  The Volga made it possible to quickly transport large volumes of cargo, which was very important.  Passenger traffic developed.  In 1936, according to the project of Leonid Volkov, the city for the first time received its single passenger Samara River Station.  Built of wood as a temporary structure, it stood for almost forty years.  War intervened and, as a result, devastation arose. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Today </h2><p>  Only in 1969, the capital building of the Samara River Station began to be built according to the project of Y.
