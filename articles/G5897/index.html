    <h2>  Prince roots </h2><p>  Yaroslav Osmomysl himself (c. 1130-1187) successfully continued his father's work to collect all the Galician lands into a single state.  Vladimirko was married (by assumption) to Sophia of Hungary, daughter of Kalman I, or Colomon I the Scribe (1070-1116).  As one can judge by the nickname, the Hungarian king from the Ariad dynasty was a wise ruler and a well-read man.  The son-in-law came to the court, as the nickname "Osmomysl", according to one version of the versions, means "possessing eight minds", and on the other - "knowing eight languages", that is, not stupid at all.  In 1149, Vladimirko Volodarevich made an alliance with Moscow prince Yuri Dolgoruky against the Kiev prince Izyaslav Mstislavovich (the first of the Russian princes, whom the <span>Ipatiev Chronicle</span> calls ‚Äúthe king‚Äù), because the Galician princes tried to achieve independence from Kiev.  In support of the union, the children of the princes get married - Yaroslav Osmomysl marries Olga Yuryevna. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Ascension to the throne </h2><p>  In 1153, at the very peak of the war with Izyaslav II Mstislavovich, when Vladimir had already captured cities on the Goryn River, the prince suddenly dies, and the Galician boyars put Yaroslav Vladimirovich on the throne, who in words tried to assure the great Kiev prince Izyaslav in his filial love and humility.  In fact, either he himself or his boyars tried only to gain time and did not think to return the conquered cities.  And <span>Izyaslav Mstislavovich</span> again goes the war on the rebellious Galich.  Near Terebovl (February 16, 1154), in a bloody battle that lasted all day and ended late at night, no one achieved a decisive victory, and the troops were withdrawn.  Izyaslav did not regain the captured cities, and soon, in the same year 1154, he died.  Yaroslav's father-in-law, <span>Yuri Dolgoruky,</span> who was a longtime ally of the Galicians, sits on the Kiev throne.  However, peace and good relations between Galich and Kiev did not last long, because Yuri Dolgoruky was sent to another world in 1157, and Izyaslav III Davydovich sat down to the great reign. </p>

    <h2>  Competitor to the throne of Galician </h2><p>  Yaroslav Osmomysl had a sworn enemy in the person of his cousin - the expelled Galician Prince Ivan Rostislavovich Berladnik (at the seat in the city of Berlad).  The years of life of Ivan Rostislavovich, who claimed the throne of Galicia, were 1112-1162.  Having sat down to the great reign, Izyaslav III patronized Berladnik in the hope that, having occupied the throne of Galicia, he would return to Kiev all the cities captured by Vladimir.  In the future, Prince Yaroslav Osmomysl pursues a clever and subtle policy, entering into alliances with former enemies, for example, with the son of Izyaslav II Mstislav Izyaslavovich.  As a result of his reign, the <span>principality of Kiev</span> fell into decay, ruined by the eternal <span>internecine wars of</span> numerous heirs, and Galitsky grew stronger and richer, growing in new territories. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Expulsion of an Inner Enemy </h2><p>  Izyaslav III, instigated by Berladnik, having entered into an alliance with the Polovtsy, Turks and Berendeys, attacked Mstislav, who had settled in Belgorod.  But after the betrayal of the Berendey, he was forced to flee, leaving the Kiev throne.  Escaped to a foreign land, Ivan Berladnik died in exile.  Allies Yaroslav and Mstislav Izyaslavovich give the throne of Kiev to <span>Rostislav Mstislavovich.</span>  As a result, Yaroslav Osmomysl did not have any opponents left, and external enemies did not dare to attack a strong state that could fight back. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yaroslav Osmomysl biography" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1062283.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Increased power </h2><p>  Yaroslav Osmomysl, whose reign strengthened and enriched the Galician land, constantly undertook campaigns against the Polovtsy and intimidated them completely.  Giving shelter to the exiled Byzantine prince Andronik Komnin, the visionary Yaroslav, after reconciling the prince with the Byzantine emperor Manuel, concluded an alliance with the latter against the Hungarians.  There were no wars on the Galician land, and it did not go bankrupt.  The power acquired by Yaroslav is also spoken of in the ‚ÄúWord on Igor's Regiment‚Äù. </p><h2>  The feud with the boyars </h2><p>  However, at the beginning of his reign, and even then, Yaroslav always overcome the confrontation of the boyars.  According to historical evidence, nowhere in Russia was the boyars more powerful than on the western outskirts.  Their self-will reached the point that they publicly and solemnly burned Anastasia, the beloved woman of Yaroslav, who gave birth to him no less than her beloved son Oleg, at the stake.  Yaroslav himself and his son were kept in captivity until he swore an oath to reunite with his wife Olga, who was in Poland, and bequeath to the throne to Vladimir, her son.  Olga solemnly returned to Galich at the invitation of the boyars, but Yaroslav, who was released a year later, regained his power over a powerful aristocratic elite, reconciled with his son Vladimir, but he still bequeathed the throne to Oleg. </p>

    <h2>  The prosperity of the principality and the death of Yaroslav </h2><p>  Defending his principality from external and internal enemies, Yaroslav gave all his strength for the economic development of Galicia.  Under him, crafts flourished, sensible foreigners took to the service.  All trade that went along the Danube depended on Yaroslav Osmomysl, since he owned the port of Mali Galich.  The principality was especially active in trade with Bulgaria and Byzantium.  Yaroslav Osmomysl, whose biography ended in Galich in 1187, was buried there.  Soon after the beginning of the reign, Oleg was poisoned, and Vladimir, whom his father sent to Przemysl, also took control of the Galician throne.  In 1939, the archaeologist Yaroslav Pasternak discovered the burial of Yaroslav Osmomysl. </p>

    <h2>  Board Results </h2><p>  The reign of Yaroslav Osmomysl falls on the era of the heyday of feudalism in the Carpathian states.  During the years of sitting on the throne of Galicia, Yaroslav Osmomysl managed to stop the troubles in the whole principality.  Twice he conquered Kiev and put on the great reign of loyal princes.  He strengthened external relations - with the Polish princes, the Hungarian king and Byzantium.  With the Principality of Moscow, he traditionally maintained friendly relations.  For his wise rule from the people under his rule, Yaroslav received the nickname Osmomysl. </p>
