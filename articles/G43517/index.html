The real story of James Cook, biography, history of geographical discoveries, date and cause of death</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Thanks to the song of Vladimir Vysotsky about the legendary captain Cook, the name of this navigator became known to almost all compatriots.  But the literary component of the song ‚ÄúWhy the Aborigines ate Cook‚Äù (you will find the chords in the article) is very different from the realities.  Although the biography of the illustrious pioneer actually has many colorful episodes.  And his preserved diary entries are still of great interest to scientists and historians ... Have the Aborigines eaten Cook?  Try to find out. </p><h2>  The son of a farm laborer </h2><p>  The future traveler was born in late October 1728 in one of the villages of the county of Yorkshire.  He was born in a large family in which there were eight children.  James was the second child.  His father worked as an ordinary farm laborer. </p><p>  A few years later, the Cook family moved to another village near the <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãof Newcastle.</span>  It was there that little James began to study at a local school.  Note that at the moment this educational institution has become a museum. </p><p>  Cook's father hoped that his son would engage in trade.  For the sake of this, James was handed over to one of the haberdashery.  By this time, the future captain was already thirteen years old. </p><p>  However, young Cook did not like this prospect at all.  Although the proximity of the seaport of Newcastle undoubtedly attracted him.  The future discoverer looked at the ships for hours and imagined how one day he would set off on his first voyage. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ancientpages.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="aborigines ate the cook" class="if uuid-2537633" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62636/2537633.jpg"></div><h2>  Flight of a haberdasher apprentice </h2><p>  Over time, the craving for sea open spaces turned into a dream, which young James decided to realize.  He left the haberdashery shop, his native home and became a young man on the Freelove ship, which transported coal to the English capital.  At the same time, he began to seriously engage in his self-education.  He bought the appropriate books, giving them his little money.  He was then a real ascetic.  The sailors laughed at him.  And because of this, James repeatedly had to fight in order to maintain his independence.  He persistently continued to study navigation, geography, astronomy and mathematics.  In addition, he read a huge number of descriptions of sea expeditions.  At that time, the future naval commander was eighteen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  First successes </h2><p>  A few years later, the young man received a flattering offer - to become the captain of the ship "Friendship".  But he decided to refuse, becoming the ordinary sailor of the Royal Navy.  He was assigned to the 60-gun ship Eagle.  A month later, he became already a boatswain. </p><p>  Meanwhile, the Seven Years War began.  Great Britain was also drawn into the conflict, which led military operations against France.  Of course, the boatswain of the Eagle ship Cook was directly involved in the clashes.  His ship participated in the blockade of the French coast.  And in the late spring of 1757, the Eagle fought with the ship Duke of Aquitaine.  As a result, the French ship was captured.  And the Eagle went off for repair in England.  So, James received a baptism of fire. </p><p>  After some time, Cook was assigned to the ship "Pembroke".  On this ship he became a member of the blockade of the Bay of Biscay.  A little later, he was sent to the eastern shores of Canada.  It was then that his knowledge came in handy, which were gleaned from books and textbooks, when he was still engaged in self-education. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.livescience.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="why the natives ate the cook" class="if uuid-2537634" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62636/2537634.jpg"></div><h2>  Cartographer </h2><p>  So, Cook handed over to the authorities his map of the mouth of the St. Lawrence River, compiled by him.  As a result, the talented cartographer was transferred to a special appropriate ship.  The purpose of the expedition is a cartographic survey of the coast of Labrador.  The result impressed the British Admiralty.  After Cook, he never took part in naval battles.  He was transferred to the flagship Northumberland as a foreman.  In fact, it was a professional promotion. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the meantime, James continued to map p.  St. Lawrence and did this until 1762.  These cards were published, and Cook himself received the rank of lieutenant. </p><p>  He returned to England and soon became engaged to Elizabeth Butts.  Note immediately that the couple had 6 children.  Unfortunately, all of Cook's heirs passed away very early ... </p><h2>  The first round-the-world expedition </h2><p>  In the second half of the eighteenth century, redistribution of new territories among the great European powers began again.  By this time, Spain and Portugal had left the game, but France and Great Britain once again fought with each other for the accession of new lands to the Pacific. </p><p>  By order of the Admiralty, Cook, having an enviable experience in cartography and navigation, went on his first expedition around the world.  Officially, his team began to engage in astronomical research.  But these observations, in fact, were just a screen.  Captain Cook was looking for new colonies, namely, the southern mainland.  In those days he was called Terra Incognita. </p><p>  In 1769, James Cook reached the coast of Tahiti.  The captain established strict discipline in the relations of sailors with the islanders.  He categorically forbade the use of violence.  So, the provisions for the team had to be exchanged exclusively.  Indeed, by those standards, it was real nonsense.  Europeans are used to rob and kill Aboriginal people ... </p><p>  When astronomical research was completed, the expedition set off for New Zealand.  On the west coast, the team found an unnamed bay.  The bay was named after Queen Charlotte.  After that, the travelers climbed a hill.  They saw that New Zealand was divided by the strait into two islands.  Later this strait was named after the captain. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In 1770, the expedition approached the east coast of Australia.  Mariners there found several previously unknown plants.  That is why this bay was called Botanical.  The following year, Cook and his associates returned to the UK. </p><p>  Is it true that the natives ate Cook?  You have yet to find out. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.abc.net.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="why the natives ate cook chords" class="if uuid-2537638" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62636/2537638.jpg"></div><h2>  Captain's Second Voyage </h2><p>  Just a year later, James Cook led a new expedition.  Often it is called Antarctic.  This journey, like the previous one, was directly related to the continuation of the search for the southern continent.  Moreover, the French were very active in the southern seas. </p><p>  In 1772, Cook left the city of Plymouth, and at the beginning of the next year, the expedition crossed the Arctic Circle.  Note that this was the first time in world history. </p><p>  The team also once again visited Tahiti.  It was here that the captain ordered the inclusion of fruits in the sailors ‚Äôdiet.  The fact is that at one time in all voyages the scourge was a real scourge.  Mortality from her was simply disastrous.  But Cook managed to learn how to deal with this disease by adding just a large number of appropriate fruits to his diet.  In fact, the seafarer made a real revolution in navigation, because the mortality rates from scurvy were practically reduced to zero. </p><p>  After this, the expedition visited the islands of Tongatabu and Eua.  The captain was amazed at the friendliness of the natives.  Therefore, these territories Cook named islands of Friendship. </p><p>  Then the travelers again went to New Zealand, and then once again they had to cross the Arctic Circle. </p><p>  In 1774, Cook discovered South Georgia and New Caledonia.  In the summer of next year, the team returned to their home harbor. </p><div class="photo" data-original="aboriginalhistoryofyarra.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where the natives ate the cook" class="if uuid-2537639" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62636/2537639.jpg"></div><h2>  The fateful journey of Captain Cook </h2><p>  At home, Cook was accepted into the Royal Geographical Society.  In addition, he received a prestigious gold medal and the title of post-captain.  Meanwhile, the 3rd round-the-world expedition was preparing.  The navigator, as always, led her.  In fact, this decision of the captain became fatal. </p><p>  The order of the British Admiralty was as follows.  Cook was ordered to search for a way from the Atlantic to the Pacific through northern North America. </p><p>  In mid-1776, the ships of the titled captain left the English harbor.  At the end of the same year, sailors had already crossed the Cape of Good Hope and headed towards the Australian mainland.  The next year, Cook has already begun to carry out an immediate task.  When the captain crossed the equator, he discovered the largest atoll on the planet.  It was called the island of Christmas.  Three weeks later, on their way, travelers came across new islands.  It was Hawaii.  After that, the scientific squadron went towards North America. </p><p>  Members of the expedition passed the strait that divide America and Asia, and ended up in the Chukchi Sea.  Cook ships met not only cold winds, but also drifting ice.  It was simply impossible to go further.  The captain decided to return to the warm seas. </p><p>  On the way, in the Aleutian Islands, he met Russian industrialists who showed him another, his own map.  The captain managed to redraw it.  In addition, he named the strait separating Asia and America, after the famous traveler Bering. </p><p>  At the very end of the fall of 1778, Cook's ships finally approached the coast of the Hawaiian Islands.  Thousands of Aboriginal crowds met them.  Apparently, the islanders took the captain for one of their deities ... </p><p>  Where did the natives eat Cook?  Now we find out. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.britannica.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Aborigines ate a cook lyrics" class="if uuid-2537640" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62636/2537640.jpg"></div><h2>  The death of the captain </h2><p>  Why did the natives eat Cook?  Is this true?  Initially, the captain had a very good relationship with the natives.  Those supplied the expedition with everything necessary.  True, the islanders were very surprised by the outlandish things that the team members brought with them.  Actually, this unhealthy curiosity led to the occurrence of minor thefts on British ships.  The sailors tried to return the stolen, and because of this there were serious skirmishes, which became hotter every day. </p><p>  In order not to aggravate the situation, Captain Cook decided to leave the islands, but the expedition was in a severe storm.  The team was forced to return.  How did it happen that James Cook was eaten by natives? </p><p>  In the meantime, the attitude of the natives became too hostile.  In addition, the number of thefts has increased significantly.  So, ticks were stolen from the ship.  Team members tried to get them back.  And this attempt ended in a real fighting clash.  And on the next fateful day, on the fourteenth of February, the boat was stolen altogether from the flagship.  Cook was determined to return the stolen.  To this end, he and four sailors from his team invited one of the local leaders to the ship.  The captain was about to take him with him as a hostage.  But at the last moment, the leader suddenly refused to go with him.  By this time, thousands of aggressive Hawaiians flocked to the shore.  They surrounded the navigator and his people.  A moment later, stones flew into this small detachment, one of which hit the captain himself.  Defending himself, Cook shot at the native.  The natives are furious.  Another stone hit the captain in the head.  As a result, the islanders finished off the strangers with knives.  The remaining satellites were able to retreat to the ship and sail away. </p><p>  The brilliant captain James Cook is gone.  He was only fifty. </p><p>  Be that as it may, the banal theft of the longboat became the impetus after which tragic events occurred.  Their deplorable outcome was the death of a talented captain.  Moreover, eyewitnesses claim that if Cook had not shot at the Hawaiians, then there would have been no fatal incident.  According to them, the natives did not intend to attack the captain‚Äôs squad at all.  They were just very worried about the fate of their leader. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.britishtars.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="why aborigines ate a cookie" class="if uuid-2537643" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62636/2537643.jpg"></div><p>  As you know from the song, the natives ate Cook.  You can read the lyrics below. </p><blockquote><p>  Don't grab someone else's waist </p><p>  Escaped from the hands of his girlfriends! </p><p>  Remember how to the shores of Australia </p><p>  The late Cook was sailing, </p><p>  Like, sitting in a circle under azaleas, </p><p>  By meal - from sunrise to dawn - </p><p>  Spruce in this sunny Australia </p><p>  Friend to friend, evil savages. </p><p>  Why did the natives eat Cook? </p><p>  For what - it is not clear, science is silent. </p><p>  It seems to me a very simple thing: </p><p>  They wanted to eat - and ate Cook! </p><p>  There is an option that their leader - a big beech - </p><p>  Said a delicious cook on a Cook ship ... </p><p>  The error came out - this is what science is silent about: </p><p>  They wanted Coca, and ate Cook! </p><p>  And there was no trick or trick at all - </p><p>  Entered without knocking, almost without sound, </p><p>  They launched a bamboo club: </p><p>  Bale!  right in the crown - and no Cook! </p><p>  But there is, however, another assumption, </p><p>  That Cook was eaten out of great respect, </p><p>  That the sorcerer incited all - the sly and the evil: </p><p>  "Atu guys, grab Cook! </p><p>  Who will eat it without salt and without onions, </p><p>  He will be strong, courageous, kind - like Cook! " </p><p>  Come on, I‚Äôve got a stone on my arm, </p><p>  Threw the viper - and there is no Cook! </p><p>  And savages now wring their hands </p><p>  Breaking a copy, breaking bows, </p><p>  They burned and threw batons from bamboo - </p><p>  Experiencing that they ate Cook! </p></blockquote><p>  This is the text of the song "Why the Aborigines ate Cook".  You can read guitar chords below. </p><blockquote><p>  Hm em </p><p>  Don't grab someone else's waist </p><p>  F # <sub>7</sub> Hm F # <sub>7</sub> </p><p>  Breaking out of the hands of his girlfriends, </p><p>  Hm c # <sub>7</sub> </p><p>  Remember how to the shores of Australia </p><p>  F # <sub>7</sub> Hm </p><p>  The late Cook was sailing. </p><p>  H <sub>7</sub> Em </p><p>  There, sitting in a circle under the azaleas, </p><p>  C # <sub>7</sub> F # <sub>7</sub> sus <sub>4</sub> F # <sub>7</sub> </p><p>  Eat from dawn to dawn </p><p>  Hm em </p><p>  Spruce in this sunny Australia </p><p>  Hm F # <sub>7</sub> Hm A <sub>7</sub> </p><p>  Friend to friend, evil savages. </p><p>  DD # dim <sub>7</sub> Em <sub>7</sub> </p><p>  But why did the natives eat Cook? </p><p>  A <sub>7</sub> DH <sub>7</sub> </p><p>  For what - it is not clear, science is silent. </p><p>  Em hm </p><p>  It seems to me a very simple thing: </p><p>  F # <sub>7</sub> Hm A <sub>7</sub> </p><p>  They wanted to eat - and ate Cook. </p></blockquote><h2>  Farewell to Captain James Cook </h2><p>  After the death of the captain, his assistant Charles Clark was forced to lead the expedition.  First of all, he conducted a special military operation.  Under the cover of ship‚Äôs guns, his unit destroyed the settlements that were on the shore.  After this, the new captain entered into negotiations with the leader of the natives.  Clark demanded to give the remains of the deceased Cook.  As a result, the islanders delivered to the ship a basket with several pounds of human meat, as well as a head without a lower jaw.  This is all that remained of the famous navigator. </p><p>  At the end of February 1779, the remains of the captain were lowered into the sea.  The team lowered the flag and gave a gun salute.  The next day, the members of the infamous expedition went on a further journey, leaving the Hawaiian Islands. </p><p>  They say that even before parting with the body of the captain, the Hawaiians buried part of his flesh.  Moreover, separately from the bones.  Such rituals are traditional for Aboriginal people.  Moreover, they were committed exclusively with the bodies of great heroes who distinguished themselves in battles, or leaders.  Perhaps that is why the islanders returned to the British only fragments of the body of James Cook. </p><p>  Now you no longer have a question about why the natives ate Cook. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.news.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="did the aborigines eat the cookie" class="if uuid-2537645" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62636/2537645.jpg"></div><h2>  Continuation of the story of the famous captain Cook </h2><p>  Having said goodbye to the islands, the orphaned expedition went north and began to search for a way from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean.  The ships made a stop in the Peter and Paul Harbor.  After which the captain again wanted to break through the Chukchi Sea, but even that was in vain.  After a while, Clark passed away.  He was hit by tuberculosis.  He was buried in Kamchatka. </p><p>  The wife of James Cook after the death of her husband lived for almost half a century or more.  She died in 93. All her life, she sincerely admired the captain and tried to measure everything only by his moral convictions and honor.  Before her death, she destroyed almost all correspondence with her husband and personal papers.  She was buried in a family crypt in Cambridge. </p><p>  But the story with Captain Cook did not end at all.  In the spring of 1823, the King of Hawaii named Kamehameha II arrived with his wife on the shores of Misty Albion.  Three months later, the monarch died.  But the day before he handed doctors an arrow with a wooden plumage and an iron tip.  According to the native, this bone arrow is nothing more than the bone of Captain Cook. </p><p> In 1886, this peculiar relic was transported to Australia and was stored there until recently.  But the head of the Captain Cook Society, Mr. C. Tronton, verified the authenticity of this arrow.  The bone was able to enlighten with an x-ray.  As it became known, it could belong to a dolphin, and a whale, and to a person.  The next step was a DNA test.  However, all the children of the captain died early and did not acquire offspring.  But the relatives of the pioneer‚Äôs sister are still alive.  Her name was Margaret.  After some time, Mr. Tronton said that DNA analysis confirmed that the bone had nothing to do with the famous navigator ... </p><h2>  Merits of Captain James Cook </h2><p>  Now that we have found out why the natives ate Cook, it's worth talking about his merits.  The captain managed to make several geographical discoveries.  In addition, about twenty geographical objects were named in his honor, including bays, straits and groups of islands.  Also, a number of maps compiled by him, served naval commanders until the II half of the nineteenth century. </p><p>  It is also important that Cook always tried to improve the welfare of the natives.  So, the pioneer gave the people of New Zealand sheep.  And he brought pigs and boars to New Caledonia.  Apparently, in this way he hoped to stop cannibalism among the islanders. </p><p>  The famous navigator was destined to educate a galaxy of famous British naval commanders.  So, at one time in her team were the future head of the Royal Society D. Banks, the future head of New South Wales W. Bly, the scientist of the Pacific coast of North America D. Vancouver and many others. </p><p>  In addition, a number of members of his expeditions subsequently excelled in Russian service.  For example, the sailor from the ship Cook D. Billings led a Russian expedition to the Pacific and Arctic Oceans.  Moreover, as a captain.  Another - D. Trevenen - also served in the service of the Russian Empire and took part in the war with Sweden.  In the Vyborg naval battle, he died.  This happened in 1790. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  Now you know what the natives ate Cook.  In the end, I would like to tell some more interesting facts: </p><ol><li>  The pioneer Cook was the first person on the planet who was able to visit all the continents.  Only in Antarctica has he never been. </li><li>  The captain discovered the islands of Fiji.  Although he himself called them Fisi.  But the mariner mistakenly recorded the name in the ship's log as "Fiji."  However, his authority was undeniable.  Therefore, they decided to leave the erroneous name. </li><li>  The captain had a best friend.  It's about Lord Hugh Pallicere.  At one time he was considered an excellent sailor, then he began to lead the main financial department.  Hugh was the first to guess the brilliant pioneer in Cook.  He believed that the captain had an enviable flair and common sense.  However, he never lost his presence of mind.  After the death of a friend, the lord created a memorial in his honor.  It is located at the Palliser estate in Buckinghamishire. </li><li>  Before the last trip, an artist named Nathaniel Dance managed to paint a portrait of the captain.  On the canvas, the largest explorer of Oceania is depicted with a certain map.  It contains almost all of its geographical discoveries.  At the beginning of the nineteenth century, it was from this portrait that the so-called Rockingham figurine was made. </li><li>  In the early 30s of the 20th century, philanthropist and bookmaker M. Barnett of Christchurch decided to perpetuate the legendary seafarer.  He managed to organize an appropriate competitive project.  After that, he paid for all the work, including the fee to the sculptor, and presented a monument to the city.  Since then, the sculpture is located in Victoria Square. </li><li>  The command module of the Apollo-15V spacecraft was called the Endeavor.  This was Captain Cook's first ship.  Incidentally, one of the "space shuttles" at one time was also called by this name. </li><li>  In 1935, one of the craters of the moon was named after the famous navigator. </li></ol>
