Many of us, going out of town for a whole summer, are not ready to refuse to watch our favorite TV shows, so we take a digital receiver for a TV to the country with us. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="receiver for the TV to the country" class="if" height="441" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39348/1783728.jpg" width="600"></div>  However, arriving at the place, they find out that its power and technical characteristics are not enough to receive a signal and watch channels in high resolution.  To prevent a similar situation from happening with you, competently approach the choice of a TV set-top box.

    <h2>  Subtleties of choice </h2><p>  Before buying a digital <span>TV receiver,</span> you need to determine the type of receiver.  It can be a satellite dish, home or outdoor <span>television antenna.</span>  The choice of this or that equipment depends on a number of factors.  In order not to make a mistake with the choice, it is worth answering for yourself several of the most important questions: </p><ol><li>  How many TV channels do you want to watch?  If their number exceeds 10, or government programs are not included in their list, then you are better off choosing a receiver for a TV for your summer cottage along with a satellite dish. </li><li>  How far is the suburban area from the city?  The farther your hacienda is from the village, the lower the likelihood that a conventional antenna will be able to receive a television signal. </li><li>  Are there television towers in the summer cottage?  Most modern TV towers broadcast in digital format.  To receive the signal in this case, a combination of a conventional set-top box and a home antenna will suffice. </li></ol><p>  The choice of the device will be significantly affected by the home budget.  If you are ready to spend a certain amount on watching TV channels, then you can safely choose a <span>set of satellite television.</span>  When this option is impossible, you will have to make a bit of effort and spend some free time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to choose a receiver for a TV in the country" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1784484.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Satellite dish receiver </h2><p>  After weighing all the pros and cons and deciding that the receiver for the TV at the cottage for the plate is the most acceptable option for you, you need to answer another question: which one should I choose, whether it is independent or attached to a particular operator?  In the first case, you can configure your ‚Äúplate‚Äù on different satellites and watch any free channels supplied from any provider.  But image quality and signal stability can significantly suffer. If you choose a satellite dish of a certain company, you will have access to the channels of only this provider.  However, image quality and signal stability will be much better.  In addition, you do not have to configure the equipment yourself. </p><p>  In addition to this, you need to decide whether you are ready to leave the receiver for the TV for the winter cottage?  If not, then give preference to independent devices - they are more mobile. </p><h2>  Overview of Independent Satellite Receivers </h2><p>  The most affordable option is the Openbox S1 set-top box.  The technical characteristics of the device allow you to receive a signal from most domestic satellites, such as Tricolor-TV, NTV + or Telecard.  Additional functionality, support for the CI module and the ability to install access cards will allow you to watch most of the Russian TV channels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="receiver for tv cottage reviews" class="if" height="441" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39348/1783726.jpg" width="600"></div>  The Openbox S1 receiver received positive user reviews for its cost, ease of setup and channel search, and versatility.  The only drawback noted by customers is the inability to view channels in HD format.

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To view HD programs, you need a digital TV receiver for your Openbox S9 HD PVR cottage.  In addition to watching the programs of your favorite operators, you can record them on the built-in hard drive, as well as listen to music and watch videos, photos from flash cards.  Minus - a fairly high price. </p><h2>  Traditional antenna and receiver </h2><p>  Today, TV towers broadcast a digital signal in the decimeter range - in the same way as analog television.  Therefore, to watch TV channels, you can select any antenna.  It remains only to decide which one: passive or active? </p><p>  In the first case, the amplifier block will be located separately from the receiving structure itself, and in the second, the amplifier block will be combined with the "horns" receiving the signal.  <span>Passive antennas</span> are more durable, but interference interferes with their operation.  Active devices are not weatherproof, but are more compact and better able to receive signals. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="receiver for TV antenna to the country" class="if" height="287" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39348/1783733.jpg" width="304"></div>  It is worth saying that you can choose any receiver for the TV antenna for the cottage, because the prefix is ‚Äã‚Äãsuitable for both active and passive devices.  In some cases, even an indoor antenna is suitable.  It all depends on the removal of the TV tower from your country house.

    <h2>  Receiver Parameters for Antenna </h2><p>  You need an antenna receiver only if your TV does not have a built-in digital signal processing module.  As a rule, it is absent in all old CRT television boxes.  For modern models marked with DVB-T2 symbols, the prefix is ‚Äã‚Äãnot needed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="digital receiver for the TV to the country" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39348/1783734.jpg" width="528"></div>  When choosing a receiver, you need to make sure that the format of the received signal matches DVB-T2, and also that the equipment is capable of processing MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 video.  In addition, you may require that the <span>TV receiver to</span> the cottage receive an HD-format signal.

    <h2>  Overview of Digital Receivers </h2><p>  An acceptable option would be the <span>Rolsen</span> RDB-507N <span>TV box</span> .  Low cost corresponds to a small set of functionality, but it copes with its task perfectly.  According to customer reviews, the receiver heats up during operation, but this does not affect durability.  Another inexpensive receiver, the Mystery MMP-71DT2, is very similar to the previous representative.  Among the advantages, it is worth noting the simple setup of channels, an intuitive interface.  Some users complained about the inconvenient remote control, but you just need to get used to it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="receiver for the TV to the country" class="if" height="208" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1784483.jpg" width="360"></div>

    <p>  BBK SMP127HDT2 is an inexpensive receiver for a TV for the country, reviews of which speak in favor of its functionality and reliability.  With proper tuning, you will be able to ‚Äúcatch‚Äù all state channels, and when located near the state border, you will also be able to catch the channels of a neighboring country.  It may scare the interface, but you can deal with the instructions with it. </p><h2>  Internet TV </h2><p>  Few people know about the possibility of watching TV channels via the Internet due to the non-proliferation of this broadcasting technology.  Unfortunately, even today the quality of cellular communications leaves much to be desired in many regions of Russia.  However, if there was never a problem with mobile communications at the summer cottage, then this option promises to be the most optimal. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="receiver for the TV to the country" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39348/1783731.jpg" width="600"></div>  To watch TV channels, you need to purchase a special receiver from a mobile operator - MTS, Beeline, TELE2 or from other providers, connect a subscription to channels and buy an access card - an analogue of a SIM card in your phone.  After connecting, the prefix is ‚Äã‚Äãimmediately ready to work - there is no need to configure or search for channels.

    <h2>  How not to miscalculate with a purchase? </h2><p>  In order for the set-top box you purchased to properly ‚Äúcatch‚Äù digital TV channels, before choosing a receiver for your TV in the country, you must carefully study the local conditions.  Find out which mobile operator works best in the area, how far the TV tower is from your home, and whether your neighbors have satellite dishes. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="receiver for the TV to the cottage for the plate" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39348/1783730.jpg" width="600"></div>  When the budget does not allow you to sort through the various options, start with the cheapest and easiest - connect a bundle of wire to your TV.  If you can find the gear, then you can get by with the indoor antenna.  If there is no signal at all (there is not even interference), then even a street receiver will not cope here.  Experiment, and you will surely find something suitable for you.
