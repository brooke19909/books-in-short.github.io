  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Wicker box: use, DIY</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Wicker boxes are increasingly seen in the interiors of modern apartments and private houses.  Designers began to pay more attention to natural materials - rotunda, vine, bamboo or sea grass.  Boxes are used in almost any part of the room, be it a kitchen, bedroom, bathroom or even a toilet.  The tradition was adopted by the inhabitants of France, who like to place their things in small baskets and wicker baskets. </p><p>  In our country, not so long ago there was a tendency to use wicker interior items, but immediately fell in love with many.  Consider where you can find application for such original products. </p><h2>  Kitchen decoration </h2><p>  First of all, wicker baskets were used in the kitchens of our hostesses, because vegetables and fruits are wonderfully stored in them, since they are aired and protect products from light and dampness.  They can be placed on the kitchen surface or inserted into the interior of the cabinets on the shelves. </p><p>  In large containers you can store stocks of potatoes or onions, in small ones to add skimmers and rolling pins.  Place bread in a wicker box with a lid - this way it will be stored longer than in a simple plastic bag. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wicker boxes in the kitchen" class="if uuid-2721776" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2721776.jpg"></div><p>  Some decorators leave one kitchen drawer without doors at all, exposing rows on the shelves of the box, woven from a vine or bamboo.  This is usually done when a natural unpainted wood is used in the manufacture of a kitchen set. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Application in rooms </h2><p>  Usually, in the absence of a dressing room, large wardrobes are put in the bedrooms in which small things are convenient to keep in wicker boxes, for example, linen or socks, scarves or ties and belts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mobilemonitors.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wicker box application in the bedroom" class="if uuid-2721785" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2721785.jpg"></div><p>  But enterprising designers went even further and placed large, but low boxes under the bed.  They must be covered with a cloth or covers so that the bedclothes stored there are not dusted. </p><p>  In the children's room you can put toys in boxes.  The material of the products is natural, so that the child will not cause negative allergic reactions.  And in the oval boxes, young mothers often put the baby next to their bed, and if the product has handles, then they are used as a baby in the car or in another room. </p><p>  In the hallway, wicker boxes are used to store umbrellas and slippers for guests, creams and brushes for shoes and clothes are put in small containers. </p><h2>  Bathroom Products </h2><p>  In the bathroom, large boxes with lids serve to fold dirty laundry before washing.  Small rectangular products can be covered with fabric covers and placed on a bookcase one above the other.  It is convenient to store terry towels and a variety of cosmetic bottles, combs, shampoos, washcloths, toilet paper and many other little things. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="zorlag.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="boxed with fabric" class="if uuid-2721779" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2721779.jpg"></div><p>  The boxes located in the cabinet under the washbasin look interesting.  Unlike plastic counterparts, they are well ventilated and always remain dry. </p><h2>  Picnic boxes </h2><p>  Wicker baskets are often used for things needed at a picnic or when going out.  Products are chosen with covers, but there are boxes with a dividing jumper inside.  Thus, you can neatly fold the dishes, glasses for wine or glasses for juice, napkins and products. </p><div class="photo" data-original="santiaspizza.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wicker box with a lid" class="if uuid-2721774" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2721774.jpg"></div><p>  When choosing a box woven from a vine to go to a place of rest, you will be completely sure that the tomatoes on the road will not turn into tomato paste, and sandwiches will not scatter throughout the car. </p><h2>  Self-made box </h2><p>  If you like to create and do things with your own hands, you can try to make a wicker box with you for storing things.  It is problematic to get a vine, like bamboo, so we will try our hand first on newspaper tubes.  Yes, yes, you heard right, it was on them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="newspaper tubes" class="if uuid-2721814" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2721814.jpg"></div><p>  Consider how to make weaving material from a regular newspaper or glossy magazines.  Cut the print onto sheets of the same size.  To twist the tubes you will need a metal stick, you can use a knitting needle without a loop at the end.  Also prepare PVA glue and a brush.  A knitting needle is placed on the edge of a newspaper sheet, and the paper begins to wind up diagonally.  The remaining corner is smeared with PVA glue and attached to the last turn of the tube.  To work even on the smallest box you need to make at least 100 parts.  If necessary, you can always make a few more pieces. </p><h2>  Beginning of work </h2><p>  For beginners, it will be easier to do the work on the cardboard bottom.  To do this, prepare two identical rectangles, you can use corrugated cardboard.  Tubes are glued to the lower part at a distance of 5-6 cm from the edge, placing them parallel to each other, as in the photo below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a box" class="if uuid-2721802" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2721802.jpg"></div><p>  When parts for future weaving are placed around the perimeter, two tubes are also glued at an angle.  They will be the beginning of weaving, then cover the workpiece with a second cardboard rectangle smeared with glue.  You can put a small load until the workpiece is completely dry, such as books or a stack of printer paper. </p><h2>  How to weave a box </h2><p>  The first row is braided on a flat blank.  The tubes glued at an angle wrap around sticks sticking out to the sides.  The photo above clearly shows how weaving is done.  Each row is tightly attracted to the previous one, so that the box does not turn out to be leaky.  After the first row of weaving, the tubes bend up at a right angle.  You can insert a box of suitable size to the inside so that there is support, and attach the upper edges of the tubes to the clothespins so that they do not fall down during operation.  When one tube ends, it is extended by gluing the next directly to its edge.  When the desired height of the box is reached, the vertical tubes bend into the work and glue the edges to the box.  The craft can be painted with acrylic paints in any color, and after drying, additionally coated with acrylic varnish. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="box of newspaper tubes" class="if uuid-2721798" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2721798.jpg"></div><p>  Self-made box can be used in different ways: paint or leave it in its original form, paint the bottom or glue it with a cloth.  You can dream as much as you like, it all depends on your creative ideas.  Good luck </p>
