Located in the British Isles.  For many, Britain and England are one and the same.  But this is not so. </p><p>  Great Britain was founded in 1801 and consists of four countries.  Each of the four countries that make up the United State owns a certain territory. </p><p>  As for England, it leaves the largest area - the island of Great Britain, some small islands, archipelagos and the northeastern part.  In addition, she has beautiful Shetland islands. </p><p>  Throughout the UK there are countless attractions, in this article we will tell you about castles in the UK, because this is what the country is famous for. </p><p>  Many rich people from different cities like to settle not in simple private houses, but in royal castles, as it is very traditional in English. </p><h2>  Windsor castle </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.windsor.gov.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Windsor castle" class="if uuid-2284266" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2284266.jpg"></div><p>  This is one of the most popular and largest castles in terms of area.  It is located in the small town of Windsor and bears the same name.  The castle in the UK is the official residence of the English monarchs. </p><p>  This ancient palace has a very large and interesting history.  It was built during the conquest of England, when William the Conqueror ruled. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Most Norman rulers liked to spend the night in a nearby castle, which was located on the territory of Old Windsor, a few kilometers from Windsor. </p><p>  The palace reached its heyday under Queen Victoria, when it became a kind of symbol of the monarchy in Britain.  Since he wore this title, almost every next ruler tried to finish building something inside or outside. </p><p>  Later, the castle began to perform a defensive function, and this happened until the middle of the seventeenth century.  In those years, the kings completely forgot about him.  Only in the nineteenth century did the revival of Windsor Castle begin. </p><h2>  Edinburgh castle </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.visitscotland.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Edinburgh castle" class="if uuid-2284296" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2284296.jpg"></div><p>  This fortress is located in the heart of Edinburgh on Castle Hill.  The palace is considered the most important attraction of the capital of Scotland, and annually it is visited by more than a million travelers and citizens. </p><p>  As for history, it is believed that people lived in this place already in the ninth century BC.  The temple also houses the crown of Scotland and Skunk Stone.  This stone is considered legendary, since almost all Scottish kings were crowned on it. </p><p>  From the history of Skunsky stone, it is known that at the end of the thirteenth century he was taken to England and inserted into the throne on which the coronation of the rulers took place, then he was taken to Britain before the reign of Elizabeth II.  Later, she decided to issue a decree that the stone was returned to its homeland - to Edinburgh Castle. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Balmoral Castle </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.royal.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Balmoral Castle" class="if uuid-2284298" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2284298.jpg"></div><p>  The estate is large enough, located in Scotland.  English rulers usually relax here in the summer.  The castle is not state, because it belongs to Elizabeth II.  Many attractions are owned by the English crown. </p><p>  A lot of animals live here.  Among them are partridges, a large number of deer and ponies. </p><p>  This place is known to all true English, as it is historical and serves as a residence since the mid-nineteenth century.  Initially, Queen Victoria bought it, but before her, King Robert the Second had some possessions here.  We can say that there were a sufficient number of estate owners. </p><p>  Queen Victoria died at the beginning of the twentieth century, and the monarchs continued to stay here for some time.  Usually in summer and autumn.  This tradition has been preserved now, officials love to visit the castle of Great Britain, but only the Ballroom is open for this.  Gardens open in the spring, when the queen is absent from the estate. </p><h2>  Cardiff Castle </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.cardiffcastle.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cardiff Castle" class="if uuid-2284311" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2284311.jpg"></div><p>  This castle is located in the heart of the small town of Cardiff (the capital of Wales), which is home to about three hundred thousand people.  It is believed that on the hill on which the castle is located, the ancient Romans began to build their structures.  Even now you can see some of the architectural style of those years. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  When William the Conqueror came to this land, the construction of the castle in the Norman style began here.  Since the estate has a long history, it had many owners and each managed to bring something completely new to the architecture.  Thanks to this, we can admire him in modern times. </p><p>  It is believed that the Marquis Bute put the most effort into this structure.  He hired an architect named William Burges to do some redevelopment of the room.  It turned out that the Marquis radically changed the interior of the rooms.  Moreover, each part of the palace became different from the other.  Everything was done in a special way.  By right, this palace can be called one of the most interesting castles in the UK. </p><h2>  Inverari Castle </h2><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Inverari Castle" class="if uuid-2284360" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72026/2284360.jpg"></div><p>  It is believed that it is the Scottish castles that are the most mysterious and beautiful in the UK.
