It is convenient and practical.  However, there are many nuances associated with crediting funds.  This service is provided both by banks themselves through official ATMs, and intermediaries through terminals. </p><p>  When considering how to put money on a card through a terminal, it‚Äôs worth mentioning right away that depending on the operator‚Äôs company, such as a bank card or a bank, crediting may occur with delays.  Additionally, intermediary banks can set commissions for this type of transaction. </p><div class="photo" data-original="platniedorogi.ru" data-author=": " data-source="http://platniedorogi.ru/archives/the-users-of-toll-roads-now-can-replenish-their-transponders-accounts-with-comepay-services"><img itemprop="image" alt="Introduction of requisites" class="if uuid-2953249" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/2953249.jpg"></div><p>  Transferring money to the card through the terminal saves time, but the amount may come less than the amount sent.  In addition, users must be careful and cautious when entering bank details.  There are times when special devices are installed on ATMs that steal information from cards in order to withdraw all funds from them later. </p><h2>  Terminal Assignment </h2><p>  Answering the question of how to send money to the card through the terminal, you must first understand what this device is.  This is a metal block that houses software, a monitor, and a machine with a bill acceptor.  Depending on the type of financial institution, as well as the category of intermediary, such boxes can additionally be equipped with various options. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition to replenishing a bank account in the terminal, you can: </p><ul><li>  pay for utilities; </li><li>  replenish the balance of a mobile phone; </li><li>  pay fines and debts; </li><li>  to make purchases. </li></ul><p>  The advantage of using terminals is that most models do not require a bank card.  The user can simply enter the details on the screen to transfer the necessary amount of money. </p><h2>  Advantage of using </h2><p>  Putting money on a bank card through the terminal is not difficult.  The device is equipped with an intuitive interface.  If we consider the models of intermediaries, then they are quite compact and at the same time do not have physical control via buttons.  To select the menu options, just touch the touch screen with your finger. </p><p>  If we consider ATMs, then most of them are equipped with physical buttons.  This is necessary in order to register all user actions in order to prevent a possible risk of theft of money from a stolen card. </p><p>  After making cash, the device sends information to the server through a wireless data channel, where a payment order is generated.  All actions take a few seconds.  The participation of people in this process is minimal; therefore, the written algorithm is responsible for the uninterrupted operation and speed of money transfer. </p><p>  In addition, a convenient menu with a large selection of options allows you to transfer funds to various card formats and bank categories.  Typically, funds are received within 15 minutes after sending data to the server. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What are the nuances of accruing cash </h2><p>  How to put money on a card through the terminal, if there is any doubt in choosing a bank, the question is common.  It is worth paying attention to the fact that terminals and cyber cash desks accept the details of all legalized payment systems and categories of banks for crediting.  It doesn‚Äôt matter whether a credit or debit card is used. </p><p>  However, do not forget that the process of redirecting funds requires a certain amount of time.  There are many questions on the Web that after sending money through the terminal, funds did not arrive at the account for a long time.  Such cases occur and the operator himself is not always to blame. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.agro24.gr" data-author=": ŒïŒõŒõŒëŒîŒë, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cash" class="if uuid-2951098" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/2951098.jpg"></div><p>  The problem here is that the generated transaction must go through two registration authorities.  The first is the operator himself, who owns the system and terminal.  After receiving the notification, he transfers from his correspondent account the amount indicated in the application for bank details.  When funds are sent from the owner, they must be credited to the bank account.  First, the financial institution must register this transaction. </p><p>  Very often, due to technical problems, the speed of operations slows down and a queue forms.  As a result of this, the money is received after being sent to the account within three days. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  In what currency can I send money </h2><p>  Money to a card through a terminal in the Russian Federation can only be credited in rubles.  This rule applies only to terminals.  If the user has deposits in other currencies open, then he can put funds on them through official ATMs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.crnrstone.com" data-author=": Ron Shevlin, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Currency account replenishment" class="if uuid-2951107" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/2951107.jpg"></div><p>  This convenient feature is international.  Upon arrival to another country at airports, you can immediately transfer money at the desired rate to local currency.  Therefore, the terminals, if necessary, can act as a device for currency conversion.  However, this feature should be clarified at the bank where the account was opened. </p><h2>  What you need to know about terminals </h2><p>  The next interesting point that relates to terminals is that the user can not only replenish the account, but also carry out various settings.  Official ATMs also offer access to your personal account when entering a PIN code from a card.  There is support menu with answers to frequently asked questions.  There you can also find instructions on how to transfer money to a card through the terminal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nversia.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Select an option" class="if uuid-2953245" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/2953245.jpg"></div><p>  If you use third-party terminals, for example, QIWI, they also have a personal account.  The user can register in the system through the device, or through the mobile application by downloading it on the official website.  The process does not take much time.  The benefit of it is that a map is available that displays all the places where the ATMs are located. </p><p>  Additionally, when using the program, you can view all transactions and operations.  There is an additional settings menu that allows you to receive electronic checks when making an operation, as well as calculate expenses and receipts for the selected period. </p><h2>  Account replenishment procedure </h2><p>  Now you need to figure out how to put money on the card through the terminal.  It is important to make out each step.  The instruction is universal for almost all types of ATMs. </p><p>  The algorithm for crediting funds to the balance is simple: </p><ol><li>  Enter the main menu of the terminal.  It is worth noting that if an ATM is used, it will be necessary to insert a card to which funds will be sent and enter a PIN code from it. </li><li>  In the menu, select "Top-up" or "Top-up a bank card." </li><li>  Next, you will need to enter the card details.  To do this, enter its number, consisting of 16 digits on the front side, the validity period and the name of the holder, if necessary.  If an ATM is used for replenishment, then after entering a PIN code, data on the card holder and account number appear automatically. </li><li>  After entering all the necessary data, you need to click "Cash deposit". </li><li>  Usually in terminals or ATMs, the bill acceptor is located on the right side.  It can be either vertical or horizontal type.  It is necessary to carefully deposit paper money into it in one banknote. </li><li>  Next, the system will recount the deposited money and issue the amount on the screen.  At the end, you will need to confirm the operation. </li></ol><p>  It is worth noting that the terminals and ATMs use the same conditions for crediting cash. </p><h2>  What difficulties may arise </h2><p>  Having examined the question of how to deposit money to the card through the terminal, it‚Äôs worth talking about what to do if problems arise.  It happens that money gets stuck in a bill acceptor.  As a result, an error and a notification that you need to contact support are displayed on the screen.  Information about it can be found both in the application itself and on the device case.  On the front panel all the necessary details are registered. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wired.com" data-author=": ANDY GREENBERG, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Money transfer" class="if uuid-2951101" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/2951101.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, the ATM may simply freeze.  This is usually due to software crashes for which developers are responsible.  It‚Äôs not worth risking and inserting money into the bill acceptor, as the operation may be lost.  It is better to immediately look for another terminal. </p><h2>  Advice Tips </h2><p>  Money to the card through the Kiwi terminal comes quickly.  However, since this is a third-party company, which is an intermediary in crediting the money sent, it takes a commission for its actions.  Usually the size is from 3%. </p><p>  ATMs can also set various conditions for crediting funds.  This can be both a commission and a time limit.  It is better to use the terminals of partners of a financial institution.  They usually provide recharge services for free. </p><div class="photo" data-original="theconversation.com" data-author=": Akintunde Akinleye, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Refill" class="if uuid-2951105" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/2951105.jpg"></div><p>  Being at the terminal do not rush.  Often users complain that they send money by mistake to the wrong account.  Making a refund in the support service, it will take at least 7 days to wait for the money to be credited.  After entering the details, it is necessary to verify them again to make sure that everything is written down correctly. </p><h2>  Which terminals are better to use </h2><p>  Many bank account holders ask not only how to put money on the card through the terminal, but also which is better to use.  There are many official ATMs as well as intermediaries that offer their services in the financial market. </p><div class="photo" data-original="alterainvest.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="QIWI Terminal" class="if uuid-2953242" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/2953242.jpg"></div><p>  It all depends on what types of cards and which bank are used.  It is better to specify in advance in the department or on the official website of the institution the information in which places it is possible to send money to an account and how beneficial it is. </p>
