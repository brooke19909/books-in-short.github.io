In our review, we will present the best hotels of the city, as well as provide reviews of former guests. </p><h2>  Hotel list </h2><p>  To have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe possible accommodation options in this city near Moscow, pay attention to the list of hotels in Podolsk, compiled taking into account the category and location. </p><p>  Hotels with 3 stars: </p><ul><li>  Mini-hotel "Diva". </li><li>  Hotel "Jungle, country club" Aivengo ". </li><li>  Hotel "Moscow-Podolsk". </li></ul><p>  Unrated hotels and hostels: </p><ul><li>  Hostel "Comfort". </li><li>  Hotel "Green". </li><li>  Hotel "Pakhra". </li><li>  Hostel "Podolsk". </li><li>  Hotel "Relax". </li><li>  Hotel "House of Scientists". </li><li>  Hotel "Sportivnaya". </li></ul><p>  Hotels near Podolsk: </p><ul><li>  Sanatorium "Erino". </li><li>  Park Hotel Fisherix. </li><li>  Hotel "Yasenki". </li></ul><h2>  Hotel "Moscow-Podolsk" </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews of tourists and travelers, one of the most worthy hotels of Podolsk (Moscow region) is considered to be "Moscow-Podolsk", located on the street.  <span>Clement Gottwald,</span> d. 1/42.  No wonder the hotel has 3 stars - it offers guests comfortable rooms and good service. </p><p>  Single room is 12 square meters.  meters will cost a tourist 2600 rubles, and this price includes a hearty, tasty breakfast.  Travelers positively note this service, they say that all the food is varied and fresh.  In addition, you can order something from the special children's menu in the on-site restaurant. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Also, tourists consider its convenient location, almost the very center of the city, an advantage of the hotel.  From here you can quickly get to anywhere in Podolsk itself, and to Moscow. </p><p>  This Podolsk hotel offers free check-in / check-out on an accelerated system, parking for private vehicles, Internet access.  The room has everything you need for a comfortable stay: a modern soft bed, telephone, refrigerator, bathroom with shower and hairdryer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="podmoskovye-podolsk-hotel.nochi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel &quot;Moscow-Podolsk&quot;" class="if uuid-2634568" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43516/2634568.jpg"></div><p>  Guest reviews speak of cleanliness in the hotel itself and in the rooms, every day they clean the room.  I also like the fact that smoking is prohibited throughout the hotel, which is very important for families with young children and people with respiratory diseases.  Based on their opinions, it can be concluded that the hotel fully justifies its "star" status, and those who settle in it will not be disappointed. </p><h2>  Jungle Hotel, Aivengo Country Club </h2><p>  If you want to stay not in the city center, but in the fresh air, tourists recommend paying attention to the Aivengo Hotel, which is located in the village of Aleksandrovka, which is 5 km from the central part of the city.  This is a whole complex where the entire infrastructure is thought out for a comfortable stay of guests. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Accommodation options at this Podolsk hotel are provided for every taste and budget.  For example, one room with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã12 square meters.  meters will cost a tourist 2600 rubles, and for a 2-seater suite with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã27 square meters.  meters will have to pay 5000 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pogostite.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jungle Hotel, Aivengo Country Club" class="if uuid-2634575" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43516/2634575.jpg"></div><p>  Tourists were very pleased that, regardless of the cost of the room, each guest is provided with a full complimentary breakfast.  In addition, the country club has several restaurants where you can have lunch and dinner without leaving the hotel.  Moreover, they claim that the dishes from the local chef are very tasty and varied. </p><p>  Mostly enthusiastic reviews deserved the infrastructure of this complex.  There is a billiard room, an indoor pool, a sauna and a spa, bowling and a real Russian bath.  I liked the horse club for those who were on a trip with children.  For a fee, it was possible to ride the baby on a horse under the supervision of an experienced instructor. </p><p>  The only negative reviews we managed to find about this place concern some hotel workers.  Someone complained that they had to wait a long time for checking into the room, and someone got a not perfectly clean room. </p><h2>  Hotel "Pakhra" </h2><p>  If when choosing a place of residence you focus not only on the stars, but also on the reviews of tourists, then you can pay attention to the hotel "Pakhra", which is located on the street.  Archival Ave, d. 3. Despite the fact that this hotel Podolsk (Moscow region) has been more than half a century old, it looks quite modern and comfortable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The hotel room stock includes more than 30 rooms with different sizes and, accordingly, cost.
