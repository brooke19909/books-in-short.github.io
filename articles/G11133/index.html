The city hosted the seventh Asian Games, in the framework of which competitions were held in skiing and speed skating, figure skating, biathlon, hockey and ski jumping. </p><p>  The most dramatic and qualitative changes occurred in the best ski resort of Almaty, Chimbulak.  It has acquired a modern look, and its technical equipment today meets the highest European standards.  At the same time, the cost of skiing and using the infrastructure of the complex is still pleasantly surprising.  The abundance of interesting tracks and accessibility are the main advantages of Chimbulak. </p>

    <h2>  Kazakhstan Alps </h2><p>  The ski resort of Almaty "Chimbulak" is often compared with the Austrian Alps.  Indeed, the capabilities of the winter center are not inferior, and sometimes surpass the resources of European bases.  On the territory of Chimbulak there are eight certified routes.  There are also unofficial ‚Äúblack‚Äù slopes, as well as speed and slalom slopes. </p><p>  The maximum elevation difference in the resort is 900 meters.  In addition to the ski slopes, there is a snowboard park.  All lower levels of the tracks are regularly processed by powerful snowmasters.  Each route is equipped with its own lift.  The base slopes are served by a chairlift and cableway.  At the very top position of the middle station visitors are delivered by a tow-lift.  Athletes overcome insignificant distances between other starting points on ‚Äúbaby lifts‚Äù. </p>

    <p>  Despite the fact that Chimbulak was recognized as the best ski resort in Almaty, city residents warmly respond to another sports center located a few kilometers from the metropolis.  This is the ski resort "Akbulak" (Almaty).  The spurs of the Soldier Gorge hide it from prying eyes. </p><p>  In addition to cross-country skiing and downhill skiing, in Akbulak you can freely ride on tubing, for which a separate track is allocated.  The vertical drop in these parts is almost a thousand meters.  The slopes of the sports base are subject to artificial snowmaking.  The tilt angle of the most difficult descent is 55 degrees.  Its route partially runs through a pine forest.  On weekends, Akbulak hosts mass night skiing. </p><p>  Starting in November, an equipment rental service has been operating.  Equipment from leading brands Salomon, Burton, Rossignol will cost from 5,000 to 10,000 tenge.  The cost of a coach starts at five thousand. </p><h2>  Back to the past </h2><p>  Almatau, a ski resort near Almaty, is considered the oldest in Kazakhstan.  It occupies a height of 1,970 meters above sea level and is located half an hour from the southern capital.  Its territory belongs to the Ile-Alatau park.  The lack of professional ‚Äúblack‚Äù slopes more than compensates for the abundance of family fun. </p><p>  Children expect a sleigh race, snowball games, the construction of ice castles.  For skiing, only one track is provided, which has a diverse relief.  It is serviced by a lift.  The cost of a single trip to the top is about 200 tenge.  Subscription price per day - 2,000. </p>
