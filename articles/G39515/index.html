Initially, it was 2.7 km long and 70 meters wide. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="colossi of memnon" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/592009.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It was possible to enter the temple sanctuary through the utility rooms located in the alcove of the lobby. </p><p>  The pylon attached to the building by Ramses is expertly painted with scenes of military campaigns on the Hittites.  The Temple of Amon in Luxor is composed of numerous painted pillared halls and courtyards.  At the very end of the courtyard there are pharaoh sculptures made of granite by the best sculptors of that time.  Their height is 7 meters. </p><h2>  Karnak complex </h2><p>  This temple ensemble is famous far beyond the borders of the country.  In ancient times, there was the legendary city of Thebes.  It occupies the largest area.  With the Luxor temple it is united by the alley of the Sphinxes.  Karnak is the largest complex of Luxor.  It testifies to the achievements of ancient Egypt. </p><p>  It consists of three main buildings - the temples of Amun, Montu and Mut.  It occupies approximately 100 hectares of land.  The distance from the city of Luxor to the complex is three kilometers.

It is located in its very center.  To the north of it is the Montu Temple.  Next to it are the cathedrals that were dedicated to the goddess Mut and the deity Ptah. </p><p>  Not far from the complex are small churches and very small Christian chapels.

    <h2>  Obelisks </h2><p>  An obelisk was discovered on the territory of this unique complex of Luxor.  Its height is 21 meters.  Weight - 43 tons.  It was erected by Thutmose.  The obelisk remained in its original form, today you can see ancient inscriptions on it. </p><p>  There is another similar design.  <span>This is an obelisk</span> dedicated to the Queen of Egypt Hatshepsut.  In height, it reaches 29 meters, and its weight exceeds 320 tons! </p><p>  When Queen Hatshepsut passed away, the throne of Ancient Egypt was taken by Thutmose III, who ordered to enclose the obelisk with a huge wall.  Thus, he tried to destroy the memory of his predecessor.  He believed that this method would cost him less, because in this case he did not have to destroy the magnificent structure.  The huge obelisk was made of pink granite. </p><p>  Luxor (the photo of which you see in our article) and Karnak in particular are invited to see the temple in this complex, built by Philip Archidaus - brother of Alexander the Great. </p><h2>  Colossi of Memnon </h2><p>  For more than 3,500 years, these statues have silently sat on their pedestals, guarding the entrance to the magnificent funeral cathedral, which was built by the powerful ruler of Egypt, Amenhotep III.  The city of Luxor (Egypt) carefully preserves these greatest treasures.  Two huge statues - this is the ruler himself - are seated on a throne, facing towards the sun.  His hands are folded on his knees, and at the feet are the figures of two beautiful women - a mother and a wife.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthis complex is 35 hectares.  The sons of the great ruler could not surpass their father and create something more perfect. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="amon temple in luxor" class="if" height="428" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/592011.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Somewhat later, the Colossi of Memnon began to ‚Äúsing‚Äù, due to structural damage.  This phenomenon began to attract thousands of curious travelers from all over the world who want to hear and see this miracle.  But the emperor of Rome, <span>Septimius Severus,</span> intervened in this process, and in 199 gave the order to fasten the damaged parts, "to please the oracle."  After that, ‚Äúsinging‚Äù stopped forever. </p><p>  The city of Luxor (Egypt), tours of which must certainly be included in the tourist list, if your plans include visiting this country, not only surprises visitors.  It would seem that everything is already known about the Colossi of Memnon.  However, this is not so; they continue to amaze.  An Egyptologist from Germany, Rainer Stadelmann, while carrying out restoration work, discovered polychrome murals on headdresses of statues, a preserved eyeliner of his eyes that had been broken by then. </p><p>  In a small article, it is impossible to describe the city of Luxor.  Egypt, whose attractions are famous all over the world, attracts many tourists to its ancient lands.  Come and you - the trip will be unforgettable. </p>
