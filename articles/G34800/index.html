The unique geographical location, the growing influence of the <span>Moscow principality</span> in the northeastern lands and the joining <span>policies of the Moscow princes</span> very quickly made Moscow the new center of the Russian state. </p><h2>  Prerequisites for elevation </h2><p>  Chronicles written after the death of Andrei Bogolyubsky mention Moscow as a city in which Muscovites live - residents of Moscow.  The name of the city is found in the annals of many military events of that time.  Moscow has become a point on the map, in which they meet friends and reflect the onslaught of enemies.  A small recent town is quickly becoming a special city of personal reign.  The transfer of the metropolitan department from Vladimir to Moscow would not have taken place if the latter had not had the necessary size and influence by the middle of the fourteenth century. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transfer of the metropolitan department from Vladimir to Moscow date" class="if" height="421" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1230449.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Formation of a new Orthodox center </h2><p>  The famous Ivan Kalita made Moscow the center of not only political, but also religious life.  Prior to this, the center of worship and the permanent residence of the metropolitan was Vladimir on Klyazma.  The passage of time and the constant maneuvering between the obstinate princes, the Tatar proteges and his own rebellious people reduced the value of Vladimir.  The battle for the status of the center of Russian Orthodoxy broke out between Moscow and its eternal rival - Tver. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The fight for the Metropolitan </h2><p>  The transfer of the metropolitan department from Vladimir was accompanied by a fierce struggle between Moscow and Tver.  The princes of these lands vied with each other to try to please the Tatar Khan, trying to persuade the omnipotent Mongols to their side.  Meanwhile, a monk from one of the Tver monasteries wrote a complaint to Constantinople about <span>Metropolitan Peter.</span>  The facts of simony (distribution of church posts) and neglect of church duties were expressed. </p><p>  For the lord of all Russia, a real threat of deposition arose.  But such an event would not have been possible without the approval of the numerous Russian clergy, and church Tatar khans and their mediators preferred not to interfere in the affairs.  More important for them were taxes and tributes regularly brought by the Russian princes.  And the khans preferred not to discuss the spiritual side of life and did not exert influence on church policy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transfer of the metropolitan department from Vladimir to Moscow" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1230445.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <p>  The ascension of Peter to the throne of the Metropolitan was not without the influence of the Moscow princes.  Having gained spiritual authority over the Orthodox, Peter did not forget the services rendered and fully supported the Moscow rulers.  He lived for a long time in Moscow, and died there, and was buried.  Numerous offerings and petitions of the Moscow princes did their job - the late Metropolitan Peter was canonized under the name of the first miracle worker in Moscow and All Russia.  The transfer of the Metropolitan Department from Vladimir on Klyazma to Moscow has already become a half-resolved issue. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Successor of the miracle worker </h2><p>  The successor to Peter was the newly-called Greek Phyognost.  At the end of 1327, the Patriarch of Isaiah of Constantinople appointed him the <span>Kiev Metropolitan</span> with a permanent place of service in Moscow. </p><p>  In 1328, Fiognost visited the north-eastern Russian lands, which, at the request of the Galician and Lithuanian princes, was allocated a separate metropolis.  But Fiognost was not satisfied with the modest position of patriarch of the county town.  He set out to unite northern and eastern Russia under one Orthodox cross.  It was under him that the transfer of the Metropolitan Department from Vladimir to Moscow became finally possible.  The date of the upcoming event was agreed with Constantinople.  The phiognost set out to surpass all known Russian cities and make Moscow the single center of the Orthodox world. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transfer of the Metropolitan Department from Vladimir to Moscow year" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1230459.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Improvement of the capital </h2><p>  Perhaps the transfer of the metropolitan pulpit from Vladimir to Moscow under Prince Kalita would not have taken place if there had not been such active support for the new metropolitan.  Under him, the construction of the Assumption Church was completed, and in 1328 two stone churches were built - an unprecedented innovation for the capital.  The Church of St. Peter the Apostle and St. Ivan Climacus became another stage in strengthening the significance of Moscow. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Solemn transfer </h2><p>  In the mid 30-ies of the 14th century, the active work of Theognostus as Metropolitan brought the first significant results.  The canonization of the miracle worker Peter attracted a lot of pilgrims and clergymen to Moscow.  Constant violent religious activity did not go unnoticed in the Patriarchate of Constantinople - the influence of the new metropolitan extended to all Russian lands. </p><p>  At the highest levels, the transfer of the metropolitan chair from Vladimir to Moscow began to be discussed.  The year 1326 was a period of final decision.  The full approval of the Moscow princes, by then already bearing the title of ‚ÄúAll Russia,‚Äù the support of the Patriarch of Constantinople and the policy of non-intervention of the Golden Horde completed the work.  The transfer of the Metropolitan Department from Vladimir to Moscow was completed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transfer of the metropolitan department from Vladimir" class="if" height="216" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1230460.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Consequences of the transfer </h2><p>  This event was a landmark for the Moscow prince.  It repeatedly strengthened the position of secular power, equating it with the spiritual.  The phiognost was entirely on the side of Ivan Kalita, helping the latter in joining the neighboring lands to the Moscow principality.  For example, Fiognost widely used the privilege of the popes to impose and remove curses not only on individuals, but even on cities and lands.  So he cursed the residents of Pskov and its environs for refusing to extradite the Tver prince to Khan Ulugbek, thereby provoking the owner of the Golden Horde to new raids and destruction.  The anathema yielded tangible results - the Prince of Tver Alexander Mikhailovich left Pskov and went to the Principality of Lithuania.  After that, the curse was lifted. </p><h2>  The formation of Moscow as the center of the Orthodox world </h2><p>  It is difficult to give a full assessment of all the benefits that the transfer of the metropolitan chair from Vladimir to Moscow brought to the new capital.  The date of this event (1326) is reflected in many chronicles and chronicles as a turning point in the life of the Moscow principality. </p><p>  According to the old concept of the structure of the universe, both secular and spiritual authority are equivalent and united.  Therefore, the fact that both the sovereign and the metropolitan simultaneously lived in the reigning city was natural and desirable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transfer of the metropolitan department from Vladimir on Klyazma to Moscow" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1230461.jpg" width="471"></div>

    <h2>  Politics and the Church </h2><p>  Based on these principles, both secular and spiritual authority was equally beneficial to transfer the metropolitan pulpit from Vladimir to Moscow.  The year 1328 was remembered by chroniclers in church festivals, which were especially widely celebrated during this period. </p><p>  It was a time of relatively peaceful coexistence between the Moscow Principality and the Golden Horde - Moscow was rich and prosperous.  The princely court and the court of the metropolitan were located nearby, and in splendor and wealth they were not inferior to each other.  Magnificent processions and divine services on the occasion of the presentation to the bishops gathered in the capital all the color of the <span>church hierarchy</span> with distinguished guests from eastern Russian lands and from Constantinople itself.  All the magnificent festivities were held in Moscow with a large crowd of people.  It was possible to dispute Moscow‚Äôs claims to the surrounding lands, but religious authority was undeniable: ignoring the Moscow Metropolitan threatened with excommunication. </p><h2>  Why did it happen </h2><p>  One of the most important facts, due to which the transfer of the Metropolitan Department from Vladimir to Moscow did take place, was the provision of various significant benefits and monetary allowances.  Compared to what church officials in neighboring principalities received, the benefits were unheard of, and the donations were huge.  The Moscow princes did not risk anything - their position was so strong that they could confidently choose among the bishops the most loyal. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transfer of the metropolitan department from Vladimir to Moscow under the prince" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1230448.jpg" width="375"></div>  The unique <span>geographical position of Moscow</span> and the proximity of relations with Constantinople played a significant role.  An important argument was the fact that the Metropolitan of All Russia did not infringe on anyone's interests among the church authorities, therefore he was equally loyal to all bishops.  Metropolitan Peter began to establish the superiority of the Moscow Patriarchate, and his successor worthily completed the transformation of Moscow into the capital of the Orthodox faith.
