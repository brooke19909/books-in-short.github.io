But, despite this, it has a rich history, and the <span>sights of Maloyaroslavets are</span> known far beyond its borders. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The question of how many kilometers from Moscow to Maloyaroslavets is asked by both residents of the capital who decided to see the less well-known cities of their vast Motherland, and the people who got here on the way.  After all, knowing the answer, you can decide how much time and money it will take to travel. </p><p>  As for the distance between the mentioned cities, it is 121 km.  Owners of their own cars should go along the Kaluga highway.  Those who prefer to travel by public transport, it is most convenient to use the train "Moscow-Kaluga", which stops in Maloyaroslavets. </p>

    <h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  The city was founded by Prince V.A. the Brave.  The exact date is unknown, researchers suggest that this happened in the XIV - early XV centuries.  The village was named after the princely son Yaroslav.  In 1485, the town became part of the Moscow Principality and became known as Maloyaroslavets.  Since 1508, the settlement was in the hands of Prince M.L. Glinsky, and at the beginning of the 17th century it was ruined. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Maloyaroslavets suffered heavy losses during the Patriotic War of 1812 and World War II.  However, in both cases, the city was conquered, and only some of the sights of Maloyaroslavets today remind of those difficult times. </p><h2>  Monuments </h2><p>  Since Maloyaroslavets was founded by Prince Brave (Donskoy), it would be surprising if there was no monument to this man on his territory.  True, they installed it only in 2002, in honor of the 600th anniversary of the town.  The monument was created by sculptor Anatoly Efimovich Artimovich.  It is located at the beginning of Kaluga street.  It is with him, probably, that one should begin to explore the sights of Maloyaroslavets. </p><p>  Another famous object in the city is the monument to S.I.  Belyaev - the secretary of the Zemstvo court, who was the ranger of the military cordons.  A monument is located at the foot of the <span>Barrow of Glory,</span> which symbolizes the strategic victory of the Russian imperial army near Maloyaroslavets in the war of 1812.  The monument was created in October 1844. </p><p>  The attention of residents and visitors to the city deserves a monument to Georgy Konstantinovich Zhukov, authored by sculptor Anatoly Artimovich.  The bust was installed in 2005. </p>

    <h2>  Monasteries and churches of Maloyaroslavets </h2><p>  Nicholas Chernoostrovsky Monastery is an ancient shrine, the location of which also became Maloyaroslavets.  A map of the city will help each tourist to find the sights, and among them there will certainly be the mentioned object located in the eastern part of the village.  The monastery is surrounded by a double wall, behind which the Korsunsky church, the hospital building, a three-tier bell tower and St. Nicholas Cathedral are also preserved.  The monastery was completely destroyed during the events of 1812.  At that time only the Holy Blue Gate survived.  But after the French retreat, the place of worship was restored, and today everyone who wants to see the ancient sights of Maloyaroslavets will certainly become its visitors. </p>
