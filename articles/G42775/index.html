And this is not at all surprising.  Indeed, even despite the abundance of shops and the assortment of goods in them, sometimes it‚Äôs not possible to find something specific at all, no matter how hard you try.  In addition, each person is unique.  And he wants the things around him to be appropriate.  But, coming to numerous shopping centers, we stumble upon completely identical items that differ from each other only in price. </p><p>  Therefore, a huge number of people begin to invent and make amazing crafts out of a variety of improvised materials.  Which, with due diligence, become real masterpieces. </p><p>  For those who are just starting to ‚Äúcreate‚Äù in this way, this article is written.  In it, we will look at how to make original flower pots with your own hands. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yoamolasmanualidades.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY flower pots" class="if uuid-2303677" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2303677.jpg"></div><h2>  The simplest product </h2><p>  If you don‚Äôt have much time, but still want to create an interesting craft, this option is suitable.  Because it is performed simply and quickly, but it turns out very beautifully. </p><p>  Necessary materials: </p><ul><li>  flower pot; </li><li>  small pebbles, beads or shells; </li><li>  small brush with stiff bristles; </li><li>  PVA glue. </li></ul><p>  Working process: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  To make the original flower pot with your own hands, you just need to glue the surface of the prepared flower pot with glue. </li><li>  Then gently stick beads or shells on it.  If you want to decorate the cache-pot with pebbles, they should be washed in advance under the tap and dried. </li><li>  Leave the craft to dry for 5-6 hours. </li></ol><h2>  Twigs and pencils </h2><p>  Also very unusual are flowerpots, pasted over with tree branches.  You can see them in the photo below.  But for their implementation you will need a cylindrical flower pot or an iron can, for example from paint. </p><div class="photo" data-original="decoracion.facilisimo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY flower pots" class="if uuid-2302699" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2302699.jpg"></div><p>  And by the same technology it is easy to make a cache-pot from simple or colored pencils.  To do this, choose a suitable flower pot and buy a set of pencils.  Perhaps even a couple of packs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pohudetbystro.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself street planter" class="if uuid-2303525" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2303525.jpg"></div><h2>  Clothespin option </h2><p>  Another very easy and interesting craft is also made from an iron can.  Only in this case, you need a low one, for example, from under any canned fish.  The main thing is to pretreat its edges so that in the process of creativity you will not cut yourself.  Ready-made hand-made flower pots are suitable for the garden, and for the home. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.faithtap.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY flower pots photo" class="if uuid-2302738" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2302738.jpg"></div><p>  Necessary materials: </p><ul><li>  iron can; </li><li>  wooden clothespins; </li><li>  acrylic paints. </li></ul><p>  Performing such a craft is very simple.  You just need to attach clothespins along the edge of the can. </p><p>  And then decorate the finished product from the outside with acrylic paints.  Both random strokes and a decorated sketch of a picture made with a simple pencil will look very cool. </p><h2>  For wine cork collectors </h2><p>  A rather unusual look is a self-made flower pot, the photo of which is presented below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.buzzfeed.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a flower pot with your own hands" class="if uuid-2302828" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2302828.jpg"></div><p>  It is very simple to make, it is much more difficult to assemble the basic details.  After all, they will need a lot.  True, depending on how tall and wide the flower pot you want to decorate.  But at least twenty pieces will have to be prepared. </p><p>  Necessary materials: </p><ul><li>  wooden <span>corks from wine</span> ; </li><li>  iron can or pot; </li><li>  wire; </li><li>  awl; </li><li>  PVA glue. </li></ul><p>  Working process: </p><ol><li>  To create such a miracle, you should make holes in the middle of all traffic jams with an awl in advance. </li><li>  Then put them on as many pieces per wire as there are rows to fit from the base of the pot to its top. </li><li>  On finished "kebabs" pour glue on the beginning and the end.  This is required so that the plugs do not slip and break the structure. </li><li>  Leave them to dry for four hours. </li><li>  When the specified time expires, you can proceed to gluing the pot or jar. </li><li>  To do this, it is enough to draw a zigzag ‚Äúglue‚Äù line on one side of the cork part, and then attach it to the base. </li><li>  Having done a similar procedure with all the prepared elements, we leave the finished craft to dry overnight. </li></ol><h2>  For people who prefer naturalness </h2><p>  A wonderful idea, which is not difficult to put into practice, is the ‚Äúwooden‚Äù planter for the garden.  With his own hands, both a man and a woman can make it.  The main thing is to study the following picture or detailed instructions below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kedicci.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a flower pot with your own hands" class="if uuid-2302967" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2302967.jpg"></div><p>  Necessary materials: </p><ul><li>  iron can, for example, from canned peas or corn: </li><li>  branches of trees of different thicknesses, but not more than a finger; </li><li>  garden secateurs; </li><li>  PVA glue. </li></ul><p>  Working process: </p><ol><li>  To do this, the pots should be cut into twigs. </li><li>  Then stick them to the prepared container. </li><li>  Allow to dry overnight. </li></ol><h2>  A budget option </h2><p>  For people who do not want to spend money, we propose to make a flower pot with your own hands from materials that are in large quantities in any house. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thekavicliving.weebly.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="planter do it yourself" class="if uuid-2302889" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2302889.jpg"></div><p>  Necessary materials: </p><ul><li>  cardboard box made from juice, kefir, milk, etc .; </li><li>  a piece of fabric of any color or pattern; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  glue. </li></ul><p>  Working process: </p><ol><li>  The first step is to cut the prepared fabric into equal strips. </li><li>  Then prepare the container that we will paste over.  To do this, cut the box in half.  We will need the part where the bottom is. </li><li>  Lubricate it with glue and wrap with a cloth, as shown in the figure above. </li></ol><h2>  "Fabric" cache-pot.  Stage one </h2><p>  Very original and somewhat extravagant and noble look vases for flowers that look like they are made of fabric.  Although in reality this is only half true. </p><p>  If the reader of this article is a girl or a woman, they should not be scared.  Because they themselves, without the help of a friend, brother or husband, will be able to bring an interesting idea to life.  After all, it‚Äôs very simple to make such a cache-pot for a summer house. </p><p>  Necessary materials: </p><ul><li>  jar of the right size; </li><li>  a piece of fabric with which it can be covered; </li><li>  rubber gloves (you can take ordinary household gloves); </li><li>  cement; </li><li>  water; </li><li>  paint is optional. </li></ul><p>  The most difficult thing that can cause a lot of questions for the fair sex is how to make a cement mortar.  Therefore, we will begin our step-by-step instruction with an explanation of this point. </p><h2>  Stage Two </h2><p>  Working process: </p><ol><li>  In reality, there is no difficulty in this matter.  You just need to mix water and cement in equal proportions.  Then mix everything thoroughly until smooth. </li><li>  The product must be started immediately, because otherwise the solution may freeze.  And we won‚Äôt do anything with him. </li><li>  So, we take the prepared jar and put it in the place where it will not interfere and can then dry dry. </li><li>  Now we put on gloves and put the fabric in a cement mortar. </li><li>  It is important to soak it completely, so that the finished craft turns out and stands for a long time, without breaking during the first gust of wind. </li><li>  We take out the fabric and cover it with a jar.  We straighten the folds so that they fall beautifully to the floor. </li><li>  Leave to dry for at least a day. </li></ol><p>  So we made with our own hands a street planter like that shown in the picture below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself flower pot for a summer residence" class="if uuid-2303024" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2303024.jpg"></div><h2>  Flower cat "Street cat" </h2><p>  A reader who wants to get something truly unique and even masterpiece will certainly enjoy the next master class.  After all, in it we will learn how to decorate your garden or lawn near the house with a charming cat.  Though a toy. </p><p>  Necessary materials: </p><ul><li>  five-liter plastic bottle; </li><li>  inflatable ball; </li><li>  six identical sticks thirty centimeters long and about a finger thick; </li><li>  wire; </li><li>  a lot of newspapers or the cheapest toilet paper; </li><li>  basin or any medium-sized container; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  glue "Moment"; </li><li>  glue for wallpaper (it will also require water); </li><li>  multi-colored oil or acrylic paints - optional. </li></ul><p>  Perhaps after reading the list of important components the reader had a thousand questions.  After all, it‚Äôs quite difficult to imagine, for example, how to make a flower pot with a bottle and a ball yourself.  But further instructions will certainly put everything in its place. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pic2viral.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY flower pots" class="if uuid-2303684" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2303684.jpg"></div><h2>  Step one </h2><p>  Make the body: </p><ol><li>  So, the first thing you need to cut off the neck of the bottle.  The part with the bottom will be a pot in which we will later put the earth and plant flowers. </li><li>  Now you should attach sticks imitating paws, neck and tail to it with the help of ‚ÄúMoment‚Äù glue.  Allow to dry for an hour. </li><li>  After the specified time, we proceed to the most interesting!  We take the container and prepare glue for wallpaper in it.  It is better to do this in advance so that it swells and insists. </li><li>  Next comes the turn of newspapers.  They can be torn into small pieces, or you can directly thoroughly (of course, one at a time) thoroughly soak in glue, and then stick to the frame - a bottle with ‚Äúlegs‚Äù. </li><li>  A reader who is familiar with papier-m√¢ch√© technique already understands what kind of manipulations we are doing.  Let us explain to beginners that in this way we form the body of the future cat. </li><li>  Having hidden the frame under the paper "armor", you need to leave the craft to dry.  At least for a day. </li></ol><h2>  Second step </h2><p>  Finish the product: </p><ol><li>  At this time, you can prepare the head of the "street cat".  To do this, take the ball and inflate it.  Then we paste over with newspapers or toilet paper.  The main thing is not to touch the ‚Äútail‚Äù of the ball and the area around it with a diameter of one or two centimeters. </li><li>  We attach the antennae from the wire, form the ears, muzzle and eyes. </li><li>  We send to the finished frame, giving the opportunity to completely dry our future planter. </li><li>  With our own hands we made a cat's body out of a plastic bottle, and with the help of a ball we built our head.  Thus, it is safe to say that the most difficult stage is behind.  Now you need to combine the main details of our original crafts. </li><li>  To do this, pierce the ball and carefully pull it out. </li><li>  Then glue ‚ÄúMoment‚Äù to smear the area around the stick - the cat‚Äôs neck.  Then put a head on her. </li><li>  Leave for an hour to dry. </li></ol><p>  In fact, that's all.  If desired, the ready-made cache-pot ‚ÄúStreet Cat‚Äù can be painted, or you can leave it like that.  It all depends on personal preference skills.  Although, of course, a colored cat, judging by the photo, looks much more interesting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.xfree.hu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY flower pots photo" class="if uuid-2303452" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2303452.jpg"></div><h2>  Cache-pot ‚ÄúCute kittens‚Äù </h2><p>  Of course, the flower pot described above can be installed right in the house.  But only in this case, a lot of space is needed, as well as the absence of pets that can climb into it and break it.  But it is much better to make another "cat" pots with your own hands. </p><p>  Necessary materials: </p><ul><li>  plastic bottle; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  acrylic or stained glass paints. </li></ul><p>  Working process: </p><ol><li>  Making this planter is very simple.  It is only necessary to cut the bottle into two parts.  But only in such a way that along the edge of the lower part (with a bottom), two triangular protrusions are obtained.  It will be ears. </li><li>  Now it is important to decide what color the cat will be.  And just such a paint to take for the foundation. </li><li>  Having covered the pots with it, you should leave the product to dry completely. </li><li>  Then proceed to the study of the details.  Draw ears, eyes, nose, mouth, antennae. </li><li>  When the craft finally dries, you can plant a flower in it. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.dailytrend.mx" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY plastic bottle pots" class="if uuid-2303478" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2303478.jpg"></div><h2>  Pot-vase from a plastic bottle </h2><p>  And how to make a flower pot with your own hands?  Believe me, the ideas of such crafts are more than enough.  The main thing is not to be lazy and choose the appropriate method for yourself.  And further we will consider a wonderful and easy-to-execute version.  Materials will be required the same as in the previous master class.  Only, besides them, you need a DVD-ROM. </p><p>  Working process: </p><ol><li>  The first step is to cut the bottle into two parts.  But not in a straight line, but in a wave. </li><li>  Then glue the neck and disc. </li><li>  Paint the finished product or decorate it with a pattern. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="pohudetbystro.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY flower pots" class="if uuid-2303521" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2303521.jpg"></div><p>  By the way, you can still make a hanging planter with your own hands.  To do this, using an awl, make four holes equally spaced from each other along the upper edge of the products described in this and the previous paragraphs.  And then stretch the twine through them. </p><h2>  Cache-pot "Marine option" </h2><p>  Another very simple idea.  It requires a minimum of time.  But the product looks quite worthy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pt.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY flower pots" class="if uuid-2303505" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2303505.jpg"></div><p>  Necessary materials: </p><ul><li>  a store flower pot, an iron can, or the bottom of a plastic bottle / cardboard box; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  stiff bristle brush; </li><li>  PVA glue; </li><li>  tourniquet, twine or regular knitting threads. </li></ul><p>  Working process: </p><ol><li>  To make pots of your own using a rope, you need to grease the surface of the prepared container with glue. </li><li>  Then wind a rope, cord or twine around it in even rows. </li><li>  If you want to make a pot of knitting threads, you should thread the thread into a needle with a big eye, then stick it into a tube of PVA glue and pull it out on the other side.  Then remove the needle and, winding the thread on the pot, ‚Äúmoisten‚Äù it in glue. </li><li>  Dry the finished craft for six hours. </li></ol>
