    <h2>  Starinov Ilya Grigoryevich: biography </h2><p>  He was born in <span>1900</span> in a small village in the territory of modern Oryol region, in an ordinary peasant family.  Since childhood, Ilya helped parents and worked hard.  In 1917, a civil war begins.  Soviet power is fighting on several fronts at once.  At the age of eighteen, Ilya Starinov enters the newly created Workers 'and Peasants' Red Army.  Training lasts a month, after which his unit is transferred south to fight the forces of Kornilov.  After the battle near Korocha, Starinov is injured, and the White Guards take him prisoner.  But after a short time, the fighter makes an escape and returns to duty.  After treatment, he begins his engineering career.  As part of the offensive group takes part in the expulsion of Wrangel from the Crimea.  After winning the Civil War for his skills, the command sends him to Voronezh for further training. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Military career </h2><p>  After graduating from the courses, Ilya Starinov goes to Kiev, where he commands the railway regiment.  His unit is engaged in the construction of the railway.  At the same time, Ilya himself is constantly studying, mastering all the subtleties of military art.  Two years later, he attends courses in Leningrad. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Starinov Ilya Grigorievich" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1318553.jpg" width="355"></div>  At the age of thirty, he personally designs sabotage equipment and trains fighters.  On the territory of the Ukrainian SSR, he creates units designed to conduct <span>partisan warfare</span> in the event of occupation.

    <h2>  Military theorist </h2><p>  After graduating, Starinov is appointed to the post of commandant of the railway station.  His tasks include escorting senior military and political figures.  In the thirties, a civil war erupted in Spain.  Left-wing revolutionaries are fighting the fascist regime of Franco.  The Soviet Union is supporting them.  Therefore, in the thirty-sixth year, Ilya Starinov was sent to Spain as a military adviser.  Using his knowledge, he trains resistance fighters.  Also prepares miners and sappers.  In a fairly short time, he became an adviser to the three-thousandth partisan corps.  He is directly involved in the planning of operations.  Thanks to the actions of Starinov, the Spanish partisans managed to blow up several trains with dignitaries, block the advance of the Francoists by rail for several days, destroy a significant amount of equipment and personnel near Madrid, and also conduct a number of other significant operations. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Homecoming </h2><p>  In the thirty-seventh year, Ilya Starinov returned to the USSR.  Upon arrival, reports on events in Spain to Clement Voroshilov.  Two years later, a new war begins.  Fearing Finland‚Äôs aggression, and also seeking to secure its borders, the Red Army goes on the offensive on the Karelian Isthmus.  There, Starinov is engaged in mine clearance and countering enemy saboteurs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Starinov Ilya Grigorievich" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/1318606.jpg"></div>  In the conditions of a fierce northern winter and a lack of food, Soviet troops suffered serious losses.

    <h2>  The Great Patriotic War </h2><p>  From the first days of the war, Starinov has been at the forefront.  In the context of the battle with the invaders on its territory, saboteur skills are needed more than ever.  In the summer of the forty-first, Starinov Ilya Grigoryevich heads the unit responsible for mining on the western front. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ilya Starinov biography" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1318555.jpg" width="600"></div>  He personally oversees five groups that carry out sapper work and block roads from advancing enemy troops.  With the rapid advance of the Wehrmacht units, the Red Army was forced to retreat east.  In the first months of the war, retreat often turns into a stampede, resulting in serious casualties.  Therefore, the activity of the <span>engineering troops</span> turned out to be very important <span>.</span>

    <p>  The efforts of Starinov damaged the railway near Kharkov, which greatly delayed the Nazis.  An operation was also carried out to liquidate Lieutenant General Beinecker, led by Ilya Starinov.  The saboteur planted a radio-controlled bomb in the general‚Äôs mansion, which was blown up during the Nazi banquet. </p><h2>  Organization of sabotage activities </h2><p>  After retreating for Don Starinov, he is in Rostov-on-Don and is engaged in minefields and sabotage.  In the winter of forty-second, saboteurs crossed the Taganrog Bay and seriously damaged the highway near Mariupol.  Starinov‚Äôs units also mined defense lines near Rzhev.  In the summer, Ilya Grigoryevich is engaged in the preparation of partisans. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Colonel Starinov Ilya Grigorievich" class="if" height="284" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1318556.jpg" width="400"></div>  During this period, the <span>partisan movement</span> is gaining strength and plays a significant role in the occupied territories.  Colonel Starinov Ilya Grigoryevich prepares special-purpose saboteurs who must perform complex tasks behind enemy lines.  In addition to military tactical skills, he was also an inventor.  Before the war, he wrote a work on mechanics, for which in the forty-fourth year he was awarded a scientific degree.
