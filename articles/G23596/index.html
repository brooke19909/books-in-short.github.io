  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Politics as an object of research at the present stage of development of society</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  To get any information, you need to research something or someone else.  What does the word ‚Äúresearch‚Äù mean?  "Research" - means to extract something from the "trace", in general, the restoration of a certain order of things on an indirect basis, a random object.  Here lies the concept of juxtaposing, analyzing facts and predicting a situation, the basic skill required of a researcher. </p><p>  <span>Research work</span> has a task, namely, the data of the primary sources, their creative analysis and the new conclusions made on its basis are compared.  How to prepare to conduct research?  Actions required are: </p><p>  1. The so-called object area, the object of study and the subject of research are determined; </p><p>  2. A topic is selected and formulated, its relevance is justified; </p><p>  3. The scientific literature is studied, and concepts are specified; </p><p>  4. The hypothesis is formulated; </p><p>  5. The goal directions and the area of ‚Äã‚Äãtasks of a specific study are formulated. </p><p>  What is an "object domain"?  The objectivity field is the science and practice where the object of study is located. </p><p>  What does the term <span>‚Äúresearch object‚Äù</span> mean <span>‚Äúresearch subject‚Äù?</span>  <span>The object of research is the</span> carrier of the problems to which the research activity is directed.  The subject of research is a specific part of the objects in the middle of which searches are conducted (phenomenon, individual side, some aspect, and so on).  Such an object of research is any unknown phenomenon that is previously unknown to science, or its half, which is supposed to be investigated by this science. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Most often they use the preliminary division of something that the unknown (unknown) into a logically substantiated and more or less well-known part of the phenomenon.  This is used as a completely independent scientific method, if such divisions are possible, given the a priori visible sign of these phenomena.  Such a division, given the alleged scope of applicability of one‚Äôs own science or some sciences, which are deduced in advance using a logical method, and are used in relation to the scope of a law according to which such a science or some sciences exist (in a complex study). </p><p>  This helps the scientist more easily cope with the often arising difficulty of studying complex phenomena. One of the most difficult objects for research is politics, due to its many-sided connections and aspects as a phenomenon.  The concept of politics as an object of research has long been known.  In general, politics as an object of research is the activity of a social group expressing the will and interests of both one organization or another and the individual.  Initially, the policy is designed to satisfy certain <span>social needs</span> that can be formulated in the political ideal and in the program. In this case, the needs are fixed in political terms and expressed in specific requirements or programs. In this example, by the way, we can see that the subject and object Research differs quite clearly. The object here is politics as a process, and the subject or subjects are the direct executors of this process. </p><p>  The <span>research topic is</span> also important <span>.</span>  <span>A topic</span> is a field through which research is carried out.  The research process itself is usually initiated by some problem that needs to be resolved.  The problem is a kind of controversial situation that arose as a result of the activity, with its help the research topic is determined, which requires resolution during research work.  The problem determines the tactics and research strategy.  The goal is the end result that the researcher would like to receive.  Often it is able to be formulated with the help of words: identification, establishment, justification, clarification, development. </p><p>  The goal is the perfect vision of results.  The objective of the study is the choice of methods and means to achieve the goal, given the hypothesis put forward. </p>
