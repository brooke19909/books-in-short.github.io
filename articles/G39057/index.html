The attraction is located 50 km north of Tel Aviv.  This settlement and the surrounding area belong to Caesarea National Park.  Here you can see many historical architectural objects, among which are buildings belonging to the ancient kingdom of Israel, the era of Byzantium and Ancient Rome. </p><h2>  History of the city, origin of the name </h2><p>  Caesarea was not built from scratch.  Initially, there was a Phoenician settlement, founded in the middle of the 4th century BC.  e.  In those days, the settlement was called the Tower of Charshon.  The army of the Jews led by Tsar Alexander Yannaya in 96 BC.  e.  captured the settlement.  But the city did not remain under Jewish control for long, since in 63 BC  e.  Judea was conquered by the Roman Empire. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.skr.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Caesarea Attractions Photos" class="if uuid-2637448" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32232/2637448.jpg"></div><p>  After Augustus Octavian became emperor of Rome, the settlement was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Jewish ruler, King Herod.  By 10 BC  e.  once a small settlement turned into a large port city.  To respect the Roman ruler, Herod decides to name the settlement Caesarea, that is, in honor of Caesar. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For some time the city was considered the main administrative unit of the Jewish province.  Most of the Roman legionnaires were based here.  Caesarea is mentioned in the New Testament, it was in this city that the apostle Paul was arrested and then transferred to Rome. </p><p>  Over the course of twelve centuries, the city was succeeded by many rulers.  After the fall of the Roman Empire, the dawn of Byzantium came.  The cultural heritage of these eras is partially preserved to this day. </p><p>  Caesarea was captured by the Arabs in 640 and from a Christian settlement turned into a Muslim fortress.  The city played a special role during the Crusades.  Many rulers of those years wanted to possess it. </p><p>  The city was repeatedly destroyed, but completely ceased to exist in 1265, after the Mamluk attack led by Sultan Beibars. </p><div class="photo" data-original="celebrationscakedecorating.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Caesarea Attractions" class="if uuid-2637453" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32232/2637453.jpg"></div><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Caesarea is one of the country's main attractions in Israel.  This place is visited by millions of tourists every year.  Of great interest is the unique architecture.  To this day, archaeological excavations are carried out on the territory of the national park, and since the sea level has changed significantly, work has to be carried out even under water.  In the process of researching the ancient settlement, scientists discovered the ruins of the Roman theater, which was built during the time of the Jewish ruler - Herod the Great.  At the moment, the historical and architectural find is fully restored and has a pristine appearance.  The stands accommodate up to 4 thousand spectators.  The ancient theater is not the only attraction of Caesarea.  Photos of unique architectural buildings will be presented in the article. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="blog.livedoor.jp" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Caesarea Attractions" class="if uuid-2637434" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32232/2637434.jpg"></div><h2>  Reef Palace </h2><p>  This building once belonged to Herod the Great.  The palace was a two-story building, built in the style of the ancient Roman era.  There were numerous terraces, columns, atriums and mosaic floors.  Near the palace was a swimming pool, which, according to scientists, the locals used as a fish market.  Now this Caesarea attraction is a ruin that has preserved a piece of the history of the majestic city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ka.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="reef palace" class="if uuid-2637461" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32232/2637461.jpg"></div><h2>  Temple Site </h2><p>  This Caesarea attraction is located on the Mediterranean coast near the ancient palace belonging to Herod.  Even during the reign of this ruler, a temple complex was erected, from which only separate fragments have survived to this day.  On the hill stood a temple built in honor of the great Caesar Augustus and Roma - forefather and founder of Rome.  After the complex was destroyed, an octagonal church was erected in its place.  Against the backdrop of aggressive wars and a change of government, this Christian shrine could not resist.  A Muslim mosque was built on the site of the ancient temple, and then a Catholic cathedral.  None of these structures have survived to this day.  How they looked, you can only guess. </p><p>  The temple platform has a small height - about 10 meters, but from this place a beautiful panoramic view of the ancient city opens. </p><div class="photo" data-original="etc.ancient.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="temple site" class="if uuid-2637468" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32232/2637468.jpg"></div><h2>  What sights are worth seeing? </h2><p>  If you are going to go to Israel, you should take note of the most popular Caesarea sights: </p><ol><li>  Hippodrome.  The construction of this grandiose structure began in the II century.  Chariot competitions were held at the hippodrome.  The number of seats was up to 30 thousand. </li><li>  The site of the statues.  This Caesarea landmark is a long street with two statues made of porcelain and white marble, which belong to the Byzantine culture. </li><li>  Lower aqueduct.  With the help of this grandiose structure, water was delivered to the city from an artificial reservoir. </li><li>  Upper aqueduct.  Used in the era of Rome and Byzantium to provide urban population with water.  The height of the aqueduct is 8 m above sea level. </li><li>  Amphitheater.  This architectural complex was used to entertain the public.  There were gladiatorial fights, sports, theatrical performances and chariot competitions.  The amphitheater is equipped with an arena and tiers made in the form of an elongated horseshoe.  The structure was built during the reign of Herod. </li><li>  Bath complex.  This building impresses tourists with its decoration.  Presumably, the baths were built relatively later than the amphitheater of King Herod. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="angrybirdsriogame.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Caesarea National Park" class="if uuid-2637518" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32232/2637518.jpg"></div><p>  Architectural structures that keep centuries-old secrets are not the only attractions of Caesarea.

It presents the work of artists of Hispanic descent.  Although this museum in Caesarea is not included in the standard program, it is definitely worth a visit. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.123rf.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rally museum" class="if uuid-2637520" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32232/2637520.jpg"></div><p>  The building area is about 9 thousand meters.
