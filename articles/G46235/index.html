  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to change the keyboard and language on Xiaomi?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the past few years, Xiaomi products have literally flooded our markets and stores.  And this is not surprising, because this company is perhaps the leader in the ratio between price and quality: the company's products (both phones and tablets) are in demand among consumers for a low price and excellent characteristics. </p><p>  One of the few drawbacks of the company is the frequent lack of global Russian-language firmware.  It happens that the goods are delivered without our native language and the device must be carried to a service center for flashing.  Because of this, users often wonder how to change the keyboard on Xiaomi.  In general, this is not difficult to do, and it will not take much time. </p><p>  This article will talk about how to change the keyboard on Xiaomi.  For example, two devices will be presented: a Redmi 4A phone and a Mi Pad 2 tablet. Of course, it is very important that the control interface is convenient, and the spelling of characters is easy.  So, how to change the keyboard on Xiaomi Redmi? </p><h2>  Keyboard selection </h2><p>  In order to see which keyboard is used in your device at the moment, you need to go to "Settings" and click on the "Advanced" or "Advanced" button (depends on the firmware of the device and the model itself).  Next, click "Language and Input", where in the "Input Methods" the current keyboard is clearly shown, as well as options for replacing it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mi-ru.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Change the input method in the settings" class="if uuid-2965685" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/2965685.jpg"></div><p>  It is worth saying that the keyboard from Google - Gboard, many like it for its standard strict design.  For those who do not like to be distracted by various little things, it is ideal.  It works with virtually no lags.  Unlike SwiftKey, Gboard lacks emojis and the ability to type with gestures.  At the same time, for quick switching from letters to numbers and other signs, there is a button located at the bottom left.  There is also a language switch key. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If we talk about another keyboard preinstalled in the smartphone, then it is worth mentioning a wide variety of themes and colors, as shown in the photo. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="The presence of different themes on the SwiftKey keyboard" class="if uuid-2965653" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/2965653.jpg"></div><p>  In SwiftKey it is possible to make the buttons flat or three-dimensional, as well as put a photo or picture from the camera on the background of the selected theme.  To switch to another language, you need to hold &lt;Space&gt; by swiping on it.  Another feature is the ability to switch to additional characters by holding the buttons.  This will significantly reduce the loss of time in the process of communication. </p><p>  The <span>Xiaomi</span> Mi Pad 2 <span>tablet</span> also has the ability to switch to <span>voice input.</span>  A very convenient feature for those who print for a long time.  Also, as shown in the photo below, there are settings of the physical (external) keyboard. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="There is a physical keyboard" class="if uuid-2969275" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/2969275.jpg"></div><h2>  Language selection </h2><p>  In Russified devices, by default, two languages ‚Äã‚Äãare installed in input methods - English and Russian.  How to change the language on the Xiaomi keyboard?  There is nothing complicated.  You just need to click on the current name of the keyboard available to us, usually it is Gboard or SwiftKey, and then on "Languages", where you can add any of the presented. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Choosing a language on a Xiaomi tablet" class="if uuid-2969274" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/2969274.jpg"></div><h2>  Other options </h2><p>  What if none of the input methods pre-installed by the developer were liked?  How then to change the keyboard on Xiaomi?  To the rescue comes Play Market - a store of games and applications on Android.  There you can download GO Keyboard, Cheetah Keyboard, Facemoji Keyboard - an abundance of keyboards to the taste of the user. </p><p>  So, choosing the input method for yourself, typing is much easier and more convenient. </p>
