Ataman forest</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>Stary Oskol, the</span> sights of which we will consider in the article, is one of the oldest cities in the European part of the country.  At first it was called Oskol, and only with time did the word Old add to it.  The order for its construction was given by the son of Ivan the Terrible - Tsar <span>Fedor Ivanovich.</span>  In the modern city there is a monument dedicated to its builders - the governor Ivan Solntsev-Zasekin, the head of Ivan Myasny and the clerk Mikhail Nechaev.  This is a three-meter sculpture depicting the first builders of the city in full growth.  Having emerged as a border town seven years before the beginning of the seventeenth century, it was an outpost of Russian lands from the raids of the Tatars.  And city residents successfully coped with this task. </p><h2>  Ataman forest </h2><p>  Stary Oskol is a city of glory for Russian weapons.  During World War II, fierce battles took place here.  Parts of the Soviet army heroically defended the city.  The headquarters was located in the Ataman Forest, where a strategy to contain the fascist German forces was developed. </p>

    <p>  As a result of titanic efforts, the infantry divisions frustrated the plans of the Nazis and did not pass them through the Don.  Now, those who visit the Ataman forest (Stary Oskol) will see a memorial complex there.  Here are the mass graves of the fighters who defended their homeland. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Zoo </h2>

    <p>  Municipal Starooskolsky Zoo is located on the Chumaki farm.  It contains about five hundred species of animals and more than one and a half thousand birds.  What is the Stary Oskol Zoo proud of?  It has an extensive population of pheasants, which totals half of the species existing in the world. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ataman forest old splinter" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/1401250.jpg" width="450"></div></h2><h2>  Arboretum </h2><p>  No less beautiful natural attraction of the city is the Starooskolsky <span>dendrological park.</span>  There are about one hundred and fifty different trees and shrubs, as well as a unique clearing-lecture hall.  A board is installed under the wooden roof, and instead of chairs, students can sit on comfortable stumps with backs that are randomly placed on a site covered with gravel.  Students will be very useful to listen to a lecture on the world of flora in this class in the fresh air. </p><h2>  Museum of Local Lore </h2><p>  Traditionally, the history of the region can be found in the local museum of local lore, which was founded in 1923.  Now it is located in a house that once belonged to the merchant Likhushin.  In addition to rich expositions, the Stary Oskol Museum of Local Lore offers tourists travel to the ancient Russian city of Holki.  There you can also see an underground monastery in the <span>chalk mountains.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Kholkovsky monastery </h2><p>  Holy Trinity <span>Kholkovsky Monastery</span> is located near the village of Kholki.  This is one of the oldest shrines in the country.  Legend has it that it is based on the meeting place of Prince Igor Svyatoslavovich and his brother Vsevolod before the campaign of Polovtsians sung in epics in 1185.  In the so-called Sign Mountains, there are caves of the monastery.  In order to hide in time from the raids of the Tatars, a Sign Gatehouse was built on the highest hill.  From it, observations were made of the steppe, from where unkind horsemen could appear at any moment.  In the middle of the eighteenth century, a wooden chapel was erected in front of the cave.  The monastery was persecuted in the eighteenth century and was closed.  In the thirties of the nineteenth century, Prince Golitsyn tried to resume the activity of the holy monastery, not sparing his own means for this, but, unfortunately, he did not succeed. </p>

    <p>  Now among the picturesque green hills you can see the white stone chapel, at some distance from it, the Transfiguration Church.  Churches amaze with their amazing modest beauty.  Snow-white walls, not blue, but somewhat gray roofs and magnificent golden domes, which you can admire indefinitely.  From the hill to the hill there are stone paths with lanterns on each side.  Paths picturesquely run from the temple to the chapel, and then further to the caves. </p><h2>  Cathedral of Prince Alexander Nevsky </h2><p>  What is worth seeing for those who come to Stary Oskol?  Sights! </p><p>  In the Old Oskol itself, many churches have survived.  The simple, austere, even somewhat harsh cathedral of Prince Alexander Nevsky was built of red brick.  And on the dark blue domes are stars.  The cathedral was built about a hundred years ago.  The architecture of the church belongs to the Russian and Greek style.  A few meters from the building is located the same style gazebo.  Surprisingly, being closed in the early years of Soviet power, the cathedral was opened shortly after the end of World War II. </p><h2>  More attractions </h2><p>  And tourists should definitely see: </p><ul><li>  Holy Cross Church; </li><li>  Church of the Ascension of the Lord; </li><li>  Church of St. Nicholas; </li><li>  Church of St. Sergius of Radonezh; </li><li>  Church of Vice Elijah; </li><li>  a chapel in honor of the Kazan Icon of the Mother of God; </li><li>  wooden church of Equal-to-the-Apostles Princess Olga. </li></ul>

    <p>  Some of these Orthodox churches are located not in the city, but in the surrounding villages.  But the beauty of these holy cloisters is worth it for tourists to take an extra trip out of town. </p><p>  What is still worth seeing for those who are interested in Stary Oskol and its sights?  The house of the holy martyr Onufriy is preserved in the city.  His fate is the usual story of a sincerely religious person who happened to live in the years of severe persecution by militant atheists.  After exile, he came to this city in the late twenties of the last century.  Having become Vladyka Starooskolsky, he prayed for the inhabitants of the city and humbly carried his cross.  St. Onufriy suffered the fate of many clergy during the years of Soviet rule.  He was repressed and shot in 1938. </p><p>  In Stary Oskol, a monument was erected on the territory of the medical college two years ago.  The monument depicts a nurse of the early twentieth century holding a book in her hands. </p><p>  Travelers will be interested in visiting the building of the former women's gymnasium and the <span>house of the noble assembly,</span> which are a classic example of nineteenth-century architecture.  And you should also see beautiful houses that once belonged to merchants.  The house of the merchant Fedyushin, the house of Diaghilev and the so-called house of the tobacco merchant. </p><p>  In Stary Oskol you should definitely see the monument to Marshal of Victory - George Zhukov. </p>

    <p>  Surprisingly bright and beautiful is the red two-story building of the Stary Oskol Theater for children and youth. </p><p>  After such exciting excursions, tourists can visit the best restaurants and cafes of the city.  For example, ‚ÄúMocha‚Äù, ‚ÄúSilk Road‚Äù, ‚ÄúIceberg‚Äù and others. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Now you know why Stary Oskol is interesting.  Its sights are really worthy of attention.
