A good location for transit transport makes this place for tourists who follow the direction of Crimea very convenient. </p><p>  In their reviews, the guests did not agree on a hotel.  Some talk about boorish and defiant behavior of administrators.  And someone is the other way around. </p><p>  Guests note that at the time of booking it was indicated that the rooms are spacious with all amenities.  As it turned out, there was no hot water and this was reported only upon arrival.  The rooms are small and have an unpleasant odor. </p><div class="photo" data-original="legkotravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="standard number" class="if uuid-2810998" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/2810998.jpg"></div><p>  There are customers who are satisfied with the room with a kitchenette.  They note that you can cook for yourself on it, although breakfast is included.  The hotel provides all the necessary things for a comfortable stay.  I liked the food in the restaurant.  It was quiet and calm. </p><p>  Guests in the reviews say that the Sputnik Hotel (Voronezh) is an ideal place to relax from the road.  The hotel is located near the highway in the forest zone.  There are no shops and cafes nearby (this can be a minus for someone).  The rooms are not as large as it seems from the photos on the site.  The service is also not top notch.  In order to spend the night and take a shower, the hotel is quite suitable. </p><h2>  Hotel Sputnik (Voronezh): vacancies </h2><p>  As in any other hotel, the Sputnik hotel always has free working positions.  Administrators, cleaning service, waiters and cooks - often these vacancies are free.  In order to get a job in this hotel, you must meet all the requirements.  All personnel are tested for professional suitability, as well as for the quality performance of their duties. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In Voronezh, you can find many places to relax.  Most tourists who come to see the city prefer to settle in the center or near the train stations.  Hotel Sputnik (Voronezh) is more suitable for those traveling along the nearest highway or for companies who want to celebrate a celebration in a hotel restaurant.  Many guests choose this hotel because of the spacious conference rooms in which they conduct negotiations and meetings, and then accommodate visiting guests in the apartments of the hotel. </p>
