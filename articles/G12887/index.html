Today it is a metropolis and one of the most dynamically developing cities in the country.  Its residents have also changed, who are increasingly choosing between a private house and an apartment, preferring the latter option.  And all because modern residential complexes have turned into separate micro-districts with their own infrastructure, which allows each resident to be provided with maximum comfort on the territory of the microsocium. </p><p>  LCD "Aurora" (Krasnodar) - a unique residential complex that has attracted a lot of attention.  We will talk about how the project turned out, what advantages it has incorporated, within the framework of this material. </p><h2>  about the project </h2><p>  So, LCD ARS "Aurora" (Krasnodar) is a unique project of an apartment building with author's architecture, being built in the very center of the city.  In the region, you certainly will not find a single similar house.  Quite often this project is confused with the Aurora Park residential complex (Krasnodar), but only the location is common between them - both are being built in the central part of the city, in an area with developed megalopolis infrastructure.  The project provides for the use of monolithic-brick technology, which gives the building the necessary strength, durability and endurance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="xn----8sbaphmhjgygfxfk.xn--p1ai" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lc aurora park Krasnodar" class="if uuid-3181306" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3181306.jpg"></div><h2>  Developer </h2><p>  The Moscow investment and construction holding, formed by the merger of several major construction companies, led the construction of the Aurora residential complex (Krasnodar), which led to such significant success.  Many years of experience, the use of advanced technologies and innovations, the author's approach to each object is what is characteristic of the company.  Each project is unique, you will not find a single similar one not only in the region, but also in any other city in the country.  Authors architecture combined with comfort, well-developed infrastructure and excellent location of houses is what every potential buyer can count on. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Architecture </h2><p>  LCD "Aurora" (Krasnodar) consists of six variable-height block sections from 17 to 24 floors, forming a semi-enclosed circle with a courtyard.  A choice of potential residents presented 532 apartments from one to five-room apartments. </p><p>  The architecture is extremely unusual for the region.  The developer opted for the Empire style, which is characterized by the presence of a rich, even luxurious decor: arches, columns, bas-reliefs. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The complex is being built at the intersection of the Festival and Central microdistricts.  Location is the main advantage of the project and the Aurora Park residential complex (Krasnodar), which is quite similar to it.  The reviews of those who managed to visit the construction site emphasize that this is the best place to live in the southern city.  Nearby is the central Red Street, all the most famous attractions.  Address "Aurora": Krasnodar, Garage street, house 67. </p><div class="photo" data-original="khimki.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Aurora Krasnodar" class="if uuid-3181292" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3181292.jpg"></div><p>  At the same time, the developer was able to isolate the house territory from noise, through traffic, and all thanks to the unique C-shaped shape of the building.  Some complain about the lack of greenery, the terrible ecological situation in the neighborhood.  But if you take a closer look at the area where construction is actively ongoing, then make sure that there is simply no reason for concern: within walking distance from the Aurora residential complex (Krasnodar) there is a central city park, several squares.  In addition, the developer provided for the improvement and landscaping of the local area. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  Transport accessibility is what attracts many to the Aurora residential complex (Krasnodar) The Neftyanikov Highway is very close, therefore, it connects the facility with other areas of the city.  It does not matter if your family has a private car or if you get by public transport, comfort and mobility are ensured in each case.  Just a few meters from the complex there are public transport stops where you can take a seat in a trolley bus, bus and minibus. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dg-yug.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Ars Aurora Krasnodar" class="if uuid-3181309" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3181309.jpg"></div><p>  Entrance to the territory of the complex will be asphalted, the roadway is even and wide, therefore it will be easy and comfortable to travel by personal vehicles. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Residents of the residential complex Aurora (Krasnodar) will certainly not be deprived of infrastructure.  The first floors of the house will be reserved for service industry organizations, shops, bank branches.  And the main gift for all residents is their own restaurant, which you can go down to from your apartment by elevator, without even going outside.  Just imagine: you can enjoy delicious aromatic coffee with French pastries every morning and celebrate significant events in your life without leaving the territory of the complex. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In walking distance from the new buildings are kindergartens and secondary schools, including those with in-depth study of foreign languages.  There are enough shops, as well as cafes, bars, restaurants.  Nearby are several markets where you can buy fresh products of the national economy.  By the way, local residents prefer to "shop" right here, since the Krasnodar Territory is rich in vegetables and fruits.  There are enough farms here, which allows you to consume high-quality fresh products every day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="krasnodar.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd aurora krasnodar reviews" class="if uuid-3181311" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3181311.jpg"></div><h2>  Security </h2><p>  When building a comfort class complex, every detail, every detail should be provided.  The security issue today comes first when choosing an apartment.  That is why many are quite demanding in choosing a district.  The developer went even further and equipped the entire territory of his complex, including entrance groups and parking, with a 24-hour video surveillance system.  Now you can not worry about the safety of children playing on the site, and a parked car. </p><div class="photo" data-original="baraholka.com.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Aurora Krasnodar Highway Oil Workers" class="if uuid-3181313" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3181313.jpg"></div><h2>  Beautification </h2><p>  The project of the complex provides for the improvement and gardening of the adjacent territory.  There will appear trees, shrubs, flower beds prepared by the best landscape designers of the city, as well as a zone with benches and gazebos, playgrounds and sports grounds not only for children but also for adults.  Just imagine: you can actively spend your free time, enjoy the silence and pleasant coolness in the shade of trees, without leaving the complex. </p><p>  An underground parking lot for 200 cars is provided for car owners, ground parking is organized for guests. </p><h2>  Apartments, layouts </h2><p>  LCD "Aurora" (Krasnodar) is a comfort class housing project, which is why many are counting on improved modern layouts and spacious apartments.  What can the Moscow developer offer? </p><div class="photo" data-original="vip-realty-krasnodar.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Aurora Mr. Krasnodar" class="if uuid-3181328" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3181328.jpg"></div><p>  Indeed, potential buyers are impressed by the variety of planning solutions presented: spacious apartments, kitchen-living rooms, where all family members can gather, as well as friends and relatives, isolated rooms, a wardrobe.  The apartments turned out to be bright, spacious.  In order to properly organize the space and storage system, you do not have to clutter square meters with massive furniture.  Successful layouts allow you to use every square meter of area and provide maximum comfort to all residents of the new building. </p><h2>  Finish </h2><p>  All apartments in the complex are rented with pre-finishing, respectively, you can save a significant part of the time and money on the subsequent repair of the area in the residential complex "Aurora" (Krasnodar).  Feedback from equity holders, of course, affect the quality of work, but at the moment they have not yet begun. </p><h2>  Prices, terms of purchase </h2><p>  The cost per square meter in a new building starts at 55,000 rubles.  At the moment, one-room apartment in the residential complex "Aurora" can be purchased from 2.6 million rubles.  Not the most budget price, but taking into account the location and level of development, it is quite justified.  The developer offers to purchase real estate by installments, as well as under the program of military mortgages.  You can get a mortgage loan from one of the partner banks on the most favorable terms.  Therefore, we strongly recommend that you hurry up with a choice. </p><h2>  Customer opinion </h2><p>  Who, if not the first owners of the treasured meters, will help to draw up the correct and most objective idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe complex.  I must admit, the construction is accompanied by a lot of comments and reviews, many caring residents of the city actively monitor all stages of the construction process, which allows us to provide the most objective assessment. </p><p>  Recently, there have been a lot of negative reviews on the network, there has been an active discussion around the project, and all because of a significant delay in the deadlines for putting the house home.  Concerns of interest holders are also caused by the extremely dubious reputation of the developer.  This is a Moscow company, LCD "Aurora" - its first project in Krasnodar.  And even many years of experience in this field, many successfully implemented projects no longer impress equity holders.  People are worried about the fate of the project, as they have invested all their savings in it.  Some are thinking of completely selling their stake before the project is completely frozen. </p><div class="photo" data-original="forums.kuban.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Aurora Krasnodar Address" class="if uuid-3181326" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3181326.jpg"></div><p>  The rest of the project is a godsend, analogues to it simply do not exist either in the city or in the region as a whole.  Bright spacious apartments, closed territory, own parking and, of course, an excellent location - what is captivating.  As the builder himself assures, some delays in the timing are associated with contractors, the problem will be fixed in the near future, and interest holders will receive pleasant compensation for expectations and delays. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Indeed, Aurora residential complex in Krasnodar is a unique comfort-class housing project that simply does not exist.  Of course, having familiarized ourselves with him and the feedback from the interest holders, we found out that there are a number of problems.  If you are not limited in time and can forgive the builder for some delays, wanting to get a large apartment in the city center, surrounded by all infrastructure, with its own closed territory and parking - pay attention to the complex.  In order to make a complete impression, be sure to visit the construction site, chat with workers and foremen - for sure you will dispel all fears and doubts. </p>
