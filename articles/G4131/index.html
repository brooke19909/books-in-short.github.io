One can hardly object to this statement, because indeed, what was popular several decades ago, but has already lost its consumer demand, is gradually returning to sales markets.  These items include anything from shoes and clothes to jewelry and design. </p><p>  Of course, new-old things are similar to their predecessors, and that's all.  All materials, design ideas and useful properties are changing thanks to modern technology.  So, the topic of our article for today will be a cap with ear flaps.  With your own hands, a pattern that will be clear to the craftsmen of all levels, and the product itself is not difficult to perform. </p>

    <h2>  Rich story </h2><p>  It is difficult to imagine a woman in a hat with earflaps a few centuries ago, since this wardrobe item belonged only to men.  The winter accessory was made of wool on the inside and suede on the outside.  The result was a hat in which it was possible to wait out any cold and not freeze at all. </p><p>  Of course, you can be grateful to the materials, but special attention should be paid to the design of the cap itself.  Due to the low forehead, the wind hardly hit the face, and long ears saved their namesakes from blowing, which the analogues of that time could not provide. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern caps with earflaps female" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/2230268.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now everyone is wearing this accessory, since such a headdress is well suited, surprisingly, for both girls and men.  In our case, we will replace animal materials with artificial analogues, which will facilitate the care and the sewing process itself, because it is high time to create <span>patterns with fur earflaps</span> from modern materials. </p><h2>  List of necessary things </h2><p>  First you need to prepare all the necessary materials.  To be honest, the most important thing without which the pattern of a female hat with earflaps definitely will not work is the sketch itself.  And everything else is just variables that can be manipulated depending on the desired result.  Therefore, do not rush to throw away fleece trimmings and run to the store, but first of all carefully consider the list. </p><ul><li>  The cloth.  In our case, we need two types of fabric, since one goes to the lining, and the second, respectively, to the outside of the cap.  Based on the purpose of your cap, you can take in thinner or, conversely, insulated analogues.  We replace natural fur with artificial fur, which, in our opinion, looks much more interesting due to a diverse palette and many textures. </li><li>  Insulation.  This item is also selected individually, taking into account the season in which you plan to wear the product. </li><li>  <span>Pattern with earflaps.</span>  Given in our material. </li><li>  <span>Sewing supplies (sewing</span> machine, pins, threads, needles, scissors and felt-tip pens for cutting). </li></ul><h2>  First stage: pattern with earflaps </h2><p>  To get started, you should prepare a paper sketch, which we will rely on later. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hat with earflaps do it yourself pattern" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12024/2230573.jpg"></div>  To do this, prepare a clean work surface, and you can start creating!

You can also adjust the details by lengthening or shortening the length of the ears or the size of the visor. </li><li>  So, the pattern of the female hat with earflaps is ready!  The matter remains small: you need to cut out the necessary number of copies from both types of fabric and set them aside until the next step. </li></ul><h2>  Second step: stitching parts </h2><p>  When the cut-out parts are ready, you can continue to work.  To do this, turn on the sewing machine, carefully lay out the blanks and proceed! </p><ul><li>  First we‚Äôll make a visor: it consists of two fur parts and does not require a lining, so we sew the parts together from the inside, turn them around and put them off. </li><li>  Now we proceed to the basis: it is sewn from one central part and two side panels.  It is important to note that the fur and lining are created in parallel!  Again, we sew the details from the wrong side, having first fastened them together with pins, after which we turn everything back again. </li><li>  We turn to the ears of our caps with earflaps, which we sew to the "fur" base so that they look down, and the continuation of the details met on the back of the head.  We also connect everything with a sewing machine. </li></ul><h2>  The third stage: we connect the parts </h2><p>  Now the only thing left is small: just bring all the parts together. </p><ul><li>  We put on two blanks for the cap (one is cotton, the other is fur) so that they are connected with the front sides to each other.  Thus, on both sides we get the wrong side. </li></ul>

    <ul><li>  We sew two parts together along the entire lower edge, retreating about 1.0-1.5 centimeters.  At the back of the head, leave a hole through which we turn the entire cap with earflaps. </li><li>  We sew the gap manually with a thread in tone with the fur, and also do not forget to stitch the visor in front.  At this stage, the pattern of a cap with earflaps can be considered mastered and attached to life! </li></ul><p>  Just look, what a wonderful hat we got in just 30 minutes.  This is a real find for any craftswoman, so use it with pleasure! </p>
