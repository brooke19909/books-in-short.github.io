    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  <span>What is a</span> Conscience <span>card</span> ?  This is the first thing everyone will have to figure out. </p><p>  This name is a plastic card from the Kiwi.  "Conscience" is the most common credit card.  She can pay for purchases, and then pay off debts.  It would seem nothing difficult.  But in fact, the Conscience card (how to arrange it, we will consider later) allows you to take goods not on credit, but in installments.  You can call this plastic an installment card or an interest-free credit card.  A pretty tempting offer is to buy and not overpay. </p><h2>  About limits </h2><p>  How to draw a "Conscience" card?  First you will have to familiarize yourself with the basic terms of use.  Plastic is issued for a maximum of 5 years.  After that, he will have to reissue. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The credit limit on the card is 300,000 rubles.  You can‚Äôt spend more than this amount.  Have to pay off the previously accumulated debt. </p><p>  There are no more restrictions.  Unless you can use plastic at all retail outlets.  But more on that later. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="conscience installment card issue" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2053367.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Primary requirements </h2><p>  How to draw a "Conscience" card?  To do this, the client will have to meet certain conditions of Qiwi Bank.  Usually there is no problem with this item.  But everyone still needs to know about the requirements. </p><p>  So, in order to draw up a "Conscience" installment card, you will have to: </p><ul><li>  reach a minimum of 18 years; </li><li>  have a permanent residence in the Russian Federation; </li><li>  be a citizen of Russia; </li><li>  do not have open loans (debts); </li><li>  have a good credit history; </li><li>  have an official source of regular income (it is sometimes required to confirm it when making plastic). </li></ul><p>  Perhaps this is all.  Installment cards can be issued without confirmation of official income.  But it is better if by the time the request is made the citizen will have the appropriate papers.  They will greatly simplify the procedure. </p><p>  In addition to the requirements listed above, a citizen must have a personal mobile phone.  Otherwise, the card cannot be issued and issued.  After all, "Conscience" is tied to a mobile phone. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  About partners </h2><p>  The catch of the studied plastic is that it does not work in all stores.  Interest-free installments can be obtained by "Conscience" only at certain retail outlets.  In total there are more than 45 pieces. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="get a conscience credit card" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2053366.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Before applying for a Conscience credit card, the applicant must find out with which organizations Qiwi Bank cooperates.  For example, among them there are: </p><ul><li>  Aeroflot. </li><li>  The Messenger. </li><li>  Euroset. </li><li>  "Platypus"; </li><li>  "Bill." </li><li>  "M Video". </li><li>  "Lamoda". </li><li>  INCITY. </li><li>  Sunlight. </li><li>  "Burger King". </li><li>  "Optics Aircraft". </li><li>  "Ile de Beaute". </li><li>  Lego. </li><li>  "Daughters and sons." </li><li>  Kari. </li><li>  Yulmart. </li><li>  Sony. </li><li>  Samsung </li><li>  "Shatura". </li></ul><p>  These are far from all partner stores.  But many people use them.  In ordinary shops, paying with a Conscience card will not work.  And this fact should be considered by everyone.  Otherwise, the presence of the studied plastic will cause a lot of trouble. </p><h2>  Installment period </h2><p>  Many are interested in how much interest-free credit is issued on a Conscience card.  This is an important point.  After all, after the deadlines have passed, a citizen will have to pay a small fine.  We will talk about him later. </p><p>  Thinking about how to draw up a Conscience card, a client should understand that installment plan is offered here for different periods.  It all depends on where the plastic was paid at. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For example, you can focus on the following data: </p><ul><li>  MVideo - 4 months. </li><li>  "Optics Aircraft" - up to six months. </li><li>  Svyaznoy and Aeroflot - 3 months. </li></ul><p>  The maximum installment plan is 1 year.  It is recommended to clarify more accurate information in the Kiwi Bank's partner store. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="card conscience where to draw" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2053370.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Clearance steps </h2><p>  How can I apply for a Conscience card?  This is not so difficult to do.  But you have to pay attention to the fact that the process is divided into several parts. </p><p>  Namely: </p><ol><li>  Application Form.  The ways to implement the ideas are described below. </li><li>  Confirmation of the request and receiving the card on hand. </li><li>  Plastic activation. </li></ol><p>  Everything is extremely simple and clear.  In general, the algorithm of actions is not much different from the design of a regular credit card.  The difference is that Conscience does not require anything special from the client.  And it takes shape outside the banks. </p><h2>  Ways of registration </h2><p>  First, we‚Äôll try to understand how to draw up a ‚ÄúConscience‚Äù installment card.  More precisely, where can this be done. </p><p>  Back in early 2017, such plastic was issued only to residents of the capital.  But already in the spring of that year, "Conscience" began to draw up in Russia. </p><p>  How to bring an idea to life?  Can: </p><ul><li>  fill out an application online; </li><li>  personally apply with a request to the representative office of Qiwi Bank. </li></ul><p>  In fact, everything is simple.  And the design of the card does not take much time.  This usually takes about 10-15 minutes.  Nothing difficult or special.  Requesting this plastic is easier than a regular credit card. </p><h2>  Where to get it? </h2><p>  And where can I get the "Conscience" card?  As already mentioned, the order of plastic is made online.  There is sovest.com for this.  With it, you can not only learn about plastic, but also order it. </p><p>  In addition, today the studied installment card ("Conscience") can be issued at any Kiwi dealership.  For example, in some banks and multifunctional centers ("Geobank", "Sberbank"), as well as in retail outlets of partners.  For example, in the "Messenger". </p><p>  Many people prefer to apply online.  This is their legal right.  The receipt of plastic in this case occurs by courier delivery.  It is completely free.  This is very pleasing to potential customers. </p><h2>  Through the Internet </h2><p>  Where to get a Conscience card?  In the Internet.  But you need to do this only from the official website of plastic.  Otherwise, a citizen may face fraudsters. </p><p>  Instructions for filling out an application on the Web look like this: </p><ol><li>  Enter the browser (preferably from a computer) on the site sovest.com. </li><li>  Click on the "Order / Get Card" button. </li><li>  Fill out an application.  Usually here you will have to write personal data, place of residence and the limit on the card that you want to receive (up to three hundred thousand rubles). </li><li>  Click on the "Place an order" button. </li></ol><p>  That's all.  Now it remains to wait for the manager‚Äôs call, after which the plastic order will be confirmed.  Call back the client after about 15 minutes, but sometimes you have to wait longer.  The main thing is that after the above actions, the request will be sent for processing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where can I draw a conscience card" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2053364.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Personal clearance </h2><p>  Where to draw up and pick up a Conscience card?  For example, in the "Messenger".  This point is recommended for personal registration of installment cards.  Finding these stores is easy - they are common throughout Russia.  Therefore, there will be no problems with the production of the card. </p><p>  Plastic ordering guide will look something like this: </p><ol><li>  Take your passport with you.  If a person has a temporary residence permit, it is also advisable to have it with you. </li><li>  Contact any branch of Svyaznoy. </li><li>  Inform employees that you want to draw up a Conscience card. </li><li>  Fill out the application form. </li><li>  Sign at the end of the document. </li><li>  Give an application to Svyaznoy employees. </li><li>  Get a card on hand. </li></ol><p>  Usually the last step is performed immediately.  But sometimes employees of the outlet may ask to wait for the manufacture of plastic.  This is a normal occurrence.  A few days later, a client will be contacted and asked to pick up a ready-made "Conscience" card.  You will have to have an identity card with you, as you might guess. </p><h2>  Activation </h2><p>  Finding the answer to the question of how to draw up a Conscience card gives a lot of trouble to customers.  Kiwi Bank requires its users to activate plastic.  If you do not go through this procedure, you will not be able to take advantage of an interest-free loan.  Many complain that they are denied activation.  Often even without explanation.  Thus, the card will be issued, but you will not be able to use it. </p><p>  So, plastic on hand.  It is not possible to issue a Conscience card by telephone, but with its help it will be possible to complete activation. </p><p>  To do this, you must: </p><ol><li>  Get detailed activation instructions on your phone.  To do this, you just have to confirm the application for a card. </li><li>  Create a message in which 16 numbers of plastic will be written. </li><li>  Send a letter to 5152. </li><li>  Wait for a reply message.  The PIN will be written in it. </li><li>  Make any purchase with plastic. </li></ol><p>  It is done.  The Conscience card is now activated.  It can be used without much difficulty, but with some limitations.  We have already talked about them. </p><h2>  Delay sanctions </h2><p>  It‚Äôs clear how to draw a Conscience card.  Make it easier than it sounds.  Especially if the client was not refused plastic activation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="apply for a conscience card" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2053363.jpg"></div>

    <p>  What to do if the citizen did not manage to pay off the debt on time?  Then he will have to face a series of punishments.  Namely: </p><ul><li>  10% per annum; </li><li>  290 rubles - the standard monthly payment for late payment. </li></ul><p>  In fact, everything is not as scary as it seems.  In some sources you can find information that delays are punishable by 29% per annum. </p><h2>  About map content </h2><p>  Of course, an important point is the maintenance of bank plastic.  And this feature will also have to pay attention. </p><p>  Production of a Conscience card is free.  But for the service of the card you have to pay.  For the first year - 290 rubles, then - 590 rubles each.  SMS informing about promotions and payments is free. </p><p>  Reissuing a Conscience card costs 590 rubles.  But so far, this operation is not in special demand.  As we have already said, delivery of plastic by courier also does not require any costs from the client.  It is very comfortable! </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Is it worth it to get in touch with the studied plastic?  Or is it better to refuse to use it?  Qiwi Bank customer reviews will help answer these questions. </p><p>  The thing is that the Conscience card is not very popular so far.  Many customers complain about activation problems, as well as the fact that it is not possible to pay with plastic in all stores.  This fact is a lot of trouble.  In addition, some say that the Conscience card often faces system crashes.  Because of this, payments have to be repeated several times.  A trifle, but you should also pay attention to it. </p><p>  Positive reviews about the Conscience card are also found.  Customers who often make purchases from Kiwi Bank partners emphasize that plastic completely copes with its tasks.  Installments are provided without difficulty, it can be repaid without interest and even ahead of schedule.  No fines for this. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Should I think about how to draw up a Conscience card?  Yes, if a person often makes purchases in partner stores of Qiwi Bank.  Otherwise, the plastic will not work.  This is warned at the time of application. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="conscience bank draw up a card" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2053362.jpg"></div>

    <p>  A small drawback of plastic is that you cannot withdraw money from it at ATMs.  "Conscience" provides only cashless payments.  Not very convenient.  Especially if a person infrequently makes purchases from Qiwi partners. </p><p>  Making an application for a card "Conscience" is easy.  The procedure takes only a few minutes.  It will take several days to wait until the plastic is ready.  If you personally make a request to the Qiwi representative office (you can see them on the official service page for each city), then the card will be issued instantly. </p>
