    <h2>  Reconquista: reasons </h2><p>  The reconquista began immediately after the conquest of the Pyrenees by the Arabs (the first half of the 8th century) and went with varying degrees of success.  Feudal strife provoked the Christian monarchs to war with each other and their vassals, as well as the conclusion of temporary alliances with the Islamic conquerors. </p><p>  During the crusades, the war against Muslim Moors was akin to the struggle for all of Christianity as a whole.  <span>The orders of the knights</span> (Templars, etc.) were originally created to fight the Moors, and the popes called on the knights of Europe to fight for the liberation of the Iberian Peninsula. </p>

    <h2>  Beginning of the Reconquista </h2><p>  After the Moors conquered most of the Pyrenees, most Visigoth aristocrats chose to remain in the conquered lands.  An example is the sons of the ruler of Vitica.  They received from the Arab authorities in personal ownership the fertile lands of the Visigoth crown.  However, the faithful parts of the Visigoth army, a significant part of the aristocrats and clergy who did not agree to stay in the occupied territory, retreated to Asturias.  There they subsequently created the kingdom of the same name.  In the summer of 718, the influential Visigoth Pelayo (probably the former guard of King Roderich), who was held hostage in the city of Cordoba, returned to Asturias and was elected the first king of the newly made kingdom.  The election took place on the Fur Field.  After receiving news of the meetings on the Fura Field, the Viceroy of Munus sent news of this to the Emir of Andalusia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, only in 722 did a detachment led by Alcamo arrive in Asturias.  With the punishers was the Seville bishop Oppa.  He was supposed to provoke Peylo to appear Alcamo, moving to Lucus Asturum.  From this place, the Arabs burst into the Cowadong Valley, looking for Christians.  But in the gorge, the Alcamo squad was ambushed and defeated.  The leader himself was killed. </p><p>  When the news of the death of the Alcamo detachment reached the Berber governor of Munus, he left the city of Gij√≥n and with his detachment advanced towards Pelayo.  The battle took place near the village of Olaglia.  Munus troops were completely destroyed, and he himself was killed.  Answering the question of what the Reconquista is, what are its reasons, it is impossible not to mention this event, because it was precisely this that served as its beginning. </p>

    <h2>  The formation of the Iberian states </h2><p>  After the successful launch of the Reconquista of Asturias in the early 10th century.  pushed its borders and became the kingdom of Leon.  In the same century, another state emerged from it - the kingdom of Castile.  A little later they teamed up.  At the turn of the 8th-9th centuries, successful franc campaigns made it possible to create a Spanish brand in the northeast of the Pyrenees with the capital in Barcelona.  In the IX century.  Navarra stood out from it, and a little later - the countries of Aragon and Catalonia.  In 1137, they united into the <span>Kingdom of Aragon.</span>  In the west of the Pyrenees, the county of Portugal was created, which later also became a kingdom. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The political situation at the turn of the XII-XIII centuries </h2><p>  At this time, the Christian powers were able to win back from the Arabs a serious part of the Pyrenees.  Their victory over the Caliphate, which was more developed from an economic point of view, can partly be explained by the fact that the Arab state at the beginning of the 11th century turned into almost two dozen provinces (emirates) that were at war with each other.  But this was not the main reason for success.  Christian countries in the Pyrenees were also at enmity with each other, and attracting the Moors to their side.  However, the Christians were more united, as well as strong militarily. </p><h2>  The position of Christians under Arab rule </h2><p>  For Arabs, the Christian population has become an object of merciless exploitation.  The defeated remained in the position of half-slaves.  Even Christians who converted to Islam or adopted Arabic customs were considered inferior.  The original tolerance of the Moors disappeared without a trace.  Gradually she was replaced by ardent <span>fanaticism.</span>  <span>This</span> led to many Christian uprisings that undermined the caliphate. </p><h2>  Reasons for the Reconquista's Success </h2>

This question can now be answered more fully.  A common enemy and oppressor rallied the Christians.  Therefore, the Reconquista took on the character of a liberation movement, despite the military-colonization plans of the Christian kings and the feud between Aragon and Castile, as well as the feudal lords with each other.  At the decisive moment, the Christians rallied.  The peasantry had its own incentive to win this war.  In the conquered territories, they could receive not only land, but also freedom from feudal lords, recorded in letters and charters (fueros).  Therefore, Christians opposed the Moors as a whole.  In addition to the Spaniards, European knights (mainly Italian and French) took part in the liberation of the Pyrenees from the Moors.  Therefore, the question "what is the Reconquista" can be answered as follows: this is an international Christian liberation movement.  <span>The Pope</span> has declared these liberation campaigns "crusades" many times.

    <h2>  Continuation of the Reconquista </h2><p>  In 1085, the Spaniards seized Toledo by attack.  This victory was very important.  At the same time, the Arabs, exhausted by the internecine war, asked the African Berbers for help.  The combined Moorish army was able to defeat the Spaniards, which temporarily slowed the Reconquista.  Soon (mid-12th century), other conquerors, Moroccan almohades, replaced the North African Berbers.  However, they could not unite the emirates of the Pyrenees.  Ask any Spaniard what the Reconquista is?  The definition of this term is known to both old and young.  This is the struggle of the oppressed against the oppressors, one faith against another - a war of rulers and cultures. </p><h2>  Reconquista victory </h2>

After this defeat, the Arabs could not recover.  In 1236, the Castilians took Cordoba, in 1248, Seville.  Aragon captured the Balearic Islands.  Castile conquered Cadiz in 1262 and went to the Atlantic Ocean.  In 1238, Valencia fell.  By the turn of the XIV century.  the Moors owned only the <span>Emirates of Granada</span> , a wealthy province in the south of the Pyrenees.  On this territory, the Arabs held out until 1492.

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  It was told above what the Reconquista is.  According to history, the conquest of land was accompanied by their assignment to the winner and settlement.  In Reconquista, townspeople and small knights played a large role.  However, the main benefits of the war received large feudal lords.  They created large estates on the annexed lands. </p>
