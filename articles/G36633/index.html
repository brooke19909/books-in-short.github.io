    <h2>  Childhood and the path to science </h2><p>  Lurie Lev Yakovlevich was born in 1950 in Leningrad.  It should be noted right away that fate was favorable to him - he was born into the family of true Leningrad intellectuals.  His father, Yakov Solomonovich Lurie, was a historian, and his mother, Irina Efimovna Ganelina, was a professor, the founder of the first cardiological resuscitation in the country.  Grandfather - Solomon Yakovlevich - left a memory of himself as an outstanding Soviet Hellenist philologist and researcher of the history of the ancient world. </p><p>  However, the path of the historian Lev Lurie did not immediately choose and spent his early years at the physics and mathematics school No. 30, which he graduated in 1967.  Lev Yakovlevich continued his further education at the Faculty of Economics of Leningrad State University.  Here he had to linger a little, as the future historian was suspended for a year for finding a draft of a leaflet of political content that he had found.  Leo Lurie spent forced <span>academic leave</span> working as a milling machine operator. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How it all began </h2><p>  Lev Yakovlevich began his educational activities as a guide of the Museum of the History of Leningrad, as well as a curator of a number of exhibitions related to his history.  As a researcher at this museum, in 1987 he completed graduate school and defended his dissertation, becoming a candidate of historical sciences. </p>

    <p>  Having successfully realized the opportunities that opened up during the perestroika period, Lev Lurie, together with a group of like-minded friends, founded the first classical gymnasium in our country on the basis of St. Petersburg comprehensive school No. 610.  In this his brainchild, he still leads history lessons and works as head teacher.  In the period from 1991 to 1993, Lev Yakovlevich served as professor of Russian history in a number of American colleges. </p><h2>  Articles and books on Russian history </h2><p>  In addition to teaching, Lurie Lev Yakovlevich conducts serious research work.
