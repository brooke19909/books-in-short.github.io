We are talking about devices such as the K750I, as well as the W800I.  Interestingly, the subject of our review at the same time is similar to two corresponding devices.  Sony Ericsson W810I phones owe their appearance to the K750 model.  You can logically ask why this is the case.  Now we‚Äôll talk about this. </p><h2>  Introduction </h2>

    <p>  <span>Sony Ericsson W810I,</span> whose battery is included in the factory equipment, is made in dark colors.  The material of manufacture is plastic.  The appearance of this device is characterized by a business design, which manifests itself in the presence of strict forms.  The appearance of the device is diluted with inserts decorated in orange.  Well, the designers have provided at least some kind of variety, which in itself cannot but please potential phone buyers. </p><p>  At the same time, there is a certain similarity with the second apparatus.  This is manifested in the fact that the Sony Ericsson W810I, the characteristics of which we will list in the article, inherited from the ‚Äúancestor‚Äù a company logo showing that the device belongs to the corresponding product line.  Well, and, of course, the positioning of the phone in the international mobile arena has been preserved.  It, in turn, had an impact on the preparation of the delivery.  Probably, thanks to such positioning, a wired stereo headset of fairly good quality was included in the package. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The K750 and W810I models use the chassis of the same type.  This fact gives the phone owner the opportunity to change the case if necessary.  For example, if the previous one was damaged as a result of a fall or other similar mechanical impact (and not only mechanical), it can be replaced with another without any problems. </p><h2>  Dimensions </h2>

    <p>  The dimensions of the phone are similar to those of the K750 model.  Which, in principle, has some logical reasons.  If we talk about specific numbers, we can note the following parameters.  The phone‚Äôs dimensions are 100 millimeters high, 46 millimeters wide, and 19.5 millimeters thick.  As we can see, the subject of our review in thickness has won one millimeter from one of its predecessors.  Probably, when developing and creating a model, the company was guided by certain rules.  They consisted in the fact that a maximum of functional abilities must be built into a compact case.  And, it seems, the manufacturer has completely succeeded. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The feeling of using </h2>

    <p>  The device is comfortable in the hand.  He does not strive to slip out.  It is absolutely unimportant in what clothes you are going to transport the phone, whether it be trousers, a shirt or a jacket.  The device is comfortable in all pockets without causing discomfort.  With the appropriate sizes indicated in the article in the previous paragraph, the mass of the phone leaves about 99 grams.  This is not so much, and the indicator coincides with the parameter of the K750 model.  But it is in a discharged state, according to the manufacturer.  In practice, more than once there was a mismatch with the indicator.  It turned out that if you install a SIM card, as well as an external drive, the mass will be about 97 grams.  But the K750 model in the same condition weighs 104 g. One of the technological features that helped to reduce the mass of the device was an innovative type keyboard.  The curtain for the camera also contributed.  Rather, her absence. </p><h2>  Color schemes </h2>

    <p>  At the time the device entered the international arena of mobile phones, it was presented in only one design.  It is commonly called classic.  This, of course, is black.  A little later, another cameraman version appeared, which was made in a different color.  But the classic at Sony Ericsson is precisely the black design of the devices. </p><h2>  Materials of manufacture </h2>

    <p>  The body of the device is made of black plastic, it is matte.  It looks like the color of coal, even graphite.  Even any hints of matte gloss are simply absent.  The case turned out quite non-marking.  When creating the W810 model, the company for the first time decided to apply asymmetric colors, which were distributed on separate keys.  In the center of the phone we can notice the presence of a proprietary key of the Vokman product line.  It is made in orange, and it was to her that the manufacturer tried to attract the main attention of potential buyers. </p><h2>  Right block </h2><p>  Here is a key called ‚ÄúActive Menu‚Äù, made in silver color.  The composition in the central direction is divided by the navigation button, which was disguised by designers as a metal element.  Interestingly, with the help of the form factor and overall design, the company employees tried to give the phone a strict look.  The use of metallic color and its application to the navigation key give reason to talk about the appearance of elements adapted to the youth style.  We can notice similar solutions for devices of the Finnish manufacturer, which are part of the Express Music line.  But the corresponding devices were positioned by the company precisely as youth musical solutions.  All this cannot but prompt us to certain thoughts. </p><p>  Such a peculiar experiment conducted by Sony Ericsson can rightly be called bold.  Only attention should be paid to the fact that such attempts have already taken place.  More specifically, we can mention the K700 model.  I remember that this device enjoyed a certain demand and popularity not only among the business audience, but also among young people.  At the same time, the device itself had a lax appearance.  Until now, the question of what adult wealthy people found in it remains open.  So, the company probably remembered its first experience and, most likely, decided to go all-in, relying on this factor. </p><h2>  Backside </h2>

    <p>  At the back we can notice the presence of two orange inserts at once.  The first is nothing more than the Vokman branded product logo.  The second is a mirror designed for self-portrait.  It is also painted orange.  The element copes flawlessly with its main function, there will be nothing to complain about here.  But at the same time, he remains, according to polls, not particularly in demand. </p><h2>  Side faces </h2><p>  On the sides is another set of controls.  The buttons are generally similar to those that were used in the development and creation of the K750 model.  More specifically, on the left side we have a musical key.  Its functional feature lies in the ability to launch a multimedia player.  It may also include analogue radio.  It all depends on which of the two applications was launched later for the last time. </p><p>  Below you can find the slot designed to install an external drive.  Memory cards are supported up to 4 gigabytes.  On the opposite right side there is a key, due to which the owner of the phone can control the volume level of the device.  It makes it possible to switch the channels of a previously launched radio.  A little lower is the function key of the camera. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  In conclusion, we note the brief technical parameters of the phone.  It has built-in 20 megabytes of RAM.  For autonomous operation, a lithium-polymer battery with a capacity of 900 milliamps per hour is connected.  The mass of the device is 99 grams, with dimensions of 100 by 46 by 19.5 millimeters.  The phone is equipped with a camera with a resolution of 2 megapixels, the module has a flash and auto focus function.  There is a radio, as well as ‚ÄúBluetooth‚Äù version 2.0.  There is no satellite navigation. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In general, the Sony Ericsson W810I model turned out to be quite good.  How to unlock the phone screen?  Such a question can often be found on forums in topics dedicated to this unit.  In fact, the screen lock is removed using the standard key combination. </p><p>  Another of the most talked about was the issue of how to disassemble the Sony Ericsson W810I.  To remove the rear panel, you can use the corresponding recesses.  Having disassembled the phone, you will open access to the hardware stuffing, including the SIM card slot. </p>
