Employers are in no hurry to pay taxes, but they don‚Äôt want to lose good employees.  However, specialists who work informally receive a number of inconveniences.  First of all, it is the inability to take a loan from a trusted financial institution.  However, you can still borrow money.  Where to get a loan without official employment?  A list of banks will be presented below. </p><h2>  What should be prepared for? </h2><p>  Getting credit approval for people who work informally is really difficult.  Market leaders (Sberbank, VTB 24, Gazprombank, etc.) will not cooperate with such clients.  In most cases, in order to borrow money, you must provide three documents: a passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation, an identification code and a certificate of income.  The last document is not always required.  At the same time, if a loan is issued for a small amount, the client must specify the work phone number in the application.  A loan officer can call and ask if an employee is on staff. </p><p>  Some financial institutions still take risks.  There is an opportunity to get a loan without official employment and guarantors.  Although the list of banks offering such a service is small, the client has a choice.  Those who decided to complete the transaction should take into account a number of points.  Firstly, these are increased interest <span>rates.</span>  <span>A financial</span> institution is thus reinsured.  Secondly, you need to understand that an impressive amount without a certificate of income cannot be obtained from the bank. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Promsvyazbank </h2><p>  A financial institution has a good rating and is popular with individuals.  It offers favorable conditions for various categories of the population.  You can apply for a loan without formal employment.  It is Promsvyazbank that starts the list of banks offering such a service.  For clients with official employment loans are issued at 16.9 per annum.  But for those who do not provide a certificate of income, a deal will be offered on less favorable terms - at 26.9% per annum.  At the same time, the maximum amount that can be borrowed is 200 thousand rubles.  The maximum loan term is 2 years. </p>

It is good if the employer can confirm this information.
