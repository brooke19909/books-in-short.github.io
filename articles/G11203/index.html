    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The electric trimmer "Caliber ET-1500V", the operating instructions for which are supplied and are partially described in the article, is a highly effective tool.  However, it is important to remember that equipment can be a source of high danger.  In this regard, the manufacturer recommends adhering to simple rules.  For example, strangers, especially children, should not approach the unit during operation.  Do not leave the trimmer unattended. </p><p>  Mowing grass can be carried out exclusively in daylight or, accordingly, in artificial lighting.  Before starting the engine, make sure that there are no foreign objects, such as stones, in the working area.  The interchangeable tool represented by the nozzles should be selected for its intended purpose and taking into account the parameters. </p><p>  The ET-1500V caliber, the operating instructions for which you should at least read before using it, must be kept out of the reach of children and also in a dry place.  When working with the device, personal protective equipment, such as gloves and glasses, must be used.  Manufacturers recommend wearing comfortable clothing. </p><p>  The cutting part of the device must not damage the electric wire, otherwise there is a risk of electric shock.  It is important to monitor the condition of the power cord.  Ensuring its integrity is essential whenever you intend to use the equipment.  Do not jerk or pull on the cord to disconnect it from the outlet.  The cable must be protected from direct heat, corrosive substances and sharp objects.  The trimmer knife should not be bent, but it is necessary to move it, like the cutting head, parallel to the ground.  Any other situation would be dangerous. </p><h2>  Reasons for Trimmer Heating </h2>

    <p>  Some consumers are faced with a problem when the trimmer Caliber ET-1500V is heated.  This can happen for several reasons.  Among others, problems with the supply voltage, which can be increased or decreased, should be highlighted.  Sometimes it happens that one of the phases disappears, and its distortion also occurs.  In these cases, the electric motor operates in abnormal conditions, which leads to a change in electrical characteristics and an increase in current in the windings. </p><p>  In order to make sure whether this is so, you need to use a tester.  A slight discrepancy is the norm.  However, if the values ‚Äã‚Äãdiffer much, then the cause must be sought and corrected.  Sometimes it also happens that an increased load is placed on the motor shaft.  Bearings may be jammed inside the engine.  And in some cases, the motor simply runs dry (without lubrication). </p><p>  If a short circuit occurs inside the windings or the supply voltage is not normal, the motor may heat up.  An indicator of abnormal operation is the increased temperature of the motor.  This suggests that in the near future it may simply fail.  If you notice an increased temperature on the engine, then you should find out the reason, which will save on the purchase of a new engine or even a device. </p><h2>  The cost of spare parts </h2>
