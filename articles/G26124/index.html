  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The end of World War II</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In our country, the Great Patriotic War is often replaced by the concept of World War II and vice versa.  And although they are interconnected and intersect, the actual end of the Second World War occurred on May 8, when the governments of the Union countries and representatives of the supreme authority of Germany signed a pact on the surrender of the defeated country;  the next day, May 9, Soviet troops finally defeated the German army in Prague, and only on June 24 a <span>victory parade</span> took place <span>.</span>  These events marked the end of World War II on the vast territory of all of Europe.  However, the fact that, in addition to Europe, countries outside of Eurasia took part in the war, is forgotten.  Therefore, the end of World War II came much later, but more on that. </p><p>  As you know, the Second World War took place not only at the site of the venerable Europe.  The USA adjoined the anti-fascist coalition as an ally, on the other hand, Japan acted as opponents. </p><p>  If initially for Japan the Soviet Union was not enemy No. 1, then, according to the agreement of friendly parties in Yalta in February 1945, the government of the Union announced the beginning of military operations against Japan, thereby abolishing the neutrality pact between these states, signed in 1941.  From that moment, the most developed countries of that time officially participated in the hostilities of World War II. </p><p>  Strictly speaking, Japan unofficially participated in hostilities throughout the war.  A huge number of Japanese intelligence officers, taking advantage of their position as citizens of a <span>neutral state,</span> freely transmitted information to Berlin, more than 170 merchant ships were detained by Japanese military personnel. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thus, the decision to start the military did not actually affect the <span>political relations</span> between Japan and the USSR. </p><p>  So, after the <span>surrender of Germany, there</span> was one clear and very serious opponent - Japan.  The end of World War II without the defeat of this country was impossible. </p><p>  As you know, the main battles took place between the military forces of Japan and the United States, which pursued their economic gain.  At the same time, Japan‚Äôs actions were aimed at preserving land and striving to leave the battle with the least losses.  So, the Japanese leadership was ready to accept the terms of surrender with the only reservations that the political system of the Land of the Rising Sun would be preserved, and the state itself would not be occupied by the allies.  Such demands seemed to the heads of countries of friendly states too bold and were rejected.  Only on August 10 did Japan recognize surrender, again insisting that the emperor‚Äôs power remain at the same level.  Having not received an affirmative answer from the supreme rulers of the opposing countries, Japan continued to "wage a <span>holy war."</span> </p><p>  Only on 08/14/1945, the Japanese emperor issued a decree according to which Japan accepts the requirements of the Potsdam Declaration, and all military personnel were ordered to lay down their arms and cease hostilities, which marked the end of World War II. </p><p>  However, some units of the infamous <span>Kwantung Army</span> continued to resist the offensive movement of the Red Army until August 19.  The fighting to suppress the resistance of the Japanese continued for a long time on the territory of the Kuril Islands. </p><p>  08/19/1945, all units of the Kwantung Army began to surrender to the Soviet military or lay down their arms.  The attack, which lasted about 10 days, became one of the brightest manifestations of the military power of the Soviet Union. </p><p>  Already on August 23, a solemn salute took place in Moscow in honor of the victorious soldiers. </p><p>  Officially, the end of World War II came in September 1945, on the 2nd, aboard the American Missouri ship, where confirmation of the surrender of Japan was confirmed by the signatures of not only all the heads of the union republics, but also the rulers of the defeated states. </p><p>  So, at the very beginning of September 1945, namely, the 2nd, the end of World War II became official. </p>
