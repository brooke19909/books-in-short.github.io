For example, how to choose yarn, tools, where to start.  More experienced craftswomen are interested in learning how to knit yarn with knitting needles.  All these issues will be addressed in the article. </p><h2>  Where to start a beginner? </h2><p>  It is clear that an experienced needlewoman will not tell her novice friend what a yarn is, <span>how to knit</span> it and why it is needed.  Perhaps this can be left for later.  To say which thing to knit first is quite difficult.  Each needlewoman has a different level of skill, patience, attentiveness and accuracy.  It is very important that the first experience in knitting does not cause absolutely any irritation, otherwise the desire to engage in such a craft will disappear for a long time. </p><p>  It is recommended to study special literature, read master classes for beginners, consult a person who has been doing needlework for some time.  In any case, you will have to practice a bit of typing loops, learn how to knit the front and back fabric, close the row and only then move on to more complex patterns.  The first thing you can make with knitting needles could be a simple scarf, cardigan or pillow cover.  It is important to start, enjoy it and develop your skill. </p>

    <h2>  Yarn selection </h2><p>  When knitting, it is important to choose the right thread.  For knitting needles yarn of any thickness and with different components.  It is advisable to buy more threads than indicated in the diagram.  This is due to the fact that each pattern will require a different amount of yarn, so it is quite difficult to predict the consumption. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When choosing a consumable, it is important to pay attention to the twisting of the threads.  If they are too tightly woven, the hosiery can slightly mow.  To check this, you need to rewind a piece of thread 100 cm long, put together the beginning and end.  If the loop twists lazily 2-3 times, then the canvas knitted with a hosiery pattern will not mow.  If the thread is folded vigorously more than 10 times, then such a yarn should not be chosen for such a rapport in order to avoid skewing.  It is possible that if one of the components of the pattern is knitting needles, then this problem will be avoided. </p><p>  Also, the yarn should be checked for resistance to dyeing.  To do this, take a piece of white fabric, fold it into a roll, over which the desired thread is wound (20-30 cm).  You can do this with all samples of yarn that will be involved in knitting.  The fabric rolls should be washed and dried when folded.  Then you need to unwind the threads and make sure that they do not leave any residue after washing. </p><h2>  Knitting needles </h2><p>  Knitting needles (stocking needles) for knitting can be divided into two categories: in shape and material. </p><p>  In form, this toolkit is divided into: </p><ul><li>  circular (circular); </li><li>  direct. </li></ul><p>  The main materials for the manufacture of knitting needles are: </p><ul><li>  metal (aluminum, steel, duralumin); </li><li>  plastic; </li><li>  bamboo; </li><li>  tree; </li><li>  bone. </li></ul>

Its surface should not contain chipping, as this will interfere with knitting.  You can create a variety of patterns with knitting needles on any toolkit.  The main thing is that the thread glides easily and without difficulty. </p><p>  All knitting needles are divided by numbers from 1 to 20. According to the craftsmen, working with a thick toolkit is quite difficult due to rapidly onset hand fatigue. </p><p>  In addition to knitting needles, additional elements are used in the work: </p><ul><li>  vintage loops; </li><li>  short curved knitting needles; </li><li>  loop holders or pins for unclosed stitches; </li><li>  row counters; </li><li>  caps for long knitting needles. </li></ul><h2>  Preparation of yarn for work </h2><p>  In order for the fabric to turn out beautiful, and some elements, for example, yarn with knitting needles, do not cause difficulties during work, the craftswomen prepare yarn.  It is important to do this correctly, pre-rewind consumables in skeins.  It is advisable to wash, dry and wind the threads in a ball.  Why is this done?  In order to determine during the processing how the thread behaves: it will stretch, deform, or shrink.  After washing and drying during socks, the thread will not give undesirable results. </p><p>  It is most convenient to work when the yarn is wound on a bobbin or a Bulgarian ball.  It is recommended to pull the thread from the inside of the skein. </p><p>  If the yarn from one ball is over, it is recommended not to knit the end from the old bobbin and the beginning of a new one, but lay one on the other and knit several loops together.  To avoid thickening in this case, skilled craftswomen advise untwisting the ends of the threads and only then lay one on top of the other.  After creating the item of the thing on the wrong side, these “traces” should be fixed. </p><h2>  Tying the front and back loops </h2><p>  Finally, the conversation came to an immediate start.  Before you make any product, you should find out how the front and wrong, removed and elongated loops are crocheted. </p>

    <p>  After the beginning needlewoman has prepared the initial row, she should remove the first stitch and not knit.  The thread is located on the index finger of the left hand.  The right knitting needle is inserted into the second loop, grabs the yarn, pulls it through the stitch, which immediately comes down from the left stocking needle.  It turns out that the newly-minted element remains on the right side.  Similarly, knit to the end of the row. </p><p>  Advice from experienced craftswomen: do not tighten the loops too tight.  It is better if the binding is medium density.  Tight loops are difficult to pull out.  And too loose stitches look ugly on the finished fabric. </p>

    <p>  With the wrong weaving, the working thread is placed in front of the canvas on the index finger.  The right knitting needle is inserted from the back into the second stitch (the first is removed), yarn is captured.  Using the index finger of the working hand, you need to stretch the thread through the loop and leave it on the main stocking needle.  A row is tied to the end. </p><h2>  Loop closure </h2><p>  To prevent the canvas from blooming, after finishing work on it, it is necessary to close the working loops.  There are 2 common ways to fasten stitches: </p><ol><li>  Knit together 2 loops according to the pattern.  It turned out one stitch, which goes to the previous knitting needle.  Knitting together 2 loops and leaving the resulting new element on the left, the craftswoman will completely close the entire row. </li><li>  It is necessary to remove the edge loop.  Knit the following according to the drawing.  Use the left knitting needle to go over the resulting stitch on the right side to the hem, grab it.  With your right stocking needle, stretch the second loop through it and leave it in its original place. </li></ol>

    <p>  Knit the next stitch according to the pattern.  Repeat the steps to “capture” the first loop and return it to the left knitting needle.  By doing such alternate manipulations with stitches, the needlewoman will be able to close the entire row.  It does not matter if the front yarn was in the last row, with knitting needles it will be possible to fasten the loops without damage to the knitted fabric. </p><h2>  Crochet </h2><p>  After gaining skills in creating the front and back stitches, the needlewoman proceeds to the next stage.  Now the novice craftswoman will understand how to make yarn with knitting needles and knit a unique pattern.  As a rule, such techniques are used to create openwork and patent patterns, fabrics with elongated stitches and complex weaving of threads. </p>

    <p>  There are such loops “to oneself” and “from oneself”: </p><ol><li>  Reverse yarn.  In another way, he is called "to himself."  In this case, it is necessary to pass the end of the main knitting needle under the working thread and grab the yarn from right to left. </li><li>  Straight yarn.  Otherwise, they call him "from himself."  The end of the main knitting needles pass over the working thread and, from left to right, they throw yarn with a loop. </li></ol><p>  The face stitch with such manipulations is knitted very easily.  The wrong side must be held with a finger so that the loop does not come off during operation. </p><p>  How to knit a crochet loop is easy to understand.  The main thing is to practice this technique in practice. </p>
