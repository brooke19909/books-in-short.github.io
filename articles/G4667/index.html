    <h2>  We plan time </h2><p>  If you have to drive a car along this highway, then, on the one hand, you will be able to observe the most beautiful landscapes and cross the most picturesque places, and on the other, you will find yourself in difficult conditions, because you have to overcome many kilometers.  The landscape outside the window is constantly changing, then the steppe, then the forest-steppe, then the semi-desert, which leaves its mark on the concentration of attention.  And if you feel tired, then it's time to look for a place to rest.  Route M 6 is replete with various motels where the traveler will be provided with a hearty dinner, a warm bed and a hot shower.  Today we look at the most popular of them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  general description </h2><p>  The M 6 highway has a huge length of 1880 km.  It passes through seven regions of Russia, linking them and providing free communication between them.  On the highway there are entrances to the cities of Ryazhsk, Michurinsk, Tambov.  The federal road began its history from the middle of the last century, from 1964.  It was then that the first section connected Moscow and Tambov. </p><p>  The coverage of the route is asphalt concrete, the width along the entire length is 8 meters.  No dividing strip.  The climate is temperate continental.  The average temperature in January is -10, and in July up to +25 degrees.  Therefore, even if your car does not have air conditioning, the trip will take place in fairly comfortable conditions. </p><p>  A number of sections on the road require increased attention from the driver.  Some have steep ascents and descents, while others have limited visibility.  Therefore, <span>accidents on the M</span> 6 <span>highway</span> are a fairly common occurrence. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="accident on the highway m 6" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2151973.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Highway traffic </h2><p>  From Moscow, the highway begins as a single unit along with the M 4 Don highway.  The road is in very good condition.  In the Kashira area of ‚Äã‚ÄãM 6, the Caspian branches and turns into a standard 2-lane road, which is in pretty good condition.  The traffic here, and <span>intense, greatly complicate the life of Kamaz, loaded to the eyeballs.</span>  <span>Their speed is not more than 60 km per hour, and maneuverability is also low.</span>  <span>Accidents on the M 6 highway often occur precisely because of heavy loads.</span>  <span>But if you compare it with other <span>federal highways,</span> then it is considered expensive with moderate danger.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Recent events </h2><p>  More recently, in July 2017, a clash occurred that claimed the lives of 4 people.  Although this happens regularly, if we take statistics nationwide.  <span>At 429 km of the M 6 highway, a passenger car and a MAZ truck collided.</span>  <span>As a result, the driver and three passengers of Hyundai were killed.</span>  <span>From the machine itself remained a pile of mangled iron.</span>  <span>Such cases confirm the fact that it is best to travel on the highway with breaks, staying overnight in motels.</span>  <span>And in the morning, after a good rest, you can go further on the</span> <span>road.</span> </p>

But interest on the highway is of several settlements: </p><ul><li>  Michurinsk is a center of scientific gardening.  The city is relatively small, only 100 thousand inhabitants.  But on its territory preserved architectural monuments. </li><li>  Tambov is the center of the region of the same name, which was founded in 1636.

    <h2>  Volgograd region </h2><p>  Another section where the highway M 6 is replete with various hotels.

There is a cafe with home cooking on site. </li><li>  Hotel "MotoDom".  The hotel is located on the Sukhov-2 bend.  On the territory of the cafe, guarded parking for trucks and cars, as well as camping.

Here, guests are offered double and triple houses, shower and toilet, hot water.  The cost of living is 1600 and 2200 rubles, parking and meals are included in the price.

It is located in a large, guarded area, where there is a small wholesale store and free parking for residents of the motel.  The rooms are divided according to the degree of comfort very conditionally.  Comfort is a double room, which includes a terrace with a table and chairs, a shower and a bathroom, as well as a refrigerator and a split system, digital TV.  Standard + is almost the same, only without a terrace. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the highway m 6" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2150387.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Astrakhan region </h2><p>  Crossing the border of 1000 km, you approach the city of Astrakhan.  Even if there are enough roadside hotels on the highway, then there will definitely be no problems with them in the city. </p><ul><li>  Hotel "House of Circus Artists".  This is a budget hotel for those who want to save money.  The cost of living is from 400 rubles.

But this is a necessary measure.  In some cases, this route is the only opportunity to travel between cities relatively quickly.  Especially if you decide to make it on your own car.  Which is convenient, the climate in these places is quite mild, so in winter and summer it will be quite comfortable.  Good road surface allows a decent speed. </p>
