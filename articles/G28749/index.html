    <h2>  Junior Suite </h2><p>  A few words are also worth mentioning about apartments in this category.  This is a bright, more spacious room with one extra large 2 double bed.  These apartments are located in a separate building with increased soundproofing.  Their balconies offer wonderful sea views.  In addition to standard conditions and amenities, there is a couch, a folding sofa and modern new Aegean-style furniture.  Terraces and balconies, by the way, are equipped with sun loungers and umbrellas.  So you can sunbathe without leaving your apartment. </p><p>  50 000 rubles - this is the price of this room for two people (7 days, ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù). </p><p>  There are also so-called superior rooms.  They are made in the same style as the standards, but the conditions and amenities inside are similar to junior suites.  And they are also in the main building, on the upper floors.  This apartment features bathrobes.  The standard price is about 50,000 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Other options </h2><p>  Special attention should be paid to the so-called apartments with sea views, which Istron Bay Hotel 5 * has at its disposal.  The description of these rooms inspires you to stay in them.  They are spacious (35 sq. M.) And are made in a modern style.  But their main ‚Äúhighlight‚Äù is the availability of a full-fledged kitchen.  All cooking utensils are provided, as well as a coffee maker, dining area and seating area.  Bathrobes are also provided. </p><p>  If you take "all inclusive", then a week for two will cost 65 thousand rubles.  But such apartments are booked mainly by those people who plan to cook themselves.  And they do not order food.  In this case, the number costs about 35 thousand rubles. </p>
