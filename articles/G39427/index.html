Guests are also pleased with the presence of free umbrellas and sunbeds by the sea, even though the zone is municipal. </p><p>  Some tourists are not comfortable with slightly dilapidated furniture in the rooms.  And despite all the efforts of the staff to fix the breakdowns, the antique situation definitely needs to be replaced. </p><p>  Often, hotel guests complain of scarcity in the menu of the main restaurant of the hotel.  It serves few desserts, pastries and fruits, which can only be seen with breakfast.  But although the restaurant cannot boast of a special variety of dishes, the quality of food is at a high level.  In addition, guests can occupy tables on the terrace and during the meal enjoy the beauty of the sea and local landscapes. </p><p>  Most tourists are satisfied with their stay at the Sun Beach Lindos hotel.  They argue that in this institution for little money you can spend time in fairly comfortable conditions.  Many of them are not only satisfied with their vacation, but are also going to return to the hotel at least once more. </p>
