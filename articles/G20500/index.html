In other words, there are two types of interaction regarding legal norms. </p><p>  In a broad sense, the structure of legal relations is a special form of <span>social interaction that</span> is objectively formed before the law <span>.</span>  At the same time, the participants are endowed with mutual duties and rights and realize them, satisfying their needs and interests in a special order authorized by the state. </p><p>  In a narrow sense, the structure of <span>civil relations</span> is a type of social interaction regulated by a legal norm.  At the same time, the participants are endowed with mutual obligations and rights and realize them to satisfy their interests and needs in a special order, protected and guaranteed by the state in the person of state bodies.  Persons with rights are called authorized, persons carrying a duty are obligated. </p><p>  The structure of legal relations arising on the basis of <span>legal norms</span> includes several types of interaction.  On the basis of industry affiliation, state-legal or constitutional, criminal procedure, criminal and other relationships are distinguished.  When separating interactions by belonging to a certain industry, the greatest importance is attached to the division into procedural and substantive legal relations. </p><p>  The structure of legal relations includes protective and regulatory interactions. </p><p>  Guard relations are formed as a reaction of society and the state to the unlawful activity of legal <span>entities.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Regulatory legal relations arise as a result of the production of regulatory norms that establish a special order in relations.  These relationships, in turn, are divided into relative and absolute. </p><p>  The basis of this division is the principle of individualization of subjects.  So, in relative relationships, both parties are precisely defined (buyer and seller, contractor and customer, and so on). </p><p>  Absolute legal relations differ in the definition of only one side - the holder of subjective law.  Other persons act as obligated persons (‚Äúeveryone‚Äù, ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù). </p><p>  The structure of legal relations is also characterized by the presence of general and specific interactions. </p><p>  General relationships are formed on the basis of constitutional norms that determine the duties, freedoms and rights of the individual, as well as administrative and criminal restrictions and prohibitions. </p><p>  General relationships are divided into three categories. </p><ol><li>  Regulated by <span>law</span> <span>relations (legal relations).</span> </li><li>  Not having a legal form of relationship (unregulated). </li><li>  Interactions are partially adjustable. </li></ol><p>  Any legal relationship is a relationship.  However, not every relationship may be a legal relationship.  Thus, not every interaction is subject to regulation by law.  The limits of the legal industry may expand or narrow depending on the circumstances, but in general they reflect the objective development needs of the state and society. </p><p>  Any legal relationship includes: </p><p>  - subjects; </p><p>  - <span>subjective law</span> ; </p><p>  - an object; </p><p>  - legal obligation. </p><p>  In modern society, the network of vertical and horizontal legal relations operates continuously.  In many cases, citizens do not notice that they are participants in these interactions - the process affecting them is so natural. </p><p>  Legal relations are the main area in public life.  In conditions where the rule of law is in force, there is a constant formation, change or termination of legal relations. </p>
