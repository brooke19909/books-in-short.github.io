From the comments on various forums it is clear that there are people who watch programs with her participation only for the host.  The girl built her brilliant career on Channel One on her own, coming to television as a regular trainee in 2004.  Like many public people, she draws special attention of ordinary people to her person.  Olga Ushakova - a TV presenter, whose personal life is very interested in the impressive part of her regular audience, - tries not to disclose information about her beloved man.  But this only enhances the public‚Äôs interest in the personal life of the screen star. </p><h2>  Exemplar </h2><p>  Looking at the leading airwaves, many have the feeling that their emancipation, sociability, ease of communication and perfect speech skills are exclusively innate abilities.  But few people think that some of the screen stars had to develop all these qualities through hard work over the years.  Beauty Olga Ushakova is a TV presenter who belongs to this category of people known in the media space. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Olga Ushakova TV presenter" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32144/1303989.jpg" width="339"></div>  Many of the qualities that now make the girl a unique star of the screen, she acquired thanks to her difficult childhood.  Olga Ushakova - a TV presenter (age, height, the weight of which interests all her fans), without a doubt, is an example to follow.  Today, a 35-year-old woman has almost ideal parameters: her height is 172 cm, and her body looks slim and fit.  But few people think that the attractive appearance and the excellent figure of the leader were also not presented from above.  In order to maintain perfect shape after two births, Olga has to work hard.

Olga Ushakova, a TV presenter whose date of birth is interested in many viewers of her broadcasts (since everyone cares about the same question: how old is this beautiful woman, actually), was born on 04/07/1981.  The girl‚Äôs father was a military man, and quite strict orders reigned at home. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Olga Ushakova TV presenter date of birth" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32144/1303979.jpg" width="495"></div>

    <p>  In addition to Olga, two more children grew up in the family: a younger brother and an older sister, who mainly dealt with Olya's upbringing.  Ushakova recalls that when the children in their family were 8‚Äì9 years old, they were already completely independent: they did their homework, prepared for themselves to eat, and cleaned the apartment.  Such qualities acquired from childhood as perseverance, discipline and responsibility in Olga's subsequent life were very useful. </p><h2>  How did the first communication skills develop? </h2><p>  Since the father of the future television presenter was a military man, their family often moved from place to place.  It so happened that Olga did not stay in one school for more than six months.  In order to join the new team, to establish contact with peers and teachers, Olya had to be interesting, sociable and sociable.  Largely thanks to such a childhood with constant moving, Olga Ushakova (the TV presenter, whose photo is in our article) developed the talent for finding an approach to completely different people and the ability to find a common language with them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Received education and experience gained by a business woman </h2><p>  At school age, Ushakova was very fond of reading and had a good memory.  She studied at one of the five and she graduated from high school at 16 with a gold medal.  Then she entered Kharkov University.  After graduation, together with her beloved young man, Olga began to actively engage in business.  Living in Ukraine, the future star of the Russian screen was engaged in the promotion of well-known foreign brands.  Being a fairly young girl, at the age of 23 she already headed one of the branches of a large trading company. </p><h2>  Fatal Relocation to Moscow </h2><p>  Olga Ushakova, a TV presenter whose biography has changed dramatically after moving to Russia, dreamed of being an announcer or TV presenter since childhood.  But life circumstances were such that for a long time the woman had to abandon her dreams.  Everything changed dramatically after she moved to Moscow. </p><p>  In an interview, the TV presenter said that the move was due to the fact that her beloved man needed to be in the Russian capital, and she followed him.  After the move, Olga doubted what she really wanted to do.  Today, she recalls that, seeing her swept state, her beloved asked who she dreamed of becoming in her childhood, and Ushakova remembered that she always wanted to become a star on the television screen. </p><h2>  Parish on TV </h2><p>  Initially, this idea seemed crazy, since Olya did not have a specialized education as a speaker or TV presenter.  In 2004, tests were held at Ostankino, and Olga Ushakova (the TV presenter, who is now loved by almost all viewers of Channel One) decided to go with them at her own peril and risk.  It suddenly turned out that the girl is very photogenic, the camera loves her, and in the frame she looks just great. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Olga Ushakova TV presenter photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32144/1303982.jpg" width="377"></div>  But at the same time, the lack of experience in the media sphere, as well as a clearly pronounced <span>Ukrainian accent,</span> could not allow her to instantly become the leading top programs.  But at the same time, Channel One did not want to lose such an interesting character, and Olga was offered a job as a trainee.

    <h2>  Hard work on yourself and well-deserved career growth </h2><p>  For almost a year, Olga Ushakova, a TV presenter whose husband supported her in all endeavors and aspirations, studied the secrets of the television backstage.  She took lessons in rhetoric and studied the technique of speech, tried to get rid of her accent and learned to write news articles and prepare an <span>informational occasion</span> for them from programs. </p><p>  Gradually, the hope that someday she would nevertheless be allowed to go on the air began to leave Olga.  And just at that moment the vacancy of the leading news program was released.  Olga was offered this place, and she successfully held this position for 9 years. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Olga Ushakova TV presenter biography" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32144/1303990.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In 2014, when no one doubted the professionalism of this woman, she became the host of the Good Morning program, which brought her the recognition and love of the audience across Russia. </p><h2>  Mystery of personal life </h2><p>  Olga really does not like to talk on topics that concern the father of her children.  In all her interviews, she emphasizes that she does not consider it necessary to bring out her personal life for all to see.  From time to time, completely different information appears in the print media and on various information resources regarding the status of relations between Olga and the father of her children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Olga Ushakova TV presenter husband" class="if" height="469" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32144/1303980.jpg" width="470"></div>  According to one of them, Ushakova and her husband are in a civil marriage.  Others write that Olga and her husband divorced, but simply maintain a good and warm relationship.

    <p>  Olga circumvents the topic of marriage and divorce very carefully and tactfully, reporting only that she and the father of her children have one common goal - to give them all the best, make them happy and educate them worthy people.  By the way, this mysterious couple has two children - two weather girls: Ksenia and Daria.  For some reason, despite the fact that the girls still have one father, they are recorded in different surnames.  But about this riddle, Olga also does not apply, nor does she agree to name their father.  Ushakova only says that this is a very correct person, who is much older than her and to whom she is very indebted, primarily for moral support.  Also, the star of the screen notes that this person always instructed her spiritually, encouraged her to spiritual self-development and self-improvement.  To find at least some negative statement of Olga that would concern the father of her children is simply impossible, since she always speaks of him only in the best way. </p><h2>  The secret of good mood and excellent appearance </h2><p>  Olga Ushakova, a TV presenter, an age that haunts most viewers of Channel One, often becomes the subject of controversy and discussion on Internet forums, as she looks really amazing.  The TV presenter herself, apparently wanting to sometimes be a yoke, says that such a fresh and peppy look in the mornings is provided by make-up artists.  Of course, no one reduces their merits, but Olga herself should be given credit.  At the moment, she is 35 years old, but those who see her for the first time on the TV screen will never give her more than 25. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Olga Ushakova TV presenter age" class="if" height="434" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32144/1303981.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Olga endured two pregnancies, and, as she herself admits, after the second birth she restored her form quite hard.  Ushakova said that after the birth of her second daughter, for the first time she began to like herself again only a year later.  At first it was difficult to cope with one of the two little girls, and there was sorely not enough time for ourselves.  But then, when Olya got used to the role of her mother, she took up herself.  Of course, these were physical exercises, massage and cosmetic procedures.  The main incentive that made the TV presenter achieve ideal forms was, of course, her daughter, for whom she wants to be an example in everything. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Olga Ushakova TV presenter personal life" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32144/1303983.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Olga also tries to always have only healthy food in her kitchen, and, as far as possible, Ushakova is trying to comply with the principles of proper nutrition. </p><p>  And, of course, the beloved work and love of regular viewers is the catalyst that makes Olya remain cheerful and positive under any circumstances. </p>
