    <h2>  Explanation of symbols </h2><p>  As you know, on products related to technology, there are certain designations.  Tamron is also no exception, so encryption can be found on any lens.  Unfortunately, even a professional photographer may not know these designations, which makes it difficult to work.  To avoid trouble, you should understand and remember the combinations: </p><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if" style="width: 626px; height: 451px;"><tbody><tr><td>  Di </td><td>  A lens that targets digital cameras.  Although this marking is not a prohibition on the use of the lens for digital SLR cameras. </td></tr><tr><td>  Di ii </td><td>  This marking indicates that it can only be used for modern digital cameras. </td></tr><tr><td>  SP </td><td>  Super Performance (translated as "professional model").  This designation is placed on lenses that meet the highest design requirements.  The best technical parameters are immediately determined on the model with this marking. </td></tr><tr><td>  IF / ZL </td><td>  Means a unique internal focusing system.  This is an important marking for any photographer, because it is such a function that is often required.  Thanks to it, the optical characteristics are significantly improved and presented to the owner at a high level. </td></tr><tr><td>  LD </td><td>  Confirms the presence of elements of low dispersion glass.  This increases the quality of shooting and ensures that there are no problematic issues that sometimes appear with high focus lenses. </td></tr><tr><td>  Xr </td><td>  Tamron lenses with this designation operate using small elements that guarantee a high refractive index.  To create such a model took a lot of time and effort, but now it pleases every owner. </td></tr><tr><td>  Vc </td><td>  A system that makes vibrations almost invisible.  This is a pretty good plus, since the loud work of the camera (and the lens in particular) often causes inconvenience. </td></tr><tr><td>  AS / ASL </td><td>  Aspherical elements in such models contribute to light weight and compact size.  In order to obtain optimal quality, Tamron uses several hybrids, due to which aperture models have no concept of distortion. </td></tr><tr><td>  AD </td><td>  Anomalous scattering - <span>optical glass,</span> which boasts a sufficient scattering ratio (partial).  Professional photographers really appreciate and respect lenses with such markings, because in their work they are truly irreplaceable.  And you can find this designation on some models with automatic or auto and manual focus. </td></tr><tr><td>  Hid </td><td>  An element that helps minimize aberration (an obstacle to optimal quality) along the axis and in the corners. </td></tr><tr><td>  Dg </td><td>  There is a greater enlightenment for the rear lens, which helps to get rid of or slightly reduce the reflections from the matrix. </td></tr><tr><td>  Hsm </td><td>  Means a branded ultrasonic motor that promotes automatic and virtually silent focusing. </td></tr><tr><td>  SHM </td><td>  A special mechanism that helps you easily mount the lens on the camera. </td></tr><tr><td>  Zl </td><td>  The proprietary lock mechanism that prevents the extension of the tube when moving the device over a long distance. </td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  Best lenses </h2><p>  Many people have already purchased Tamron lenses and were pleased with their choice.  As mentioned above, a large assortment is always a difficult choice.  Therefore, you should consider those options that are very popular recently. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tamron lenses for canon" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42731/1420401.jpg" width="600"></div>

Its main advantage is a <span>focal length of</span> 90 mm, which is a pretty good indicator for an amateur photographer.  Focusing can be both automatic and manual.  By weight, this option is not so heavy - only 550 grams. </p><p>  Ideal for shooting outdoors.  Often it is bought in order to capture the most important and interesting moments during the trip.  The compact size allows you to carry the lens in your bag without any difficulties. </p><h2>  AF 18-200mm </h2><p>  The universal Tamron 18-200mm lens differs from other models by the presence of a thread under the filter in as much as 62 millimeters.

    <p>  The price is acceptable for almost all people, so it is very popular among beginners.  The lens will help to create a masterpiece in any area.  After use, positive emotions are guaranteed. </p><h2>  SP 24-70mm </h2><p>  The Tamron SP lens is an upscale model that targets SLR digital cameras.  It is equipped with an optical stabilizer as well as ultrasonic focusing. </p><p>  The SP class itself is highly technical.  Its most important feature is the presence of a proprietary add-on - a three-dimensional vibration compensation system.  This fact gives a guarantee for sharp pictures during long exposures.  Focusing happens pretty quickly and without noise. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Among other things, the lens is made of durable material that protects against the penetration of water, dust and so on. </p><h2>  SP AF 70-200mm </h2><p>  The professional model has, first of all, an ideal ratio of price and quality.  Experienced photographers can afford the acquisition of such a lens, and in return receive a high-quality product that will last for many years. </p><p>  Really high quality images help to achieve low diffusion glass, which is not present in every product of this type.  Any kind of shooting will be pleasant with it: macro, portrait, landscape and so on. </p><p>  And the package includes two covers (front and back) that protect against the ingress of dirt inside, as well as a cover, thanks to which the lens can be taken on trips. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tamron sp lens" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42731/1420399.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  AF 18-270mm </h2><p>  The compact Tamron 18-200mm lens (f / 3.5-6.3 aperture) with the Sony E-mount type is a universal model, the mass of which slightly exceeds 500 grams.  7 aperture blades and 67 millimeters of thread for a light filter - these are the main characteristics that attract customers.  Professional photographers with extensive experience recommend it to beginners, as the low price and high enough quality will allow them to learn the basic nuances in this profession. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  AF 70-300mm </h2><p>  The unusual Tamron 70-300mm lens has a large number of advantages, for which all customers love it.  First of all, it is worth noting that its weight, compared to previous models, is slightly more - 765 grams.  In addition, it boasts the presence of 8 aperture blades, as well as manual and automatic focusing.  Any important point will be recorded in the picture, taking into account all the small details.  The result is a beautiful photo with high quality. </p><p>  This product is bought more often by professionals, not beginners or amateurs. </p><h2>  AF 28-75mm </h2><p>  Zoom lens, quite compact and lightweight.  Design distinguishes it from similar options and immediately attracts customers to itself.  The fast aperture is designed for shots that require a long shutter speed.  Focusing (manual and automatic) does its job perfectly.  Thanks to this lens, you can get clear high-quality images from various holidays, competitions or travels. </p><h2>  Tamron or Nikon </h2><p>  The two most popular firms produce good products, so customers often have to choose the best product.  For comparison, you can take the Tamron f2.8 lens and the Nikon model with similar characteristics.  In the end, it will be clearly understood that similar data is not at all an indicator that both lenses guarantee the same high image quality. </p><h2>  Catalog </h2><p>  Judging by the catalog, Tamron lenses are inferior to the second production in price.  But the winner is the ‚ÄúTamron‚Äù, which has a large aperture.  In all other respects, the options are similar: image stabilization, appearance, equipment and so on. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tamron lens reviews" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42731/1420400.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Thus, if you choose only by price, not taking into account the technical characteristics, then the favorite is immediately determined. </p><h2>  Sharpness and contrast </h2><p>  Judging by the testing, some nuances were clarified, after which the product "Tamron" was recognized as the winner.  During the test, the settings were exactly the same, so there was no catch here.  As a result, photographers noted the excellent performance of both lenses.  But the winner was unanimously identified, because the contrast, and accordingly the sharpness of the finished image, were much weaker at Nikon. </p><p>  Professional photographers recommend Tamron lenses for Canon.  In this combination, any person will be able to independently verify and confirm its high quality. </p><h2>  Long distance </h2><p>  At the next stage of testing, the settings were set not only "by default".  The city was chosen as the subject.  In the first case, despite the better aperture, Tamron showed a slightly worse result, although there were no serious differences between the images. </p><p>  But when setting other settings, our favorite was successfully rehabilitated and became the winner again.  This fact indicates that the lens owner will have to deal with all its nuances and learn how to set the correct parameters to get the perfect photo. </p><h2>  Bokeh </h2><p>  Tamron lenses have successfully passed another test step.  17 attempts to make a better photo did not help Nikon, so a unanimous victory was given to the favorite, who showed his power at the very first stage. </p><p>  Compared to Tamron, Nikon showed, it can be said, terrible performance.  Although the quality of bokeh is not important for every photographer, it should be considered when choosing a purchase. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tamron f lens" class="if" height="243" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42731/1420398.jpg" width="574"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Any commercially available Tamron lens will, of course, receive feedback from its owners.  And on their basis, the buyer will be able to decide whether to take the products of this manufacturer. </p><p>  The opinions of real people are not negative.  And in fact, how can you find flaws in lenses that have compact sizes, suitable equipment, a quick focus function, and so on.  In addition, when buying goods, a person receives a warranty card for a long period.  Quite rarely, Tamron lenses require repair at this time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tamron 18 200mm f 3 5 6 3 lens" class="if" height="389" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42731/1420396.jpg" width="600"></div>
