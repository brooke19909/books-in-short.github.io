Most manufacturers are constantly updating their product range.  Customers are happy and even with some trepidation await the release of new products.  In addition to well-known world-famous brands (Samsung, Apple), Chinese manufacturers have also become leaders.  Previously, buyers were wary of such devices, preferring to overpay a certain amount, but buy quality products.  Now everything has changed dramatically.  Gadgets from the Middle Kingdom please not only with a beautiful design, hardware, good quality, but also low cost.  It is worth noting that such devices fill the niches of not only the budget segment, but also the middle class.  These are the ones that Huawei produces. </p><p>  The hero of our review debuted in 2016.  This is a smartphone Huawei Nova (CAN-L11).  The expert reviews about this model are mixed.  "Why?"  - you ask.  The device has some features that underestimate its assessment.  Noticed the shortcomings and the owners.  They share their impressions.  Those who are seriously interested in this model, it is very useful to read the reviews of real people.  At the start of sales, the price tag for the gadget reached $ 370.  If you pay that kind of money, then you need to know why. </p><p>  The review below is based on owner reviews and specifications announced by the manufacturer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="huawei nova reviews" class="if" height="440" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2013758.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Distinctive feature </h2><p>  The phone is a compact device that may interest those customers who, for whatever reason, do not want to switch to bulky "shovels."  It can be called "average", as the gadget is equipped with a typical "stuffing" for its price category.  However, you can often find such reviews about the Huawei Nova 32Gb, which state that, against the background of other Chinese gadgets, its price seems somewhat overpriced.  Did the manufacturer justify the difference in cost?  This is what we have to deal with. </p><p>  The first thing customers pay attention to is the specifications.  A detailed description of them can be read below.  Some features distinguish this model from devices of the budget segment, for example, Qualcomm chipset.  But smartphones with a class below are based on their own Kirin platform. </p><p>  What other features interested users?  Many have focused on the Huawei Nova fingerprint scanner.  In the reviews, the owners highlight its versatility.  In addition to the main purpose, it can be used as a button.  Settings are available to the user, thanks to which the scanner can be programmed to receive an incoming call or to activate the front camera.  The phone is controlled by both standard movements (swipe) and gestures.  With the help of the latter, the user will be able to open the curtain and view pictures.  Gestures are recognized thanks to sensors installed on the smartphone case. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the comments, users included design features as well.  But we will talk about it in more detail. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  The external design of the phone remotely resembles the previous Nexus 6P model, released in 2015.  The most similarity has the rear panel, more precisely, the plastic insert in the upper part, on which the camera lens is displayed.  Did Huawei Nova Gray receive negative reviews for this?  Not.  Users did not consider the decision of designers a significant drawback.  On the contrary, this insert fits perfectly into the metal case, giving it a complete look. </p><p>  Equally important for owners is the build quality of the device.  Users studied and examined it from all sides, and a laudatory verdict was heard in the comments: no play, creaking, surface deflection was found.  This suggests that the developers responsibly reacted to this issue.  However, as is usually the case with Chinese devices, there is one ‚Äúbut.‚Äù  It lies in the fact that when you touch the body, you can feel the boundaries of the elements at the places of transitions of materials. </p><p>  What about the size of Huawei Nova Gold in reviews?  This phone, like models made in other colors, can be safely called compact.  It weighs only 146 g. The thickness indicator is fully consistent with modern requirements and is only 7.1 mm.  Advantage or disadvantage is difficult to judge.  On the one hand, a narrow gadget looks pretty pretty, but on the other hand, users are not advised to wear it in the back pocket of trousers, so as not to accidentally bend the case.  Such cases did not seem to be there, but it is better to play it safe.  The height of the case - 141 mm with a width of 69 mm - looks pretty harmonious, as for a 5-inch smartphone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="huawei nova gold reviews" class="if" height="492" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2013760.jpg" width="257"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  A lot of positive reviews about Huawei Nova Gold were made to 2.5D glass.  Its properties allow you not to worry about scratches, cracks and chips.  Also, its availability exempts owners from acquiring a protective film. </p><p>  On the front side, the manufacturer did not use a standard control panel.  Instead, the company name flaunts.  Function buttons moved to the screen.  In this matter, the opinions of users are divided.  Some enthusiastically made this decision, but there are those who categorically did not like it.  As they say: how many people, so many opinions. </p><p>  The space above the display is occupied by standard elements.  We are talking about the front camera, event indicator, sensor and dynamics.  There is no point in dwelling on them in detail, since no new technologies have been used here. </p><p>  Huawei Nova LTE receives positive reviews thanks to the aluminum back cover.  Its quality is undoubtedly much better than plastic counterparts.  As mentioned above, there is a glossy insert on which the flash and the ‚Äúwindow‚Äù of the main camera are displayed.  Immediately below this insert, the developers placed a fingerprint scanner.  In order to ensure optimal conditions for the operation of the antennas, there is also a small plastic insert in the lower part of the housing.  She did not affect the positive experience of interacting with a smartphone.  The developers designed it in the same shade as the entire body.  Due to this, the surface imitates aluminum very well. </p><p>  The metal with a chrome coating is used for the rim, which runs along the entire perimeter of the gadget.  Its reliability does not allow to doubt the quality of materials used in Huawei Nova.  The reviews of the owners confirm this.  The shape of this frame is rounded, but its borders are clearly visible. </p><p>  The headphone jack is located on the upper end.  There is also a hole for a noise canceling microphone.  The bottom end is used to accommodate the USB port and speaker.  Everything is located on the side faces, as in other models: on the left there is a SIM tray, on the right there are mechanical buttons that adjust the volume and turn on / off the smartphone. </p><h2>  Reviews and screen specifications </h2><p>  Let's look at the features of the Huawei Nova 32Gb screen.  Feedback in this matter will help us a lot.  First, we‚Äôll clarify the characteristics declared by the manufacturer.  The diagonal of the display is 5 ∫.  Of course, at this time you will not surprise anyone.  However, here the manufacturer prepared a surprise for the buyer.  It's about permission.  A 5-inch screen allows you to enjoy Full HD quality.  Most often, displays with such a diagonal have a resolution of 1280 √ó 720 px, so this decision by the manufacturer definitely deserves respect. </p><p>  Screen technology - LTPS.  She is currently one of the best.  The user gets wide viewing angles, excellent color reproduction, optimal brightness margin.  As for the latter, the range is enough for comfortable work in sunny weather.  Under direct rays, of course, the picture changes, but the information remains readable.  Many users separately highlighted the contrast level, which is 1500: 1. </p><p>  It does not hurt to talk about the properties of the sensor.  It works quickly and clearly even with a light touch.  The screen of the device is equipped with a special option, with the help of which 10 clicks made simultaneously are recognized.  The developers did not forget about the <span>oleophobic coating.</span>  Thanks to him, it‚Äôs convenient to control the phone, since the finger easily glides on the glass.  It is also worth noting that the level of soiling is minimized, which cannot but please the owners, especially those who do not prefer to use a smartphone in a case. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="huawei nova 32gb reviews" class="if" height="437" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2013759.jpg" width="600"></div><strong></strong>

    <h2>  Hardware equipment </h2><p>  What else needs to be said about the Huawei Nova 32Gb smartphone?  The reviews presented on the forums often raise the topic of performance.  Undoubtedly, this is an important criterion.  It will be quite difficult to understand the features of the hardware "stuffing" to an unprepared person.  Technical indicators can only be decrypted by one who has certain knowledge. </p><p>  What characteristics did the manufacturer indicate?  Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 is responsible for the device‚Äôs performance. Undoubtedly, this processor is considered more powerful than the one used in budget models of this brand. </p><p>  The chipset is based on eight cores.  Their type is Cortex-A53.  Now attention!  The maximum clock frequency reaches 2000 MHz.  For the middle price category this is a pretty good result.  Advanced users claim that the developers were able to optimally combine energy efficiency and the level of productivity.  The process is indicated by the process technology (14 nm). </p><p>  Technical capabilities also depend on the model of the graphics accelerator.  Often, users are faced with the fact that after installing an animated image on the splash screen, the gadget starts to slow down somewhat.  This can also occur during the launch of games.  What is the reason?  In the capabilities of the video card.  The Adreno 506 processor is responsible for the graphics in this model. It is not the most powerful, its performance is average.  Not failed and the amount of RAM.  Its in this phone model as much as three gigabytes. </p><p>  So, what do all the above characteristics of the hardware platform testify to?  The smartphone can easily cope with all modern applications.  Any sites start quickly, switching between tabs does not take more than a second.  Many users are interested in how the device behaves during games.  Note that everyone, even ‚Äúheavy ones‚Äù, will start smoothly and work without delays.  The conclusion suggests itself: the Nova is great for multitasking. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="huawei nova 4g reviews" class="if" height="255" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2013761.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Talk about memory </h2><p>  How can an ordinary user choose the optimal amount of internal memory?  Probably, at least once every person was faced with the fact that during the installation of applications a warning about a lack of memory appeared.  The reason is that you can install software on Android devices only by saving them in your own storage.  Let's understand what is offered to the buyer in the Huawei Nova model?  32 GB  Owner reviews indicate that no more than 25 GB will be available from them.  This storage is enough to install two resource-intensive games and several "light" applications. </p><p>  A separate slot for a memory card is not provided.  If necessary, it can be installed instead of a SIM card of a mobile operator. </p><h2>  Huawei Nova Gold (CAN-L11): battery life reviews </h2><p>  The manufacturer equipped the gadget with a pretty good battery.  Its capacity is 3020 milliamps per hour.  Given the thickness of the smartphone, such a battery is the best solution.  In their reviews, users say that with a low load (no more than 2-3 hours per day of activity), the battery life is approximately three days.  When watching movies and other videos, the battery lasts for 8 hours.  It is these characteristics that almost all mid-range smartphones have. </p><p>  To restore the charge to 100% will have to spend about 2 hours.  In the official firmware, energy-saving modes are not provided. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  About Huawei Nova cameras, the reviews are mostly positive.  For the main manufacturer, I chose the matrix of the famous manufacturer Sony.  It's about the IMX286 model.  The lens is based on six wide-angle lenses.  To improve the quality, the developers implemented phase autofocus.  There is also a LED flash. </p><p>  The shooting quality is adequate.  It is quite justified by the cost of the device.  However, users claim that, for example, for Samsung, Huawei gadgets are not competitors.  If you activate the HDR mode when shooting outdoors, then the photos are detailed with good color reproduction.  I liked the users and the camera in the room.  However, there are still flaws, which is confirmed by the reviews.  Huawei Nova is not the only smartphone whose optics are not complete.  For example, the most common problem is a jump in sharpness, noticeable when the photo is enlarged.  Pictures taken at night, although not very obtained, but if you compare, for example, with the Meizu M3, the difference is noticeable to the naked eye.  Definitely, Huawei wins.  The main camera is capable of recording video in 4K quality. </p><p>  The front module also has a good matrix.  Its resolution is 8 megapixels.  According to users, this camera is the most balanced selfie solution.  Surprisingly, when compared to the Samsung Galaxy A5, the winner was the Nova. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="huawei nova gray reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2013763.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Communication opportunities </h2><p>  This phone model supports the work with two SIM cards of mobile operators.  The special tray has two slots.  They are oriented to the nano format.  There is one important point that you should pay attention to.  It's about working with memory cards in the Huawei Nova 32Gb LTE.  Reviews on this subject can hardly be called positive.  The fact is that to install it you will need to sacrifice one of the SIM cards, as the developers combined their slots. </p><p>  The phone, as befits a modern device, works not only with networks of the second and third generations, but also with 4G.  Theoretically, the maximum available speed is 300 Mbps.  However, it is worthwhile to understand that the LTE network still does not catch all over Russia, so if you have connection problems, you must first check the coverage. </p><p>  Gadgets that are sold at official locations work great with all frequencies.  Nobody can guarantee such a result of phones bought directly from China. </p><p>  Among the communication capabilities, it is worth highlighting the presence of an NFC transmitter, GLONASS, GPS, Bluetooth modules.  The version of the latter is 4.1, although at present most manufacturers already install the most effective 4.2.  There are comments on the Wi-Fi module.  It only works in the 2.4 GHz frequency range. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  Almost all Chinese smartphones work on Android.  No exception was the Huawei Nova.  Feedback on the interface of the sixth version is only positive.  Settings are very easy.  Everything is clear on an intuitive level.  Each user will be able to choose the most suitable screen design.  The curtain opens quick access to brightness control, activation of the Wi-Fi module, the choice of a SIM card and other functions.  You can create multiple desktops for ease of use. </p><p>  Users in the comments say that the manufacturer introduced this model for an official update to the seventh version. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="huawei nova 32gb reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2013765.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The target audience </h2><p>  Who will like the Huawei Nova 4G?  Reviews clearly indicate the target audience.  This model is aimed at advanced users who can appreciate a balanced hardware system.  The stylish appearance makes the device desirable both for young people and for respectable people who care about their status. </p><p>  Although manufacturers are currently trying to produce gadgets with large screens, this model with a 5-inch display has rather compact dimensions, so it is ideal for those who do not like phablets. </p><p>  Users assure that the phone looks equally harmonious both in elegant female hands and in strong male hands. </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  Highlight reviews of strengths and weaknesses.  Huawei Nova Dual Sim is a good smartphone, but it is not without flaws.  What caused the most comments and complaints?  First of all, the owners were very disappointed that the Wi-Fi module operates only in the 2.4 GHz frequency range.  Currently, most devices already work with 5 GHz.  Dissatisfaction also caused a quiet speaker.  You can, of course, try changing the settings in the engineering menu, but for this you need to have some knowledge. </p><p>  About the sad already told, now you can go to the wonderful moments.  The advantages attributed to users include the following: </p><ul><li>  High screen resolution. </li><li> Adequate level of image quality. </li><li>  The average battery life. </li><li>  Optimally balanced hardware platform. </li><li>  Stylish design with easy-to-see individual style. </li><li>  Body thickness. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Summarize </h2><p>  By and large, only positive impressions remained from interaction with Huawei Nova (CAN-L11).  Reviews, of course, are also negative, but they are much less than laudatory.  Its main advantage is the balance of the hardware system.  Performance and battery life will allow users to not feel the limitations when working with the gadget.  The device performs all daily tasks with a bang. </p>
