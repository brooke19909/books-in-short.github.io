Where can tourists stay and how are they fed?  What <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="74" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">other</span> services are there at the recreation center?  We will talk about this below. </p><h2>  How it all began? </h2><p>  Today, Okhta Park in St. Petersburg is the region‚Äôs largest winter ski resort and a great base to relax in the summer.  Back in 1993, a group of enthusiasts who loved to ski noticed an interesting slope 20 km from St. Petersburg, next to the beautiful Okhta River.  Together they made a homemade lift, cleared a fairly large area for the first track.  All this was carried out with the aim of consciousness of the training zone for the children's ski school. </p><p>  So a small base was opened on which the younger generation of St. Petersburg learned to ski under the strict guidance of adults.  Over time, it turned into a huge complex, which became known as the winter ski resort.  This is the only place of its kind in the entire area.  The address of <span>the recreation center</span> "Okhta Park" (St. Petersburg): Leningrad region., Vsevolozhsk district, village.  Mistolovo, st.  L. Kedrina.  The road from the Northern capital takes no more than 30 minutes by car.  You need to follow to the traffic police post on Kultury Avenue, and then turn to the direction of the village of Bugry following the sign, turn right after it.  By public transport you can get from <span>the metro stations</span> Parnas, Devyatkino, Toksovo directly to the complex. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  After reconstruction </h2><p>  The updated Okhta Park base (St. Petersburg) resumed its work after a short break in 2015.  Renovations touched everything, but first of all, the infrastructure of the slopes and lifts was updated, the territory was expanded, many more modern innovations appeared for lovers of winter recreation. </p><p>  On the photo "Okhta Park" (St. Petersburg) you can see the satisfied faces of vacationers, many of whom come here regularly with their entire families with children or large friendly companies.  The base is open all year and is located in a very picturesque place among the stately pines. </p>
