The formation of the properties of a certain type of water mass occurs over a long period of time, which makes them relatively constant and water masses are perceived as a whole. </p>

    <h2>  The main characteristics of marine water masses </h2><p>  In the process of interaction with the atmosphere, aquatic oceanic masses acquire various characteristics that differ depending on the degree of impact, as well as on the source of formation. </p><ol><li>  Temperature is one of the main indicators by which the water mass of the World Ocean is estimated.  It is logical that the temperature of surface sea waters finds its extremum at equatorial latitude, as the distance from which the water temperature decreases. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water mass property" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46438/1646789.jpg" width="523"></div></li><li>  Salinity.  The salinity of water flows is affected by the level of precipitation, evaporation rate, as well as the amount of fresh water coming from the continents in the form of large rivers.  The highest salinity is recorded in the Red Sea basin: 41 ‚Ä∞.  The salinity map of sea waters is clearly visible in the following figure. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water masses" class="if" height="343" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46438/1646819.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  The density of water masses directly depends on how deep they are located at sea level.  This is explained by the laws of physics, according to which a denser, and therefore heavier, liquid falls below a liquid with a lower density. </li></ol>

The upper layers of ocean water are more susceptible to mixing and atmospheric influence than the deeper layers of water of the same geographical region.  In connection with this factor, the water masses of the oceans are divided into two large sections: </p><ol><li>  The ocean troposphere is the upper, the so-called surface water layers, the lower boundary of which reaches 200-300, and sometimes 500 meters of depth.  They differ in the most affected by atmospheric, temperature and climate conditions.  They have heterogeneous characteristics depending on the territorial affiliation. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="types of water masses" class="if" height="422" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46438/1646788.jpg" width="433"></div></li><li>  Oceanic stratosphere - deep waters below surface layers with more stable properties and characteristics.  The properties of the water masses of the stratosphere are more stable, since there are no strong and extensive movements of water flows, especially in the vertical section. </li></ol><h2>  Types of Ocean Troposphere Waters </h2><p>  The ocean troposphere is formed under the influence of a combination of dynamic factors: climate, precipitation, as well as the influx of mainland waters.  In this regard, surface waters have frequent fluctuations in temperature and salinity.  The movement of water from one latitude to another forms the formation of warm and <span>cold currents.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  In <span>surface waters</span> , the greatest saturation with life forms in the form of fish and plankton is observed.  The types of water masses of the oceanic troposphere are usually subdivided according to geographical latitudes with a pronounced climatic factor.  We will name the main of them: </p><ul><li>  Equatorial. </li><li>  Tropical. </li><li>  Subtropical. </li><li>  Subpolar. </li><li>  Polar. </li></ul><h2>  Characteristic of equatorial water masses </h2><p>  The territorial zoning of the equatorial water masses covers a geographical strip from 0 to 5 north latitude.  The equatorial climate is characterized by almost the same high temperature regime throughout the entire calendar year, therefore, the water masses of this region are warmed up to a sufficient degree, reaching a temperature of 26-28. </p><p>  Due to heavy rainfall and the influx of fresh river water from the mainland, the equatorial ocean waters have a small percentage of salinity (up to 34.5 ‚Ä∞) and the lowest conditional density (22-23).  The saturation of the region‚Äôs water environment with oxygen also has the lowest value (3-4 ml / l) due to the high average annual temperature. </p><h2>  Characteristics of tropical water masses </h2><p>  The zone of tropical water masses occupies two bands: 5-35 of the northern hemisphere (north-tropical waters) and up to 30 of the southern (south-tropical waters).  Formed under the influence of climate and air masses - trade winds. </p><p>  The summer temperature maximum corresponds to equatorial latitude, but in winter this indicator drops to the level of 18-20 above zero.  The zone is characterized by the presence of ascending water flows from a depth of 50-100 meters near the western coastal continental lines and descending flows from the eastern coast of the mainland. </p><p>  Tropical species of water masses have a higher salinity (35‚Äì35.5 ‚Ä∞) and relative density (24-26) than the equatorial zone.  The oxygen saturation of tropical water flows remains approximately at the same level as in the equatorial band, but the phosphate saturation exceeds: 1-2 Œºg-at / l versus 0.5-1 Œºg-at / l in equatorial waters. </p><h2>  Subtropical water masses </h2><p>  The temperature during the year of the subtropical water zone can drop to 15. In the tropical latitude, desalination of water occurs to a lesser extent than in other climatic zones, since there is a small amount of precipitation, while intensive evaporation occurs. </p><p>  Here, the salinity of the waters can reach up to 38 ‚Ä∞.  Subtropical water masses of the ocean during cooling in the winter season give a lot of heat, thereby making a significant contribution to the process of heat transfer of the planet. </p><p>  The boundaries of the subtropical zone reach approximately 45 southern hemispheres and up to 50 north latitudes.  There is an increase in water saturation with oxygen, and therefore with life forms. </p><h2>  Characterization of subpolar water masses </h2><p>  <span>As you move away from the equator, the temperature of water flows decreases and varies depending on the time of year.</span>  <span>So in the territory of subpolar water masses (50-70 N and 45-60 S) in winter, the water temperature drops to 5-7, and in summer it rises to 12-15</span> <sup><span>about</span></sup> <span>C.</span> </p><p>  <span><span>Water salinity tends to decrease from subtropical water masses towards the poles.</span></span>  <span><span>This happens due to the melting of icebergs - sources of fresh water</span></span> . </p>

    <h2>  Characterization and features of polar water masses </h2><p>  <span>Localization of polar oceanic masses - near continental polar northern and southern spaces, thus, oceanologists distinguish the presence of Arctic and Antarctic water masses.</span>  <span>Distinctive features of polar waters are, of course, the lowest temperature indicators: on average in summer 0, and in winter 1.5-1.8 below zero, which also affects the density - here it is the highest.</span> </p><p>  <span><span>In addition to temperature, low salinity (32-33 ‚Ä∞) is also noted due to the melting of continental fresh glaciers.</span></span>  <span><span>The waters of the polar latitudes are very rich in oxygen and phosphates, which favorably affects the diversity of the organic world.</span></span> </p><h2>  Types and properties of water masses of the oceanic stratosphere </h2><p>  <span>Oceanologists are conventionally subdivided into the oceanic stratosphere into three types:</span> </p><ol><li>  <span>Intermediate waters cover the water column at a depth of 300-500 m to 1000 m, and sometimes 2000 m. Compared to the other two types of water masses of the stratosphere, the intermediate layer is the most illuminated, warmer and more rich in oxygen and phosphates, and therefore richer underwater world plankton and various species of fish.</span>  <span>Under the influence of the proximity to the water flows of the troposphere, in which rapidly flowing water mass prevails, the hydrothermal characteristics and the flow rate of the water flows of the intermediate layer are very dynamic.</span>  <span>The general trend of intermediate water movement is observed in the direction from high latitudes to the equator.</span>  <span>The thickness of the intermediate layer of the oceanic stratosphere is not the same everywhere; a wider layer is observed near the polar zones.</span> </li><li>  Deep waters have a distribution area starting from a depth of 1000-1200 m, and reach 5 km below sea level and are characterized by more constant hydrothermal data.  The horizontal flow of water flows of this layer is much less than intermediate waters and is 0.2-0.8 cm / s. </li><li>  The bottom layer of water is least studied by oceanologists in view of their inaccessibility, because they are located at a depth of more than 5 km from the surface of the water.  The main features of the bottom layer are an almost constant level of salinity and high density. </li></ol>
