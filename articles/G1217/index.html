It was founded in 2006.  Today the park is one of the best recreational facilities in the Maryino area. </p><h2>  Dusseldorf park on a map of Moscow </h2><p>  The facility is located in the southeastern part of the capital, in the Maryino area.  On the city map, the park is bordered by Novomaryinskaya and Belorechenskaya streets, as well as Perervinsky Boulevard.  It is a small hill with an irregularly shaped artificial pond. </p>

    <p>  This place is still difficult to call a full-fledged park, since the plantings in it are still very young and do not give any shade. </p><p>  How can I get to Dusseldorf Park?  To do this, get off at the <span>Bratislavskaya metro station,</span> and then walk a few more blocks in a north-east direction.  The park can also be reached by ground transport - by buses No. 81 or No. 853 (stop at the 9th microdistrict of Maryinsky park). </p><h2>  History of the park </h2><p>  Dusseldorf Park is, in fact, a certain <span>symbol of friendship</span> and close cooperation between Moscow and Dusseldorf, between Russia and Germany.  As you know, these two European settlements have been twin cities since 1992. </p><p>  Dusseldorf is a fairly large city with a population of about 600 thousand people, which is located in the west of Germany.  The first diplomatic relations between the city and Moscow were established in the late 60s of the twentieth century. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>The green zone</span> in Maryino appeared in 2006, and in 2009 D√ºsseldorf Park got its modern name.  Specialists (architects, designers, florists) from Germany worked on this park.  That is why it is very similar to the green areas of German cities. </p>

    <p>  The park was inaugurated in the spring of 2009.  The ceremony was attended by <span>Yuri Luzhkov,</span> as well as Dirk Elbers (chief mayor of the German city). </p><h2>  "Highlights" of the park </h2><p>  In Dusseldorf Park, in addition to the pond, alleys and green spaces, a cycle track is equipped.  There is also a small zoo where rabbits, goats and even an owl live. </p><p>  One of the first trees in the park was an oak planted by Yuri Luzhkov and Dirk Elbers on April 18, 2009.  It grows right in the center of the new recreation area. </p><p>  At the entrance to D√ºsseldorf Park is a black plate with an inscription in German.  It says the following: "Dusseldorf - a twin city since 1992." </p>

    <p>  An interesting pond in the park: if you look at it from a bird's eye view, it will resemble a tadpole.  But to cartographers, the shape of the reservoir will surely resemble the conventional topographic designation of the spring. </p><p>  One of the main symbols of Dusseldorf, a sculpture of a boy making a "wheel", is also installed in the Moscow park.  It is completely covered with multi-colored candy wrappers from chewing gums and sweets. </p><h2>  Temple in Dusseldorf Park </h2><p>  The decision to build an Orthodox church on the territory of the young park was made in 2012.  It is known that some residents of the adjacent residential areas were against this initiative and insisted that the park remain exclusively a recreational area.  However, at a <span>public hearing</span> on this subject, all the inhabitants of Maryino who were present spoke out "for" the construction of the church. </p><p>  In April 2012, the first prayer service was held at the site of the future temple.  In the next two and a half years it was built: in January 2015, the interior decoration of the church walls was completed.  It also established a temporary iconostasis. </p><p>  The temple was named after the Holy Myrrh-bearing Women.  These are precisely those women who joyfully accepted Jesus Christ in their homes and homes.  Later, they followed the Savior to Calvary.  It was the Myrrh-bearing Women who were the first to discover that the body of the crucified Christ was not in the tomb, and heralded his resurrection. </p>
