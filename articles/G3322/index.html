The Kurgan region is no exception.  The lakes in this area are very picturesque, and many come to <span>these reservoirs</span> to spend their weekends or vacations.  Each of these corners is distinguished by something special: somewhere you can successfully go fishing, and somewhere you can get well. </p><h2>  Kurgan region: lakes and their features </h2><p>  This area is rich in lakes, there are more than three thousand.  Around 2000 are freshwater.  The remaining lakes differ in salt water, and some have an alkaline composition.  Their size is mostly small, and only 400 of them are large.  It is believed that the <span>lake Schuchye</span> - the largest in the Kurgan region.  Here, fishermen can catch not only pike, but also perch, crucian carp and carp. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kurgan region of the lake" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1042184.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  But Shchuchye is not the only reservoir for which the Kurgan region is famous.  Lakes of large sizes are Steklene, Black, Kobylino, Found, Monastic, Kamagan.  These and other places are very fond of fishermen, because there is an abundance of fish.  It can be noted that in the Kurgan region fishermen do not rest all year round.  Only in mid-April can you take a short break, as the fish goes to spawn.  But in the rest of the period, the catch of local fishermen can be envied.  In each lake, certain species of fish are found, and even in small ponds there is something to profit from. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  List of lakes </h2><p>  As already noted, the abundance of water bodies is what the Kurgan region is famous for.

    <h2>  Gorky Lake </h2><p>  In addition, there are many recreational ponds in this area.  For example, the most famous of them is Lake Gorkoye (Kurgan region, 18 km from the village of Zverinogolovskoye).  It is a drainage water body; its nutrition is possible due to meteogenic and groundwater.  Its area is 6 km <sup>2</sup> .  On average, the depth of the lake is 2 m. The bottom has no sharp drops and troughs.  The upper silt layer has the smell of hydrogen sulfide, black.  Steppe grass grows along the shore, but on the eastern shore there is a pine forest (artificially planted in the 19th century).  During the warm season, many tourists come here. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the forest there is a sanatorium that helps to heal with the help of healing mud.  Therefore, those who suffer from heart, musculoskeletal and nervous diseases, have inflammatory processes, problems with the gastrointestinal tract and other organs, come to maintain health.  A list of diseases that dirt can affect can be obtained from the employees of the Pine Grove sanatorium. </p><h2>  Bear Lake </h2><p>  <span>Medvezhye Lake</span> (Kurgan Region) is also famous for its wellness mud.  But its difference from other reservoirs is also highly salty water.  It feeds on meltwater. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bear Lake Kurgan Region" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1042183.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  This large lake, if you look at the area, it occupies more than 61 km <sup>2</sup> .  But it is small.  On average, its depth is 70 cm. Closer to the center, the lake deepens to 120 cm. Lake Medvezhye (Kurgan region) is popular among vacationers with children, because it is very difficult to drown here, because in addition to the shallow pond, it has very salty water, which literally pushes a person.  The composition of the water of the reservoir makes it unsuitable for fish, wildlife and vegetation. </p><p>  There is a sanatorium on the lake, designed to treat joints, muscles and nervous system with mud.  In winter, the pond is practically not covered by ice due to the high concentration of salt.  Although it is worth noting that salinity can vary. </p><h2>  Lake Vacation Reviews </h2><p>  Those who want to heal and just relax, go in the summer to Bear Lake (Kurgan region).  The reviews of these people show that the area is really conducive to improving and raising tone.  It should be noted that during the holiday season there are a lot of tourists, although a place for a tent can always be found.  But it is better to take fresh water with you in reserve. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bear lake kurgan region reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1042207.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  If desired, you can settle in a neighboring village.  There are shops in such villages, and a cafeteria at the recreation center.  Many travelers say that traveling here for two days is not enough.  The terrain and landscapes are very beautiful, mud helps to heal, and the soul rests, so you return home refreshed and alert. </p>
