  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Guangzhou Safari Park: an unusual zoo</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Guangzhou is the largest city in South China, famous for its huge number of attractions and places of interest to visit.  One of them is the only Guangzhou safari park - Chimelong.  It has a huge area - about 130 hectares, which is inhabited by more than 300 species of various animals. </p><h2>  What makes Chimelong Safari Park special? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="travelingbugwiththreeboys-kelleyn.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bear in the Aviary" class="if uuid-2567463" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/91082/2567463.jpg"></div><p>  Guangzhou safari park itself is more like a huge reserve, here animals are not kept in cages, but enjoy life behind fences in large enclosures. </p><p>  The zoo is divided into two zones: the first is a safari zone, where visitors are transported around the territory in peculiar steam locomotives consisting of several small wagons; here you can also rent a special car or drive your own, having made an independent trip;  the second is the pedestrian zone. </p><p>  The safari zone is divided into parts according to the natural regions of animal habitat.  Here you can not only see animals living in the open air from very close range, but even touch and feed some of them. </p><h2>  Safari area </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.animalsmix.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Passenger steam locomotives" class="if uuid-2567487" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/91082/2567487.jpg"></div><p>  On the territory of this zone animals are kept practically without barriers.  Some of them can be found freely moving along the road, for example, kangaroos or llamas. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Near each animal, the engine stops for a couple of minutes so that tourists can take pictures, but getting out of transport is prohibited.  It is best to take places in the last carriage - this will provide an opportunity for an additional review. </p><p>  The habitats of carnivorous and large animals are fenced by a moat and tensioned wire. </p><p>  In the safari zone you can see elephants, camels, tigers, lions, cheetahs, hippos, bears, rhinos, giraffes, storks and other large species of animals and birds. </p><p>  A trip on the route of one tram takes about half an hour, but to see all the animals, you may need several of these trips. </p><h2>  Pedestrian zone </h2><div class="photo" data-original="hydro73.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Meerkats in the aviary" class="if uuid-2567468" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/91082/2567468.jpg"></div><p>  The most numerous inhabitants of the territory are monkeys.  They can be seen not only in aviaries, but also climbing trees above their heads.  You can also buy food for them and feed. </p><p>  The next largest are birds, especially parrots.  Very interesting to visit at home for newborns.  Here you can see the recently hatched chicks, monkey babies, tiger cubs, cubs and others.  Also see the animals that are in the safari zone, but here they are in aviaries, and almost any of them can be fed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For children there is a zone with pets - goats, hens, horses and others.  There are rides nearby. </p><p>  There are several more particularly interesting parts of the pedestrian zone. </p><ul><li>  Panda Center is an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 10 thousand square meters.  m, which is inhabited by pandas.  Here conditions are recreated as close as possible to their habitat. </li><li>  Australian Park - You can see the koalas and kangaroos. </li><li>  Tiger Zone - 6 species of tigers live in this part: northeastern, southern Chinese, gold, silver, white and Bengal. </li><li>  Mountain of the green dragon - here you can observe the gigantic salamander, as well as various owls, squirrels and hamsters. </li><li>  Jurassic Park is a territory on which very realistic figures of dinosaurs are exhibited, which can jump out of the bushes at the most unexpected moment. </li><li>  A snake trail inhabited by various species of snakes. </li><li>  Swan lake with a large number of white and black swans, which themselves swim up to visitors in search of food. </li><li>  Rainforest, in which various species of monkeys, lemurs and other tropical animals live. </li></ul><h2>  Zoo show </h2><div class="photo" data-original="secretlifeofatravellingpig.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Elephant show" class="if uuid-2567479" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/91082/2567479.jpg"></div><p>  Another difference between the Guangzhou Safari Park and the regular zoo is that it hosts various animal shows: </p><ul><li>  tigers; </li><li>  elephants; </li><li>  birds </li><li>  hippos; </li><li>  monkeys and others. </li></ul><p>  The program includes not only feeding animals, but also performing some tricks, dances and performances. </p><p>  In the park you can see a mountain of fruits and flowers and much more. </p><h2>  Guangzhou Safari Park: how to get there? </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="23.007046" data-lng="113.31618100000003" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/7/4/3/4743.png"></div><p>  Where it is located?  There are two ways to get to Guangzhou Zoo: </p><ul><li>  by bus: routes No. 288, 288A, 301, 301A, 304, 305 and 309 - you need to get off at the Xiangjiang Zoo Station stop; </li><li>  by metro: line 3, Hanxi Changlong station. </li></ul><p>  It is more convenient to get on the subway, both from Guangzhou itself and directly from the airport or Guangzhou East Railway Station.  There passes a direct branch, following to the desired station.  At each station you can find a detailed diagram of the nearby territory.  You need to proceed to exit E. Every 15 minutes there is a free shuttle that goes directly to the entrance to the zoo.  You can not wait for the shuttle, but take a walk on foot - the road will take only 10 minutes. </p><h2>  Opening hours and ticket prices </h2><p>  Entrance to the zoo is open every day from 9:30 to 18:00. </p><p>  Tickets for adults are 250 yuan and 175 yuan for children.  This is about 2400 and 1600 rubles, respectively.  If the day of visiting the park coincides with any of the holidays, then the price of tickets will be slightly higher - 300 yuan for adults and 210 yuan for children.  Translated into rubles - 2900 and 2000. For children whose height does not exceed 1 m, admission is free.  Prices are relevant for the summer of 2018. </p><h2>  What to see in Guangzhou </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.klook.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amusement park" class="if uuid-2567475" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/91082/2567475.jpg"></div><p>  Urgent question of the tourist.
