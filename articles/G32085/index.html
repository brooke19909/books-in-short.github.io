The population of the metropolis exceeds two million people, which leads to the existence of an extensive transport system, the “Baku on the cake” is the “cherry on the cake”.  Last year, he celebrated a half-century anniversary. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sputnik.az" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Baku metro" class="if uuid-2413520" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32232/2413520.jpg"></div><h2>  Baku International Transport System </h2><p>  Nowadays, almost all widespread modes of transport are represented in the capital of Azerbaijan.  You can get here by air through the Heydar Aliyev International Airport, which connects the country with the states of Europe and Asia.  Baku railway station is the largest in Azerbaijan.  Every day, trains leave from all over the former Soviet Union.  The plans to connect the country with a railway line with Turkey.  Baku is also a port in the Caspian.  It is through the largest lake in the world that there is a connection with neighboring Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan.  At the moment, there are two crossings: <span>Baku-Aktau, Baku-Turkmenbashi.</span> </p><h2>  Soviet history of the Baku metro </h2><p>  The metro in the capital of Azerbaijan opened in 1967 and became the fifth underground system open in the USSR after Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev and Tbilisi.  The construction of the metro in Baku was first considered in the early 1930s, but first the country's industrial needs, and after the war and devastation, constantly interfered with these plans.  The construction of the first stage started only in 1960.  Seven years later, on November 25, 1967, the Baku Metro was inaugurated.  The first section included more than six kilometers of tracks and five stations: Icheri Sheher, Sahil, May 28, Ganjlik and Nariman Narimanov.  This metro line is marked on the maps in red.  The first stopping points of the new underground system are located in the very center of the capital of Azerbaijan. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.trend.az" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Entrance to the station &quot;Elmlyar Akademiyasy&quot;" class="if uuid-2411813" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80038/2411813.jpg"></div><p>  On April 22, 1968, the Baku Metro received a new station: a 2.24-kilometer-long section was launched, which became an offshoot from the May 28 station.  The new landing site was called “Shaumyan”, and today it is called “Shah Ismail Khatai”.  Now the trains ran in two directions: in the original and in the new, with a branch to the Shaumyan station. </p><p>  We had to wait two years for the next opening of the stations: in May 1970 the red line was extended to the Ulduz station, and already in September, fork traffic was launched from the same Nariman Narimanov station to the stopping point Platform Depot, which is now called "Bakmil."  Two years later, the first branch of the Baku Metro was significantly increased: almost five kilometers of new routes were laid and three new stations were opened: Koroglu, Kara Karaev and Neftchilar.  On this, its construction stopped for 17 years, and attention was paid to the new "green" metro line. </p><p>  Initially, a new metro line opened as another branch in the Baku metro.  In 1976, the “May 28” - “Nizami” stage was opened, to which five kilometers of tracks and four new stations were added nine years later: “Elmlyar Akademiyasy”, “Inshaatchilar”, “January 20” and “Memar Adzhemi”.  The last extension during the USSR took place in 1989: the “red” branch was extended and two new stations were opened at three kilometers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Post-soviet period </h2><p>  After the collapse of the USSR, the pace of metro construction was markedly reduced.  In 1993, a new Jafar Jabbarly station was opened as part of the green line.  Now this stop plays the role of “May 28” - trains from Shah Ismail Khatai come here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.railwaygazette.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev at the station of the new Baku metro line" class="if uuid-2411810" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80038/2411810.jpg"></div><p>  The next discoveries of the stations happened in the 21st century.  In 2002, the first branch of the Baku metro was last extended and the Azi Aslan station was opened.  In 2008, 2009 and 2011, the Green Line was sequentially extended and the Nasimi, Azadlig Prospect and Darnagyul stations were opened.  In 2016, a new “purple” branch of the Baku subway opened.  At the moment, it has two stations: Bus Station and the Memar Adzhemi interchange, from which you can go to the green branch station of the same name. </p><h2>  Baku metro map </h2><div class="photo" data-original="planetolog.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Scheme of the Baku Metro" class="if uuid-2413519" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32232/2413519.jpg"></div><p>  The subway in the capital of Azerbaijan at the moment includes 34.6 kilometers of tracks and 25 stations. </p>
