Characteristics, prices, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Even about 8 years ago, a <span>portable game console</span> was the dream of any child.  Everyone wanted to get a brand new PSP in order to play exclusive and high-quality games.  However, now <span>portable game consoles are</span> gone.  PS Vita is dead and forgotten "Sony" for the third year.  And Nintendo‚Äôs 3DS, though kept afloat thanks to the formed fan base, is far from the success of its predecessor.  So what is the reason for this disgrace?  Why are portable consoles not as popular as before?  You can find answers to these questions in this article. </p><h2>  Ragnarok for portable consoles </h2><p>  Newfangled smartphones are the main cause of death for handhelds.  It's hard to admit, but modern phones are many times superior to portable consoles in terms of functionality.  The multimedia component in smartphones is made much better.  Here and a huge number of services for buying and watching movies, music, reading books, etc.  If we talk about games, then here modern phones managed to wrest the palm.  New-fashioned flagships are able to run heavy games better than the same PS Vita, which is considered a powerful portable.  In addition, price plays a huge role.  The cost of a portable console is equal to the price of a good mid-range smartphone.  And if we talk about games in this regard, then everything is sad at all.  As a rule, games for a smartphone are free or do not exceed the cost of 100 rubles.  As for portable consoles, the price of one game can reach 2000 rubles.  Therefore, it is not at all surprising that buyers prefer smartphones. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Want to learn about one of the most successful handbags called the PSP 3008?

    <p>  <span>PlayStation Portable 3008</span> was introduced in 2008.  And it was this console that became the most successful portable in the history of Sony.  The prefix was sold in a huge circulation and received praise from both players and reputable gaming publishers.  What is the reason for this popularity?  Why did the PSP 3008 make such a splash on the gaming community?  The answers to these and many other questions lie in this article. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  The first thing you should pay attention to is the appearance of the device.  The casing of the console was made of durable plastic, which practically did not scratch.  Moreover, the prefix could survive a fall from a height of a meter without any consequences.  A lot of crash tests will not let you lie.  Despite the strength, the material was quite pleasant to the touch, discomfort when interacting with the body was not observed. </p>

    <p>  Since the PSP 3008 is primarily a portable console, the guys from Sony made it as convenient and ergonomic as possible.  The dimensions of the console were quite small, which made it possible to put in a backpack, bag and even pocket without any problems.  The weight of the console did not even reach two hundred grams (and this taking into account the battery).  Thanks to this, the hands did not get tired even during long gaming sessions.  Among other things, pleased with the location of the buttons.  They were at a sufficient distance from each other, so that the likelihood of mislisk was reduced to zero. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  PSP 3008: specifications </h2><p>  Sony has always paid special attention to the filling of their devices.  The PSP 3008 was no exception. The console‚Äôs specifications were at a fairly high level and at that time the console was the most powerful portable in the world.  What is really there.  Sony PSP 3008 in terms of performance could <span>give odds to the</span> stationary PlayStation One console.  So what kind of hardware did Sony use to dominate the compact gaming device market? </p>

    <p>  Sony used unique hardware that they developed on their own.  The multimedia and central processor of the device were based on the MIPS R4000, the clock frequency of which ranged from 1 to 333 MHz.  Their well-coordinated and optimized work made it possible to process information and display it on the device screen in a matter of fractions of a second. </p><p>  As for the screen, the PSP 3008 used a new hitherto unprecedented display.  The high-quality screen began to dazzle with brighter, more saturated colors.  However, quite often there were problems with the image (you can read about this below). </p><p>  Among other things, the display was covered with a special coating that completely prevented <span>sun glare.</span>  Another innovation was the built-in microphone.  Thanks to him, it was possible to answer calls using the notorious Skype system.  Also worthy of attention is the new battery for the PSP 3008, which increased the duration of offline work (without connecting to a network). </p><h2>  Games </h2>

    <p>  However, iron is far from the main thing in the console.  Much more important than the game, their optimization.  In this regard, there was no problem with the Sony PSP 3008.  Especially for this portable console, about a hundred exclusives were released.  Especially popular were such legendary games as Call of Duty, GTA, Tekken, etc.  Genre diversity also pleased.  On the PSP 3008, you could play shooters, races, slashers, arcades, fighting games and much more.  Project optimization is also on the level.  Games never lag, do not hang and do not crash. </p><h2>  PSP 3008: reviews </h2><p>  What fate awaited the new portable game console from Sony?  As mentioned above, the gaming community took the PSP 3008 well. The reviews about the console are mostly positive.  Users praised the console‚Äôs high performance, portability, amazing ergonomics, interesting design, the availability of useful services (the same Network PS) and a huge number of high-quality and exclusive games. </p>

    <p>  However, there were also disadvantages.  Perhaps the main problem with the PSP 3008 was the screen.  As you can read above, a new technology was used to create the display.  Its essence was the use of the so-called interlaced scanning method.  In accordance with this technology, each frame is divided into two parts, which are assembled from rows selected through one.  This allowed you to display the image with the PSP directly to the TVs.  And it sounds pretty promising.  However, in practice, everything turned out to be much more complicated.  Due to this technology, a comb effect arose during the game.  Objects that move horizontally began to grow in halos, which made the picture very soapy.  It was not possible to get rid of this bug by releasing new software, because the problem was in the hardware.  However, Sony later released an update in which it was possible to disable interlaced scanning. </p><h2>  Should I buy a PSP now? </h2>

    <p>  Does it make sense to buy the PSP 3008 now?  It all depends on your preference.  If you don‚Äôt understand anything in games, and you need a prefix to distract during long trips, then for such purposes it is better to use smarfton.  If you want to join the legendary series like Metal Gear Solid, LittleBigPlanet, God of War, but you do not have money to buy a PlayStation 3, then the PSP 3008 is the best choice.  After the release of PS Vita, the price of previous Sony laptops fell significantly.  And this means that you can buy PSP for a penny (from 2-4 thousand rubles).  There should be no problems with games either.  Now you can install pirated firmware on the PSP and download games directly from the Internet. </p>
