    <h2>  About location </h2><p>  People, choosing for themselves a hotel in which they would like to stay during their stay in a foreign country, often pay attention to the place where the hotel is located.  This is indeed a very important criterion.  For example, if a person travels to Greece with the aim of sunbathing and swimming in the sea, it is important for him that the hotel is as close to the beach as possible.  By the way, here is the first advantage of the complex.  You can literally walk to the beach in 1-2 minutes.  Moreover, it is private, only for guests. </p><p>  By the way, the locality in which the hotel is located is called Ixia.  This is a resort located in the western part of Rhodes, a few kilometers from the capital.  Accordingly, Diagoras Airport can also be reached quickly. </p><p>  Still very close is Mount Filerimos, and beyond it is another interesting city - Ialyssos.  It is worth noting that Ixia is the best place for people who like windsurfing and waves in general.  Since here they are almost always available.  But the sea is clear. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  And finally, a few words about the hotel itself.

The hotel is positioned as a place for a peaceful, relaxing holiday for lovers.  Therefore, families with children under the age of 16 are better off looking for other options: they will not be accepted here. </p><h2>  Fun and relaxation </h2><p>  While at Sentido Ixian Grand, people can brighten up their leisure activities in different ways.  It has an outdoor pool and sun terrace, bike rental, a billiard room and even a library.  There is also a gym and games room.  But the main way to entertain yourself here is a trip to the SPA center. </p><p>  In this place you can not only relax in the jacuzzi and visit the massage room - it offers full-fledged packages of services.  And both for single clients, and for couples.  Many lovers like a joint visit to cosmetic and wellness treatments.  And SPA offers a wide range of them.  Sauna, solarium, relaxation programs, deep muscle massage, mud baths, steam room, hammam, reflexology, aroma and thalassotherapy - all this and much more, clients of the Sentido Ixian Grand SPA-center can experience for themselves.  Guest reviews strongly recommend spending time on such pleasures.  Everything is done here - even Swedish and <span>sports massage.</span> </p>

The rooms are nice - they correspond to their description and photos.  In the event that guests arrive a little earlier than check-in, and if there are no ready-made rooms available for them, they can leave their things in the luggage storage room and go to the beach. </p><p>  The apartments have everything you need - the air conditioning works well, the plumbing is working, the furniture is comfortable.

There is everything - from yoghurts and oatmeal to meat delicacies, wines, cocktails and more. </p><p>  And of course, many leave comments about the beach of the Sentido Ixian Grand 5 * hotel.  Greece (Ixia, Rhodes) is widely known as an excellent seaside resort.  Many people come here to swim.  So, the hotel has its own beach.  There is a part with grass (artificial turf), on which there are sun loungers and umbrellas.  And another area with large pebbles.  The bottom of the sea is sandy, which pleases especially sensitive people.  And the depth begins almost immediately: it is worth literally 5 meters to go - and you can immediately swim.  No shallow water.  Accordingly, the sea is almost always clean, even after cloudy weather and rains.  By the way, guests are advised to bring swimming goggles with them.  The underwater world here is not as luxurious as in the zone of tropical islands, but still, diving into the depths, it is nice to see the sparkling sand and small fish. </p>

Rooms are cleaned every day, towels and linen are regularly changed.  The staff in restaurants and bars are also decent.  People working here know their job.
