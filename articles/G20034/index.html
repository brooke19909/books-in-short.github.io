    <h2>  Park-Hotel Festival (Ryazan): reviews </h2><p>  The overwhelming majority of reviews left by visitors characterize the <span>recreation center in the Ryazan region</span> exclusively on the positive side, there are very few negative points.  This truly indicates a high level of service in this institution and the quality of the services provided. </p><p>  Speaking separately about the Vikings building, on the outside it looks like a rock with a cave, inside everything is decorated in accordance with the northern surroundings, and there is also heavy wooden furniture.  Most of the visitors who lived here liked the interior.  Each hotel building is decorated in its own style.  For example, "Rainbow" is a cottage for 6 people.  All rooms have air conditioning and secure parking.  The recreation center has a large territory, which allows you to place many objects on it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The main restaurant Heart of Paris is a three-story building.  It combines the unusual atmosphere of France and the taste of Russian dishes.  It is decorated in accordance with the Parisian style.  According to visitors, the design of the institution is beyond praise, and the restaurant is famous for its good cuisine.  Although it is noted by some that the range of dishes is not very rich, but for children the choice is quite small.  In addition, the price tag is equal to Moscow.  Breakfast is free, but lunch and dinner are at your own expense. </p><p>  The choice of catering establishments here is quite wide: there are several restaurants and cafes in which you can choose what you like most.  The water park and baths are especially pleasing to the guests: both in Russian, and in Turkish and Finnish style, which are located on the shore of the pond, as well as a well-groomed territory with thoughtful infrastructure. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the holiday home has Wi-Fi, in some parts of the complex it can be a problem.  It is noted that, if you wish, you can visit Ryazan in order to see the sights of the city: for this purpose, you can order transport here. </p><p>  Park-Hotel is a beautiful, luxurious building, claiming to be the elite, which is nice to be in, the rooms are furnished with chic furniture.  In each of them, all conditions are organized for visitors: there are necessary hygiene products, individual sets of SPA cosmetics, soft terry bathrobes, surprises for children.  Of the shortcomings - poor soundproofing.  The staff is attentive and polite. </p><p>  Some point out that not much entertainment is provided for children.  The children's pool is well equipped: the water is warm, there are slides, balls and life vests.  The buildings and cottages are built from environmentally friendly materials, the complex has a convenient layout, the interiors are thought out to the smallest detail by design masters and delight with their organicity and great style.  A varied, healthy diet is provided.  The price includes a buffet.  On weekdays, it does not differ in the abundance of options.  As some say, the menu lacks diet foods. </p><p>  Visitors are pleased with the large territory of the complex, a mini-zoo, a pool with slides, billiards, sports grounds, and they are also attracted by the interesting architectural concept of the institution.  You can rent bicycles, which are very good for walking, besides the tracks are smooth, and it‚Äôs a pleasure to ride them.  Well-groomed and clean territory creates the feeling that you find yourself in a fairy tale.  Adults and children also like to visit the zoo, which is inhabited by <span>forest deers,</span> funny little horses, raccoons, beautiful swans, camels, peacocks.  The hotel has a farm where you can see various animals, including goats, sheep, cows, pigs, geese and ducks.  There are two ponds: one of them is for swimming, the other is for fishing.  Near them there are gazebos with barbecue facilities. </p><p>  Often in the holiday home various promotions are offered.  Some visitors mark the spa program separately: it features very high-quality treatments.  Of the minuses of the park-hotel - mostly high prices for services and a poor access road, however, the latter does not apply to the institution itself. </p>
