It was originally called Theodosius, the mention of which can be found even in Homer's poem "Odyssey."  Cafe in different historical periods was a center of trade and was repeatedly drowned in blood ... The city, like a phoenix, rose from the ashes, rebuilt all enemies in spite.  Today, Feodosia is a wonderful resort, hosting a huge number of tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cafe city" class="if" height="457" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10530/449352.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Ancient history of the city </h2><p>  There are practically no reliable information about the first settlers of Kafa, only myths and legends.  It is known that at the end of the VI century BC.  e.  <span>Greek ships</span> came from Miletus to the bay <span>.</span>  The colonists liked the area, the <span>gentle beach,</span> so they stopped here and founded a trading port.  Thanks to trade, in a short time Kafa grew and became rich.  The city is already in the IV century BC.  e.  competed with the influential Panticapaeum.  Of course, there were some troubles.  For several decades, Theodosius was attacked by the Bosporus kingdom, trying to subjugate it.  The city experienced ups and downs, it was badly damaged in the middle of the 4th century A.D.  e.  after the invasion of the Huns.  Up to the XII century  the future Cafe lay in ruins. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Genoese settlement </h2><p>  In the XIII century, Kafa passed into the possession of merchants from Genoa.  Theodosius at that time belonged to the Tatars.  Merchants bought a piece of land from them and called it Kafa.  They quickly rebuilt the city, defended it with a powerful fortification with high walls and towers, as well as a huge moat filled with water.  The favorable geographical position allowed the Cafe to become a major port, it was here that the trade routes leading to the West and East crossed.  Merchants transported furs, wheat, jewelry, salt, wax, oriental spices and, of course, slaves.  Here was the largest slave market in Crimea. </p><p>  Life in the Cafe could not be called calm: the Genoese constantly waged wars with the Tatars and their rivals - the Venetian merchants.  Despite the well-planned attacks of the enemies, the city stood, rebuilt and continued to trade.  People of various nationalities lived here: Greeks, Armenians, Russians, Tatars, Jews and others. </p>

    <h2>  War with the Turks </h2><p>  In 1475, it completely passed to the Turks Kafa.  The city was ruined at first, but as soon as the conquerors realized how profitable it could be, they immediately rebuilt it.  Caf√© continued to be a major trading port, while up to four hundred ships could stop there.  The main commodities were slaves.  In 1616, an army of Cossacks came here, who freed their compatriots from captivity and completely defeated the Turkish fleet.  Also, raids were carried out in 1628 and 1675. </p><h2>  Joining Russia </h2><p>  In 1783, Kafa passed to the Russians.  The city, considered Turkish for three centuries, now belonged to the <span>Tauride province.</span>  Empress Catherine II again renamed him Theodosius.  From this time began the period of devastation.  The former great and rich port could not be restored, the buildings were destroyed, trade with other countries was stopped.  The Russians freed the city from duties, but even this saved him little.  Only at the end of the XIX century Theodosius began to come to life, to develop a resort area. </p><p>  At first, the city suffered from the consequences of the First World War, and then, during the formation of Soviet power, it was not easier.  But gradually, the former Kafa began to turn into an industrial center.  Brick and hydro-lime plants, a meat processing plant, a tobacco and knitting factories appeared here.  The city of Feodosia was badly damaged during the Second World War, only in 1944, people began to rebuild it little by little. </p>
