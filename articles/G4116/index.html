For this, you can pack your bags and safely go to such an exotic country for us as the People's Republic of China.  Her sights, however, are not limited to this magnificent structure.  In this country, you definitely will not be bored. </p><h2>  Unique objects for every taste </h2><p>  In China, there are many other unique objects that the People's Republic of China is rightly proud of.  Attractions can be divided into 3 main groups.  The first is the ancient architectural structures, which reflected the traditions, culture and history of China.  The second group - religious and temple buildings.  They contain the beliefs and spirit of the peoples inhabiting the territory of this country.  And the last group - monuments created by nature.  These are picturesque forests, majestic mountains, <span>mirror lakes</span> and rivers.  The main attractions of China we will briefly describe in this article.  Let's start with the historical ones, the main of which, without a trace, is the Gugun Palace. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Historic Sites: Gugong Palace </h2>

    <p>  The Gugong Imperial Palace is one of the most picturesque places in Beijing, the capital of the country.  It is here that tourists are usually brought first.  This is understandable, because if a resident of Moscow was asked to show the Russian capital, he would start from Red Square and the Kremlin.  And the Chinese have them, but their palace is not royal, but the imperial.  And the area is not Red, but White (Tiananmen).  By the way, it is here that the <span>mausoleum of Mao Zedong, the</span> people's leader, is located.  Unlike Lenin, this ruler is still loved and honored in such a state as the People’s Republic of China. </p><p>  The sights of the Imperial Palace (otherwise called the <span>Forbidden City) are</span> numerous.  This is not surprising, because for about 500 years it was the residence of 24 emperors of China and their families.  It was strictly forbidden to enter mere mortals.  Until 1925, the palace was closed to visitors.  Its walls still keep the secrets of the past.  Today, everyone has a unique opportunity to wander through the mazes of the Forbidden City and learn about how imperial families lived. </p><h2>  Summer Palace and Potala Palace </h2><p>  The cultural attractions of China attract many tourists.  In addition to the aforementioned palace, at least two more deserve special attention.  We are talking about the <span>Summer Palace</span> located in <span>Beijing,</span> as well as the Potala Palace located in Tibet.  The first is a picturesque suburb.  He gained world fame primarily as a classic Chinese garden.  This palace was the resting place of the emperor's family in the summer.  The second is famous for being considered the highest palace in the world. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Burials </h2><p>  You may have heard that a skull belonging to Sinanthropus (an ancient man) was found in the village of Zhoukoudian near Beijing.  This man could already make tools and use fire.  Having been in China, you can see with your own eyes this historic place.  In this country, a number of imperial burials have been preserved.  There are temples, and tombs, and rooms for steles, and ritual and office buildings.  The most famous of them is the burial "13 graves", located in Beijing.  Emperors of the Ming Dynasty are buried here.  The mausoleum of Qin Shihuangdi, another Chinese emperor, is also interesting.  Tourists are also impressed by the "terracotta army" (Xi'an). </p>

Here and to this day, the traditions and customs of the ancestors are sacred.  A particularly noteworthy place is Jiangsu.

    <p>  The Temple of Heaven, located in Beijing, is the largest and most famous.  It was here that the Chinese emperors prayed for a good harvest.  The Temple of Heaven is a true masterpiece.  It was built on a marble three-level terrace.  The ceiling is supported by wooden poles, with no cement or nails.  This is quite remarkable when you consider that the height of the building is 38 meters and its diameter is 30 meters. </p><h2>  Lhasu City and Shandong Province </h2><p>  If you want to visit several temples at once and see the largest Buddha statues in the world, you should go to Tibet, more precisely, to the city of Lhasa.  It is its capital and holy city for the Chinese. </p><p>  Those who are interested in the teachings of Confucius can be advised to visit his temple, house and grave.  They are located in Shandong.  This great Chinese educator and thinker is the founder of a whole philosophical movement known as Confucianism.  And today, Confucianism is the basis of the traditional culture of Chinese society. </p><h2>  Shaolin </h2>

    <p>  This monastery is certainly worth mentioning, telling about what are the main attractions of China.  A description of it is available in any guide to this country.  If you are interested in martial arts or the history of Buddhism, feel free to go to the Shaolin Monastery located in Luoyang.  It is the most famous Chinese temple related to Buddhism, as well as a recognized center of Wushu (martial arts). </p><p>  The monasteries, called the "Shaolin", in the history of China, there were about ten.  However, only one of them managed to survive, their ancestor.  We are talking about the northern monastery of Sunshan.  It was founded back in 495 AD.  e.  Bodhidharma, an Indian monk who was otherwise called Damo.  Already in 620, the Chinese ruler granted this monastery the right to have its own army.  Today it looks more like a museum.  On the territory adjacent to the monastery, there are small restaurants, small souvenir shops, and snack bars.  However, in the closed part, where the monks meditate and train, today it is impossible to get. </p><h2>  Mountains of china </h2><p>  You will enjoy not only the cultural and religious, but also the natural attractions of China.  In this country, the mountains are very majestic and beautiful.  Next to them you feel how insignificant each of us is in front of the power of nature. </p>
