    <h2>  When was chain weaving used to make jewelry, and not just for protective uniforms? </h2><p>  <span>When this species began to move into the decorative sphere, it is very difficult to say.</span>  <span>There are many different theories about the ‚Äúinterweaving of these genres,‚Äù however, information about most of them, as well as examples of works, have not been preserved in the era of the absence of the Internet.</span> </p><p>  <span>The use of chain weaving to create decorative jewelry, in fact, has to be reinvented from scratch.</span>  <span>Of course, the genetic relationship between this technique and the basic methods of manufacturing protective armor is the basis for formulating various theories, but none of them can be called unconditionally true today.</span> </p><h2>  How to choose materials?  What metals are bracelets and necklaces usually made of? </h2><p>  <span>The whole process of making jewelry is done manually.</span>  <span>For such products, various metals can be used, having calculated the strength characteristics of the future product.</span>  <span>It is necessary to take into account the rigidity of the metal, the characteristics of the weaving itself, as well as the dimension of the rings.</span> </p><p>  <span>The most popular materials are steel, copper, silver and brass.</span>  <span>In addition, you can use niobium, bronze, titanium, sometimes gold.</span> </p><h2>  What products can be made using this technique? </h2><p>  <span>Chain weaving is universal: from ‚Äúchain mail‚Äù it is possible to do whatever your heart desires - from small rings to the gates of the house.</span>  <span>This genre has the broadest possibilities: on the network you can find candlesticks made in this technique, chess, sculptures, <span>horse blankets</span> and much more.</span> </p>

    <h2>  What is the process like?  What can it be compared with for a layman? </h2><p>  <span>The rings are closed, being threaded into each other in a certain way.</span> </p><p>  <span>For clarity, this process can be explained by example.</span>  <span>Imagine that you simultaneously have a fabric that can become motionless and strong, and a rope.</span>  <span>In almost all chain mail weaves, the base is a chain, a line.</span>  <span>Most of them can be expanded: in this way a canvas or a plane is obtained.</span>  <span>By modifying the thickness parameter, you can give the product hardness and bendability.</span> </p><h2>  How difficult is it for a beginner to master this type of weaving? </h2><p>  <span>It all depends on the goal of a particular person.</span>  <span>To understand in what sequence it is necessary to close the rings in order to get one or another pattern, perhaps in a day or more.</span>  <span>And then there‚Äôs the question of ambitiousness: how many weaves the beginner wants to master and how well he wants to hone the technique.</span>  <span>And since their number cannot be counted, the training period can last indefinitely.</span> </p><h2>  What weaving is the most popular? </h2><p>  <span>Basically, "hearing" people have no more than a dozen species.</span>  <span>They are either basic, or migrated to the jewelry craft.</span>  <span>This is Persian, European, Byzantine, Japanese, box.</span> </p>
