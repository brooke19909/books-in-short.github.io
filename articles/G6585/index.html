Therefore, the construction of comfortable, modern complexes that meet absolutely all international standards is very active here.  One of the projects that is already being prepared for delivery is the LCD "Bestuzhevsky Gardens".  Kharkov, of course, will be decorated with its bold architecture, and the unusually bright design of the complex will make this corner of the city brighter and more attractive. </p><h2>  Location, transport accessibility </h2><p>  Without exaggeration, we can say that a very good place was chosen for the implementation of the Bestuzhevsky Gardens project.  Kharkov is a city in which one and a half million people live, and about the same number of cars rush through the streets.  It is quite difficult to find a quiet, quiet corner here, and even next to important objects of urban infrastructure, but the developer of the housing complex under consideration succeeded. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bestuzhevsky gardens Kharkov" class="if" height="294" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1619350.jpg" width="499"></div>  The address of the complex is Bestuzheva street, building No. 11. This is a relatively quiet place, where there is no big fuss and cars rushing endlessly somewhere.  But it is very easy to get to anywhere in Kharkov from here, as transport stops (minibuses, buses, trams) are located just 300 meters away.  A little further, namely at 1,500 meters, are the metro stations "Kievskaya" and "Defenders of Ukraine", and at 2,000 meters - the metro station "Akademika Barabashova".

Kharkov is an industrial city whose enterprises contribute to air pollution.  In addition, many cars pollute the environment here every hour.  According to specialists, the environmental situation is best on the outskirts of Kharkov, and the pollution index in the center is about 6. But the Bestuzhevsky Gardens LCD looks relatively good against the general background.  It is far from industrial enterprises, high-rise buildings separate it from large transport arteries.  The advantage of the complex is that the Memory Park is 700 meters away, and the Zhuravlevsky Hydropark is about 2.5 km away. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Bestuzhevsky Gardens Kharkov" class="if" height="341" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1619286.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Infrastructure and design of the complex </h2><p>  There is no doubt that the residential complex ‚ÄúBestuzhevsky Gardens‚Äù (Kharkiv) will become a bright architectural object that lifts the mood on a gloomy, bad weather.  It consists of one six-story building in the shape of the letter "g".  Its facades will combine bright tones of green, red, yellow, blue, violet and orange on a white background.  The developer paid special attention to the design of the porches, which are also planned to be created bright, using large mirrors, paintings, flowers in the decor.  There will be two of them in total.  Elevators are not provided.  The developer also did not disregard the adjacent territory.  It is planned to lay out lawns, plant shrubs and flowers, create recreation areas for adults and a multifunctional playground where children can play. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For car owners in the complex will be equipped with a parking area with video cameras and security. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bestuzhevsky gardens Kharkov reviews" class="if" height="354" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1619282.jpg" width="477"></div>
