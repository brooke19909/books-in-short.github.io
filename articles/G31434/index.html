It existed in the geographical region of Cilicia in the southeast of Asia Minor from 1080 to 1424.  This article will discuss the history of its occurrence, political and economic features. </p><h2>  Background </h2><p>  Even before the appearance of the Cilician Armenian state, Armenians settled in these territories, starting from the 1st century BC.  It was then that this region was annexed by Tigran II to Greater Armenia. </p><p>  However, Rome soon recaptured these lands.  They became part of the empire along with the Armenians, who managed to settle on them. </p><p>  In the second half of the 11th century, the mass migration of Armenians to this region began after the loss of statehood.  Their own country was conquered by the Turks. </p><h2>  History of occurrence </h2><div class="photo" data-original="hy.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kingdom of Cilicia" class="if uuid-3189928" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3189928.jpg"></div><p>  The actual year of foundation of the Cilician Armenian state is considered to be the 1080th, when Prince Ruben, who defended the region of Antitavro, laid the foundation for a new dynasty, becoming the founder of the principality. </p><p>  After the death of Ruben in 1095, the throne was succeeded by his son Kostandin, who expanded his influence beyond the mountains of Antitavros.  The main enemy of the Armenians at that time were considered Seljuk Turks.  Therefore, the crusaders that appeared in the region were initially considered as potential allies.  For example, the Armenians helped the knights with food and warriors during the siege of Antioch. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Independence and relatively quiet life in the principality were due to its geographical location.  At one time, neither the Seljuks nor the Crusaders claimed it, since it was located in the mountainous part of the region. </p><p>  The situation was complicated in 1100 after the death of Kostandin.  The Principality was divided into two destinies, which began to rule his sons Toros and Levon.  At the same time, Toros managed to pursue an active foreign policy, expanding the borders of the principality, approaching the borders of the Cilician plain.  He successfully fought with the Turks and the Byzantines.  He built allied relations with the crusaders, supporting them in wars with Muslim rulers. </p><p>  In 1169, Mlech came to power, usurping power after the death of his brother.  He sought to ensure the independence of the Cilician Armenian state.  To once and for all prevent the claims of the Byzantines to these lands, I concluded an agreement with the ruler of Syria, Nur al-Din.  With his support, Mlech defeated the Byzantine army.  But a year later he was killed in a palace coup. </p><p>  In 1187, Levon II became ruler.  This coincided with the third crusader campaign.  By the end of the century, he became the most powerful ruler in the region.  Even the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Armenian-Frankish state appears. </p><h2>  Conversion to the Kingdom </h2><div class="photo" data-original="armhandmade.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The ancient Armenian state of Cilicia" class="if uuid-3189924" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3189924.jpg"></div><p>  Levon II wanted to become a crowned ruler according to the traditions that existed in Western Europe.  This was not easy to do.  One should be wary of breaking up relations with Byzantium that had been established by then.  In parallel, it was important, if only for the sake of making a concession, to the Roman Catholic Church, so that the coronation of a king who was not Catholic was approved by the Pope. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In order to achieve this, Levon sent diplomats to Emperor Henry VI and Pope Celestine III.  Another delegation at the same time went to Constantinople. </p><p>  Thanks to his skillful and dodgy policy, the official coronation took place in 1198.  Prince Levon II became King Levon I. This was the final stage of the reorganization of the Armenian state of Cilicia from the principality to the kingdom. </p><h2>  Domestic policy </h2><div class="photo" data-original="hetq.am" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cilician Armenian kingdom" class="if uuid-3189923" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3189923.jpg"></div><p>  Having become king, Levon was forced to solve long-overdue internal problems.  In particular, he was not happy with the growing influence of religious leaders.  He even tried to make his cousin the head of the Armenian Church, but the local clergy categorically rejected the candidacy. </p><p>  In addition, he wanted to end the family of the Hetumids, who did not obey him and constantly competed.  To do this, he gathered an army, besieging Hetum III in the family estate.  But, like his predecessors, failed.  Then he went on a trick, inviting the prince to conclude an imaginary marriage between their clans.  As soon as Hetum arrived in the capital, he was arrested. </p><p>  After his coronation, Levon continued the pro-Atlantic policy in the Armenian state of Cilicia.  The arrival of the Latins was encouraged in every way, they were entrusted with responsible posts in the government.  During this period, the ancient state of Cilicia was open to trade with Europeans.  French was popular at court. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Strengthening Catholics </h2><p>  The next politician, during which important changes took place in the Cilician state, was Getum II.  He came to power in 1289.  As a Franciscan, from the first days of his reign he began to revive the pro-Latin policies that his predecessors had weakened.  In particular, Levon III.  The desire to develop Catholicism, which was previously hidden, has now taken on an open and even defiant character. </p><p>  In 1292, the Mamluks captured the residence of the head of the Armenian church, capturing Stepanos IV.  His successor Grigor VII was considered a staunch supporter of Rome.  Therefore, he decides to transfer the Catholicos rate to the city of Sis, the capital of the state of Cilicia.  After that, the clergy actually lost their independence, some subsequent leaders of the Armenian church were so inclined to Catholicism that they came into conflict with the rest of the clergy and parishioners. </p><h2>  Break with the Mongols </h2><div class="photo" data-original="patm.arma-vir.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="State of cilicia" class="if uuid-3189926" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3189926.jpg"></div><p>  For Armenia in Cilicia, the existing alliance with the Mongols was of great importance.  Together they opposed the Mamelukes.  At the same time, the rulers of the ancient Armenian state of Cilicia constantly sought to find new allies and partners. </p><p>  In 1293, the situation in the east of the country worsened after another attempt to invade the Egyptian Mamelukes.  She was prevented, and it soon became known that the emperor of the Byzantine Empire was planning to marry the sister of the king of the Cilician Armenian kingdom.  Counting on new allies after the conclusion of such a marriage, the delegation of Armenians immediately left for Constantinople.  At the beginning of 1294, Princess Rita was solemnly married to the Emperor of the Byzantine Empire, Michael IX. </p><p>  At the same time, relations between the kingdom of Cilicia and the Mongols became more complicated when one of the sons of Argun Gazan came to power in the Persian ilkhanate.  He did this as a result of a coup.  At first, he confirmed to Hetum loyalty to the alliance and joint action against aggressive Mamelukes. </p><p>  At the same time, Ghazan realized that he could not rule Muslims without accepting their religion.  Therefore, it enters into Islam at the very end of the 13th century.  This leads to the fact that his successors will decide to reconsider the traditional provisions of their foreign policy regarding the Armenian kingdom of Cilicia.  Ghazan will become the last Mongolian ally of the Armenians. </p><p>  In 1299, they still have time to defeat the Egyptian Mamelukes together at Homs.  This allowed the Armenians to return all the lost territories, and Ghazan to get Syria.  After his imminent death in 1304, the Cilician-Mongol Union ceases to exist.  This has a significant impact on the position of Armenia in Cilicia, since it is losing a loyal and reliable ally.  The Mongols now cease to oppose the Mamluks.  Those, in turn, are increasingly threatening Cilicia.  By 1304, they are returning part of the land lost five years earlier. </p><p>  In the history of the Cilician Armenian kingdom, the end of the 13th century is marked by a cardinal shift of forces in the entire Middle East.  After the adoption of Islam by the Mongol ilkhans, the Armenians finally lose their support.  A threat to the state looms immediately from two sides.  From the east he is threatened by the Mamluks, and from the west by the Turks.  Of the allies in the region, only Cyprus remains.  Meanwhile, Western countries are less enthusiastic about the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãequipping another crusade. </p><h2>  Power struggle </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikiwand.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The ancient state of Cilicia" class="if uuid-3189927" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3189927.jpg"></div><p>  It is noteworthy that the stay on the throne of Hetum II was twice interrupted.  First, in 1293, just four years after coming to power, he renounced the throne, retiring to the Franciscan monastery. </p><p>  His place is taken by brother Toros, who reigns very briefly.  It is not known whether he was crowned at all.  Toros himself returns the throne to his brother, who returns from the monastery in about a year. </p><p>  In 1296, both brothers went to Constantinople.  Taking advantage of their absence, their third brother Smbat proclaims himself king.  Even Catholicos Grigor VII, who believes that the new ruler will be able to develop his pro-Latin policy, goes over to his side. </p><p>  Finding himself in the position of ousted ruler, Hetum begins to seek support in Byzantium.  Smbat makes an alliance with Ghazan by marrying his close relative. </p><p>  When the brothers Toros and Hetum return from Constantinople, they are both arrested on the orders of the new king.  Toros dies in custody. </p><p>  In 1298, the fourth brother Kostandin entered the political arena.  He overthrows Smbat, taking the throne.  Moreover, the country is in a critical situation.  She has to withstand the invasion of the Mamluks, who are ravaging large territories.  In such a situation, Kostandin leads the state for about a year, after which he voluntarily gives way to Hetum, who has been imprisoned all this time. </p><p>  Having regained power, he manages to reconcile the brothers, to establish the situation.  Having done this, in 1301 he abdicates the throne in favor of his nephew Levon III.  At the same time, he remains the de facto ruler, regent under the infant son of Toros.  In 1307, both die at the hands of the Mongol commander Philargun.  The uncles of Levon III - Oshin and Smbat - enter the dispute over the throne. </p><h2>  End of the dynasty </h2><div class="photo" data-original="hy.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cilician state" class="if uuid-3189929" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3189929.jpg"></div><p>  Oshin prevails, in which the country falls into turmoil.  After his death in 1320, the throne was inherited by Levon IV.  He becomes the last ruler of the Hetumid dynasty. </p><p>  He also began to rule over minors, so a regency council was created.  He was headed by Prince Oshin, who, wishing to legalize his position, passed off his daughter as a minor heir.  The princes did not like it. </p><p>  As a result, a critical moment has come in the history of the state of Cilicia.  The country was mired in internal strife, while the enemies pressed on all sides. </p><p>  In 1321, the Mongols invaded the kingdom.  The following year, Egyptian Mamluks invaded, destroying Ayashi fortress.  Forgetting the former feuds, the Cypriot king Henry II sends military assistance, and the Catholicos concludes a truce in Cairo for a period of 15 years.  However, in fact, it does not work.  The Mamluks, fearing the next crusade, resume raids the next year. </p><p>  Oshin asks the Pope to establish a Catholic episcopate.  This was an additional impetus to the development of pro-Catholic influence in the country.  In 1329, Levon became an adult.  Having ascended the throne, he orders to kill Oshin and his wife Alice. </p><p>  The country is growing unrest due to the struggle of supporters of the union and adherents of the traditional Armenian movement in Christianity.  Levon himself took a pro-Latin position, which led to the resignation of Catholicos Hakob II.  In his place, he appointed his prot√©g√©, who was opposed by the clergy. </p><p>  Pope Benedict XII refused to enter into conflict, saying that he was ready to provide assistance only after the Armenians converted to Catholicism. </p><p>  Levon died in August 1342.  Apparently, he was killed during a riot organized by opponents of the union. </p><h2>  The fall of the Cilician state </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Armenian state of Cilicia" class="if uuid-3189930" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3189930.jpg"></div><p>  With the death of Levon, the Hetumid dynasty on the male line was interrupted.  The struggle for power intensified.  The new rulers of Armenia were the Lusignans, they were relatives of Levon on the female side. </p><p>  The founder of the Armenian branch of this French noble family is Kostandin III.  His reign did not last long.  Already in 1394, the Armenian princes revolted, as a result of which the king was killed along with 300 of his associates. </p><p>  The Lusignan dynasty held power until 1375, until the fall of the Cilician kingdom.  In fact, the state ceased to exist after the capture of the capital by Egyptian Mamelukes. </p><p>  Until 1424, the so-called Mountain Cilicia existed.  She fell after being captured by the Egyptians.  The Mamluk Sultanate was established on the site of the kingdom. </p><h2>  Economy </h2><p>  The state economy was based on agriculture.  Also important industries were trade and industry.  Cilicia played an important role in the development of cultural and economic ties between East and West. </p><p>  The flat terrain was very fertile.  Harvested twice a year, grown citruses, raspberries, grapes, cotton, barley, wheat.  At the same time, cotton and wheat were massively exported.  All this indicates that agriculture was highly developed. </p><p>  In the mountainous regions there were many forests and pastures; mineral resources were stored in the bowels.  Mining and livestock farming developed.  Evidence of the extraction of gold, iron, copper, silver, salt, lead, vitriol, soda, mica and sulfur has been preserved.  Lead was exported to European countries. </p><p>  Craft production was also actively cultivated.  In the cities of Adan and Mamestia, the minting of copper and silver utensils, weapons, jewelry and pottery developed.  Fabrics and leather were processed, glass was made.  Camelot was mass-produced - this is a special material that was made from the wool of camels.  In Europe, Armenian carpets were highly valued at that time. </p><p>  At the same time, economic development has not yet reached the level of manufactory production. </p><p>  An important role in the economy was played by trade.  Domestic circulation of money was extremely developed.  Moreover, Cilician Armenia had its own merchant-military fleet.  Armenian merchants were simultaneously shipowners, engaged in overseas trade and shipping.  The country occupied a special place in transit trade. </p><p>  Cities became major centers of handicraft production and trade along the lines of Italian city-states.  The Armenian princes provided the Italians with significant benefits, cultivating the development of the craft industry and shipping in their kingdom. </p><p>  Intensive economic development cut short when the country was mired in internal strife.  In addition, strong external pressure was exerted on her.  As a result, the kingdom fell, subdued by the Mamluks. </p>
