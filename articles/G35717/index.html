Indeed, the older the city, the richer its history and more historical architectural monuments can be seen in one trip.  Nevertheless, there are exceptions to this rule.  Take some free time to explore the sights of Tchaikovsky in the Perm Territory. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="56.76611599999999" data-lng="54.127671299999975" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/8/2/8/5/18285.png"></div><p>  It is a very young city, founded in 1955.  Today Tchaikovsky is a recognized cultural center and is considered one of the most interesting tourist cities in its region. </p><h2>  Port city and cultural center </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="attractions of Tchaikovsky photo" class="if uuid-3254092" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/3254092.jpg"></div><p>  Tchaikovsky was founded as a working village on the banks of the Kama River and the Votkinsk reservoir.  It is easy to guess that the place was named after the brilliant Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.  The village quickly grew to a small cozy town.  Today, the unhurried atmosphere of the province is preserved here.  The town pleases with a large number of landscaped squares and green spaces.  Surrounded by water on both sides in the warmer months, it resembles a southern resort. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Sightseeing Tchaikovsky can start from the local promenade.  The city has its own river station.  During the season, you can take a boat trip or relax on the beach.  Thanks to its famous name, Tchaikovsky since 1977 began to develop as a cultural center.  It was then that the first music festival for children and adolescents was held here.  The event is held annually, young talents from Russia and foreign countries take part in it.  Today in Tchaikovsky there are several children's art schools and a music school, to which students from all over the country come to study. </p><h2>  Museum of Local Lore </h2><p>  What could be interesting in a museum dedicated to the history of a city that did not have time to celebrate its first centenary?  A lot of things - visit the Tchaikovsky Museum of Local Lore and see for yourself.  It is located on Mira Street, d. 19. The museum was founded in 1963.  In it you can find out the history of the construction of the city and the main enterprise - Votkinsk hydroelectric station.  A separate exposition is dedicated to peasant life in the 19th century.  One of the significant events in the history of Tchaikovsky is the landing near the city of the Vostok spaceship, on board of which the dog Zvezdochka made a flight.  You can learn more about this achievement of Soviet cosmonautics at the local museum of local lore.  In addition to permanent exhibitions, various temporary exhibitions are regularly held here. </p><h2>  Picture gallery </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.domotdiha.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="art gallery in Tchaikovsky" class="if uuid-3254095" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/3254095.jpg"></div><p>  A bright and interesting attraction of Tchaikovsky is the art gallery.  Usually, wishing to see the masterpieces of world painting, we go to large cities.  Meanwhile, a decent collection of paintings and sculptures has been collected in the Tchaikovsky art gallery.  This unique museum begins its history in 1970.  It was then that the Moscow collector A.S. Zhigalo donated his personal collection to the city.  In 1993, the Tchaikovsky Gallery was presented by recognized artist I.P.  Ruban.  The collection continues to grow.  Sometimes this museum is jokingly called the "gallery of gifts."  You can admire the works of art at the following address: st.  Mira, d. 21. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Ethnographic complex "Saigatka" </h2><p>  Once on the site of modern Tchaikovsky was the village of Saigatka, the first mention of which dates back to 1646.  From the original village buildings, the central street and several lanes, succinctly inscribed in the city‚Äôs development plan, have been preserved.  Tourists wishing to see all the sights of Tchaikovsky should definitely follow the Saigatka architectural and ethnographic complex.  The tourist site occupies an original house of the XVIII century, built of wood without a single nail.  The interior of the dwelling of an Old Believer peasant typical of the late 18th - early 19th centuries was reconstructed inside.  The museum provides guided tours and interactive theatrical programs for guests of all ages.  Ethnographic complex address: st.  Gagarina, d. 98. </p><h2>  Temples of Tchaikovsky </h2><div class="photo" data-original="autogear.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="attractions of Mr. Tchaikovsky" class="if uuid-3254093" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/3254093.jpg"></div><p>  Tchaikovsky is a young city; there are no ancient Russian cathedrals in it.  The main city Orthodox church is located on Kosmonavtov highway, 1. The Church of St. George the Victorious was built in 2003.  This young temple looks impressive and is one of the most beautiful buildings in the city.  Other religious attractions of Tchaikovsky: Trinity Church, Assumption Church and the Church of St. Nicholas.  All these Orthodox churches are operational.  They are not remarkable for their outstanding architecture, but you can visit the service.  A unique attraction of Tchaikovsky is the existing mosque.  This temple is also operational today, it can only be viewed from the outside for tourist purposes today. </p><h2>  Monuments to P.I. Tchaikovsky </h2><div class="photo" data-original="saltan.spb.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Attractions Tchaikovsky Perm Territory" class="if uuid-3254090" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/3254090.jpg"></div><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚ÄãP.I. Tchaikovsky is one of the favorite places for walks of city residents.  In 2008, landscaping was carried out, at the same time a new monument to Peter Ilyich was erected.

This monument is more classic.  The great composer stands in a rather strict pose on a high pedestal.  What is noteworthy, the monument was originally located on Mira Street, but later it moved to Lenin Street, where it is today. </p><h2>  Other sights of Tchaikovsky </h2><div class="photo" data-original="gorod-chaikovskiy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of Tchaikovsky photo with names and description" class="if uuid-3254096" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/3254096.jpg"></div><p>  A great attraction for tourists is a walk along the streets of Tchaikovsky.  There are several interesting monuments in the city.  The most significant of them is a monument dedicated to the first builders and builders of the city.  The sculptural composition has many small fragments that tell about various stages in the history of the village.  In Tchaikovsky, a monument to the dog-astronaut Zvezdochka was erected.
