    <h2>  Background </h2><p>  At the end of the 18th century, the oldest Soldier's settlement of Rostov-on-Don began to be intensively populated, and there was an urgent need for its own church.  In February 1781, near the place where the central market is today, the construction of the wooden church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary was begun.  It lasted about six months, and <span>on September 5, the</span> temple was consecrated.  He served the Rostovites only 10 years and burned out during a thunderstorm from a lightning strike. </p><h2>  History (before desecration) </h2><p>  In 1795, the mayor M.P. Naumov turned to Metropolitan Gabriel with a request to be allowed to build a stone church.  The petition was granted, and soon the city center was decorated with a new stone cathedral of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Rostov-on-Don over time has become one of the economic centers of the region.  He was actively built up and decorated.  In 1854, it was decided that instead of a dilapidated church with wooden domes, a new Cathedral of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary should be built.  Rostov-on-Don was decorated with a building designed by the famous architect K. Ton.  That is why modern tourists are always struck by its external resemblance to the exterior and silhouette of the capital's Cathedral of Christ the Savior, by the same author. </p>

    <h2>  Rebirth of the cathedral </h2><p>  In 1937, it was decided to close the temple.  The Soviet government did not find anything better than placing a zoo on the territory of the cathedral.  A little later, they began to use it as a warehouse, and at the beginning of the Second World War, the upper tiers of the bell tower were dismantled, as they were afraid that the enemy would use this structure as a guideline during air raids. </p><p>  In the middle of the summer of 1942, during the occupation of the city, believers themselves opened <span>the Cathedral of the</span> Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary and began to conduct services there.  After 9 years, the main iconostasis with four tiers was installed in the temple.  It was made in the capital according to the sketches of the altar partition of the blown up Cathedral of Christ the Savior. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  By 1999, the bell tower of the cathedral was completely restored, at the consecration of which was attended by His Holiness Patriarch Alexy II. </p>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  Almost all tours of Rostov-on-Don include a visit to the Cathedral, the Russian-Byzantine silhouette of which is considered one of the architectural symbols of the city.

The same altar partitions are located in the Peter and Paul and Transfiguration chapels. </p><p>  For the celebrations dedicated to the millennium of the Baptism of Russia, the domes of the church were covered with copper and gilded, they also did with crosses that are visible from different parts of Rostov-on-Don. </p>

    <h2>  Bell tower of the cathedral </h2><p>  In 1875, construction of another city landmark was started in the west of the temple.  According to the project of the military architect-engineer A. A. Kampioni and at the expense of patrons S. N. Koshkin, P. R. Maksimov, V. I. Asmolov and I. S. Panchenko, the bell tower was erected in 1887. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It had a height of 75 m, and in its architecture elements of the Russian Renaissance and Classicism were combined.  The dome of the bell tower was made in blue and decorated with gilded stars.  On its upper tier were a watch with a quarter fight and four dials.  They were visible from most of the city and many Rostov residents for a long time checked their watches. </p><p>  Bells were placed in the middle tiers.  The main one was cast in Moscow at the expense of I. Panchenko.  He weighed 1,032 pounds.  The bell was decorated with images of saints, Our Lady and <span>St. John the Evangelist.</span>  There is evidence that his iridescent ringing was heard over 4 dozen miles. </p><p>  In 1882, on the first tier of the belfry, a small temple-baptismal church was built in the name of St. Nicholas. </p><p>  As already mentioned, at the beginning of the war, the two upper tiers of the structure were destroyed, and after 7 years it almost ceased to exist, since its lower part was dismantled. </p><p>  The bell tower was restored in 1999, and today many sightseeing tours of Rostov-on-Don begin at its foot. </p><h2>  New bells </h2><p>  For many years the gospel did not sound over the cathedral.  The situation changed by the beginning of the new century, when new bells were made.  This responsible task was entrusted to the Voronezh MP Vera. </p><p>  The new bells are not exact copies of those whose ringing once called the church of the Orthodox inhabitants of Rostov-on-Don.  They were named after the heavenly patrons of the secular and spiritual leaders of the region. </p>

    <p>  Today, the Cathedral of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary (Rostov-on-Don) notifies parishioners by the sound of bells: </p><ul><li>  the great martyr Panteleimon weighing 4 tons; </li><li>  Holy Prince Vladimir (2 t); </li><li>  Archangel Michael (1 t); </li><li>  Sergius of Radonezh (0.5 t); </li><li>  Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary (0.25 t). </li></ul><h2>  Cathedral Square Rostov-on-Don </h2><p>  Of interest is not only the temple, but also the adjacent territory.  In front of the cathedral, between the streets of Moscow and Stanislavsky, is a small Cathedral Square.  Her story is inextricably linked with the difficult fate of the temple. </p><p>  In April 1890, grateful Rostovites erected a bronze monument to Alexander the Second there.  The monument was erected by <span>M.O. Mikeshin.</span>  In 1920, a plywood box with a red star was put on the monument, and after a while it was completely demolished.  After that, the square was empty for a long time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="street of Stanislavsky Rostov on Don" class="if" height="439" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1014522.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Monument to St. Demetrius of Rostov </h2><p>  In 1999, Cathedral Square was transformed.  Near the place where once there was a monument dedicated to Emperor Alexander II, a monument was erected to St. <span>Demetrius of Rostov.</span>  The authors of the new statue were V. G. Belyakov and N. F. Gmyr. </p><p>  The monument was hastily mounted during the celebrations dedicated to the 250th anniversary of Rostov-on-Don, at the insistence of the city administration.  This decision caused a mixed reaction from the public.  First of all, the low artistic level of the monument became the cause of dissatisfaction.  They also criticized the vestments of the saint and the inscription on the pedestal.  Many experts pointed out that an extremely unfortunate place was chosen to install this new landmark of the city.  They called for a monument to be erected on the territory where the fortress used to be, or on Stepan Shaumyan Street (formerly called Dimitrievskaya). </p>
