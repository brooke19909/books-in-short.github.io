    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Buddha statue in Leshan" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/1857315.jpg"></div>  The largest surviving Buddha sculpture has been created for 90 years.  713 year is considered the date of the beginning of work on its construction.  A giant Buddha statue in Leshan is carved from Lingyushan rock.  Initially, the sculpture was inside the thirteen-story temple "Dasyange", or the Great Image Pavilion.  In the seventeenth century, a wooden structure burned down.  But the giant statue did not suffer at all from the fire.  Now the majestic huge Buddha is visible from a considerable distance.  There are many legends about the creation of this sculpture.  According to the most common version, the monk Hai Tong proposed to make a giant statue.  He hoped that the statue of Buddha could pacify the turbulent rivers Minyan, Dadu and Qingyi, intersecting in this area.  Curiously, the water flows really became calmer.  The thing is that during construction stone blocks fell into the river.  Another legend says that a statue of Buddha in Leshan was created to protect the area from heavy rain.

The deity is depicted in a sitting position, his hands resting relaxed on his knees.  The statue has been worked out in detail and has been preserved to this day in excellent condition.  The sculpture is made of stone, and only some of its individual elements are carved from wood.  The total height of the sculpture is 71 meters.  Moreover, the height of the head is 15 meters.  The shoulder width of the stone Buddha is almost 30 meters.  The length of the fingers is 8 meters.  The nose of the giant statue is also striking in its size - as much as 5.5 meters.

On the contrary, from the statue it still blows with calm and pacification.

Despite its considerable age, the statue is perfectly preserved.  Over the centuries, many locals have explained this fact with the mystical properties of the image of a deity.  But in fact, the secret to the longevity of the sculpture lies in the drainage system, hidden from prying eyes.  The creators of the statue hid a whole network of grooves and grottoes in the folds of clothes, on the head, arms and chest of the Buddha.  Thanks to this decision, the sculpture is reliably protected from weathering and is practically not afraid of the effects of meteorological precipitation, temperature extremes.  Some statues of standard size, located in the same temple complex as the giant Buddha, have serious damage.  According to experts, the sculptures suffered at the hands of vandals, and not from natural phenomena. </p><h2>  Useful information for tourists </h2>
