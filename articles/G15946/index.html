They issue cottages, cottages and house territories.  The illuminated walkway or part of the landscape highlighted by street garden lights looks very beautiful. </p><p>  Today's market offers an impressive assortment of stand-alone solar powered lighting devices.  Getting confused in all this diversity is quite easy, especially for inexperienced consumers. </p><p>  We will try to understand this issue and designate the most popular solar lamps for summer cottages.  We also consider the main characteristics of the models and critical points that you must definitely pay attention to when buying such devices. </p><h2>  Difficulty choosing </h2><p>  Almost all solar-powered cottage lamps can be classified according to four criteria: material of manufacture, type of battery, type of silicon, and installation method.  These parameters must be taken into account before purchase. </p><h2>  Material </h2><p>  The length of the operating period depends on the material, as well as the stability of the solar lamp for the garden to climatic changes and some physical influences.  Devices can be made of ordinary plastic, wood materials, steel, alloys, as well as bronze. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.jocuri-ninja.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flowers fixtures" class="if uuid-2776413" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2776413.jpg"></div><p>  To increase the protective characteristics, a layer of some chemical elements can be additionally applied, which helps protect wood from rotting, metal from rust, etc.  Plafonds of solar luminaires for summer cottages are made of ordinary or tempered glass.  The latter option will cost much more, as well as the use of noble alloys in the case itself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Solar lamps for summer cottages are equipped with either nickel-cadmium batteries or nickel-metal hydride.  The latter have a longer operational period, they are noticeably more expensive and together, but much more practical than the former.  The power of rechargeable batteries in most luminaires ranges from 600-700 mAh. </p><h2>  Kind of silicon </h2><p>  In total, there are three main varieties: polycrystalline, multicrystalline and monocrystalline.  The first is used in budget products, the second in mid-budget products, and the third in premium devices. </p><p>  When choosing, it is necessary to take into account the specifics of using a solar lamp for a summer residence.  If the device will be actively used all year round, it is better to focus on single and multicrystalline options.  And for seasonal decoration, you can take inexpensive polycrystalline devices. </p><h2>  Installation method </h2><p>  Products can be installed on poles, fences, walls, fountains, artificial reservoirs, etc.  If, for example, you liked the ‚Äúflower‚Äù lamp and you want to mount it in the ground, then it will be clearly out of place to clarify the possibility of such an installation in the store. </p><div class="photo" data-original="filegathering.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="solar lights for the garden" class="if uuid-2776419" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2776419.jpg"></div><p>  Next, we consider the most popular solar-powered lighting devices that can be found on the domestic market. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Globo </h2><p>  This is an Austrian brand, which, as they say, ate a dog at the release of such devices.  The company's products are considered a trendsetter in its segment and are successfully sold all over the world.  Products are distinguished not only by their high-quality component, but also by attractive cost. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="street garden lamp" class="if uuid-2776412" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2776412.jpg"></div><p>  Globo produces not only classic pendant balls, but also boasts a chic assortment of original fixtures: flowers, cats, mushrooms, gnomes, cartoon characters and many other forms. </p><p>  Plafonds of conventional devices from Globo come in high-quality plastic, and the fittings themselves are made of metal.  The illuminated area fluctuates around 0.1 square meters.  m at a power of 0.06 watts.  The cost of fixtures begins with a mark of 1000 rubles and depends mainly on the power of the installed bulbs. </p><p>  The advantage of models: </p><ul><li>  attractive appearance; </li><li>  variety of forms; </li><li>  durable and high-quality plastic; </li><li>  one and a half year warranty. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  after a year of use, plastic on budget models begins to fade under direct rays of light. </li></ul><h2>  Bradex TD 0404 </h2><p>  This is a rather interesting, versatile and inexpensive (about 500 rubles) device from an Israeli manufacturer.  The luminaire can operate not only from a solar battery, but also from ordinary AA batteries (4 pieces).  So in the winter months, when the sun is not so active, you can use more familiar batteries. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="minsk.tomas.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="solar lamps" class="if uuid-2776416" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2776416.jpg"></div><p>  It is also worth noting that the lamp has good protective characteristics that meet the IP55 class.  This allows you not to worry about heavy rain and snow - nothing will happen to the bulbs.  The device can automatically turn on, and 6 LEDs covering about 3 square meters are responsible for lighting.  m square. </p><p>  The model attracts with its modern exterior in a universal style and can be fixed on both horizontal and vertical surfaces.  Users do not note any problems with installation. </p><p>  Pluses of model: </p><ul><li>  sensible light sensor; </li><li>  several installation options; </li><li>  decent area of ‚Äã‚Äãlighting; </li><li>  more than adequate cost for the available characteristics; </li><li>  Attractive and versatile design. </li></ul><p>  Critical minuses were not identified. </p><h2>  Novotech Trip </h2><p>  The Novotech lamp from the Hungarian manufacturer has a simple design and can be installed on any horizontal surface.  The model received good moisture protection in accordance with the European classification IP52.  In addition, the plastic on the case is protected from physical impact (falls, bumps). </p><div class="photo" data-original="colorsvet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Novotech fixtures" class="if uuid-2776414" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2776414.jpg"></div><p>  The power of the Novoteh Trip lamp is enough for about 6 square meters.  Judging by user reviews, the device is bought mainly for the design of tracks or designation of some objects in the country.  24 pieces of LED lamps do an excellent job of this. </p><p>  The exterior of Novotech lamps in this series can be varied, but the design, as a rule, does not contrast with other summer cottage accessories, so the models will look harmonious both in the garden and within the house.  Due to the extensive lighting area for such devices, the device can also be used for other specific needs, and not just as a decorative decoration. </p><p>  Advantages of the Novotech Trip lamp: </p><ul><li>  large area of ‚Äã‚Äãlighting; </li><li>  shockproof and moisture proof housing; </li><li>  a decent choice of the appearance of the models; </li><li>  adequate cost (about 1300 rubles). </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  exclusively horizontal installation. </li></ul><h2>  Star Alliance YH0607A-PIR </h2><p>  This model is installed only on vertical surfaces and most often it can be seen near doors, on facades or columns.  Until the motion sensor works, a barely noticeable backlight flowing from the central part of the device is responsible for the lighting.  When approaching the lamp, it lights up at full power. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="solar powered vertical lamp" class="if uuid-2776417" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2776417.jpg"></div><p>  The appearance of the models is quite attractive, but not catchy.  The dimensions are small, and the case has universal wall mounts.  Judging by the reviews, there are no problems with installation.  It is also worth noting that this series provides several color solutions.  So you can choose options for almost any surface, be it brick, marble or wood. </p><p>  4 lamps on board illuminate an area of ‚Äã‚Äãapproximately one square meter.  The cost of the lamp is largely determined by the power of the selected bulbs.  An inexpensive option for 40 Lm will cost 800 rubles, and for 150 Lm it will already cost 2000 rubles. </p><p>  Pluses of model: </p><ul><li>  protection against water; </li><li>  high-quality assembly; </li><li>  sensible motion sensor; </li><li>  several color schemes; </li><li>  simple installation. </li></ul><p>  Minuses: </p><ul><li>  easy to install and also easy to remove (not for streets with strangers). </li></ul><h2>  Solar Landscape Lighting BSV-SL318 </h2><p>  <span>Solar powered</span> lamps <span>Solar</span> BSV-SL318 are enviable among landscape designers.  The organization of outdoor lighting has always been accompanied by considerable problems: wiring, installation of switches and other nuances.  And here it is enough to stick the lamp in the right place on the ground, at a distance place the light receiver and nothing more. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dhgate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="solar solar powered lights" class="if uuid-2776415" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2776415.jpg"></div><p>  The model of the BSV-SL318 series calmly illuminates 10 square meters of the adjacent territory and plus it has very good protection corresponding to IP68 class.  The latter allows the lamp to stay in the rain and snow for as long as necessary, and also prevents physical impact, such as hail or accidental impacts. </p><p>  Lamps look like mini-spotlights, in a set of three of them.  The light receiver is located separately and has decent dimensions, so you have to think about where to place it so as not to spoil the overall look. </p><p>  The cost of fixtures ranges from 2500 rubles and depends on the power of the bulbs.  The most mundane options can be bought for 1000. Judging by the reviews, at least 6 such sets will be needed to cover the average household plot.  So be prepared to go broke for a tidy amount, especially when it comes to good lamps. </p><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  decent lighting up to 10 square meters; </li><li>  the most simplified installation; </li><li>  good build quality and materials used; </li><li>  small dimensions of the fixtures; </li><li>  good protective performance corresponding to IP68; </li><li>  adequate cost for the available characteristics. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  you have to attach a massive light detector somewhere. </li></ul>
