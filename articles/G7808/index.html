He is beautiful in melodramas ("Stylish little thing"), and in thrillers ("Stealth"), and in biographical dramas ("J. Edgar"). </p><h2>  Childhood and youth </h2><p>  The future actor was born in the town of Little Rock, in Arkansas.  His father was an ambulance doctor, his mother was a nurse.  Lucas had a brother and younger sisters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="josh lucas" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31647/1150579.jpg" width="389"></div>

    <p>  The boy spent all his childhood traveling, because his parents considered themselves hippies and fought against the construction of nuclear power plants.  For thirteen years of his life, Josh managed to live in South America, but in general, the family moved from place to place about thirty times. </p><p>  But in the end they settled in Washington, where the young man received a school diploma. </p><p>  Despite such a seemingly unstable childhood, Lucas always had many friends, he was a very sociable and open guy.  Perhaps these traits of his character played an important role in choosing a future profession. </p><p>  In his school days, Josh Lucas was fond of sports, but not to the same extent as the theater arts.  We can say that it was a disease.  He participated in every school production, and also did not miss major theater premieres in the city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The result of this love was the decision not to go to college, like all children, but to go to conquer Hollywood. </p><h2>  Carier start </h2><p>  Probably, the actor was led by some kind of lucky star.  He was nineteen, he arrived in California alone, almost without money, did not know where to start ... Usually the stories of beginning actors sound like this.  But the sequel is not always optimistic.  Josh Lucas almost immediately found a job, though not in the movies, but on television. </p>

    <p>  The first few years, he occasionally starred in the series, but there were roles in the full meter.  For example, one of his first works is <span>‚ÄúChild of Darkness, Child of</span> Light‚Äù of 1991. </p><p>  Until the early 2000s, his roles were inconspicuous and vivid, although he starred in "American Psycho" along with Christian Bale. </p><p>  Josh Lucas, whose photo already often appeared in tabloids, was a partner of such famous actors as Patrick Swayze, Ethan Hawke, <span>John Malkovich.</span>  Experience with them was invaluable.  In addition, he became closely acquainted with Stephen Spielberg, who was the producer of the film "61st Edition", where he played Lucas. </p><p>  For almost a year, Lucas lived in Australia, working on the series Cold River.  The project had good ratings, but Josh Lucas himself refused to renew his contract, explaining that he misses his home. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The roles that the actor offered in Hollywood, no longer satisfy his ambitions.  The directors saw him as just a student.  To prove his competence, Lucas went to New York, where he took acting lessons, and also participated in some theatrical productions. </p><p>  And success was not long in coming. </p><h2>  Confession </h2><p>  In 2001, the movie "Mind Games" was released, where Josh got a serious, but small role.  The following year, he got a major role in a melodrama with Reese Witherspoon.  Well, then everything went like a dash.  Josh, being already popular, could choose the roles he liked. </p>

    <p>  In 2006, he starred in the sports drama Road to Glory.  Lucas played the coach of an unknown basketball team.  Thanks to a fanatical attitude to his work, faith in players, he achieved incredible success.  The feature of the film was that it is based on real events, the action takes place in 1966, and all the players are black (which was nonsense for that time). </p><p>  The actor claimed the role in the movie "The Dark Knight", which eventually received Aaron Eckhart. </p><p>  Josh Lucas, whose filmography currently has thirty-four film works, is currently filming in the series "Secrets of Laura" in one of the main roles. </p><p>  Among his recent films, one can single out Youth in Oregon, Dear Eleanor, and another film is being prepared for rental called I Fought the Law. </p><h2>  Personal life </h2><p>  New York has become a real haven for the actor.  He simply adores this city.  But nature is not averse to staying, so he has a small house on the territory of the Grand Canyon. </p>

    <p>  Josh Lucas, whose personal life was always in sight, does not really like such attention to his person.  Journalists call him very secretive. </p><p>  The maximum that they managed to learn was about the novels of Josh with Selma Hayek and Rachel McAdams at the dawn of a career. </p><p>  For a long time, the actor met with Jessica Enriquez, whom he secretly married in 2012.  A few months later, the couple had their firstborn - the <span>son of Noah.</span> </p><p>  In 2014, it became known that the couple divorced. </p>
