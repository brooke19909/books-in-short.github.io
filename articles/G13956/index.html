Having been here once, you will want to return again and again. </p><h2>  Features of rest in Thailand </h2><p>  Holidays in Thailand are very diverse, it all depends on the goals that you pursue. </p><div class="photo" data-original="steemit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="thailand vacation" class="if uuid-2451905" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/86863/2451905.jpg"></div><p>  To the northeast is Pang Nga Bay with the famous Fr.  James Bond.  The islands of Koh Chang, Koh Samui and Krabi have beautiful beaches and quiet hotels, ready to welcome their guests. </p><p>  Many tourists from all over the world consider the island of Phuket the most affordable and attractive resort in Thailand.  The unique shape of the island and stunning nature allow us to confidently call this place the pearl of the Andaman Sea.  Once visiting the resort, it is impossible to break away from the beautiful landscape: green groves, coconut plantations, pristine beaches and the blue sea. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.namloo-divers.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="phuket island thailand photo" class="if uuid-2451931" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/86863/2451931.jpg"></div><h2>  Island climate </h2><p>  Phuket is located in the tropical zone, so it has a humid and warm climate.  On the island you can relax in the summer and winter.  It is especially nice to run away from the severe winter frosts and find yourself on the beach, being warmed by the warm rays of the sun and the cozy climate of Phuket. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Fans of cooler climates can visit Thailand during the rainy season.  This does not mean that you have to spend the whole vacation at the hotel.  After a short rainfall, the sultry heat recedes, so you can enjoy the cool and refreshing sea. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.picswalls.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="thailand travel" class="if uuid-2451907" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/86863/2451907.jpg"></div><h2>  Two seasons </h2><p>  Many are interested in what climate in Phuket and what are the features.  The rainy season is characterized by an increase in rainfall.  Powerful waves and winds often appear in this season, therefore it is not always possible to be on the beach. </p><p>  But even during the rainy season the vital activity on the island does not stop at all.  In addition to beach activities, there are many other types of recreation that the clouds will not be an obstacle.  And some are waiting for this particular time to go surfing. </p><p>  Understanding the difference in seasons and stop fearing rainfall will certainly help the perception of why the climate of Phuket is such.  The whole problem is that the climate in many regions of Southeast Asia is controlled by monsoon winds. </p><p>  In the summer season, they blow from the sea to land, and in the winter, from land to sea.  So, in the winter months, dry air comes to Phuket, and in the summer months on the island more moisture evaporates over the sea. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="phuket-vacation-homes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="phuket island photo" class="if uuid-2451917" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/86863/2451917.jpg"></div><p>  The beach season begins in October and ends in April.  There is less rainfall in this period, the sea is quiet, there are practically no clouds.  The best is the period from the end of December to February.  On New Year's holidays, rental housing and plane tickets to Phuket are getting more expensive. </p><p>  During the beach season, it also rains, but they usually come at night.  During the day, rain is extremely rare, and if it does, it lasts 15 minutes and no more.  Rainfall in Phuket does not look like cold and gloomy rain in Russia.  A little rain after the heat refreshes and helps to cheer up. </p><p>  In the winter months, the average air temperature is 30 ° -32 °, at night - 25 ° -27 °.  The water temperature is also high - 28 ° -30 °.  On all the main beaches during the beach season, waves in the water are very weak or completely absent, thus, nothing prevents the rest on the beaches of Phuket.  But when sunbathing and bathing, do not forget that the sun is well baked here, it is very simple to sunbathe, including not being under direct rays. </p><h2>  Phuket climate by month and temperature </h2><p>  It is best to consider the situation on the island in more detail.
