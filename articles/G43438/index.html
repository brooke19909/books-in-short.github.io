In fact, any pattern upon closer examination fits quite simply.  Let's try to figure out how to perform a lace using knitting needles.

    <p>  Such patterns are formed with the help of yarn and knitting loops together.  Repeated repetition of these simple techniques forms a variety of motives.  A feature of the yarn is that it is not connected with the loop of the previous row, so a hole appears in this place. </p><p>  Before you start knitting, you should learn two simple rules: </p><p>  - when choosing threads, you need to give preference to smooth and even, they should not have thickenings, knots and other defects; </p><p>  - when calculating the amount of yarn, it is necessary to take into account the fact that the openwork pattern significantly reduces its consumption. </p><p>  Choosing a picture for a future product is quite simple.  Today, a huge number of print and Internet publications offer lace <span>patterns for knitting</span> along with descriptions and patterns.  Understanding them is easy if you know how to properly crochet.  In the case when, in accordance with the scheme, you should knit the front loop, you need to twist the needle with the thread in the forward direction, if on the wrong side, then vice versa, back.  It is important to hold the yarn with the right index finger in the process, so that it does not inadvertently slip from the knitting needle. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  I think it‚Äôs not difficult to remember for those who like knitting, - openwork </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting openwork patterns" class="if" height="447" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10492/66855.jpg" width="600"></div>  the patterns imply that after the typesetting, the preparation is also performed <span>(with purl loops,</span> or as indicated in the description). 
      <br>

    <p>  In addition, it is important to ensure that the number of crochets is always equal to the number of loops to be reduced.  That is, during the execution of the pattern, the width of the product should not vary. </p><p>  In the process of creating the product, using knitting <span>, openwork</span> patterns, or rather their relief, can be emphasized with the right reductions.  The following properties should be used: </p><p>  - if the yarn goes before the decrease, the decrease is done by peroxide.  It turns tilt to the left, the hole - to the right; </p><p>  - in the opposite situation, it should be reduced by knitting the loops together as front ones, capturing them by the upper halves.  In this case, the pattern tilts to the right, and the hole is obtained on the left. </p><p>  Remember to carefully study the pattern before you start knitting.  Openwork patterns </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="openwork patterns for knitting" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10492/66852.jpg" width="496"></div>  knitting needles in even rows are most often performed according to the pattern of the resulting fabric, that is, purl loops.  However, there are exceptions.  About them is usually indicated in the description of the work or in the explanations to the scheme.  Remember that information about <span>edge loops is</span> not always available, since their presence in any work is mandatory.

      <p></p>
    <p>  In the end, I would like to tell those who are just starting to practice knitting: openwork patterns can be used not only as the main fabric, but also as a finish.  For example, for a wavy edge, you should make an openwork series in several rows from the beginning of knitting in which the holes are evenly spaced.  Subsequently, in the assembly process, a hem is made, due to which the desired waviness is formed. </p>
