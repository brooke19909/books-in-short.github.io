    <p>  The metropolis of Famagusta is located on the northern outskirts of the island.  It houses the famous medieval Othello Tower and the ghost town.  Famous monuments of the island include the tomb of St. Lazarus in Larnaca.  Cyprus is adjacent to a number of Mediterranean countries.  Therefore, it is very often organized sea cruises for tourists to Egypt, Israel, Jordan and the island of Rhodes.  Cruise ships are equipped in the seaports of Limassol and Larnaca.  They correspond to three- or five-star hotels.  A cruise usually lasts a couple of days. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Guests can rent cars here.

    <p>  How much does a stay at this hotel cost?  A night in a standard double room, followed by breakfast, will cost you 89 dollars.  Stamatia 3 * also has standard twin rooms with side sea view, double rooms with sea view and superior double rooms.  For a chic room with special conditions, you will pay $ 200 per night. </p><h2>  Cyprus beaches </h2><p>  <span>The beaches of Cyprus</span> are called treasures of the island.  And it is precisely among these pearls that Stamatia 3 * is located.  Ayia Napa, you see, grabbed a tidbit of the ‚Äúbeach cake‚Äù. <strong> </strong>  But I must say, it is less popular than Protaras.  But Larnaca Ayia Napa is ahead of the number of visitors. </p><p>  Why are the beaches of Ayia Napa better than the <span>beaches of Larnaca?</span>  Yes, just the sand here is lighter, and the color of the sea is more beautiful.  In Larnaca, the sand is dark, and the sea water, although clean, does not have such a prohibitive turquoise hue as in Ayia Napa.  But, excuse me, Larnaca is the cheapest city in Cyprus! </p><p>  Of course, the city hall invests fabulous funds in the <span>beaches of Protaras</span> .  This is noticeable in their arrangement - everything is fresh and new.  But Ayia Napa has something to be proud of. </p><h2>  Quick reference </h2><p>  Many travelers do not know how to get into <strong> </strong>  Stamatia 3 *.

It acquired its name thanks to a very pretty island, which is connected to the coast by a narrow sandy isthmus.  The isthmus then goes under water, then appears on its surface: the <span>tides</span> are the reason.  On the island of tourists are taught water sports.  The biggest disadvantage of the beach is the rapid growth of algae in the summer.  From July to August they are cleaned with a special network. </p><p>  Young and active guests on the beach will like: </p><ul><li>  Professional DJs. </li><li>  Foam party. </li><li>  Football, volleyball. </li><li>  Other beach games. </li></ul><p>  Tourists with young children or those seeking peace and quiet are advised to relax on the eastern side of the beach or visit Makronisos. </p><h2>  Adams beach </h2><p>  It is a very narrow beach.  Here people enter the water not only from the coast.  The beach is equipped with a special staircase, like in a pool: on it, vacationers go down to swim.  A small church was built nearby, in which young people are often married.  It should be noted that it is now very fashionable to play a wedding in Cyprus. </p><h2>  Lanta Beach: Golden Sands Beach </h2><p>  Lanta Beach is located between Makronissos and Nissi Beach.  It is a calm and quiet coastal area.  There is light sand and turquoise water, and there are much fewer people than on Nissi Beach.  This is a suitable place to relax with the kids, because here the deep sea begins far from the coast.  The beach has a large free parking. </p><h2>  Macronissos Beach </h2><p>  This coast is suitable for a relaxing holiday.  Tourists are attracted to this wonderful Wink cultural program.  The eastern part of the beach is bordered by archaeological sites of the Romanesque and Hellenistic periods.  Its big disadvantage is the small parking.  At the height of the season, it is quite difficult for drivers to find an empty seat for their car.  In addition, the entrance to the parking lot is too narrow, so using its services is very inconvenient. </p><h2>  The magic of Cyprus </h2><p>  Have you ever seen the complex <strong> </strong>  Nelia / Stamatia Hotel 3 *?  This is a fabulous contest.  The buildings were built near the picturesque fishing harbor on the amazing sandy shore of Ayia Napa.  They are located opposite each other.  By the way, from the complex to the center of the tourist area at hand. </p>

    <p> Tourists like to relax in Nelia, and in Stamatia 3 *.  Employees of these institutions always receive only positive feedback.  Some travelers like the Nelia Hotel.  They are delighted that it is located fifty meters from the beach.  Tourists say the rooms are decent, the plumbing is new, the towels in the hotel are changed every day.  There is more than enough food here - there is always chicken, beef, pork, fish.  All dishes are prepared at the highest level.  The guests report that the staff is friendly: the employees always approach the vacationers during lunch and dinner and ask what kind of drinks they bring.  Of course, tourists do not forget to indicate flaws in the recall.  They do not like the small area and the shallow pool.  But they still always advise this hotel to other vacationers, since the sea is next to the complex and just do not want to pay attention to minor shortcomings. </p>
