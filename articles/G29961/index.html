    <h2>  Mark Junius Brutus </h2><p>  All the ancestors of Brutus were ardent freedom fighters, defending the people from despots and actively promoting tyrannical struggle.  His paternal grandfather, Lucius Junius Brutus, became a participant in the overthrow of Guy Servillius Agal, and his father himself was killed for his views by Pompey the Great when Brutus was still a child.  His mother‚Äôs brother, a well-known warrior Quintus Servilius Cepion, took him to his upbringing. </p><p>  Mark Junius Brutus participated with his uncle in many fights, speaking on the side of Pompey, the warring Caesar.  It is not known why after the defeat of the army of Pompey under Farsal, which took place in 48 BC.  e., Caesar decided to save Brutus‚Äôs life, and subsequently still appointed him immediately to several serious posts.  Already in 46 BC  e.  he became proconsul, and in 44 BC  e.  - praetor in Rome. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Caesar and Brutus </h2><p>  The ancient Roman emperor showed Brutus an obvious disposition, and this only led to the fact that Caesar was the victim of an insidious plot and was betrayed by a man who, it would seem, should be infinitely grateful to him.  However, Brutus became not only a member, but also the head of the conspiracy.  Guy Cassius Longin, who wanted to kill the dictator, became his ideological inspiration.  Days of the one who said: "And you, Brutus!"  - were numbered. </p>

    <h2>  Conspiracy </h2><p>  In organizing the conspiracy, Brutus was guided not only by state motives, but also by personal ones.  Caesar seduced his mother - Servilia, which dishonored and dishonored the young Roman senator.  Some historians even believe that Brutus was the illegitimate son of a great commander, otherwise why would he sympathize with him so ... </p><p>  The senators were also participants in the conspiracy, dissatisfied with the fact that Caesar sought to limit the fullness of power of this state body and to turn the <span>Roman Empire</span> into a monarchy.  According to many political figures of those times, the ideal model of <span>government</span> was power, in which all segments of the population would be in harmony.  With such a system, the existence of a tyrannical ruler is impossible, which, in the opinion of the senators, was Caesar. </p><h2>  Murder </h2><p>  March 15, 44 BC  e.  Caesar said his last words, which became the catchphrase: "And you, Brutus!"  The signal to the attack was given by the emperor's attorney Lucius Zimber.  None of the conspirators wanted to commit the murder single-handedly, so as not to commit a sin, so they agreed that each of them would strike Caesar with the help of a stylo, since they did not allow weapons into the Senate building. </p><p>  After the blows of the first conspirators, the commander was still alive and trying to resist.  When Brut's turn came to stick a stylo into his patron, Caesar cried out with great surprise: ‚ÄúAnd you, Brutus!‚Äù  - since he had not the slightest reason not to trust his favorite, and he did not expect from him such a betrayal. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="who said and you are brutal" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/384078.jpg?1398688806704" width="200"></div>  Even many centuries later, the words spoken by Caesar remain known throughout the world.  A lot of this was facilitated by Plutarch, who captured them on paper, and Shakespeare, who wrote the play ‚ÄúJulius Caesar‚Äù.  The catch phrase "And you, Brutus!"  still symbolizes betrayal and treachery of a loved one.
