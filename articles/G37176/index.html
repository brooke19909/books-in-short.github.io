What kind of organization is this?  What are the pros and cons of it?  What should customers pay attention to?  Numerous reviews will help to understand all this.  Do not be surprised if they contradict each other.  This is quite normal.  Someone or other indicators are acceptable, but for someone not.  This should always be remembered. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  GSK Ugoria is <span>an insurance company</span> located in Russia.  It has branches in different cities.  Even in the smallest city there are branches of the organization.  The insurance company offers property and population insurance services.

    <p>  Here you can also use the services of obtaining a <span>voluntary health insurance policy.</span>  This is very pleasing to customers.  In principle, the corporation does not carry out any third-party activities.  Everything is extremely simple and clear. </p><h2>  Services </h2><p>  What exactly are the services provided by GSC "Ugoria"?  What does this corporation do?  The answers to these questions are of interest to many citizens. </p><p>  Today, Ugoria offers the following services: </p><ul><li>  life insurance; </li><li>  accident insurance; </li><li>  VHI policies; </li><li>  property insurance; </li><li>  CASCO; </li><li>  CTP; </li><li>  "Repair at the dealer." </li></ul><p>  Accordingly, there is no third-party activity.  All standard services of ordinary insurance companies.  But what should customers pay attention to?  What are the pros and cons of this corporation? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yugoriya Osago" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1516056.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Reliability Rating </h2><p>  <span>The Yugoriya insurance company</span> receives far from the best <span>reviews</span> for its reliability rating.  This is a very important indicator that customers often pay attention to. </p><p>  The thing is that the so-called trust is at relatively high levels, but only it does not cause much confidence among potential customers.  At the moment, "Ugoria" has a rating of A. Decrypted as "Stable".  From time to time, this organization receives a B ++ score.  It stands for "Acceptable Level of Reliability." </p><p>  Most bona fide corporations in Russia have an A + or A ++ reliability rating.  It is these ratings that attract customers.  It follows that Ugoria may not be the best insurance company.  But is it really so? </p><h2>  Rating among SK </h2><p>  Ugoria Med is far from the best organization.  Many come to this conclusion, referring to the reliability rating of the company.  It should also be noted that the company is not among the top 10 leaders of insurance companies in Russia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="GSK Yugoria" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1516055.jpg"></div>

    <p>  It turns out that we are talking about an average quality service association, which offers services for population insurance.  The exact place in the rating of SK Russia is unknown.  It‚Äôs enough to know that this company is not among the top 10. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Accordingly, not everyone trusts the organization.  Even leaders of insurance companies are not always fully prepared to trust.  What are the pros and cons of Ugoria?  Does the company deservedly get far from the highest ratings in Russia? </p><h2>  Addresses </h2><p>  To begin with, it is worth paying attention to some features that Ugoria (Khanty-Mansiysk) has.  The thing is that in each city about the organization leave their reviews.  This factor has to be taken into account. </p><p>  Where can I find "Ugoria" in Khanty-Mansiysk?  To date, not many branches have this organization.  There are only 2 company offices in the city. </p><p>  Ugoria addresses offer the following: </p><ul><li>  51 Mira Street </li><li>  Komsomolskaya street, house 59a. </li></ul><p>  There are no more branches in Khanty-Mansiysk.  Not everyone likes this, but so far Yugoria does not offer offices in other places. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="yugoria insurance" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1516057.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Contacts for communication </h2><p>  How can I contact this organization?  It is worth noting that the insurance company offers a variety of contacts for communication.  Each branch in each locality has its own numbers.  This should be known to all potential customers. </p><p>  In Khanty-Mansiysk "Ugoria" a telephone for communication offers - 8 3467 363 838. This number allows you to contact the office on Mira Street.  It is also proposed to use the number - 357 166 to contact this department. Policies are drawn up for this combination, and consultations are held on this issue. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  To reach the branch on Komsomolskaya, you can use the number - 357 160. No more combinations are provided.  All residents of Khanty-Mansiysk should know about this. </p><h2>  Customer service </h2><p>  Now you can pay attention to what Ugoria Med is.  For example, what kind of feedback does the organization receive from residents of Khanty-Mansiysk.  What do customers say about service? </p><p>  It is not too happy.  The thing is that many indicate a kind of neglect of customers.  Some employees are not professional, some cannot answer questions regarding certain services.  This should be remembered by every citizen.  Some claim that Ugoria is far from being the most honest organization. </p><p>  Some citizens also say that Ugoria's customer service (insurance) is carried out quickly and efficiently.  Workers try to pay attention to all their visitors, they also answer questions quickly. </p><p>  What to believe?  There are more negative opinions, but there is no evidence of such behavior.  Therefore, it is recommended to take into account the negative expressed in the address of "Yugoria", but hope for the best.  Indeed, far from the most conscientious workers are found here.  But no one is safe from this. </p><h2>  CASCO and CTP </h2><p>  Special attention is paid, as a rule, to car insurance.  This is a common service that is offered by Ugoria.  MTPL and CASCO are far from happy here.  The organization does offer car insurance policies, but here you can not do without flaws. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="yugoria honey" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1516058.jpg"></div>

    <p>  For example, some say that Ugoria OSAGO and KASKO refuses to issue without additional services.  In particular, without life insurance.  In fact, the service is imposed on visitors.  It does not please everyone. </p><p>  Some also say that many cases are not covered by Ugoria insurance.  Accordingly, getting money is very problematic.  Some clients say that Ugoria is simply trying to lure visitors and does not fully interpret the terms of cooperation. </p><p>  At the same time, some indicate that MTPL and CASCO are generally happy - payments are received in full and on time, car repairs after a particular incident are made quickly.  It is enough just to carefully study the terms of the contract.  Then no significant problems will arise. </p><p>  The insurance company Ugoria receives various reviews.  Some say that the organization does not issue a CASCO agreement.  And further service leaves much to be desired. </p><p>  There is no evidence for these phenomena, but, nevertheless, some believe such a negative.  Why?  All due to the fact that the insurance company "Yugoria" has far from the best reliability rating indicators.  So, there are reasons for that. </p><h2>  Health insurance </h2><p>  Reviews insurance company "Yugoria" earns mixed.  But you can see that there are more negative opinions, although not confirmed by anything.  Medical insurance, like other services, according to such claims, also leaves much to be desired. </p><p>  Some reviews indicate that payments from Ugoria come in small amounts (less than originally promised), and even late.  All this is not the best way affects the ranking of the organization.  All trust is lost to her. </p><p>  But sometimes you can see positive opinions about the work of Ugoria.  Part of the population indicates that health insurance here is a good alternative to using a VHI policy.  Payments on time, in full. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="yugoria addresses" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1516060.jpg"></div>

    <p>  It is impossible to say exactly how ‚ÄúUgoria‚Äù actually faithfully provides assistance in the field of health insurance.  It remains only to assume that this company, taking into account all the expressed negative and relatively low rating of public confidence, is not the most conscientious.  During the cooperation, negative situations and various delays can occur.  However, as with other insurance companies. </p><h2>  Auto repair </h2><p>  Ugoria-Insurance often receives positive reviews for arranging car repairs on purchased insurance policies.  In any case, in Khanty-Mansiysk. </p><p>  And in this city, people point out that after accidents, all payments arrive quickly, and the cars are brought to working order in the shortest possible time.  Many have been cooperating with Ugoria for many years and remain satisfied.  There are no significant complaints about vehicle repairs.  Of course, if you do not take into account all the previously mentioned minuses. </p><p>  But in other cities, some customers complain that the cars are either not being repaired or the process has been delayed for a long time.  Sometimes you have to literally get the Yugoria insurance company to repair a vehicle using purchased car policies.  This is a common phenomenon that few people are surprised at.  However, most similar companies also have similar customer complaints. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear what <span>reviews the</span> Ugoria <span>insurance</span> company receives.  This is not the best place in Russia, offering services for insurance of the population and property.  Many residents complain about one or another shortcoming of the organization.  Trust in them would be less if not for the relatively low level of company trust.  It is because of him that people believe that the negativity expressed against Ugoria is true.  Not all, but only partially, but there is some truth in it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yugoria Khanty Mansiysk" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14322/1516549.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Accordingly, if you want to contact an insurance company that will provide insurance services without any difficulty, Ugoria is clearly not suitable.  Here, as already mentioned, there are drawbacks and claims.  But if you just want to use any insurance services, at the same time insure your life and property, just for the sake of confidence in the future, then it is quite possible to contact Ugoria.  There, they will quickly draw up all the necessary documents.  Plus, they will offer a number of additional services for concluding a contract.  Perhaps this is all the important information that everyone should know about.  Now it remains only to draw independent conclusions about how ‚ÄúUgoria‚Äù seems to be a conscientious corporation. </p>
