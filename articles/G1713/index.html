    <p>  All manufacturers should study the consumer market.  The quantity of goods and services sold and, as a result, <span>profit from sales</span> depends on this <span>.</span>  <span>The consumer market</span> is a group of people who are interested in a given product or service, purchasing them for personal use.  In addition to this type of market, there is a market for manufacturers, wholesalers or intermediaries and a market for government agencies.  The model of consumer behavior is important for successful business. </p><p>  <span>Consumers of goods</span> and services differ primarily in their income level, as well as in age, tastes and education.  Therefore, market participants studied consumer buying patterns <span>.</span>  They divided potential customers into groups and, in the production of goods and services, focus on their needs. </p><p>  With the development of the market, direct communication with the client has become not always possible.  A model of consumer behavior and its study has become a necessary measure.  A huge amount of money is spent on finding out the tastes and possibilities of potential consumers. </p><p>  This is a marketing issue.  The model of consumer behavior is formed in five stages. </p><p>  The first is the awareness of the problem and the need for a particular product or service.  This happens long before the purchase itself.  It compares the real and desired features.  When desire reaches a certain peak, there is an incentive to buy. </p><p>  The following is the process of collecting information about products that are able to satisfy desires and needs.  There is a selection of goods or services adequate to the possibilities.  Sometimes a consumer may skip this step if the arousal state has reached a high level.  In this state, it is available to the manufacturer and may make a rash purchase.  <span>Sources of information</span> may include colleagues, friends, advertising, the media and visual inspection of the goods. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The model of consumer behavior is determined by the influence of sources.  Most <span>information is</span> provided by commercial advertising.  But data from personal sources have the maximum effect. </p><p>  An important objective of marketing is the formation of a strategy that will be tuned to a model of purchasing behavior and will lead customers to purchase a particular product.  It is necessary to identify more influential sources of information and use them to attract customers. </p><p>  After collecting information, options are evaluated.  The properties of specific brands matching the query are discussed here.  For each consumer, their own set of qualities is important. </p><p>  The consumer can have his own image of the product and the properties that he must possess.  For each specific quality, the buyer can give his level of importance and significance. </p><p>  After evaluating the options, the fact of the purchase itself occurs. </p><p>  Then follows the reaction.  It shows customer satisfaction with the perfect act of purchase. </p><p>  There are several types of customer behavior patterns.  They are listed below. </p><p>  Uncertain behavior occurs when there are several identical types of goods, a high price and a certain share of risk when buying. </p><p>  Habitual behavior is characterized by the absence of a difference between product brands and low consumer engagement.  For example, buying salt. </p><p>  Search model of behavior.  It occurs when the buyer is not very involved in the process, but the differences between different brands of goods are significant.  In this case, the otregeter, as a rule, easily changes his preferences. </p>
