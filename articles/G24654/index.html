The city received its name because of its proximity to the Caucasian mineral water deposit, although there are no sources in the city itself. </p><p>  Most tourists come to <span>Mineralnye Vody</span> in the Stavropol Territory to improve their health, relax in the mountains and explore local attractions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tgt.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mineralnye Vody, Stavropol Territory" class="if uuid-2627892" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2627892.jpg"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The city is located in the valley of the Kuma River, 172 km south of Stavropol.  The city of Mineralnye Vody in the Stavropol Territory is located at the foot of Mount Zmeyka, which is mainly occupied by the Beshtaugorsky forest, and from the side of the city it represents a cluster of rocks and quarries that are connected by a serpentine road. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="44.211675" data-lng="43.12385270000004" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/5/6/5/4/5654.png"></div><h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  In the second half of the 19th century, the construction of the Rostov-Vladikavkaz railway was completed.  In 1875, the first trains were launched.  The Sultanovskaya station was built on the site where the railroad lines go towards Kislovodsk.  It received its name in honor of the Sultan Girey, who allowed to occupy part of his land for the resettlement of workers serving the transport sector.  At that time, there were about 500 people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="postav.livejournal.com" data-author=": . . , " data-source="https://postav.livejournal.com/379803.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="History of the city" class="if uuid-2627878" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2627878.jpg"></div><p>  Every year the population of this settlement increased.  Artisans began to gather here, who manufactured and sold their goods.  So the village of Sultanovsky arose, named so in 1878.  On its territory in 1898 a glass factory began to operate.  Naturally, this led to further population growth and expansion of the village. </p><p>  In 1906, it was renamed, calling it Illarionov, in honor of Illarion Vorontsov-Dashkov, the Caucasian governor. </p><h2>  Soviet period of history </h2><p>  In 1922, the new authorities decided that the railway station, as well as the nearby village, should become one administrative unit.  So on the map of the young republic appeared a city called Mineralnye Vody.  As before, it remained the most important point of transport infrastructure in the south of our country. </p><p>  Two years later, a decree was issued on the formation of the Mineralovodsk district.  The importance of the city increased even more in 1925, when an airport was built nearby.  Over time, industry developed - in the late 1920s and early 1930s, industrial enterprises were opened for the extraction of non-metallic materials and their further processing by crushing. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="review-planet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The city in Soviet times" class="if uuid-2627886" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2627886.jpg"></div><p>  At the beginning of the Great Patriotic War, 18 thousand citizens, including volunteers, went to the front.  Some city enterprises began to produce products for military orders.  Women, old people and teenagers worked for them.  In August 1942, the city was occupied by the Nazis, the commandant's office was located in the station building.  The transport hub played an important role in supplying the German units, which were eager for Vladikavkaz and Baku. </p><p>  During the five months of occupation in the city, the most important household facilities, depot and station were destroyed.  Jews from all the resort towns of Kavminvod were brought to Mineralnye Vody in the Stavropol Territory.  The surroundings of the glass factory became the site of mass executions.  The bodies of the dead were dumped into the anti-tank ditch.  In total, more than 10 thousand people were killed. </p><p>  The city was liberated in January 1943.  More than 7 thousand city residents did not return from the war, more than 6 thousand people were awarded, 12 citizens were awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.  Immediately after the liberation, Mineral waters in the Stavropol Territory began to be restored, but managed to fully recover from the huge damage and began to erect mass housing and expand communications in the second half of the 50s.  At the railway station, the building of the new station appeared in 1955. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The development of the city allowed him to become one of the largest <span>cities in the Caucasian</span> Mineral Waters of the Stavropol Territory.  The city met the beginning of the 80s with well-groomed and comfortable landscapes - the active construction of multi-story buildings, including high-rise residential buildings, was unfolding.  The development of the mining quarry, which lasted more than half a century, was completed in 1984, transport links continued to develop - a new highway was built between Mineralnye Vody of the Stavropol Territory and Kislovodsk. </p><h2>  Modern city </h2><p>  Today, Mineralnye Vody is still the largest city of Stavropol, an important transportation hub.  It covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã51.6 sq. Km.  The population has grown to 76 thousand inhabitants.

This is an amazing sight to see with your own eyes.  And in the summer, tourists like to visit the open-air museum in the village of Upper Chegem.  Walking along the gorge, do not forget that there are wild animals that can meet you on the way - foxes, wolves, lynxes.

The shrine of the church is an old Athos icon. </p><p>  The church has a fairly simple architecture.  In addition to the main building on the territory of the church is a bell tower.  A red brick wall encloses the entire temple. </p><div class="photo" data-original="voxxter.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker" class="if uuid-2627969" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2627969.jpg"></div><h2>  Fire of Eternal Glory </h2><p>  The grand opening of this memorial complex took place in 1976.  In this place, processions, rallies, solemn city events are held every year.  The monument is a composition of figures, as if rising above the surface, and stone columns. </p><p>  At the base of the pylons is a recess lined with marble with stones and a star.  Eternal flame bursts from the star.  On the territory of the memorial complex there is a beautiful square with trees and flowers planted on both sides of it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.onetwotrip.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fire of Eternal Glory" class="if uuid-2627982" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2627982.jpg"></div><h2>  Monument to Tankers </h2><p>  22 years after the liberation of the city from the Nazi occupiers (1943) in Mineralnye Vody, a Monument was opened to the fallen tankmen.

There are always fresh flowers here - the townspeople are reverent about the memory of the fallen heroes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.war.ekimovka.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to Tankers" class="if uuid-2628000" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2628000.jpg"></div><h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  According to vacationers, Mineralnye Vody is somewhat inferior to Zheleznovodsk, Kislovodsk and Pyatigorsk, located 20-40 kilometers from the city.  There are no such number of health resorts and medical facilities.  But there is some special charm in this city - shady boulevards with chestnuts, lanterns, benches and cozy little cafes - there are many interesting and memorable places.  That is why you can have a great time here. </p><p>  The summer is quite hot, and already in June the grass is scorched.  In Mineralnye Vody comfortable in September-October.  Picturesque places, beautiful mountains that are near the city, fresh and clean air and a favorable climate - all this has a relaxing family vacation. </p>
