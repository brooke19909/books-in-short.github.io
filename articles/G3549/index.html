Since this is mainly manual work, then such products are worth a lot.  At the same time, crocheting boots is not such a difficult task.  It is available even for beginners. </p><h2>  Crochet Home Boots </h2><p>  As a workout, you can start with home slippers.  In this case, the simplest techniques and patterns will do. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet boots" class="if" height="481" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/700194.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Knitting should start from the sole.  You can take it ready from old slippers, or crochet the workpiece, or adjust a felt insole.  The last option is the easiest to prepare.  Felt is not difficult to break through with an awl and serves for a long time at home.  To increase its wear resistance, dermantine or skin can be sewn to the bottom. </p><p>  So, we take the insole and oblige it in a circle with single crochet columns.  We get to the start of knitting, we make a lifting chain of air loops and continue to knit a couple of centimeters in height in columns. </p><p>  And further in how to crochet the boots, there are options.  Having measured the required length from the toe of the sole, you can continue knitting, reducing the number of loops in each row, so that the front of the boot is at the end. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can knit this part separately, and then sew it.  The second option is a bit simpler, but it looks less aesthetically pleasing. </p><h2>  Knitting freebies </h2><p>  When the lower part is completed, you can go to the freebie - bootleg.  Crochet <span>home slippers</span> are made with the same <span>columns, with</span> or without <span>crochet</span> , as the bottom of the product.  If there is a desire, the top can be connected with a more interesting pattern, which you can choose from the catalog or use your own experience. </p><p>  To search for beautiful patterns, it makes sense to look into needlework magazines.  The designations on all schemes are the same, and the base of patterns in popular sources is much larger. </p><p>  When the desired height is reached, and <span>crocheted</span> home <span>slippers are</span> almost complete, do not forget about jewelry.  These can be pompons, buttons, beads, or crocheted leaf flowers.  Flight of fancy in this matter is not limited to anything. </p><h2>  Dress boots </h2><p>  You can also crochet boots for the street.  The scheme described above is suitable for them.  Only work should be more subtle and accurate.  To begin with, it is worth preparing the sole.  It, like the insole, needs to be tied to make the basis for the future product.  It is necessary to work carefully, without piercing the bottom of the sole, otherwise the foot will get wet even from the slightest dew, and the threads on the asphalt will be erased very quickly, and the boots will have to be repaired. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet boots" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/701699.jpg"></div>

They give a more even canvas and the ability to adjust the width of the product on the go, adding or decreasing the number of loops. </p><p>  For the off-season, you can continue knitting boots with columns, but crocheted patterned boots look more interesting.  The pattern of the pattern you like should not have a very large report in order to possibly change the width of the freebie. </p><h2>  Square motifs </h2><p>  You can also crochet the boots in a different way.  A master class of such a motif product is also found repeatedly.  For such boots you will need a multiple of 4 the number of square motifs, plus 1 motif for the front.  On average, 13-17 squares are enough for beautiful openwork shoes.  At 38 size, the side of the motive should be approximately 10 cm. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet slippers" class="if" height="435" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/701702.jpg" width="437"></div>

    <p>  For about these motives, we start crocheting the boots.  The layout of the square is given as an example and can be replaced with any other suitable size. </p><p>  The most interesting thing about this method is the assembly.  Squares can be joined by tying them to each other, but in this case, at the junction, a protruding embossed seam will be obtained.  You can just sew the finished product. </p><h2>  Collect the squares </h2><p>  From ready-made motifs we make a canvas 3 * 4 or 4 * 4 squares.  We connect them into the tube, leaving the 2 lower motifs unstitched.  An odd square is inserted into this place with a blade.  Thus, the triangular part protruding forward is obtained.  In total, this ends with crocheting boots.  The master class of further actions is related to sewing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  We take the blank of the sole and the blank of the boot and grab them with a thread in 4 places so that the finished product is not warped during sewing. </p><p>  The last stage is decoration.  It depends only on the purpose of the boots and the aesthetic taste of the master. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crocheted homemade boots" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/700190.jpg" width="236"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  And finally, a little advice: to keep the boots in good shape, it is better to take the <span>yarn thicker</span> and crochet it 1-2 sizes smaller so that the fabric turns out to be more dense.  Otherwise, the boots will have to be constantly starch. </p><h2>  African motive </h2><p>  Those who like to knit from motifs know for sure the pattern of the 6-sided African motif.  It is colorful and easy to knit.  It is also a universal constructor that can convey any form. </p><p>  From these motifs, beautiful crocheted homemade boots are obtained.  Hexagonal blanks are assembled so that a slipper is formed.  For this, 4 pieces are quite enough.  If you need high boots, you can sew on the sides 2 more motifs. </p><p>  The advantage of this method is that it is a great way to dispose of yarn residues.  Each motive can be unique, not repeating. </p><p>  The sizes of motives can also vary.  As a result, the product itself is obtained from small children's slippers to large home shoes of the 46th size. </p><p>  Such slippers will give not only warmth, but also positive emotions to their owner. </p><h2>  Openwork or dense? </h2><p>  The hook provides a variety of options for implementing the same idea.  At the same time, it complicates the answer to the question of how to crochet boots.  The choice of knitting method depends on the goals and materials with which to work. </p><p>  Tight knitting from motifs and columns is ideal for indoor shoes.  In this case, the elegance and subtlety of work are not as important as warmth and convenience.  You can decorate such slippers with individual elements, pompons.  You can tie this product from the remnants of yarn and a little "bully" asymmetry of boots. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to crochet boots" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/700196.jpg" width="340"></div>

    <p>  Openwork products are ideal for summer.  In them, the leg does not get tired and does not overheat.  At the same time, such boots look very rich and elegant.  They are suitable for everyday wear, as well as for combination with cocktail and evening dresses. </p><p>  Particular removal should be given to the pattern with which the boots will be crocheted.  Its scheme should be combined with the main dress.  Ideally, if the pattern is a little repeated in both details of the suit. </p><p>  Regarding openwork boots, there is a small nuance: make sure that there are at least holes in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe fingers, otherwise they will not stick out quite nicely, creating the effect of a small shoe. </p><h2>  Sole selection </h2><p>  For homemade boots, we already mentioned the outsole options.  With street shoes, things are a little more complicated.  It is not always possible to buy a new sole.  We have to come up with something from the existing options. </p><p>  Ideally, if the basis on which crochet boots is knitted is shoes.  They do not need to be cut off if you feel comfortable in them.  Having tied the bottom, you get the perfect shape of the bottom of the boots, which can not be achieved in any other way. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet boots master class" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/700192.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  If you still need to remove the base of the shoe, try to keep the toe and back.  In these places, <span>knitted boots</span> are often deformed and lose their appearance. </p><p>  If we take the sole from old shoes, you need to make sure that it is in excellent condition.  The sole should be intact, without cracks and large scuffs.  If there are heels on the heels, replace them before you sew the boot so that the shoemaker accidentally does not stain him. </p><h2>  Yarn Features </h2><p>  Of considerable importance is the yarn itself, from which the shoes are knitted.  The durability of operation depends on its quality.  It is difficult to say for sure which is better: synthetics or natural fabrics.  Cotton and wool are more suitable for slippers; for street shoes, it makes sense to pay attention to acrylic. </p><p>  Remember, street shoes get dirty quite quickly and require frequent cleanings.  Therefore, it makes sense to take yarn resistant to repeated washing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet boots master class" class="if" height="218" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/700195.jpg" width="300"></div>

      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  At the same time, synthetics are poorly tolerated in hot weather.  She does not breathe and creates a greenhouse effect in her boot.  And this is a number of problems and the risk of fungal infections. </p><p>  Summarizing, we note that crochet boots, the scheme of which you have already chosen and ready for implementation, should be knitted from high-quality expensive yarn that holds its shape well and is easy to clean.  Having saved on the quality of the threads, do not be surprised if after a week or two you can‚Äôt look at your masterpiece without tears because the boots look like old footcloths. </p>
