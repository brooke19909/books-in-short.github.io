Terminals for exchanging trifles for paper notes</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Money, no matter what material it is made from, is a universal product that can be exchanged for any product or service.  But money from metal has a small nominal value, and therefore are less valued.  People try to avoid paying with coins, which is why they accumulate over time.  And then the question arises, where to change a trifle for paper bills.  There are several ways: some of them are old and proven, while others may be the first to know about others. </p><h2>  Where to change a trifle for paper notes? </h2><p>  Getting rid of metal money is not a very pleasant procedure.  A person with a large number of coins of various denominations is often associated with beggars at the terminal metro stations or holy fools at the entrance to the temple.  You can completely get rid of the little things, if you always and everywhere pay by bank transfer.  Unfortunately, in our country this is not possible, therefore it will be useful to have ideas on how to exchange a tinkling trifle for rustling paper money. </p><p>  Several ways, they all have their own nuances that must be considered.  If we talk about the duration of the exchange procedure, then it often depends on the degree of preparedness. </p><h2>  Exchange of trifles for paper notes in Sberbank </h2><div class="photo" data-original="xn--e1abcgakjmf3afc5c8g.xn--p1ai" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank office" class="if uuid-2993411" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95252/2993411.jpg"></div><p>  The most logical is the exchange of money in the bank.  Sberbank has a large number of offices, and therefore it is easiest to go to this institution. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Any organization has its own charter governing its activities.  In the line of Sberbank services, there is no exchange of metallic money for paper money.  An employee of the institution has the full right not to accept a trifle for the purpose of exchange, without explaining the reasons. </p><p>  Of course, you can complain about the operator, but this is a waste of time.  An employee can always refer to the fact that he carried out compulsory operations (issued a loan, transfer, etc.) and could not be distracted by secondary services. </p><p>  Periodically, Sberbank arranges shares, the essence of which is to collect metal money from the population.  You can find out about the upcoming event on the official website.  Sometimes the bank advertises on its ATMs.  But such actions occur infrequently, and you should not really rely on them. </p><p>  Before you submit a trifle to Sberbank for the purpose of exchange, you need to prepare for the procedure.  Employees of the institution should be notified about the upcoming operation in advance and give confirmation on its implementation.  If the client agrees in advance, and later he is denied the exchange, only in this case you can write a complaint, which will be considered in due measure, and the employee will be punished. </p><h2>  Exchange procedure </h2><div class="photo" data-original="kreditstock.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank tracking" class="if uuid-2994495" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95252/2994495.jpg"></div><p>  The exchange procedure is described in the instructions of the bank employee, which everyone can read.  One of its points is a brief description of the preparation rules for the client.  Before you go to Sberbank, you need to sort out the coins at face value (10 kopecks, 50, etc.) and calculate the amount for each.  In the bank itself, the exchange procedure is carried out only after identification.  Passport data is necessary so that, if necessary, for example, for an attempt to enclose counterfeit money, the bank could hold a real person accountable.  The process of exchanging little things for paper notes: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Customer filling out an application form.  It indicates personal data, face value and the amount provided for exchange. </li><li>  Reconciliation by the employee of all the data specified in the application, including the recalculation of metal money.  Counting can be done using an automated device or manually.  To save time, you need to specify in advance in which offices the device considers money.  In addition, the device immediately checks the coins for authenticity and virtually eliminates the possibility of errors in counting. </li><li>  After signing all the papers, the employee issues the amount in banknotes together with documents confirming the operation. </li></ul><h2>  How much is the exchange </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.shutterstock.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="metal money" class="if uuid-2993405" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95252/2993405.jpg"></div><p>  The exchange of trifles for paper money involves a fee.  In different departments it makes up from 1 to 3%.  It can be paid additionally or subtracted from the amount received.  In order not to bring part of the little things back, the commission must be specified in advance.  And also to count the money to be exchanged so that the amount is a multiple of the lowest face value of the paper bill. </p><p>  It should also be borne in mind that the minimum transaction fee is 100 rubles.  When exchanging trifles for paper money, it is desirable that the amount be at least two times the minimum limit set by the bank.  Otherwise, an exchange does not make any sense. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  What should I do if the bank refuses to exchange coins for banknotes? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.archynewsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cash withdrawal" class="if uuid-2994454" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95252/2994454.jpg"></div><p>  Often, preparation discourages a procedure.  Before you hand over a trifle to Sberbank, you need to decompose it and calculate it, which takes a lot of time.  Most simply pack it up and go to a financial institution.  In such cases, the bank most often refuses to conduct the exchange procedure.  In this situation, you can use some life hacks. </p><p>  Before heading to the department, it would be worthwhile to seize an unpaid receipt, approximately equal to the amount of exchange.  When paying, an employee must accept money of any denomination.  All the same, then spend money, and at the same time the debt will be repaid. </p><p>  If you have a Sberbank card or a current account, you can tell the employee that you need to credit money to the account.  After the employee completes the operation, you can get paper bills at an ATM located next to the bank. </p><p>  If a person is not a client of the bank, then this is easy, and also quick to fix.  A debit card is issued within 15 minutes.  To replenish her account can be brought a trifle.  The bank is always glad to new customers and investments. </p><h2>  Terminals for the exchange of little things </h2><div class="photo" data-original="irecommend.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="accepting coins" class="if uuid-2994467" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95252/2994467.jpg"></div><p>  Recently, Sberbank has been installing ATMs that accept a trifle.  Their characteristic feature is the tray under the TFT monitor.  Unfortunately, such payment devices are only available in the capital, and even then in very limited quantities.  You need to search for ATMs on your own, the site provides only general information about all automated payment devices. </p><p>  In addition to Sberbank, Coincom sets up terminals for exchanging trifles for paper notes.  Unlike the bank, the company provided information on the location of the machines on its website.  The principle of operation of both those and other devices is similar.  The only thing is that the ATM from Sberbank, in addition to the exchange, performs other operations, if there is a queue, you will have to wait. </p><p>  The operation itself does not require preparation, there is no need to lay out coins at face value.  Passport and application form are also not needed.  The process is automated and runs as follows: </p><ul><li>  A trifle is loaded into a special receiver tray. </li><li>  The device itself sorts coins by ruble, 10 kopecks and other denominations, while counting. </li><li>  After counting, the amount lights up on the screen. </li><li>  Next, you need to enter where exactly to transfer the money - to a card or phone. </li></ul><p>  If a Sberbank ATM was used for the procedure, you can insert a card and perform the ‚ÄúCash withdrawal‚Äù operation.  If a trifle was loaded into the Coincom terminal, you need to find another ATM to withdraw money. </p><h2>  Exchange of little things using various self-service machines </h2><p>  You can exchange a trifle not only through payment, but also through self-service machines.  In large hypermarkets, such as Auchan, Perekrestok, payment for purchases is made through the terminal using a special coupon.  You can pay even with coins, the device accepts money of any denomination. </p><div class="photo" data-original="edition.cnn.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="vending machines with food" class="if uuid-2994484" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95252/2994484.jpg"></div><p>  Well suited for the exchange of little things on paper bills machine with drinks and food.  You can simply pay with coins for provisions.  And if you use your wits and perform a certain procedure, then the coins can be exchanged for paper money. </p><p>  A trifle is loaded into the device and the button ‚ÄúCancel actions‚Äù is pressed.  The device will return the money in paper bills.  It is necessary to deposit in such a way that the amount is a multiple of 50 rubles.  This monetary unit is most often loaded into the device, and first it issues those banknotes, which are larger. </p><h2>  Proven ways to exchange trifles for banknotes </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.vesti.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="payment in detail" class="if uuid-2994502" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95252/2994502.jpg"></div><p>  One of the proven places to get rid of coins is a grocery store.  Small money is always in their price.  And you can change a trifle on paper bills anywhere, even in a small store, even in a chain supermarket. </p><p>  You can get rid of coins by paying for purchases.  Just for an exchange you should first find a free cashier and inform him of his intentions.  The employee will count the money and conduct an exchange. </p><p>  Another place where they are willing to make an exchange is a pharmacy.  Prices for medicines and other pharmacy products are not rounded.  Therefore, these health organizations often need small bargaining money in order to give change.  The exchange should be carried out according to the same principle as in the store - to find a free pharmacist and offer him a "deal". </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  There are a lot of places where you can change a trifle for paper notes without much difficulty.  You can always choose what is convenient for you.  His choice depends on the amount and the real need for an exchange.
