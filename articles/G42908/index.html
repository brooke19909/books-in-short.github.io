    <h2>  What is the difference between the Carolingian sword </h2><p>  At the end of the first and beginning of the second millennium, this sword was the most common blade weapon.  On the territory of Europe and even on the banks of the Volga River, meeting him was commonplace.  This is for us, ordinary people, all the swords seem to be the same.  But for a specialist to distinguish one type of weapon from another is easy. </p><p>  What is the difference between the Carolingian sword and the Merovingian sword?  The second sword is also named after the dynasty, but already the Merovingians.  But these are conventions, the name is not the main thing.  Each type of weapon differs primarily in shape and design.  For example, the hilt of the Carolingian sword is easy to assemble and has a cheap finish.  This type of weapon became available to ordinary warriors. </p>

    <h2>  Where was applied </h2><p>  The Carolingian type sword was in no way suitable for combat combat.  It had a rounded end, and its purpose is not to chop, but to chop.  In foot tight formation during the battle, he was more likely a burden.  In addition, the peak is much more convenient for stabbing.  But after the system collapsed, the warrior with such a sword was not equal.  In most cases, the Carolingian sword is a weapon used in equestrian combat. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Change in sword blade design </h2><p>  The sword consisted of a straight, wide, rather heavy double-edged blade, the end of which was as if rounded.  In the middle of the blade on both sides there is a forged hollow (dol), which is mistaken for a bloodstream, but this is absolutely not true.  Dol is a design feature that makes the Carolingian sword much easier.  Its weight and size are well known: weight - 1-2 kg, length - up to 90 cm, width - 6-5 cm. This is necessary so that the hand does not get tired.  It is dol that allows you to extend the strip without increasing weight and without creating excessive load for the hand.  In the manufacture of expensive weapons, the dol could be decorative.  The handle is short enough. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Caroline type sword" class="if" height="448" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/1803253.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Changing the hilt of the sword </h2><p>  The hilt of the sword has undergone a significant change.  The guard, consisting of three parts, began to become monolithic, which greatly simplified the design.  She remained short and most likely served to rest her hand. </p><p>  The upper part of the hilt - the top - consists of two bars instead of three.  The first part is the foundation.  The second is the upper curly part, which finished the hilt.  It is she who gives the sword picturesqueness, recognition and originality.  And although the Carolingian sword is considered popular, each warrior wanted to give the weapon a special uniqueness.  This could be achieved by decorating the upper part.  First, notches of the pattern were made, then softer and more expensive metals were driven into them: copper, tin, silver and gold.  It turned out a kind of ornament.  Jewelers did this. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Carolingian sword spread </h2><p>  Swords were widely used in the 9th-10th centuries on Scandinavian, Frankish and Celtic territories.  Carolingian swords came to Russia from Scandinavia from the Vikings and were widely used.  They were both imported, made in Europe, and made by Russian blacksmiths.  Before the appearance of the Carolingian sword, the Russians became acquainted with eastern Persian and Arabian blades.  We learned how to make damask steel and make high-quality cold steel. </p><p>  Russian masters made carolings, which were in no way inferior to Western ones.  The manufacturing technology was not simple and consisted of a number of operations: preparing the metal, drawing the blade strip, hardening, polishing, sharpening, manufacturing the handle, scabbard.  A good sword is not a cheap weapon.  It was often worth a fortune.  Weapons specialists can determine where the found instance is made, which master made it. </p>

    <h2>  Brand of the master </h2><p>  Often on the blade of the sword you can see the <span>stigma.</span>  <span>This is</span> not surprising.  Each master who invested a lot of energy in his brainchild wanted to imprint his name on it.  This is a kind of brand.  The stigma will tell the weapons specialist about a lot: where it was made, what military path he had to go through. </p><p>  The most famous company that created the Carolingian swords, Ulfberht.  Her brand is on every fifth blade found.  Swords with such a stigma were found in Russia, Finland and Norway.  A large number of copies with such a stigma and a wide radius of distribution suggests that this was a large workshop in which many craftsmen worked. </p><p>  In total, there are about 115 carolings with such a stigma in the world.  It is worth noting that their hues are not the same, as many as 14 types can be identified in form.  Specialists were able to establish that the workshops that produced swords with this mark were in a town on the Rhine river in Germany.  This brand can be seen not only on carolings, but also on other blades. </p><p>  What is the secret of such popularity?  High in carbon, which gives strength to steel blades.  Its presence is 0.75%, while the rest have a maximum of 0.5%.  Often on the sword you can read the name of the owner. </p>
