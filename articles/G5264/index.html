  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sights of Mexico: photos with descriptions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The homeland of an ancient civilization attracts not only a carefree vacation, but also a rich history.  Stone cairn pyramids, towering among the jungle, fascinate travelers who touch a unique culture.  Mexico, known from many TV shows, is a country of mysteries that allows you to know yourself.  There are a huge number of archaeological and architectural monuments, and even a few months is not enough to get to know everyone. </p><h2>  The Holy City of Chichen Itza </h2><p>  Not a single tourist leaves without visiting the city of Chichen Itza, which is the cultural and religious center of the Mayan civilization.  A sacred landmark of Mexico, protected by UNESCO, founded around the 5th century.  No one knows its real name, which is hidden in the darkness of history.  Residents left Chichen Itz√° after six centuries, and the Spanish conquerors found only ruins here.  The well-preserved archaeological complex was overgrown with jungle, but scientists discovered it around the world at the beginning of the last century.  The mecca of tourists, whose roads are paved with stones, is now always open to the public. </p><div class="photo" data-original="visit7wonders.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chichen Itza - an abandoned city" class="if uuid-2294160" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2294160.jpg"></div><h2>  What to see in the ancient city? </h2><p>  Guests admire the <span>pyramid of Cuculcan</span> (El Castillo) 25 meters high, on the upper platform of which the temple was located.  Dedicated to the god of wind and rain, it holds many secrets, and the entire architecture of Chichen Itza is filled with symbolism. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Echoes of bloody sacrifices are imprinted on the walls of the city‚Äôs buildings, and even the ancient temple, inside which human skulls are carved, has been preserved.  A deep well was dug here, where beautiful girls were thrown to appease the <span>god of rain.</span> </p><p>  Guests can enjoy other sights of Mexico - the Temple of the Warriors, whose square columns are carved in the form of Toltec soldiers (Native American people), and the observatory, where Mayan astronomers watched the luminaries. </p><h2>  Teotihuacan </h2><p>  The city, which became the same age as our era, appeared two thousand years ago.  Researchers do not know anything about its history, and scientists are still worried about who founded Teotihuacan and who needed to fill the mysterious pyramids with sand. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ihr.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pyramid of the Sun (Teotihuacan)" class="if uuid-2294162" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2294162.jpg"></div><p>  The Aztecs called it "the corner in which the gods are born."  During its heyday, more than 200 thousand people lived in it.  Life was constantly in full swing in the city: palaces were built, places of worship, ritual services were held.  For unknown reasons, the cultural center of Mesoamerica was destroyed, and it was only in the 20th century that archaeologists seriously began to study it.  A lot of secrets are kept by an abandoned city located in the Valley of <span>Mexico City (Mexico).</span>  The main attractions of Teotihuacan are the Street of the Dead, five kilometers long and majestic pyramids built on its both sides.  A UNESCO-protected site awaits visitors every day and carries them many centuries ago. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hidden beach </h2><p>  Miraculous sights of Mexico make one admire the skill of mother nature, creating stunning monuments.  The country has an amazing beach located in the picturesque bay of Banderas, which appeared as a result of hostilities.  Hidden from prying eyes, it looks like a natural formation, but this is not so.  On the island of Marieta, the Mexican military detonated bombs, and the landscape of the beautiful archipelago was spoiled forever.  Most of the "wounds" dragged on, but one place remained gaping with a huge hole, inside of which a secluded beach formed.  An oval hole of 35 meters in size perfectly transmits the sun's rays, and vacationers not for nothing adore the unusual attraction of Mexico.  Photos with a description of an insanely attractive place first appeared on social networks, after which a real pilgrimage of tourists began. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travelfunetc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hidden Beach (Mexico)" class="if uuid-2294165" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2294165.jpg"></div><p>  Two years ago, local authorities blocked access to the public due to environmental threats.  Now only 116 lucky people visit a luxurious corner every day and admire its beauties. </p><h2>  Surreal park </h2><p>  If we talk about the modern attractions of Mexico, then you can not ignore the park Las Pozas.  Located near Khilitla, a small town in the country, it is lost in the rainforests, at an altitude of 600 meters above sea level.  The brainchild of the English millionaire E. James, who loves surrealism, has been hosting tourists since 1990.  The eccentric rich man, fascinated by the country, decided to create his own magic corner.  An amazing combination of picturesque nature and human imagination attracts millions of guests who fall into an unlike fairy-tale world. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thedailybeast.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Las Pozas Park (Mexico)" class="if uuid-2294166" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2294166.jpg"></div><p>  A green oasis in which you can hide from all problems is filled with bizarre sculptures.  Intricate structures without steps and railings, stairs that break off halfway, strange arches - all this causes a feeling of unreality.  Immersion in a real fairy tale will appeal to both young visitors and their parents. </p><h2>  Resort on the Yucatan Peninsula </h2><p>  On the shores of the Caribbean Sea stands a charming Cancun - the city that first meets the dawn.  Appearing on the site of a poor fishing village, a fashionable resort welcomes lovers of a beautiful life.  One of the main tourist destinations attracts travelers with white beaches and turquoise water.  However, not only endless entertainment attracts a paradise on the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula (Mexico).  <span>The sights of Cancun, the</span> photos of which are sure to be taken by all guests as a keepsake, are also the ruins of the ancient Mayan cities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cancunalltours.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pyramids of the Holy Tulum" class="if uuid-2294174" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2294174.jpg"></div><p>  Not far from the resort are the ruins of Tulum, surrounded by a stone wall.  The only seaport of the Indians flourished in the fourteenth century, and only two centuries later was abandoned.  The archaeological complex is famous for its destroyed buildings, among which the most interesting are the pyramid of El Castillo and the Temple of the Frescoes. </p><h2>  Underwater park </h2><p>  Tourists are also attracted by the modern monument, which is an artificial reef.  Cancun Marine Park is constantly changing under the influence of environmental conditions.  Scientists who thought about preserving and increasing marine wealth, decided to distract divers who tear off corals.  The underwater attraction of Mexico (photo presented in the article), was built near the island of Isla Mujeres, at a depth of about eight meters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nytimes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cancun Underwater Park" class="if uuid-2294168" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2294168.jpg"></div><p>  The life-size set of sculptures shows the complexity of the relationship between nature and man, and at the same time, the statues frozen at the bottom play the role of the foundation for future coral colonies.  Being home to marine life, they are made of a special material consisting of fiberglass, cement and silicone. </p><h2>  A museum whose exhibits change every year </h2><p>  The underwater museum is visited by more than 750 thousand travelers.  The marine park, which was built by marine biologists, engineers, artists, scuba divers, covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã420 square meters.  Each year, exhibits are overgrown with coral, and expositions appear before the eyes of the guests changed.  For those tourists who do not want to immerse themselves in water, there are excursions in small boats with a transparent bottom. </p><p>  The creators of the compositions hope that people will still think about the future.  And soon the positive activity of man will increase the natural strength, and not destroy what has been achieved with such difficulty. </p><div class="photo" data-original="scubadiverlife.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Unique Museum (Cancun)" class="if uuid-2294172" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2294172.jpg"></div><p>  The many attractions of Mexico (a description of some of them is presented in the article) attract millions of visitors to the sunny country.  Tourists traveling through a treasury of riddles, legends and myths admit that real experiences exceeded all their expectations. </p>
