    <h2>  Negative reviews of tourists </h2><p>  Unfortunately, not a single complex can boast an impeccable level of service.  The same can be said about the Lesse Hotel 4 *, reviews of which are quite unflattering.  Consider what he did not please tourists: </p><ul><li>  the furniture in the rooms is old and often creaks; </li><li>  a very small and uncomfortable bathroom; after taking a shower, a whole puddle forms on the floor; </li><li>  bad wifi that doesn‚Äôt work in all public places; </li><li>  in September there are no declared Greek evenings and animations; </li><li>  monotonous breakfasts, every day fed with fried eggs; </li><li>  there is no sound insulation in the rooms, ventilation can sometimes buzz. </li></ul><h2>  Should I relax at the hotel? </h2><p>  Of course, each tourist himself decides whether he should choose Lesse Hotel 4 * (Greece, Kassandra, <span>Halkidiki).</span>  <span>Photos</span> located in our article will help to evaluate the visual component of the hotel, and the information will tell you if this place is right for you.  This is a good tourist complex for those who want to relax with their family in the picturesque part of Greece and not spend a lot of money.  Perhaps young people who love vibrant nightlife will be a little bored here.  One way or another, despite the shortcomings of the hotel, it is still considered one of the best and budget options on the Halkidiki Peninsula. </p>
