    <p>  The most important habit that a person should have is preparing a shopping plan before going to the store.  The list must be prepared in advance, everything needs to be carefully thought out and ‚Äúweighed‚Äù. </p><p>  Tip one: creating a family foundation.  For example, funds planned for personal income and household expenses are best kept with those that you plan to spend on entertainment. </p><p>  Tip two: you should always buy things and products on time.  And it does not depend at all on what your personal income is, it is just the ability to correctly spend money.  There is a very important saying: "The poor buy things in season, and the rich buy during discounts."  Therefore, if you want financial independence, it is best to follow the <span>habits of rich people.</span>  The cost of things that are sold in season can be 50-80% more expensive than off-season.  Discounted items can be bought at online stores or ordered from catalogs.  As for food, those products that have a long shelf life, it is better to purchase in bulk or in advance.  So you can save up to 30% of the money that you plan to spend on food. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="personal income: definition" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15706/227314.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Tip three: try not to go beyond your shopping list.  You need to buy only everything you need and need.  Most of us already in the store recall that you need to buy both.  However, if you have not included this in your list, you can do without it.  The main thing is to control the situation, not to be her hostage. </p><p>  Tip four: contact your family and friends for advice.  Before important purchases, it is best to ask your relatives or acquaintances who are better versed in this area.  They will surely give you a couple of valuable recommendations and tips.  So you can buy goods at a lower cost and faster. </p><p>  Tip five: increase sources of personal income, as well as personal income, that is, look for new ways to earn money. </p><p>  Try to start making a family budget today and control personal finances, and you will understand how pleasant it is not to wait for the next salary in order to afford something.  Experiment and control your personal income, it is not difficult, then you will see how 10-30% can turn into amounts that can be invested. </p>
