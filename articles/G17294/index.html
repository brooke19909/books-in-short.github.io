  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Khvalynsky resort - rest in Russia according to European standards.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  On the right bank of the majestic and mighty <span>Volga River,</span> in one of the districts located in the very north of the Saratov province, there is a small regional town called Khvalynsk.  It is surrounded by pine forests with relict giant pines giving a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãfresh air and springs abounding with the most delicious spring pure water.  It is here that the highest point of the Volga Upland is located - 379 meters above sea level, forming an array of the Khvalynsky mountains.  On their slopes, among the unique and fabulous mountain landscape, watered with crystal clear air, the Khvalynsky ski resort is located.  Every year in winter, thousands of outdoor enthusiasts flock to the Khvalynsky resort not only from the entire Volga region, but also from many other <span>regions of Russia</span> and even from abroad. </p><p>  The first-class Khvalynsky resort is spread over an area of ‚Äã‚Äã10 hectares and is equipped with the most modern equipment and ski equipment, as well as snowboards.  The ski slopes themselves are divided into three categories of difficulty, according to generally accepted international standards.  Thanks to this, the Khvalynsky resort can provide a ski vacation for almost anyone, even if it does not have professional training. </p><p>  Contrary to popular belief, that skiing is available only to professionals, almost everyone can get on skis and ride the track: from a young child who has just learned to walk to his grandmother.  Depending on the level of training, the Khvalynsky resort offers three routes designed for beginners, where the slope starts from 3 percent and does not exceed 14 percent.  A more laid track with a slope of up to 44 percent is ideal for more experienced ones.  The Khvalynsky resort did not pass the attention of extreme lovers either - there are already two steep tracks at their service, where they can ride "with the breeze" and experience plenty of thrills.  For ease of orientation and according to safety standards that are generally accepted in Europe, light trails for beginners are highlighted in green, for medium difficulty levels, red and especially difficult ones marked in black.  The length of the slopes is from 200 to 1800 meters and at the same time up to 500 ski fans can comfortably sit on them. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  From a technical point of view, the resort of Khvalynsk is also equipped at the highest level.  To prepare the slopes of the mountains for skiing and to open the season as early as possible, the Khvalynsky ski resort has at its disposal a unique system of <span>artificial snow cover.</span>  Thanks to this innovation, the Khvalynsk resort opens the season already at a sub-zero freezing temperature, without waiting for favors from nature in the form of ordinary snow.  To maintain the snow cover in perfect condition, providing trouble-free downhill skiing, the Khvalynsky ski resort uses a snow-sealing machine of the world-famous manufacturer Pisten Bulli, who knows a lot about such units.  <span>Artificial lighting</span> along the tracks using special scattering lamps on the one hand illuminates the road well, and on the other, it almost completely eliminates snow glare.  It offers skiers and several lines of modern high-speed lifts. </p><p>  The Khvalynsky resort took care of the most comfortable living conditions for the guests.  The modern, warm buildings have comfortable rooms from simple to luxury.  In addition, for those who like to relax with the company, it is possible to rent a separate wooden <span>two-story house</span> with a sauna, designed for simultaneous accommodation of up to 6 people.  There are also separate smaller houses, which can accommodate a couple of people.  On the territory of the ski slopes there are mini snack bars, and at the entrance there is a guarded parking lot for 300 cars.  In a word, everything is provided for a hassle-free and quality vacation.  Everyone will get a lot of pleasure and new experiences! </p>
