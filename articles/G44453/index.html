    <p>  Crystal clear, oxygenated waters that go to a depth of more than one and a half thousand meters, and another layer of sedimentary rocks beneath them hide a lot of bizarre life forms.  Biologists call them endemic.  This means that the organisms living here can be found exclusively in the waters of Lake Baikal.  One of them is pink translucent fish of the golomyanki, giving birth to live cubs.  Geologists claim that the age of the lake is about 20-25 million years, which explains the exclusivity and originality of the creatures living in it. </p><p>  Surrounded by mountain ranges and sopkakmi volcanoes, the peaks of which are covered with sparkling snow covers all year round, Lake Baikal has been attracting tourists from all over the world for its unsurpassed beauties for hundreds of years. </p><p>  Like several centuries ago, mountains today serve as a refuge for rare species of wild animals, and tiny villages that are located along the diameter of the lake are a stronghold of calm and serenity in the remote and inaccessible Siberian taiga. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Rest on Baikal - what is it? </h2><p>  Holidays here are as varied as the waters of an ancient lake: from banal grilling on the beach (but why, in that case, did you need to climb here? Better go to Egypt!) To extreme dragging of heavy packs and guitar songs around the campfire.  However, the most popular was and remains a water holiday, whether it be a classic cruise or ordinary boat trips with the aim of fishing and enjoying the local beauties. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Baikal has the power to surprise and satisfy the needs of all, even the most sophisticated travelers.  Do you prefer natural attractions?  Baidinsky caves at your service.  These are quite large cavities of natural origin, created due to water erosion.  In the XII-XIII centuries, they became a haven for Kurykans - tribes living in Siberia.  Keep in mind that inside the wall, the floor and the ceiling of the caves are covered with an impressive layer of ice, which gives them a stunning view, but it can be difficult to visit if you do not stock up on warm clothes and appropriate shoes. </p><p>  Also, lovers of natural beauty are strongly recommended to visit the Peschanaya and Ayu bays.  And what is the fairy tale waterfall worth overthrowing its waters into the gorge from a 20-meter height! </p><p>  The thermal spring Goudzhekit, next to which there are comfortable camp sites on Lake Baikal, will heal your body and spirit with healing waters. </p><p>  The Baikal Astrophysical Observatory, which is famous for its powerful telescope serving to study the Sun, will help you plunge into the secrets of the Universe. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  But you can comprehend the spiritual laws of the universe by visiting a <span>Buddhist stupa!</span>  Yes, you heard right - Buddhism is in the heart of Russia!  By the way, the stupa promises all pilgrims peace, wealth and wisdom, as well as the fulfillment of innermost desires. </p><h2>  Dangers and other surprises </h2><p>  Going on a journey along these stunning paths, remember that they are fraught with not only pleasant surprises.  So, let me introduce you: cedar elfin.  A unique plant that forms completely impenetrable thickets, tearing your clothes and mercilessly cutting the skin when trying to overcome an obstacle.  In addition, with an inadvertently thrown cigarette butt flare up like a torch, which will be quite difficult to extinguish. </p>

    <p>  When planning a fishing trip or just a walk on the water, keep in mind that quite strong storms may suddenly appear on Lake Baikal, even though it is a lake. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Ticks, perhaps, occupy an honorable second place in the ranking of unpleasant surprises in Lake Baikal.  These insects carry encephalitis, and therefore take the precautions very seriously. </p><p>  But the first place in our list is occupied by bears!  Despite the fact that these animals try to avoid human society, nevertheless, every season there are always some ‚Äúlucky ones‚Äù who will nevertheless meet with a predator.  With a very unfavorable outcome. </p><h2>  What to do on Baikal? </h2><p>  Although Baikal is a lake, it is not an analogue of the sea coast.  Here, besides a traditional beach holiday, there are plenty of interesting leisure ideas.  First of all, amazing fishing.  And, as a result, gastronomic tourism - try to catch omul and cook it at the stake - we bet you haven‚Äôt tried anything tastier! </p><p>  Going for a boat trip or even a real multi-day cruise, get to know the seals better - they are so sweet and curious that you will certainly make friends. </p>

    <p>  A beach holiday on Lake Baikal is also diverse: small bays with clear and warm water are adjacent to less hospitable places where you can literally feel a contrast of 10 degrees at a distance of a couple of meters! </p><p>  When you get tired of sitting still, go camping - get to know the flora and fauna, study the myriad of stars and eat pine nuts with squirrels. </p><p>  There is more than enough spiritual food here!  Only one places of power for esotericists can count 20 pieces!  In addition, if you are lucky, you can meet a real shaman or llama.  The first will hold a mystical ritual with you, bringing good luck and prosperity, and the second will make a personal horoscope and even hold a psychological consultation in the best traditions of Buddhism. </p><h2>  Time to travel </h2><p>  Depending on your goals and preferences, the season of your vacation can significantly change.  Beach vacations and fishing should be planned for July-August.  But solitude, meditation and the search for spiritual truths should be carried out in the period from September to November.  By the way, this is the best time for phototourism.  In winter, the <span>climate of Baikal is</span> harsh, and the entire surface of the lake is drawn in by an ice shroud, which is incredibly beautiful.  Well, by the way, hostels on Lake Baikal are ready to hospitably open their doors for you at any time of the year! </p><h2>  Bad advice! </h2><ul><li>  When resting with a tent, use exclusively <span>live trees</span> for the fire <span>,</span> and make the fire on dry grass.  Only in this case will you be visited by huntsmen and environmentalists - with all the ensuing consequences. </li><li>  Write all sorts of nonsense on the rocks - let everyone see that you were here for sure! </li><li>  Fish exclusively with nets - do not let the fish supervision relax! </li><li>  Leave plenty of rubbish wherever you are - it will attract gnats, rodents that carry encephalitis ticks, and if you're lucky, even a bear! </li></ul><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  So, you decided to spend your vacation on Lake Baikal.  But how to get into this kingdom of nature?  It's simple - wherever you go, Irkutsk always serves as a starting point.  And then you will have at your disposal a railway, a bus station, a pier (this way is only available in the summer) and a lot of minibuses leaving the city market. </p><h2>  Housing issue </h2><p>  Despite the fact that these are rather wild places, camp sites on Lake Baikal are presented for every taste and budget.  You can choose Spartan conditions at the campsite, deluxe rooms at the mini-hotel or even a comfortable cabin on the boat.  In addition, a tent and wild tourism are always at your disposal, but better with an experienced guide. </p>

    <h2>  Travel Recommendations </h2><ul><li>  Going to rest on Lake Baikal, regardless of the time of the year, do not forget to bring warm clothes, <span>a raincoat, waterproof</span> shoes. </li><li>  In the warmer months, a vaccination against encephalitis is strongly recommended before traveling.  Moreover, this must be done in advance, since vaccination is carried out in 3 stages with fairly long intervals. </li><li>  Refrain from hiking in the Baikal region from the end of April to the beginning of July - so you will avoid meeting a bear and reduce the risk of tick attacks. </li><li>  When planning river crossings, always adequately assess the risks of flow and bottom topography. </li><li>  Away from the coast of the lake, a vulture that carries a lot of dangerous viral infections can become a big problem - stock up on repellents. </li><li>  And remember: the biggest danger of relaxing on Lake Baikal is that you fall in love with the lake, and you will certainly want to stay here forever!  Have a good trip! </li></ul>
