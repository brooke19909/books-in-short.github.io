  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Leader in sports nutrition - Serious Mass: reviews and recommendations</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Every professional athlete who respects himself, as well as an amateur, knows about the importance and necessity of proper <span>balanced nutrition.</span>  Eating the recommended number of calories and observing the ‚Äúprotein-carbohydrate‚Äù ratio has a positive effect on health, physical fitness and athletic performance.  However, often athletes leading an active lifestyle simply do not have enough time to comply with all these rules.  It is for these situations that Optimum Nutrition Serious Mass is created.  This is a weight gainer developed by <span>Optimum Nutrition</span> Corporation (USA), which has solid experience and excellent recommendations in the sports nutrition market.  Serious Mass includes a complete complex of proteins, carbohydrates, unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins, amino acids and minerals, as well as low molecular weight biologically active compounds that provide muscle gain and an increased need for vitamins, increase energy and stamina. </p><p>  Serious Mass, reviews of which are exclusively positive, has a lot of additional advantages, including natural taste, ease of preparation and a whole range of low molecular weight antioxidants.  These substances are necessary to neutralize aggressive <span>free radicals</span> formed in the body due to physical and mental stress, as well as adverse environmental conditions. </p><p>  To achieve the maximum possible effect, it is recommended to take one portion of the drug per day immediately after training.  In this case, Serious Mass, reviews of which are predominantly athletes, fully satisfies the need for calories formed after serious physical exertion. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Of course, like any drug, Serious Mass has certain contraindications.  The main one is overweight and a tendency to it, as well as a <span>sedentary lifestyle.</span>  In the presence of excess <span>body weight</span> or physical inactivity, calories will be stored in the form of fat deposits: intense physical activity is a necessary condition for muscle growth. </p><p>  Not only athletes are recommended taking Serious Mass.  Reviews of people with insufficient body weight and lean physique testify to the effectiveness of the drug for body shaping, which is especially important for men with an <span>accelerated metabolism</span> and ectomorphic physique. </p><p>  Depending on the type of figure, the initial body weight, the standard load level and the desired results, the dosages and the dosage regimen differ.  When taking before training, you will provide yourself with strength, endurance and energy, after it - restore the reserve of nutrients.  Take 1-2 scoops of powder between regular meals, dissolved in cold water, juice or milk and mixed in a blender for 1 minute.  Before use, do not forget to consult a doctor and make sure that you do not have allergic reactions to the components of Serious Mass.  Customer reviews indicate that the drug is one of the best of its kind in terms of effectiveness and degree of balance of nutrients, as well as the absence of side effects.  In addition, this gainer has a pleasant taste of strawberries, vanilla, chocolate, banana and others. </p><p>  As for the widespread opinion about the dangers of all, without exception, sports nutrition products in general and weight gainers in particular, it was true only for representatives of the first generations of drugs.  Modern gainers are not only completely harmless, but also benefit the body of athletes, supplementing the diet with missing elements, especially Optimum Nutrition Serious Mass.  Reviews of this drug confirm that a world-famous company cares about its image and the health of its customers, and therefore guarantees the absence of any side effects. </p>
