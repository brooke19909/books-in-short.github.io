    <p>  The lack of funds for expensive outfits did not prevent little Marion from enjoying life.  The girl practically grew up behind the scenes, often accompanying her mother to rehearsals.  Cotillard from childhood became ill with the theater, revised many productions.  Of course, she did not have doubts about who she would become when she grew up - an actress. </p><p>  The financial situation of the family changed for the better when his father became famous as a director.  Parents and daughter moved to an elite mansion in Orleans. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Carier start </h2><p>  Highlander is the first television show to feature Marion Cotillard.  The filmography of the Frenchwoman began at the age of 19 with an episodic role that did not help her to be remembered by the audience.  This did not embarrass the stubborn girl, since then she began to actively act in films - almost for free.  In parallel, she had to earn extra money by creating souvenirs for sale, as the desire for independence did not allow her to take money from her parents. </p>

Her filmography in 1998 was replenished with the tape "Taxi", shot by the famous <span>Luke Besson.</span>  She played the girlfriend of the protagonist, honestly earning promising status in the world of cinema.  Consolidation of success was made possible by subsequent participation in the popular films ‚ÄúFall in love with me if you dare‚Äù, ‚ÄúBig fish‚Äù.  However, the most interesting roles of the rising star were yet to come. </p><h2>  Breakthrough movie </h2><p>  The starring ribbon for the aspiring actress was Long Engagement, where she was invited by director Genet, impressed by her looks and talent.  The drama, which was released in 2004, changed the public's perception of Marion Cotillard.

    <p>  The character played by the Frenchwoman in this popular drama was a prostitute.  The heroine Marion lives on revenge alone, hoping to settle accounts with the people who destroyed her lover.  Her Tina turned out so lively and immediate that it seems as if the action takes place in the real world, and not on the set.  Some critics insist that the girl even outplayed Audrey Tautou, who also starred in the drama. </p><h2>  The brightest roles </h2><p>  ‚ÄúLife in pink‚Äù, presented to the public in 2007, was another creative victory for Marion Cotillard.  A review of the best images she created in the movie cannot but include a character like Edith Piaf.  When reporters asked the director Daan why he was focusing on this actress, he replied that he had found a similarity between the Frenchwoman and the cult singer, whom she had excellently played.  The role of Piaf gave Marion numerous awards, among them was the Oscar. </p><p>  Two years later, movie star fans were waiting for another pleasant surprise - her appearance in the film "Nine."  The role that the actress got was not the main one, but during her presence in the frame she managed to overshadow the partners on the set.  The character Marion is the wife of the famous director, who experienced disappointment in life.  Especially vivid were the scenes where her heroine enters into a confrontation with the unfaithful spouse. </p>

    <p>  The romantic picture Midnight in Paris, released in 2011, also allowed Marion Cotillard to fully reveal his acting talent.  A photo of a French woman in the image of Adrianna, who is in a romantic relationship with Picasso himself, can be seen above.  She perfectly managed to portray the flirty intellectual who lives at the beginning of the last century. </p><h2>  What else to see </h2><p>  When it comes to such a wonderful actress, it is difficult to choose the most impressive of her work in films.  The fantastic beginning thriller, which appeared on the screens in 2010, deserves to be watched.  Perhaps this is the largest blockbuster of all that Marion played.  Photos of French women in the image of Mall Cobb can be seen below.  At first glance, her character seems to be the standard heroine of thrillers, but the girl managed to revive him, while maintaining intrigue and tension up to the final credits. </p>

    <p>  Marion also looks great in the film "Johnny D", filmed a year earlier, where the star got the role of the girlfriend of the legendary bandit.  The image she created is called among the best female characters in a gangster movie.  Additional advantages of the tape are unexpected plot twists and dynamism. </p><p>  The biography, filmography of the star is full of other bright moments.  For example, the heroine of the film ‚ÄúThe Dark Knight: Revival of a Legend‚Äù, which saw the light in 2012, is not like her other roles.  According to rumors, the creators even agreed to wait until the movie star is released from another contract. </p><h2>  Personal life </h2><p>  The love of a lifetime met a star from France on the set.  This happened while working on the picture "Fall in love with me if you dare" when Cotillard met Guillaume Canet.  On-screen relationships of a beautiful couple have grown into real ones.  The French actor and director broke up with his wife and since then remains the only man in Marion‚Äôs life.  In 2011, the couple had a baby, becoming the first for both of them. </p><p>  To the delight of fans, the actress does not stop acting.  One of her last achievements is participation in the military drama Macbeth, in which she is assigned the main female role.  The plot of the new picture echoes Shakespeare's play of the same name.  In 2016, other interesting new items will appear with her participation. </p>
