Of course, you can not strain and rent a hero costume in numerous ateliers.  But mothers who want their child to look decent at the holiday will try and sew a unique outfit with their own hands.  It‚Äôs not difficult to do it, a snowman‚Äôs costume will cost inexpensively, but you will be sure that no one else will come in exactly the same outfit, that all things are clean, and not after someone else‚Äôs child, rented. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider several options for making an outfit from different materials.  If a snowman costume is needed for some theatrical scene, then you can make individual elements of paper or padding polyester.  If the outfit is needed for the matinee, the child will be in it for a long time, dancing and dancing, then it is advisable to sew a full-fledged costume from light fabric. </p><h2>  Attributes Attributes </h2><p>  A cloak of two "balls" can be made of thick paper or thin foam rubber.  A snowman costume for a boy consists of two small circles for the upper "balls" and two large ones for the lower ones.  The front and rear parts are either stitched together or glued together if paper is used.  It is also convenient to attach to office paper clips with a stapler.  The outfit is held on two strips attached on top of the shoulders of the child.  To prevent the outfit from flying to the side, the lower circles on the sides also need to be connected with wide stripes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="snowman costume attributes" class="if uuid-2587712" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2587712.jpg"></div><p>  The front is decorated with black round buttons.  Cut them out of glossy double-sided paper.  In the center, you can <span>draw the threads in</span> two lines or with a cross corrector.  The hat is complemented by a black cylinder hat and any bright striped knitted scarf.  First, you need to dress the boy in black trousers and a white shirt, pull on a finished outfit, tie a scarf over your shoulder, and you can go on a holiday.  It will be interesting to complement the image made of paper cone of orange color, which clings to a nose on a thin elastic band. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Syntepon outfit </h2><p>  Such a simple snowman costume (photo below in the article) is sewn from synthetic winterizer to get a voluminous outfit.  It consists of two elements - a beret with eyes and a carrot nose and a rectangular bag tailored to the pattern.  Snowman balls are decorated with elastic bands sewn from below, at the waist and top at the neck.  For cutting fabrics, measure the length of the suit and cut the neck.  Width is made up of length from one shoulder to the other + 10 cm on each side for allowances.  Also, the elastic is sewn on both sides at the level of the hands. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="synthetic winter suit" class="if uuid-2587720" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2587720.jpg"></div><p>  For a beret, a large circle is cut, the diameter of which is 1.5 or 2 times the size of the head, the elastic is sewn along the edge and after fitting it is tightened to the desired length, at the end a knot is tied. </p><p>  When the main details of the snowman's costume are assembled, the synthetic winterizer is decorated with foil snowflakes.  A cone carrot sewn from red fabric is sewn onto a beret, 2 eyes and a paper cylinder are attached a little higher.  You can make it black, as in the photo, or you can any dark color.  How to make a snowman hat, we will consider a little later. </p><h2>  Cloak </h2><p>  It‚Äôs easy to make a snowman costume for a boy with your own hands (photo below) in the form of a wide cape of white felt.  This material is convenient, since there will be no need to hem the edges.  For fabric cutting, the length of the craft and the width are measured from one shoulder to the opposite with large reserves on both sides.  The fabric is folded in half and the required length is measured.  The neckline is cut from above, the sides are stitched to the cutout for the hands.  Since the cloak is wide, the elastic band hangs from below and is pulled to the waist of the child.  Under a kind of vest put on black pants and a white shirt. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="snowman outfit" class="if uuid-2587724" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2587724.jpg"></div><p>  Sew on the front a few circles of black felt.  You can wear a regular bright scarf around your neck or cut out a strip of red felt, as in the photo in the article.  It remains to make a black top hat and the snowman's costume is ready! </p><h2>  Foam Outfit </h2><p>  To convey the round shape of the snowman's balls, you need to use foam rubber as the lining material.  He will give the sewn along with volume.  How to make a snowman costume, read on.  You can make two different patterns.  Firstly, an outfit with one-piece sleeves, and secondly, a separately wrap over the head, which is worn on a white turtleneck. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="snowman costume" class="if uuid-2587708" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2587708.jpg"></div><p>  For a pattern, you can outline any child‚Äôs sweater by making the contours of the neck, sleeves and upper body on the fabric.  The suit has an extension in the shape of a pear downward, forming a snowball ball on the child‚Äôs stomach.  From below, the fabric is tucked and an elastic band is inserted inside the lapel.  After sewing and trying on an outfit, they tighten it, picking up fabric assemblies.  The same outfit can be made of faux white fur. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Two black felt circles are sewn on the front of the chest.  The neck is tied with a contrasting long scarf, and a black cylinder made of fabric or paper is put on the head.  Near the rim of the hat you can tie a wide satin ribbon to match the scarf.  If desired, you can make a carrot nose.  Later in the article you will learn how to quickly make such a paper craft. </p><h2>  Overalls </h2><p>  Let's take a closer look at another option for making a snowman costume with your own hands from the photo.  In a one-piece jumpsuit made of light fabric, the child will be most comfortable at the holiday.  In this case, no detail of the costume will slip, it will not move away, so before photographing you will not need to run out to your mother in the center of the hall and adjust the outfit.  Sewing such a suit is not difficult, the main thing is to make the cut correctly.  If the child‚Äôs wardrobe has overalls, then you just need to put it on top of the fabric and circle it around the contours.  After cutting out the details of the front and back, it remains only to make side seams. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="carnival jumpsuit" class="if uuid-2587715" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2587715.jpg"></div><p>  To draw a pattern for a pattern, you can use separately pants and a sweater.  The jumpsuit is sewn wide, at the back you can make an incision on the fabric and attach a long white Velcro.  The bottom edge of the legs is hemmed with an elastic band. </p><p>  For this outfit, you can take your father‚Äôs hat by making a piping in a circle from a red ribbon.  It is better to take a long scarf so that it hangs from the neck in front and behind.  Instead of the usual black circles of felt for making buttons or embers of a snowman, pompons are made from black yarn. </p><h2>  How to make pompons </h2><p>  How to make a snowman costume, you already know.  Consider how to make pompons from the yarn on the front of the outfit.  You will need cardboard, compasses, scissors, a needle with a wide eye, black yarn, nylon threads.  Two identical circles of the same size as the future pompom are cut out on cardboard.  Inside, using a compass, a smaller circle is drawn, which is then carefully cut with scissors.  Two rings with a width of 2 cm are obtained. Then, a loop is tied with a thread through the inner hole of the folded rings and a knot is tied. </p><div class="photo" data-original="defrenteparaomar.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a pompom" class="if uuid-2590043" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2590043.jpg"></div><p>  Then the edge of the yarn is threaded into the needle with a wide eye and stitched around the ring until the needle can no longer squeeze into the inner hole.  Spread the threads around the entire ring evenly.  Then the sharp edge of the scissors is pushed into the hole between the threads along the outer edge and cut in a circle.  Strong kapron threads tie a strong knot around the inner ring.  Only then can you cut the cardboard rings and pull them out of the pompom.  The edges of the threads are not always smooth, after removing the warp, they can be cut to one length with scissors around the circumference of the ball. </p><h2>  Paper Cylinder Hat </h2><p>  Almost all the boys in the snowman outfit have a hat in the shape of a cylinder on their heads.  Let's see how it can be done.  A rectangle is cut from a sheet of whatman paper, the height of which corresponds to the height of the hat, and the width to the circumference of the head.  In order not to make a mistake with the size, you can wrap a strip of paper around your head and grab it with pins in the right places.  Excess paper is cut off, and the pipe itself is fastened on the sides with paper clips, PVA is glued together or sewn together with threads (optional).  Remember to leave 1 cm of paper in stock! </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ucandostuff.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a cylinder hat" class="if uuid-2587728" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2587728.jpg"></div><p>  Next, cut a circle for the top of the hat.  To do this, it is enough to circle the manufactured pipe.  When cutting this part out of paper, you need to leave 2 cm around the allowance, which will need to be cut into corners.  They are subsequently smeared with PVA glue and attached to the cylinder. </p><p>  It remains to arrange the field hat.  To do this, the workpiece is turned over and the upper circle of the hat is encircled with a pencil.  Then another circle is drawn around it with a compass, 3-4 cm larger than the previous one. Here, when cutting the fields, you need to cut the corners for attachment already on the inside of the ring.  All fastenings are made from the inside so that there are no visible places for bonding allowances. </p><p>  The last stage of the work is painting the craft black with gouache paints.  You can then open everything with acrylic varnish so that the paint on the hat does not stain the child‚Äôs hands. </p><h2>  Satin costume </h2><p>  If you have not yet chosen the method of how to sew a snowman costume with your own hands, consider another outfit made of light white satin.  It consists of two parts.  These are spacious pants on the bottom with elastic bands and the upper part is a wide long rectangle of fabric, which is mounted on the elastic in several places - from the bottom, at the waist, at the neck and at the shoulders on one side and on the other. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="satin costume" class="if uuid-2587722" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2587722.jpg"></div><p>  3 black pompons sewn in front.  A nice addition are mittens, a scarf and a bucket on the head made of blue velvet.  Let's see how to make all these elements for a snowman costume with your own hands. </p><h2>  Bucket </h2><p>  The headgear for the New Year's outfit for the boy can be made from both paper and fabric.  The pattern is made using a piece of paper, which must first be wrapped around the child‚Äôs head.  After the edges are fastened together in the shape of a cone in the size of the head, you need to trim exactly the lower and upper truncated line.  Then it remains to close the hole on top with a circle cut to size. </p><p>  Be sure to leave an additional 1 - 1.5 cm on the hem of the fabric or, in the case of a paper bucket, on strips for gluing the parts together.  After the main work is done, on the opposite sides you need to sew on the semicircular details of the "ears" of the bucket. </p><h2>  Carrot nose </h2><p>  An additional element to any costume proposed in the article, you can create an orange conical nose.  It can be made of paper or foam by folding sheet.  It is necessary to make two holes for breathing from below, and two more holes to be perforated on the sides in order to insert the gum holding the product on the head.  You can make carrots right away from orange cardboard, or you can color the craft with gouache. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The proposed snowman costumes for a boy with a photo will help mothers choose the best option for them to do the job quickly, without unnecessary waste of material and money costs. </p><p>  Any novice master can sew an outfit for the New Year's matinee, even without a sewing machine in stock at home.  The main thing is to try and follow the tips in the article.  Good luck </p>
