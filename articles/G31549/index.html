For example, the pattern of <span>sun skirts that</span> came off the catwalks of fashion designers and won the hearts of the general public is built very easily and quickly, and sewing does not take much time.

    <h2>  The choice of material for the skirt </h2><p>  What fabric is better to choose to get a beautiful sun skirt (flared)?  The pattern suggests that the material should fall from the waist to the bottom of the product with beautiful folds, which means that the canvas should be dense enough to hold its shape.  Suit fabrics, as well as cotton, are suitable for such a product.  If you need to sew a skirt for a holiday, then you can consider options for brocade, tight lace, which will require an additional piece of fabric for lining.  And it is better that the density of these materials and the ability to hold the form are as equal as possible.  Then the product will be harmonious. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The work will also need threads in the color of the canvas, an elastic band of at least 5 cm wide or skirt zipper and buttons for the belt. </p><h2>  Building a pattern of a skirt sun </h2><p>  Cutting can be done directly on the fabric, without developing any blanks and patterns.  The skirt pattern the sun is located on the canvas as follows: </p><ul><li>  the fabric is folded in half lengthwise and then across; </li><li>  a certain number of centimeters recede from the corner and draw ¼ part of the circle so that the line length is equal to ¼ measurement of the waist circumference; </li><li>  if this is a skirt pattern the sun on an elastic band, then it follows the initial value to take the hips so that the product is easy to put on; </li><li>  further from the obtained border, first along the folds of the canvas, and after and throughout the field, lay the length of the product + 4 cm for processing the slices along the top and bottom; </li><li>  if desired, the whole part can be cut into two panels or made one cut for the seam into which the zipper will be inserted (for the product on the belt). </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dress pattern with a skirt sun" class="if" height="385" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1202325.jpg" width="367"></div></h2><h2>  Measurement for the top on the dress </h2><p>  The ability to combine different patterns with each other will create even more fashionable things.  The pattern of skirts (sun and half sun) can be used both for sewing an independent item of clothing, and for combination with patterns of tops.  For example, a dress or dress with such a hem will simply look chic.  To build a top, you need to take measurements from the figure.  The <span>dress</span> pattern <span>with the skirt the sun</span> will consist of four parts: the back, the front shelf and two panels of the skirt. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So, measurements are taken first: girth of the chest, waist, neck, shoulder width, back, chest height, solution of breast protrusions and the length of the back and front to the waist.  For convenience, an elastic band is tied at the waist level so that the last two measurements are measured at the same level. </p><h2>  Transfer measurements for the top to the drawing </h2><p>  <span>Pattern dress with a skirt the sun</span> involves cutting the bottom of the product directly on the fabric and the development of the drawing for the template top.  So that the workpiece can be used several times, it is best to take a building film for work.  It will not tear or crumple like paper, and it is convenient enough to store.  It should be noted immediately that the pattern of skirts the sun (flared) is much simpler, but with the top for the dress you have to tinker. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="skirt sun flare pattern" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1202326.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  The drawing is built in a rectangle, the sides of which are the girth of the chest and the length of the back to the waist: </p><ul><li>  first note the height of the chest and draw the appropriate horizontal line; </li><li>  after it lay on it half the width of the back on one side of the rectangle and ½ solution of tucks on the other; </li><li>  perpendiculars are lifted from these points; </li><li>  further note ¼ girth of the neck from both upper corners and from the marks shoulder width at an angle of 10 degrees; </li><li>  along the front panel from the perpendicular line drawn earlier, 3 cm recede, fall down to the border of the tuck solution and extend the shoulder seam by the same 3 cm; </li><li>  after marking the armhole zone from the mark of the width of the back (1/2 of the chest circumference is divided by 4 + 2 cm); </li><li>  then it remains to compare the measurements of the circumference of the chest and waist and distribute the value to the side seams and tucks. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="skirt pattern sun on an elastic band" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1202330.jpg" width="516"></div></h2><h2>  Product Modeling </h2><p>  A sun skirt (flare), the pattern of which is described above, can be either on an elastic band or fastened with a zipper and have a belt.  The whole modeling process consists only in the design of the belt fastener.  This element can be with a minimum width of 1.5 cm or, conversely, wide and play the role of a decorative element.  And in fact, and in another case, the belt is cut out in the form of an even strip with a fold.  In order to be able to sew it in, there should be at least one seam on the skirt.  It will need to be closed to the line of the hips, and then insert a secret or skirt zipper.  The belt can also be fastened with the same zipper or have an overlap and fastened with buttons, hooks or buttons. </p><h2>  Product decoration </h2><p>  How can a sun skirt be decorated?  The pattern, the photo of which is presented in the article, is designed exclusively for cutting, but on it you can outline the location of decorative elements.  To do this, the template will need to be drawn and cut out of oilcloth or paper, and then, applying to the cut canvas, transfer marks to the fabric to arrange the elements evenly across the field. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="skirt sun pattern photo" class="if" height="496" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1202324.jpg" width="263"></div>  It can be sewn on stones or rhinestones in a checkerboard pattern on the bottom of the product, intertwined with ribbon embroidery.  Or lace sewn with coupons in combination with beads.  The emphasis can also be placed on a decorative wide belt.  It can be embroidered with stones or duplicated with lace or just use beautiful buttons for fastening.  A wide belt with 5 or 7 buttons, “fungi,” which will fasten not just in broken loops, but in hinged ones, will initially look.
