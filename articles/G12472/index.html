Nha Trang is one of the most beloved resorts not only for Russians.  Many Chinese, local residents, Europeans rest here.  The infrastructure of the town is upset, because you need to satisfy the needs of travelers in comfortable housing, delicious food and entertainment.  The hotel base of Nha Trang has a huge number of accommodation options for different price categories.  It is necessary to make a reservation right away that the "star system" is conditional here.  You can equally well spend your vacation in a 3 * or 4 * hotel.  To make the right choice of accommodation, you need to read the rating of hotels in Nha Trang. </p><h2>  The beach capital of Vietnam </h2><p>  And this name of Nha Trang is justified today.  The times have passed when the best clubs with a merry nightlife were only in the capital Hanoi.  At the moment, not only fans of an unforgettable beach holiday amidst the picturesque landscapes of Nha Trang, but also young people who need parties, are striving for the resort. </p><p>  In total there are 28 districts that divide the city into the southern, central and northern parts.  Young people usually flock to the center - this is a very noisy and fun part of the resort with many bars, restaurants, clubs located in the European Quarter.  The largest number of <span>resort hotels is</span> concentrated here <span>.</span>  The southern region is calmer, with quiet beaches and budget hotels.  Judging by the rating of Nha Trang hotels (3 stars), it is in the south of the resort that you can choose a place with the best price / quality ratio for your stay.  In the northern part of Nha Trang, there are very few people, very well-groomed beaches, but few hotels. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The resort is warm all year round, but it can be cool in January and February, and from May to August it is too hot.  The rainy season is short - from mid-October to the second half of December.  During this period, the stormy <span>beaches of Nha Trang</span> beckon high waves of surfers.  The beaches of the city are one of the most beautiful in the world.  All of them (with rare exceptions) are municipal, equipped with sunbeds, umbrellas, deck chairs for an additional fee.  The white sand is mixed with small colored shells, the entry into the South China Sea is quite gentle, and the water is very clear and clean. </p><h2>  General characteristics of the hotel base </h2><p>  What is important in choosing a place for a modern tourist going on a beach holiday? </p><ol><li>  Close to the sea. </li><li>  Air conditioning, TV and Wi-Fi. </li><li>  Clean in the room. </li><li>  Cafes and restaurants nearby. </li><li>  All of the above at a low cost. </li></ol><p>  The fifth point in the resort (like the rest) is carried out in almost all cases, unless, of course, you book a chic Vinpearl Resort, which is considered the most luxurious and expensive, occupies the whole island and has a stable leading position in the ranking of the best hotels in Nha Trang. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.expedia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vinpearl resort" class="if uuid-2583793" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56278/2583793.jpg"></div><p>  All hotels of categories 3 *, 4 * and 5 * are equipped with air-conditioned rooms, bathrooms (many have bidets), modern appliances and free access to the Network.
