The various styles and colors of this simple little thing can create a unique style, from the bully sports and ending with a strict and elegant.  Of course, the cut plays a huge role, and it will be about the modeling capabilities that will be discussed later. </p><p>  A real find of designers was such a model as a tulip skirt.  The template for this product is created on the basis of a simple <span>pattern of a</span> <span>straight skirt.</span>  But the landing of such a model compares favorably with originality from all other variations.  And that is precisely why a season‚Äôs favorite among fashionistas is precisely a tulip skirt.  The pattern (you can create it with your own hands according to the description below) is quite simple in execution, so even a novice master can master such a product. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern of skirts tulip" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1163991.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Preparatory work: building a straight skirt </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the <span>pattern of tulip skirts</span> is built on the basis of the direct model template.  Therefore, in order to sew a fashionable new thing, you must first build a <span>straight skirt pattern.</span>  To do this, take the following measurements from the figure: </p><ul><li>  waist circumference </li><li>  hip circumference; </li><li>  height from the waist to the hips; </li><li>  the length of the finished product. </li></ul><p>  It is best to create a drawing either on a piece of wallpaper or on a section of a dense construction film using a <span>permanent marker.</span>  Its lines will not fade on polyethylene and will be bright enough on paper.  First, draw a right angle with two rays: vertical is equal to the length of the product, horizontal is half the circumference of the hips.  In the drawing, half of the front and rear shelves will come out.  Further along the vertical it is necessary to go down in accordance with the measure ‚Äúheight from the waist to the hips‚Äù and draw a parallel from the horizontal point of the existing horizontal.  The top line will be the waistline, the bottom - the hips. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself tulip skirt" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1163989.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Important Nuances </h2><p>  To get a pattern of tulip skirts with an excellent fit, do not lose sight of the tuck tucks in the manufacture of a direct model drawing.  Therefore, it is necessary to determine the difference between the circumference of the hips and waist and distribute this value in the tucks along the side seam and the back shelf of the product.  Each tuck should not be deeper than 1.5 cm. And the tops must be at a distance of 5 cm from the line of the hips.  In front of the side seam to the fold of the shelf, you need to remove one and a half centimeters for a more accurate fit of the product on the stomach.  It should also be noted that up to 2.5 cm of the difference in the value of the circles can be taken into the side seams. </p><h2>  Modeling a Tulip Style </h2><p>  Once the blank of a straight skirt is ready, you can begin to design the desired style.  <span>The pattern of tulip skirts,</span> as a rule, is lowered to the knee line.  Therefore, first of all, you need to mow down the side seam on both halves by about 5-7 cm. Next, the blanks are cut out and vertical strips are drawn on the details.  The first goes from the fold line of the shelf at a distance of 2.5 cm, the rest - at a distance of 5 cm from each other.  This value is variable and can be changed depending on the desired depth of the folds along the waistline.  The classic pattern of tulip skirts provides a strictly vertical direction of the lines, but you can experiment with a slope.  Subsequently, the resulting verticals are cut, not reaching the bottom, about 0.5 cm. The elements of the pattern are moved apart by a distance similar to the width of the stripes and fixed in this position with tape.  In this case, the bottom of the product is inverted by an arc.  The next step is to lay the bow folds at the waist in accordance with the size of the strips and the indents between them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tulip skirt pattern with pockets" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1163993.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you need a pattern <span>of a tulip skirt with pockets,</span> then the entrance to them is done either in the center of the inner bow of the fold, or in the side seam of the skirt.  In this model, slotted or slanting side pockets are most often performed.  Burlap is made deep enough so that the pocket is not useless. </p><p>  This is how the template is built on which the tulip skirt is sewn.  Do-it-yourself pattern is built quite simply.  A little perseverance, confidence - and it will be possible to proceed to cutting the canvas. </p><h2>  Making dresses with a bottom "tulip" </h2><p>  Using the resulting upgraded skirt pattern, you can sew a great dress with a fitted fitted bodice.  There are a lot of design options for such a product.  It is possible to make tight-fitting sleeves with a length of ¬æ in it or to flare them to the wrist.  You can also make a summer version with a wide shoulder, which will look like a lowered sleeve.  The dress pattern with the tulip skirt includes the skirt template itself, as well as the top and sleeves. </p><p>  To make the top, you need to take additional measures: girth and chest height, shoulder and back width. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="skirt tulip photo pattern" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1164002.jpg" width="389"></div>

    <h2>  Building a bodice pattern </h2><p>  The easiest option for manufacturing the top of the dress is that on a knitted fabric folded in half, half the girth of the chest and the midline should be noted at the fold.  From it is a semicircle of the neck and to the sides is the width of the shoulders, beveled 1.5 cm and elongated 5-7 cm. Next, from the shoulder line at the neck, the chest line should be noted and the boundary of the armhole should be marked along it.  The lower seam of the sleeve should come out of the side seam of the top.  A few tucks should be made along the waist line in accordance with the value of the difference in the circumference of the chest and waist.  If the chest is not very large, then subject to the use of a knitted fabric, additional tucks will not be required, but a secret zipper will need to be inserted into one of the side seams. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dress pattern with tulip skirt" class="if" height="323" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1164017.jpg" width="332"></div>
