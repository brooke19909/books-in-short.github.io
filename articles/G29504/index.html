Nowadays, in Russia, residents of not only large cities, but also small cities can take advantage of the amenities provided by LTE technologies.  There are such towers also in many towns and even villages.  However, the quality of 4G Internet in remote settlements still, unfortunately, usually leaves much to be desired.  This is due to mountains, hills, forests, etc. Correct the situation and speed up 3-4G Internet in the village or, for example, in the country, you can install an external LTE antenna.  Such devices can have a design different. </p><h2>  Types of antennas </h2><p>  All such devices are primarily classified into: </p><ul><li>  ordinary; </li><li>  complemented by a MIMO amplifier. </li></ul>

    <p>  Simple LTE antennas provide data rates up to 50 Mbps.  For MIMO devices, this figure is 100 Mbps. </p><p>  Also, antennas of this type are classified into: </p><ul><li>  directed; </li><li>  sectorial; </li><li>  omnidirectional. </li></ul><p>  By design, such devices are divided into: </p><ul><li>  parabolic; </li><li>  "Yagis"; </li><li>  panel. </li></ul><p>  According to the received signal, 4G antennas are classified into wide and narrowband. </p><h2>  What is <span>a 4G</span> LTE MIMO <span>antenna</span> and how does it differ from ordinary </h2><p>  Devices of this kind, as already mentioned, provide the maximum data transfer rate.  However, they cost more than conventional LTE designs.  In fact, such models are simultaneously two antennas located in one housing, but at a certain distance from each other.  The latter receive the signal independently of each other, but they transmit it to the modem simultaneously. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The advantages of MIMO LTE antennas over conventional ones are thus obvious.  The speed of the Internet when using them can be almost twice as high. </p><h2>  Directional patterns </h2><p>  Depending on the design, LTE device signals can be received from one or several towers at once.  Directional models are usually mounted on the roof of the house and are directed towards the nearest station.  The advantages of such antennas are primarily due to the fact that they practically do not catch interference.  However, installing and configuring such devices is a very complicated matter.  Mounted directional LTE antennas are usually only by qualified specialists.  Another disadvantage of devices of this type is the unreliability of transmission.  After all, if for some reason the station suddenly stops working, the signal in the house will immediately disappear. </p>

    <h2>  Sector antennas </h2><p>  Models of this variety can receive a signal from several stations at once.  Moreover, such devices are automatically configured and operate on the fastest ‚Äúwave‚Äù.  If the signal suddenly disappears from the main tower, the antenna will immediately switch to another one.  The Internet in this case will become worse, but still <span>not going anywhere.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There are practically no shortcomings in sector antennas.  Their only drawback is perhaps the high cost. </p><h2>  Omnidirectional models </h2><p>  The principle of operation of LTE antennas of this variety is almost the same as that of sector devices.  However, such an antenna is capable of catching a signal as much as 360 degrees.  The main advantage of this type of device is that it provides stable transmission.  However, at the same time, the speed of the Internet itself does not increase omnidirectional models too much. </p><p>  Antennas of this type are usually used if there are many obstacles in the signal path.  Most often these are multi-storey buildings in cities. </p>

    <h2>  Yagi Antennas </h2><p>  Such an interesting name are devices that are well-known to many with a horizontal reflector-rod reminiscent of a ‚Äúladder‚Äù.  Most often, such models are painted in blue. </p><p>  The main advantages of Yagi antennas are low cost.  They take a signal worse than other varieties. </p><h2>  Panel Antennas </h2><p>  Devices of this type receive a signal pretty well.  In houses above one floor, they can even be mounted not on the mast, but simply on the wall - on special brackets.  These LTE antennas got their name for the characteristic reflector shape resembling a panel. </p><h2>  Parabolic patterns </h2><p>  Antennas of this type catch a signal better than "Yagi" and panel.  But they cost much more.  Such models are equipped with a parabolic mesh reflector. </p><h2>  Received signal </h2><p>  Among other things, antennas of this type, as already mentioned, can be classified into narrow and broadband.  The towers of mobile operators usually transmit a signal at once at several frequencies.  The advantage of broadband LTE antennas is that they can catch any of them.  For example, if for some reason the 4G signal disappears, the model will automatically switch to 3G or 2G. </p>

    <p>  When 4G disappears, a narrow-band antenna will simply cease to perform its functions.  The only advantage of such models is their low cost. </p><h2>  4G and 3G </h2><p>  LTE antennas are called devices designed to receive a 4G signal.  However, if necessary, such models can easily go into 3G mode.  They represent in the vast majority of cases one of the varieties of MIMO antennas. </p><p>  At the same time, 3G models are usually simple devices without an amplifier.  But sometimes <span>MIMO technologies</span> are also used for such antennas. </p><p>  The difference between the 3G and 4G models lies primarily in the fact that the first type of device catches a signal at frequencies of 2100 Hz or 900 Hz, and the second - 2600 Hz, 800 Hz or 1800 Hz. </p><h2>  Mobile devices </h2><p>  All external LTE antennas are fixed structures.  They are installed on the mast, wall or roof of the house.  In most cases, they amplify the signal well.  However, such devices, even simple "Yagis", are quite expensive.  In some cases, it is possible to ensure a decent Internet speed, and without spending especially big money. </p><p>  In addition to stationary on the market, there are also mobile LTE antennas.  Devices of this type are connected to a computer, router or laptop and are installed in the house - on the windowsill or at the highest point in the room.  It is advisable to use such models instead of expensive external antennas, for example, in suburban villages or on the streets of villages, partially closed from the nearest towers by a small hill.  That is, where the signal from the station is caught without an antenna, but the speed of the Internet is not too high or it is somewhat unstable. </p><h2>  Yota LTE Antenna </h2><p>  Yota is a relatively new operator in the Russian market.  However, its coverage zone is already available, including in the outback of Russia.  The modems of this operator catch the signal basically well.  However, the Yota coverage area is still (by 2017) smaller than that of the old operators - Beeline, Megafon and MTS. </p><p>  Sellers of Yota modems, trying to persuade buyers from towns or villages to buy their products, usually reassure them that the signal from this operator is well caught in the same places where it is stable from the Megaphone.  However, this, unfortunately, is not always true.  Therefore, it is with Yota modems that it is necessary to use LTE antennas, including external ones, most often. </p><p>  For a Yota modem, you can, in principle, use an antenna from third-party manufacturers.  But you can buy a model of the brand exactly Yota.  Moreover, modems from this operator often come bundled with an antenna. </p>

    <h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  Thus, there are several varieties of external LTE antennas in the modern market.  When choosing the most suitable model, it is worth focusing primarily on the number of towers in the vicinity, their location, remoteness.  You should also take into account the features of the area where the antenna will be used.  In any case, you should consult with specialists before buying.  Or at least agree with the seller on the return of the antenna after the sample in the event that it suddenly turns out to be useless. </p>
