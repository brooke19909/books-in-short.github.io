For each of us, relaxation is something special, we decide what it will be, but to deny the love of people for the sea is simply pointless.  Numerous studies and observations of scientists have shown that the sea really calms, relaxes, helps to escape and at least temporarily forget about everything.  And, of course, the southern sea resorts allow you to get a beautiful even tan, temper your body, and due to the developed infrastructure, have a great time and get unforgettable emotions. </p><p>  Modern tourists increasingly prefer overseas resorts, and all because they offer excellent conditions for organizing an unforgettable vacation and first-class service.  But do not forget that in Russia there are also beautiful and noteworthy vacationers places.  Resorts of the Krasnodar Territory, popular in the Soviet years, are now forgotten by many.  Yes, of course, they can not compete with the fashionable European resorts, but in fact rest here is much cheaper.  If your family has small children, you are not ready for long and tiring flights, you decided to go to the sea by personal car - the Russian sea resorts will be an excellent option. </p>

    <p>  The simplest option that the Sea Star Hotel (Kabardinka) can offer is a standard room with a bathroom, designed for two or three people.  The walls are painted in pastel colors and the floor is tiled.  Many people think that tiled floors are a significant drawback of rooms: it‚Äôs easy enough to break fragile things, utensils, and sometimes it‚Äôs really cold in the legs.  The superior room is more spacious, comfortable, the furniture is better and more beautiful.  There is a dining table and a balcony with stunning views of the resort. </p>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Going on vacation, hardly anyone wants to spend time cooking daily, standing at the stove, so many tourists will surely like the opportunity to rent a room with three meals a day.

Moreover, in walking distance from the hotel there are enough bars, cafes, restaurants, hot corn, ice cream, fresh fruits and soft drinks are sold on the beach. </p>
