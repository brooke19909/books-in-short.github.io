    <h2>  Moment structure </h2><p>  Starting in October 2014 and ending in June 2016, Valery Fadeev shone on the television screens of Channel One viewers as the host of the show “Structure of the Moment”.  A political show was released every week.  Guests and participants of the studio discussed controversial topics related to the problems and difficulties of life in Russia.  Public figures suggested possible solutions, which were also commented on by the permanent host Valery Fadeev.  The “structure of the moment” was held in the format of a round table.  Visiting the host were Karen Shakhnazarov, Alexei Venediktov, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, Leonid Slutsky and other public figures.  Within the framework of the show, topics such as the “Referendum on the withdrawal from the EU of Great Britain” or “Do Ukraine and the Minsk Agreement have a future” were discussed.  Often, guests did not come to a consensus, made harsh remarks towards each other, but Valery Fadeev, whose biography helped him learn to act in such situations, was always considerate and competent in resolving conflict situations.  Now you can see only archived issues of the program, since after Fadeev’s transfer to another program, “The Structure of the Moment” has ended. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  In place of Zeynalova </h2><p>  As you know, the leading news program of the “First Channel” “Evening Time” since 2012 has been Irada Zeynalova.  The viewer got used to her style and enjoyed watching new news releases with her comments.  It seemed to be like this forever.  But in September, as the host of the evening news program, the viewer saw a new face for this program.  The new leader was Valery Fadeev.  What is the reason for these permutations is thoroughly unknown.  One of the opinions suggests that the ratings of Irada Zeynalova fell, and they decided to replace her.  From other sources there is information that Zeynalova was tired of the quiet life of a news anchor and wished to return to the life of a correspondent with various business trips.  Whatever the reason, Valery Fadeyev is now conducting the news broadcast - a man close to power, a liberal and a former presenter of the socio-political show “The Structure of the Moment”. </p>

    <h2>  Not Dmitry Kiselev, not Dmitry </h2><p>  Sunday time on Channel One intersects in time with Vesti Nedeli on Rossiya TV Channel.  In this regard, the channels have to not only divide the audience, but also compete in the ratings.  The host of Vesti Nedeli, Dmitry Kiselev, as you know, was ahead of Irada Zeynalov in all respects.  Perhaps this is precisely what caused the introduction of the new face on Channel One.  The newly-minted news anchor Valery Fadeev, according to the viewers and experts, is the exact opposite of Kiselyov.  The format of Fadeev’s reference is not inherent in statements regarding spies, a <span>world conspiracy, and a</span> fifth column, so beloved by the audience and fans of Dmitry Kiselyov.  But perhaps the first channel focuses on the fact that the time of Kiselev, like Zeynalova, will pass sooner or later, and then Valery Alexandrovich will get his peak of popularity. </p>

    <h2>  Say what you think and be right </h2><p>  The love and respect of the audience is most valuable to Valery Fadeev.  Reviews about his work are not always unambiguous.  This is due to the fact that he always has his own opinion, which sometimes does not coincide with the vision of the audience.  But they listen to him, listen to him and discuss him.  So, for example, he notes: “A journalist works to be in the place where an interesting and significant event took place.  His duties are to find out the details, communicate with eyewitnesses and then bring this to the public, preferably without deception.  But, despite this, each journalist should have his own position and at least some worldview.  Of course, you can write political articles and defend your personal opinion in them, but you can no longer call it journalism.  It’s just a statement of the position of the publication or a specific person. ”  And here’s what Valery Fadeev says about foreign media: “If you do not take into account political correctness, then, in comparison with ours, the Western media is, of course, stronger and more powerful.  For comparison, I would like to mention the attendance of Spiegel magazine from Germany.  There are no entertaining topics, all about politics, but on business.  Discussion of the state budget of Germany simply tears all possible ratings, since everything is stated clearly and clearly - for whom changes are good and for whom not.  They do not attribute the lack of popularity to the disinterest of the people, they are trying in every possible way to captivate the people.  And, as a result, they get a return. ” </p>

    <h2>  Expert opinion on the Russian economy </h2><p>  Within the framework of “Synclit in VIAM” Valery Fadeev spoke out on the Russian economy, the difficulties of its development and ways to solve them.  In his thoughts, he came to the conclusion that the main problem is the most severe monetary policy, namely, recommendations for a sharp reduction in the money supply.  In his opinion, in order to create the soil for the development of the country's economy, it is necessary to forget about the patterns and highlight really significant landmarks.  For this, it is important to discuss the real economic situation, and not to devote all the time to creating “mythical assumptions” about it.  According to Valery Fadeev’s acquaintances, he doesn’t write a book, but he conveys his opinion through meetings with people of interest and conducting political programs.  On synclite, he highlighted such a problem as a decrease in mortgage interest rates.  He said that the cost of mortgage housing in our country could be 5 times less.  Answering the guests' questions, Valery focused on the missing innovations, the production of a meager product range and the degradation of the economy. </p><h2>  Heart to heart with Dmitry Medvedev </h2><p>  On the air of the final program "Sunday Time" Valery Fadeev managed to communicate and ask questions to Dmitry Medvedev.  Answering important economic issues, Dmitry Anatolyevich noted that negative trends will completely exhaust themselves in the near future.  The reason for this will be government measures and the desire to improve the country.  According to the Prime Minister, next year there will be an increase in GDP.  Subject to improvement, and other macroeconomic indicators.  As for the price increase, this, according to Dmitry Anatolyevich, will happen only within the framework of inflation.  And she, according to his forecasts, should be insignificant, which means that the Russians will not hit hard in the pockets. </p>

    <h2>  Journalist = civil servant </h2><p>  When Valery Fadeev was informed about the idea of ​​equating journalists with civil servants in order to make public and declare income, he answered with indignation and bewilderment.  In his opinion, this is too much.  The desire to get into the pockets of journalists is understandable, especially from the opposition, but, according to Fadeev, this will entail only the development of “black bookkeeping”.  And no one will ever know the true state of affairs.  And the appearance of journalistic salaries "in envelopes" will only further aggravate the country's economic situation. <sub></sub></p>
