How to get to the Dulber Palace?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many writers were inspired by the beauty of the Crimean peninsula.  Such famous writers as A. Chekhov, A. Mitskevich and Lesya Ukrainka wrote masterpieces here.  It worked perfectly on this land and the geniuses of architecture.  Hundreds of buildings in the Crimea are considered examples of style.  The D√ºlber Palace is among the best of them.  A photo of the castle can be seen in the material. </p><h2>  Mix of cultures </h2><p>  Crimean land attracted different peoples thousands of years ago.  Short and mild winters, long summers, a rich world of flora and fauna - all this allowed the tribes to live in this territory easily and happily.  It was easy to engage in fishing, farming and hunting.  At the same time, iron ore was mined, so the inhabitants of the peninsula developed metallurgy and crafts. </p>

The land was washed by two seas, so the peninsula stood in the way of water transit routes.  A mixture of cultures and traditions was subsequently reflected in architecture.  Dulber Palace, <span>Swallow's Nest, the</span> ruins of Chersonesos - all this and many other attractions today are the pride of the Crimea.

    <p>  A tidbit of dry land has become the birthplace of various groups of peoples.  Tauris, Cimmerians and Scythians found shelter here.  In the VI century.  BC  e territory occupied by the Greeks.  When they lost their independence, the Romans came in their place.  Of course, these lands were also mastered by the Slavic neighbors.  Later on the peninsula came Turks and Tatars.  In general, about thirty nationalities created the history of Crimea. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The background of the palace </h2><p>  One of the attractions of architecture is Dulber Palace.  His story began in 1895.  And more than a hundred years before this event, the Russian state and the Ottoman Empire were weaving political intrigues on the peninsula.  During the war, the lands went to Catherine II.  Under the reign of the queen, this coastal region turned into an amazing resort. </p><p>  Each representative of the noble family considered it an honor to acquire an estate here.  Consequently, in the territory of Crimea, luxurious summer mansions for nobles appeared one after another.  The rich did not spare money for the embodiment of their desires.  The most talented architects were invited to work. </p>

    <h2>  Virtuoso in the shower </h2><p>  The customer of the palace was the representative of the Romanov princely family - Peter Nikolaevich, who was the grandson of Emperor Nicholas I. </p><p>  The aristocrat was born in 1864.  In childhood received a military education.  But the guy did not stand out with heroism and special courage.  He began his career in the army, because it was one of the traditions in the family.  It was highly developed creativity.  He was interested in painting, architecture.  Later, the architect‚Äôs talent was reflected in the design that we call the Dulber Palace today.  The aristocrat simultaneously collected documents and manuscripts, and also bred dogs.  Last hobby sometimes made a profit.  The man married and raised three children. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Romantic nature </h2><p>  Everyone who knew Pyotr Nikolaevich described him as a silent, kind, calm and very modest person.  Others noted that the prince did not have the business acumen and could not properly allocate his budget. </p><p>  In the service, he served as an engineer.  His military inventions have repeatedly saved the lives of soldiers.  During work, he contracted tuberculosis.  And he, like all patients with this ailment, was prescribed a warm climate.  The man was treated in the Mediterranean, where he was struck to the core by magnificent oriental architecture. </p><p>  All his life, Pyotr Nikolaevich was drawn to art.  One of his brilliant creations was the Dulber Palace.  It should be noted that the ensemble was built according to the sketch of the prince.  He was inspired by a travel project to the countries of the Middle East and Africa. </p>

    <h2>  From concept to implementation </h2><p>  The style chosen by the owner is called Moorish.  He was fashionable throughout Europe in the years 1850-1950.  This direction consisted of Spanish, Portuguese, Islamic motifs that prevailed in the Middle Ages. </p><p>  The prince entrusted the work to <span>Nikolai Petrovich Krasnov.</span>  This man studied in Moscow, lived rather poorly.  And since 1887, for success in his work, he was appointed the chief architect of Yalta.  He was given a responsible task: to make a luxurious and beautiful resort out of the town.  But, in addition to government orders, he accepted private projects.  His portfolio included the Dulber Palace.  How to get to the territory, on what principle to build and what to use during construction - all these secrets Krasnov knew. </p>

    <p>  It should be noted that the prince was told about the young architect by his friends.  The nobleman decided to heed the advice, because the architect had been working in the Crimea for several years and during that time he had perfectly studied all the features of the local relief. </p><h2>  Financial difficulties </h2><p>  During construction, the prince and his family lived nearby, on the coast of the sea.  But poor health did not allow him to control the process on his own.  Peter felt so bad that he even refused to get out of bed. </p>

    <p>  But not only the illness of the customer has become a problem for the architect.  When they began to calculate the financial capabilities of the family, they realized with horror that the royal offspring had almost gone bankrupt.  There was hardly enough money for living.  And, of course, there was nothing to pay the workers.  For some time, friends recommended the prince to sell the object.  If the noble then surrendered, then perhaps no one would ask today how to get to the Dulber Palace.  But Peter, in turn, decided to auction other clan lands and thus paid off his debts. </p><h2>  Oriental luxury </h2><p>  The palace is striking in its beauty.  This is an asymmetric structure with two and four-story extensions.  In general, the complex has more than 100 rooms.  It is inherently surprisingly white in color, which shimmers depending on the lighting.  Silver domes hang over the battlements.  The windows are made in the form of arches.  Mura decorated with mosaics and ornaments.  Visitors are delighted with luxury.  Many guests claim that during the tour, it seems that you are visiting the <span>Arab sheikh.</span> </p><p>  After the wars, the building was partially damaged.  During the construction, the architect used unique technologies for decoration.  Contemporaries still cannot unravel their composition.  Therefore, in part, the decor has acquired new features.  But the park remained the same as a hundred years ago.  It has become the hallmark of D√ºlber Palace.  Reviews of tourists about the park are positive.  Even experts note that gardeners managed to maintain their original appearance.  The park ensemble extends from the entrance gate to the coast of the sea. </p>

    <h2>  Impregnable fortress </h2><p>  During the revolution, all the Romanovs who were on the peninsula during the war gathered in the walls of this palace.  Strong walls protected them from political repression for a long time.  Those who were outside the castle fell under the wrath of Soviet power and were killed.  After waiting for the rebellion, the aristocrats soon sailed to Europe by ship, where most of their close relatives lived.  There they were given shelter. </p><p>  Historians note that if it were not for the Dulber Palace, then perhaps there would not have been a single <span>descendant of the Romanovs</span> today <span>.</span> </p><p>  In the early <span>years of Lenin's rule, a</span> sanatorium was made from the castle.  Later, he took first place among all the health resorts of Crimea.  Subsequently, bedroom towers were built on the territory of the complex, which pretty spoiled the romantic composition.  But visitors note that in general the monument was not damaged. </p><p>  The very name of the palace is translated from Arabic as "beautiful", "delightful."  This can be confirmed by tourists visiting the estate.  In addition to an interesting story with dramas and tragedies, travelers also receive a lot of positive charge.  The Dulber Palace has its own unique energy.  The tour takes place in one breath. </p>

    <h2>  Unique tour to the past </h2><p>  On the stone niche of the fountain there is a medallion on which it is written that the whole family was present at the consecration of the mansion.  Therefore, it seems that every visitor can touch this period of history and imagine how the aristocrats lived. </p><p>  Above the entrance is an inscription made in Arabic.  This is a phrase from the Qur'an that translates as: ‚ÄúMay Allah bless everyone who enters the house.‚Äù </p><p>  Guests note that the park is a real botanical garden.  Here you can see rare plants such as <span>stone oak,</span> pistachios, cedar, oils, sequoias and many others. </p><p>  The only negative - the palace can be viewed only from the outside.  Tourists are not allowed into the mansion itself. </p><p>  Allows you to be in the eastern fairy tale Dulber Palace for several hours.  The address of the magnificent and unique complex: the village of Koreiz, which is 12 km from Yalta.  The estate is located on Alupkinskoye Highway 19. You can get to the place by minibuses, trolleybuses or buses that run from Yalta and Sevastopol. </p><p>  It should be said that excursions are held at any time of the year.  But the guests note that the house is especially beautiful in the summer, when its snow-white walls are framed by green foliage. </p>
