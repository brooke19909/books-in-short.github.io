    <p>  This city arose in the upper Dnieper as the center of the Krivichi Slav tribe.  The history of Smolensk begins with the first mention of it in the Ustyug chronicles, which dates from 863.  The story of how Askold and Dir‚Äôs squads went on a campaign to Tsar-haiti states that the city of Smolensk at that time was "a city of great strength and many people."  In 882, Prince Oleg captured this settlement, which is mentioned in the first Novgorod annals.  The history of Smolensk is marked by the fact that at the end of the 9th century it became part of Kievan Rus, however, it was ruled for a long time after that.  In the notes of Konstantin Bagryanorodny (Byzantine emperor), dating to the middle of the 10th century, this city is called, along with Kiev, a fortress. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Smolensk in the XI-XII centuries </h2><p>  After Yaroslav the Wise died in 1054, his younger sons reigned in Smolensk for some time: first Vyacheslav, and after him Igor. </p><p>  The city of interest to us at the end of the XI century becomes the specific city of Vladimir Monomakh, who received it in addition to Pereyaslavl Yuzhny, his old "estate".  The Smolensk principality achieved political independence under Rostislav Mstislavovich, the grandson of Monomakh.  Rostislav in 1134 surrounded the Smolensk settlement with fortifications.  At that time, this city was already very large.  It began intensive stone building, which continued under the sons of Rostislav Mstislavovich - Roman, who reigned with a short break from 1160 to 1180, and David (from 1180 to 1197).  By the end of the 12th century, an independent architectural school appeared in Smolensk. </p><p>  At favorable points of the relief, along the Dnieper, there were large city and monastery cathedrals, Posad and princely churches, as well as bishop's churches.  This created a picturesque panorama of Smolensk, which made an indelible impression on the trading people who came from abroad. </p><h2>  The intellectual life of the city </h2><p>  Writing and culture at that time reached a high level.  Workshops were created at the temples, in which books corresponded, as well as schools teaching Latin and Greek.  Such great enlighteners came from the Smolensk land, as Clement Smolyatich, a scribe and philosopher elected by the Kiev Metropolitan in 1147, and the Rev. Avraamy Smolensky, whose "gifts of shepherding" and "scholarship" were noted by his various contemporaries. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The development of crafts and trade, the invasion of Batu </h2><p>  Crafts and trade developed.  In 1229, they entered into an agreement with Gotland, Riga and the North German cities.  This agreement is known as the Smolensk Trade Truth.  Having defeated Batu‚Äôs detachment in 1239, the Smolenskys escaped the Tatar-Mongol ruin, although they subsequently had to pay a tribute to the Golden Horde.  Nomads in 1339 tried again to capture this rebellious city, however, having seen powerful fortifications on the spot where Smolensk is located, they retreated. </p><h2>  Smolensk as part of the Principality of Lithuania </h2><p>  Since the 14th century, this city has been under pressure from <span>Lithuania.</span>  <span>Vytautas, the Lithuanian prince,</span> in 1404 treacherously captured Smolensk after a two-month siege.  In 1410, Smolensk, already part of the Principality of Lithuania, participated in the Battle of Grunwald.  The main blow of the Teutons was taken by three Smolensk regiments, which were in the center of the army of Slavic peoples.  They stood to death, deciding, in fact, the outcome of this battle. </p><h2>  The liberation of Smolensk, the development of the city in the XVI century </h2><p>  Under Prince Vasily III in 1514, Smolensk was liberated.  He became part of the Moscow state.  Under Ivan the Terrible, in the middle of the 16th century, a new oak fortress was erected in it on an earthen rampart.  The settlement beyond the Dnieper is expanding significantly, two new settlements appear on the left bank - Churilovskaya and Rachevskaya.  The foreigner John Cobenzel, who visited the city in 1575, compared its size with Rome.  Polish-Lithuanian detachments, having lost a fortress strategically important for them, repeatedly made attempts to re-capture the city.  The decision to strengthen the outpost of the western borders of the country was made at the end of the XVI century.  In Smolensk in 1596-1602 a powerful fortress wall was erected. </p><h2>  Poles invasion </h2>

    <p>  The city withstands a twenty-month siege in 1609-1611, which was subjected to the army of <span>Sigismund III, the</span> Polish king.  One nameless letter that called for fighting the invaders said that if there were at least a few such ‚Äústrong cities‚Äù in the Russian state, then it would be inconvenient for the enemies to enter Russian land.  Bloodless Smolensk in June 1611 fell.  Only after 43 years, during the reign of Alexei Mikhailovich, he was freed from the Poles and he finally became part of the Russian state. </p><h2>  The Northern War in the history of the city </h2><p>  During the Northern War, Smolensk again found itself on the path of the conquerors.  Peter I repeatedly came here, in case of the invasion of the Swedes, strengthening the city.  This sovereign in October 1708 at the city hall solemnly met the Russian troops, who defeated the Swedish corps coming to the aid of Charles XII near the village of Lesnoy, led by General Levengaupt. </p><h2>  New status </h2><p>  The city of interest to us in 1708 receives a new status - the status of a provincial city.  The ancient coat of arms of Smolensk, which depicts a cannon and a bird of paradise sitting on it, is approved in 1780.  At the bottom of the silver ribbon today is the motto: "Glorified by the fortress."  The modern emblem of Smolensk is presented below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="museums of smolensk" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/853000.jpg" width="482"></div>  In Smolensk, by the end of the 18th century, 11,579 residents lived.

    <h2>  The historical reunion of two armies near Smolensk </h2><p>  1812 entered the heroic page in the history of Smolensk.  The 1st and 2nd Russian armies, departing from the western borders after the invasion of Napoleon, united near Smolensk.  The French here met fierce resistance on the part of the Russians: on the fortress walls and bastions, the enemy‚Äôs attacks courageously reflected Russian soldiers.  The unification of the armies of Bagration and Barclay de Tolly near Smolensk thwarted <span>Napoleon's plans to</span> defeat them one by one.  In many ways, this determined the outcome of the Battle of Borodino (Commander-in-Chief - Kutuzov). </p><h2>  Smolensk battle: details </h2>

    <p>  French soldiers wanted at all costs on the birthday of their emperor (August 4) to enter this city.  And on August 4-5, the battle of Smolensk took place.  Hundreds of grenades and cores, thousands of bullets were showered on the city.  The French almost captured the Molokhov Gate.  However, help arrived in time and, having run out of the wall, the Russians expelled the French from the ramparts.  Also in other places, the heroes of Smolensk repulsed the attack.  Many townspeople took part in the battle, taking the wounded to the city and delivering cores to the soldiers.  Without fear of cores, women brought buckets of water to weary soldiers.  For a long time, the defense of Smolensk continued.  The French rushed again and again to storm the city, but always unsuccessfully.  Then the emperor Napoleon ordered to light it with bombs, and the city burned in flames. </p><p>  On August 6, in the morning, the French entered, not without fear, into the deserted Smolensk.  Napoleon entered the Nikolsky Gate.  After 4 days, the emperor‚Äôs troops went to Moscow.  However, the Russian armies were already united and together were retreating.  Russian troops on the <span>Borodino field,</span> inspired by the presence of the gate icon of the Mother of God in their ranks (she was carried around the camp before the battle), repelled the attacks of the French.  Bonaparte then understood the power of the Russian spirit. </p><h2>  The Return of Napoleon </h2><p>  Napoleon, 2 months after the capture of Smolensk, was already running back with his hungry army.  He walked into Smolensk on October 28 through the Dnepropetrovsk gate without any solemnity, on an icy road.  The city was still empty.  Hunger and cold and here met the remnants of his army.  Napoleon, enraged by this, ordered to blow up the walls of the city, fatal for him, and left him in order to run on.  9 Smolensk towers took off.  From under the rest, the Russian huntsmen arrived in time to pull out the wicks. </p><h2>  Smolensk at the beginning of the 20th century </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is smolensk" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25681/852019.jpg" width="546"></div></h2><p>  By the beginning of the 20th century, Smolensk was a provincial wooden city.  Only 283 of the 2698 buildings were stone.  In this city, according to the census of 1881, 33.9 thousand people lived.  40 temples and monasteries operated in Smolensk.  On the night of October 31, 1917, the pre-revolutionary history of this city ended.  Her new page began - the Soviet Smolensk.  It was then that the local Bolsheviks announced the establishment of Soviet power in this city.  The impending collapse, and then the restoration of the economy, the monstrous Stalinist repressions, the years of fascist occupation. </p><h2>  The Great Patriotic War in the history of the city </h2><p>  In June 1941, Smolensk was on the path of the main blow of the German armies.  The stubborn battles for this city lasted two weeks.  The lengthy defense of Smolensk led to the fact that the plan for the lightning capture of the capital was disrupted.  Here, German troops were forced to go on the defensive for the first time during World War II. </p><p>  In 1943, on September 25, there was a battle near Smolensk, as a result of which this city was liberated.  The war has brought untold suffering to this land.  Military Smolensk suffered heavy losses.  Almost to its very foundations, the enemy destroyed the city.  Of the 157 thousand inhabitants who lived here before the war, only 13 thousand people waited for their liberators. </p><h2>  "Key City" </h2><p>  Smolensk, having gone through all the harsh trials that fell to its lot, retained its unique appearance.  The fortress walls and ancient temples, modest obelisks and majestic monuments are like milestones in his fate, closely connected with the fate of our country.  Having survived the fires of conflagration, enemy invasion, destruction, Smolensk gained fame as a guard of the borders of the Russian state, became a symbol of Russian patriotism and perseverance.  It is not for nothing that they call the key city. </p><h2>  Historical Museums of Smolensk </h2><p>  Today you can get acquainted with the history of the city by its museums.  This is the Historical Museum, the museum "Smolensk - the shield of Russia" (pictured below), "Smolensk during the Second World War 1941-1945."  Each of them is interesting in its own way.  The Historical Museum will tell you about the past of this city from prehistoric times to the 20th century.  "Smolensk - the shield of Russia" is located in the Thunder Tower, which is part of the <span>Smolensk fortress wall.</span> </p>
