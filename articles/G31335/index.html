But in fact, not everything is so complicated.  There are many nuances that will tell the user which tablet he is holding in his hands.  Therefore, let's explore these nuances so that you can easily determine the model of the device. </p>

    <p>  As you can see in the photo, it‚Äôs quite easy to determine which line of tablets this or that iPad is in.  There are only three of them. </p><ul><li>  A line of ten-inch tablets - they are simply called iPads. </li><li>  Eight-inch, called "Mini." </li><li>  And finally, a thirteen-inch lineup called the Pro. </li></ul><p>  But then inside each line you need to understand the nuances of the appearance of the iPad itself.  Therefore, the question of how to find out which iPad is mine remains quite relevant. </p><h2>  The first iPad models </h2><p>  The very first tablet from Apple went on sale in 2010, and determining it is quite simple.  This model appeared on sale only with a black screen and without a camera.  Therefore, a quick look at such a tablet is quite enough to answer the question of how to find out which iPad I have.  If there is no camera, then this is definitely the first generation iPad. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In addition, the appearance of the power connector is of great importance in determining the type of tablet.  But the external signs of the first generation of iPads are so eloquent that they are confused that it is quite difficult to mix up even without looking at the <span>power connector.</span> </p><h2>  The second and third generation tablets </h2><p>  A year after the appearance of the first Apple tablets, the second version of the tablet is released, and soon the third.  Recognizing the difference between them visually is not so simple.  Therefore, in order to answer the question of how to find out which iPad I have, the second or third generation, you need to know their features well.  If we talk about the physical dimensions of these devices, an experienced user will say with confidence that the third-generation iPad is a little thicker, and can even identify this tablet by touch.  But the average user, especially if he has never held such a tablet in his hands, will not be able to feel the 0.6 mm difference in thickness.  The same goes for the power connector.  In all three tablets of the first generations, the power connectors are thirty-pin, but in the iPad of the third generation it is slightly wider.  But how do I know which iPad is in my hands, if there are samples for comparison?  Therefore, for owners of tablets on the back side are written model numbers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  iPad 2 came out with the numbers A 1395, A 1396 and A 1397. </li><li>  iPad 3 was released with the numbers A 1403, A 1416 and <span>A 1430.</span> </li></ul><p>  From these numbers it is quite easy to determine the model of the device, but you need to know these numbers for memory or keep records in some form. </p><h2>  IPad mini coming out </h2><p>  In 2012, Apple introduced a smaller tablet, just eight inches, called iPad Mini.  It was quite simple to recognize him among other tablets, since all the models before him had a ten inch size.  But with the release of other models of this size, the question of how to find out which iPad I have ("Mini") in my hands becomes quite relevant.  Starting with this model, the company is switching to a new power connector, called Lightning.  Externally, the iPad Mini and iPad Mini 2 differ only in screen quality.  The latest version of tablets has a display with a Retina screen, which significantly improves image quality.  In the ‚ÄúMini‚Äù model of the third generation, a new golden color appears. </p>

In appearance, it is not much different from its predecessors, but experienced users will be able to quickly distinguish it.  The Lightning power connector and Retina display appear in it.  After some time, the full-length iPad Air and iPad Air 2 appear. When you look at them, the question of how to check which iPad I have should not arise.  Since these models not only decreased in size, retaining a ten-inch screen, but also significantly lost weight.  In addition, the iPad Air 2 lost a sound switch, the absence of which can easily be distinguished from its older brother. </p>

    <h2>  Other options for defining an iPad model </h2><p>  There are several more ways to answer the question of <span>how to find out which iPad I have.</span>  The first and easiest is to read the model name on the tablet packaging.  But one cannot be mistaken only if the packaging has not yet been opened after manufacturing at the factory.  In other cases, often the tablet and packaging do not match. </p><p>  The second way - when the tablet is turned on, enter its settings and open the "About this device" tab.  It contains the number of the party in which this tablet was released.  Knowing him, on the Internet it is enough to simply find the number of tablet models that were released in this batch.  Thus, having learned a little about iPads, you can quite easily determine which model is in your hands and do not let yourself be deceived. </p>
