  <section class="page js-page"><h1>S.Oliver stores in Moscow: clothing and accessories</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In Russia, the fashion <span>brand of clothes</span> and accessories s.Oliver appeared recently, but quickly won the hearts of Moscow youth.  Founded in Germany, a retail company began to spread throughout Europe, looking at Russian consumers.  The largest number of stores of this brand can be found in Moscow. </p><h2>  Brand history </h2><p>  Every big business starts small.  So it happened with s.Oliver.  In 1969, Bernd Fryer opened a small boutique, which he called "Sir Oliver."  It was the author's exclusive clothing for men.  After 4 years, all of D√ºsseldorf knew his products as premium business clothes that many wanted to wear.  Mr. Bernd decided not to miss the benefit and opened the line for women. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="s.Oliver stores in Moscow: addresses" class="if uuid-2244352" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64128/2244352.jpg"></div><p>  The current name s.Oliver appeared in 1978 and was already positioned as casual clothing for men and women.  Only in 2003, the brand decided to enter the foreign market, opening in Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.  In 2006, it conquers Poland, Italy and Kazakhstan, in 2007 - France and India.  Later it appears in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Croatia and Canada and, finally, conquers the Russian market. </p><p>  In total, 10,300 stores are open in the world, and the s.Oliver group of companies now combines several brands.  Successful development is due to the quality and wide demand for the products sold in the mass market segment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="s.Oliver stores" class="if uuid-2244351" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64128/2244351.jpg"></div><p>  The main office of the company is located in the German city of Rottendorf, from where all other international offices in Indonesia, Turkey, India and China are managed.  Since 2015, Armin Fichtel has held the position of CEO of the company. </p><h2>  Prevalence in the Russian market </h2><p>  In Russia, including Moscow, the first s.Oliver stores appeared about ten years ago.  Fashionable clothes at low prices quickly captured the attention of city residents, and the brand became very popular.  In 2011, the joint advertising campaign of singer Alexei Vorobyov with a youth brand began, which certainly raised the rating of stores among the Russian audience. </p><p>  Now you can find s.Oliver clothing stores in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Kaliningrad, Yaroslavl, Krasnodar, Novokuznetsk and other cities.  The Russian audience liked the new German youth brand, thanks to which the opening of stores throughout the country and the further development of the brand continue. </p><h2>  Popularity in the capital </h2><p>  S.Oliver stores in Moscow cover a wide range of consumers.  Since the brand keeps up to date and timely releases fashion collections that take into account all the latest trends, and even at attractive budget prices, young people are happy to go there to buy it. </p><div id="sjcont"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In <span>Moscow shopping centers there</span> is a huge variety of competing brands of clothing and accessories, especially in the mass market segment.  The s.Oliver brand has not yet gained such high popularity as the world-famous Swedish brainchild of Erling Persson, but is slowly gaining momentum with enviable constancy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.europark.at" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="s.Oliver clothing stores in Moscow" class="if uuid-2244360" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64128/2244360.jpg"></div><p>  Now in Moscow, s.Oliver stores are represented in almost every major shopping and entertainment complex, which ensures the brand‚Äôs accessibility for guests and residents of the city. </p><h2>  Who is interested in visiting s.Oliver? </h2><p>  Stylishly dressed in s.Oliver can be a person of any age.  There is clothing for both a fifteen-year-old and retired men. </p><p>  The company's policy is to create fashionable and affordable clothing for any buyer, without discrimination on the basis of gender or other characteristics.  And the brand successfully copes with this. </p><p>  Simple and beautiful things are waiting for buyers on the shelves, and affordable prices do not affect the quality of clothing.  Products are well and correctly sewn, rarely when marriage comes across. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ksp-architekten.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="s.Oliver stores in Moscow: telephone" class="if uuid-2244361" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64128/2244361.jpg"></div><p>  The product range is very diverse.  It presents not only clothing for men and women collections, but also an impressively large selection of children's accessories.  There are also necessary accessories: gloves, umbrellas, bags, shoes, hair ornaments, belts.  In the store you can not only dress up, but also buy gifts for your friends by choosing things that suit them. </p><p>  Shoes are designed according to special design projects of excellent quality.  Most shoe models use natural, breathable materials. </p><h2>  Shop Addresses </h2><p>  The company does not have a multi-channel, widely available regional phone in Moscow at s.Oliver stores.  You can only get through the administration of the direct tenant. </p><p>  Addresses of s.Oliver stores in Moscow (shopping centers): MEGA Belaya Dacha, Pike, City on Ryazanka, Budapest, Clouds, Sokolniki, Motes, Golden Babylon (Avenue Mira), Golden Babylon (Otradnoe), Rublevsky, Zvezdochka, Holding Center (m.
