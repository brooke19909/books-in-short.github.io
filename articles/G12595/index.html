You are interested in various offers and you are visited by the thought of how to make sure that you are not refused a loan. </p><p>  Each person has his own situation, so the nature of these fears can be very different.  Someone has a <span>bad credit history.</span>  Someone gets a good salary, but in an envelope.  And someone takes a loan for the first time and simply does not imagine how to fill out bank forms. </p><p>  The following tips will help you figure out what to do in order not to be denied a loan. </p><h2>  1. Choose an organization that suits your situation. </h2><p>  There is an unwritten rule in the lending market: the easier it is to get a loan, the higher the <span>interest rate.</span>  For us, the fact itself is not important, but the reason why this happens.  The rate is greater, the greater the degree of risk from the point of view of the bank.  The bank understands risk in a peculiar way.  The more certificates and papers you have confirming your solvency, the less danger the bank sees and the lower the rate. </p><p>  Hence the first conclusion: evaluate your opportunity to open in front of a creditor.  You work "in white", you are ready to provide 2-NDFL, copies of labor and other certificates - go to large banks and do not be afraid of anything - the chances of getting a loan are very high.  If you need problems and money urgently, look for organizations that are ready to issue <noindex>  <span>quick loan without inquiries</span> </noindex>  . </p><h2>  2. Fill out the questionnaire like a car </h2><p>  You came to the bank and were asked to fill out a questionnaire.  Keep in mind that clerks have dozens and hundreds of such profiles.  They are very fond of when the information in them is indicated as clearly as possible on the case.  Moreover, first of all, the application is checked by a computer program. </p><p>  Therefore, write everything in the official "reporting" language.  You work in - "LLC Such-and-such".  Income: XXX rubles / month.  Pay particular attention to the purpose of the loan.  It is better to write that it is taken to purchase some durable goods.  The questionnaire is not a place for creativity.  Lyric applications can be rejected automatically.  In the same way, applications with insignificant errors or typos from the point of view of a person, but critical for a computer, can end up in the basket. </p><h2>  3. Write authentically, do not hide anything </h2><p>  A lot of people try to hide information about their bad credit history.  Some even embark on fraud with fake passports.  Such cases only amuse the bank security service. </p><p>  If the bank aims to verify you properly, he will easily find information in <span>the credit bureaus</span> and in other places that you do not even suspect.  If you had problems in the past, but they are already behind, it‚Äôs better to explain it to a <span>bank employee.</span>  Along with this, provide documentary evidence of your current solvency. </p><p>  On the other hand, you may not need to describe anything.  Remember point 1?  Issuing organizations <noindex>  <span>credit per hour without information</span> </noindex>  often not at all interested in your sources of income. </p><p>  * * * </p><p>  So, we hope that these tips helped you decide what to do so that you do not refuse a loan and give confidence before going to the bank.  Finally, we advise you to carefully read everything that you sign, as well as be sure to calculate the full cost of the loan.  Do not borrow so that payments are more than 40% of your monthly income.  This will protect you from the debt hole. </p></div></article>
