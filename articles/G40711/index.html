To do this, cut one sleeve along the armhole.  On the other side of the T-shirt, mark the point on the lower edge of the armhole and connect it with a smooth line with the first strap, cut it off.  We get a pattern with a shoulder strap on one shoulder.  We cut the strap and sew the plastic ring, connecting both parts.  The cut line will be processed on the overlock.  We got a new model from an old thing. </p><p>  From the top and several t-shirts, you can make a summer dress.  From the t-shirts we cut the bottom, sew the canvas of the skirt from them, combining color and shape.  Then we sew this skirt to the top. </p><h2>  Child's world </h2><p>  We sew to children from old things.  The photo shows what wonderful things can happen. </p><p>  From the top of the jeans you can make a fashionable mini-skirt for the girl.  To do this, cut off the legs, and on the bottom we make a fringe. </p><p>  From an old stretched sweater, you can sew a dress for a girl with a short sleeve.  To do this, fold the sweater in half, cut out the shelves.  From the sleeves cut off the bottom with an elastic band.  We carefully sew in the armhole.  We sew seams. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The long sleeves of an old T-shirt can be great leggings for a girl.  To do this, we bend along the cut line, insert the elastic, the top can be decorated at your discretion. </p><p>  From an old children's coat you can make a fashionable vest.  We evaporate the sleeves and with a soft drape we sew the neck, armholes, from it we also make straps for fastening. </p><p>  From the pockets of old jeans you will get an elegant children's handbag.  To do this, take two pockets and sew them together.  You can make one compartment or two or three.  It depends on how to sew the top.  The pocket must be cut out with the fabric to which it is sewn.  The fabric is cut one or two centimeters more than a pocket, and then fringe is made from this part.  On the front side of the bag you can make an applique.  The handle of the bag is made from the side seam of the leg, it can also be decorated with a fringe. </p>

    <h2>  Alteration Ideas </h2><p>  We sew new ones from old things.  If the <span>t-shirt for the girl is</span> in good condition, but has become short, then you can make a contrasting color insert at the bottom and decorate the top of the shirt with a catchy element from the same material (it can be, for example, a butterfly or a flower). </p><p>  If the jeans for the girl are short, they can be lengthened with multi-colored braid. </p><p>  We sew a <span>fashionable bracelet</span> ourselves from old things.  For him, we need the remainder of denim, thread, needle, awl, beads, thin elastic.  From the fabric we cut a rectangle 5 cm wide and 20-25 cm long. Along the entire length on both sides we make a fringe 1 cm wide. With an awl we pierce holes in the material.  We assemble the bracelet on an elastic band as follows: we make two or three folds, then a bead.  Thus we do all the work.  Sew the ends of the fabric. </p><p>  From scraps of <span>denim,</span> an original apron is obtained.  Pockets can be of a different color, this will add unusualness to the product. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="We sew from old things.

    <h2>  For children </h2><p>  We sew a pillow for children from old things and make an original glass for pencils. </p><p>  We cut out a circle from old jeans and add details: ears from the same material, eyes and a nose from buttons, you can sew a bow.  The head of a bear, pig or owl is ready.  It will make a wonderful pillow cover for the nursery. </p>

    <p>  From old tights we sew a snake pillow.  For her, you will need several tights of the same size, from which we cut off the lower part and the top.  Then we sew the cooked pieces together.  At one end, we make the head of a snake, with buttons, we designate eyes.  Then we evenly stuff the padding polyester, sew the other end.  We twist the snake into a ring and fasten it together.  The result was an original pillow. </p><p>  To prevent the child from throwing pencils, we will weave him an unusual glass.  You will need a sleeve from toilet paper, glue and cut out seams from jeans.  First, glue the bottom with thick paper, then glue strips of denim to the bottom of it and close it with another circle of paper.  If you raise the strips up, they should be approximately two centimeters apart.  Now we circle the cup in a circle, arranging the horizontal stripes in a checkerboard pattern.  At the top we glue the edging. </p><h2>  Practical hobby </h2><p>  When we sew new ones from old things, this allows us not only to take our free time, but also significantly save the family budget. </p><p>  Of course, these things sometimes turn out to be far from perfect, and it‚Äôs not always possible to go out into them.  Another thing is important here.  It attracts the opportunity to realize their bold fantasies, to combine something, to try. </p><p>  As for children's clothing, rework here will save a lot of money.  And it‚Äôs easier to sew baby clothes. </p><p>  We sew simple and bright models from old things.  The photos of some of them presented in this article are proof of how interesting and practical this hobby is. </p>
