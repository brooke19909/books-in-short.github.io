It is understandable, because it is possible to save space and make the room very stylish.  Most often, such equipment is purchased for the kitchen, because it is there that various household appliances should be located.  One such appliance may be a washing machine with a removable top cover.  It is specially designed to fit in the kitchen and save space.  But there are several types of such machines.  We will analyze their best models. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.williams-electrical.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine with removable top cover" class="if uuid-3027102" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3027102.jpg"></div><h2>  Types of built-in washing machines </h2><p>  There are several types of built-in washing machines.  They are not particularly different from each other, but there are some differences.  That is why they were distinguished into separate species.  And that's why you need to consider them. </p><ul><li>  Fully integrated machines.  These include devices that are fully integrated in a cabinet or cabinet and even have special curtains for securing doors.  These cars can be completely hidden in a curbstone. </li><li>  Machines under the countertop.  In this case, the front of the washing machine remains visible.  Just instead of the top cover, a countertop is installed.  This design is the most common. </li></ul><p>  It is worth noting that many recommend a washing machine with a removable top cover, which is fully integrated into a cabinet or cabinet.  These devices are much less noisy and vibrate, since they are completely covered by the doors of the cabinet.  But in this review we will consider various models of cars.  Among them will be both representatives of the first type, and the second. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.northlondonappliancerepairs.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ariston washing machine with removable top cover" class="if uuid-3027111" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3027111.jpg"></div><h2>  Bosch WIS 24140 </h2><p>  This washing machine belongs to the class of economical devices.  And it has special mounts for installing curtains on both sides of the case.  Bosch washing machines with a removable top cover are extremely reliable.  Because they are so popular.  Specifically, this model has leakage protection (and full), a special design of the legs (which dampens vibration) and the presence of an inverter motor.  The latter is much quieter than the classic and much more reliable.  You can load 7 kilograms of things into this washing machine.  The maximum speed of the drum during the spin cycle is 1200 rpm.  This is quite enough for high-quality extraction.  There is also a very informative LCD display.  The control of the machine is intelligent, electronic.  There are as many as 18 programs.  True, this car is a little expensive.  But you must pay for a quality German product. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gumtree.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bosch washing machines with removable top cover" class="if uuid-3027106" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3027106.jpg"></div><h2>  Bosch WIS 24140 Reviews </h2><p>  What do users say about this washing machine with a removable top cover?  Reviews about her are extremely positive.  Still, this is Bosch.  Almost all owners note an unusually low noise level.  She is almost inaudible at work.  Only when spinning does a slight buzz appears.  And if you close the cabinet door, then it will not be heard.  Also, all users note the extremely successful design of the legs.  There is no vibration at all.  But only on condition that the machine is installed correctly.  And in order to be sure of this, it is better to entrust this work to a professional.  Then there will be no problems with the machine.  As for the quality of washing, there are also no complaints.  Users note that things are erased perfectly.  And after pressing them, it takes only half an hour to dry.  However, it's time to consider other models.  They are even more interesting than the product from Bosch. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.businesswire.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="removing the top cover of the washing machine" class="if uuid-3027123" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3027123.jpg"></div><h2>  Electrolux EWG 147540 W </h2><p>  In fact, we have before us the twin brother of the previous ‚ÄúBosch‚Äù.  Even the design is very similar.  There are also special mounts for curtains.  And this means that this washing machine with a removable top cover is fully integrated.  The machine has a very robust body and excellent reliability.  All the same <span>inverter motor is</span> installed here <span>.</span>  Here are just the number of revolutions during the spin cycle increased to 1400 revolutions per minute.  Excellent result.  You can load 7 kilograms of dirty laundry into this washing machine.  There are special programs for washing wool, delicate fabrics, down jackets, sportswear and shoes, among other things.  There is a special protection against leaks and an option to save energy.  The machine runs very quietly and perfectly suppresses vibration.  The number of washing programs is 18. But this miracle of technology is cheaper than the previous ‚ÄúBosch‚Äù. </p><div class="photo" data-original="picclick.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to remove the top cover of the washing machine" class="if uuid-3027119" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3027119.jpg"></div><h2>  Electrolux EWG 147540 W reviews </h2><p>  Those who purchased this washing machine are very pleased with the purchase.  They say that the car is definitely worth the money and works very well.  Particularly pleased users that the removal of the top cover of the washing machine is very easy.  She is not even bolted to the body.  A detailed removal algorithm is described in the instructions.  And it even has a normal Russian language.  Which also can not but rejoice.  As for the other features of the washer, here the owners are unanimous: its technical characteristics completely coincide with the declared ones.  The machine works very quietly and almost does not vibrate.  And for built-in appliances this is very important.  The washing quality of this machine is excellent.  She is able to cope with the most difficult pollution.  And especially users were pleased that there are special modes for washing various types of fabrics.  And there is even a special mode for shoes.  Great universal washing machine for the home.  Many users recommend buying it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="newsmart.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="removable top washing machine reviews" class="if uuid-3027137" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3027137.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotpoint-Ariston ARSF 105 S </h2><p>  Ariston washing machine with removable top cover.  Made in the best traditions of the company.  But co-authored with Hotpoint.  As Ariston itself does not produce built-in appliances.  There are no special mounts for installing curtains.  So, the car belongs to the class "under the countertop."  The maximum load of this washing machine is 5 kilograms.  Not much.  The maximum spin speed is 1000 rpm.  Not a very impressive indicator.  But the machine has an impressive number of programs for washing (18) and partial protection against leaks.  But not complete.  There are also modes for washing delicate fabrics, down jackets and sportswear.  But there is no damping option.  And the machine consumes too much water.  Nevertheless, many buy this model, since it costs a penny.  Yes, and this washing machine looks attractive.  But it should be so if it cannot be covered by a cabinet door. </p><div class="photo" data-original="balconyelectronics.tumblr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine with removable top cover" class="if uuid-3027131" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3027131.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotpoint-Ariston ARSF 105 S reviews </h2><p>  Those who bought this washing machine are not so few.  And they leave exhaustive comments about her work.  The first thing that users did not like was the instruction.  If you are guided by it, then it is completely unclear how to remove the top cover of the washing machine.  The owners also note that this washing machine is very loud.  And to reduce the noise level is not possible.  Still would.  A drum with a classic engine is also installed here.  And there is no damping option.  As for the quality of washing, then this is all right.  But some users are not happy that after spinning things are too wet.  And this is because the speed is only 1000. </p><p>  Another feature that the owners did not like was the lack of a full display for displaying information.  Instead, some kind of calculator.  The owners were also not happy with the lack of a regime for saving energy and water.  But in modern realities this is very important.  In general, this washing machine is recommended for purchase only if there is not enough money for anything else.  If finances are not limited, then it is better to choose something more adequate.  For example, Bosch or Electrolux.  And it is better to refrain from buying this "Ariston".  And if you like the company so much, then it has other models.  More advanced. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we examined the best washing machines with a removable top cover.  They belong to the class of built-in appliances and have some features inherent in just such devices.  The best in this class are washing machines from Bosch and Electrolux.  But the model from "Ariston" (considered as part of this review) was not impressive.  However, it is up to the user to decide which model is suitable specifically for him.  We can only recommend it.  And nothing more.  In any case, there are many other models of built-in washing machines on the market. </p>
