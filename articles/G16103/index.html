Walt Disney, who dreamed of a magical realm with a lot of attractions, was happy when a fabulous country created for the whole family opened its doors to visitors.  Since then, <span>theme parks have</span> spread all over the globe, and prudently build comfortable hotels nearby, because it takes several days to get around a completely amazing place. </p><h2>  Man-made tale for the little ones in Belek </h2><p>  Today, the story will be dedicated to Disneyland in Turkey, whose charm is that it attracts not only impressionable children, but also their parents, who forget about their age.  The local leisure industry is striking in its desire to please even the most demanding tourist. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Disneyland Turkey Belek" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2052609.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Last summer, 30 kilometers from Antalya, in the resort town of Belek, a theme park called The Land of Legends opened.  This is the largest fairy-tale world in <span>Turkey, the area of</span> which is 63 thousand hectares.  The pride of the country was designed by the famous company Emaar, which built the tallest skyscraper in the world - resembling a stalagmite tower in Dubai.  A well-known world-famous director Franco Dragone staged an enchanting show, starting at night.  It is not surprising that the park‚Äôs budget, the construction of which took place in several stages, amounted to more than one billion dollars. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the territory where Disneyland in Turkey is located, there is a huge water park, many slides and attractions, an underwater safari, a special lounge area with restaurants for every taste, a shopping area with boutiques of famous brands. </p><h2>  Leisure park and luxury hotel </h2><p>  The Land of Legends is not only the largest leisure park, but also a five-star hotel with a unique concept and high level of service.  More reminiscent of a fabulous palace, it is designed for younger guests.  A huge building with columns, towers and marble statues of chariots is a real delight.  It is curious that visitors who live on the <span>Antalya coast</span> in one of the five hotels owned by the chain do not pay for an admission ticket to Disneyland in Turkey (Belek), which combines all aspects of leisure.  They can at least every day immerse themselves in a magical world open to the general public. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dreamland" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2052608.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The first acquaintance with the building owned by the vast empire of Rixos Hotels, which hosts guests throughout the year, will confuse even sophisticated travelers.  Like a museum complex in Paris, it delights in its architecture and interior.  However, this is not the most interesting! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Fairy kingdom for kids </h2><p>  The whole kingdom, addressed to curious children, is designed so that the child feels like a special guest.  The baby is happy to plunge into the magical atmosphere of amazing fantasies and real adventures.  The unique design of the hotel is impressive: instead of the chandelier, colorful lollipops hang, <span>balloons</span> are scattered on the floors <span>,</span> walls are hung with cartoon portraits, crooked mirrors talk to visitors who see plush noses or ears in their reflection. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where is Disneyland in Turkey" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2052605.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Of course, the new Disneyland in Turkey is intended for families, but first of all for the smallest.  Everything is done here to please the children: surprises await them at every corner, and spending time in beautiful rooms with design based on fairy tales is a real pleasure for them.  Rooms reminiscent of a child‚Äôs dream room are equipped with game systems and dual-screen TVs that children can watch with their parents.  It is worth wearing special glasses, and no one will quarrel about which gear to choose. </p><h2>  Adventure begin </h2><p>  But the main surprise awaits everyone in the fresh air, in the interior of the hotel.  The huge complex, designed for relaxation, was invented for the sole purpose - to make the fairy tale a reality.  Water Disneyland in Turkey, which is a new generation entertainment center, is inhabited by fantastic heroes whose images were invented specifically for him. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  A visit to a wonderful place where everything is saturated with an atmosphere of happiness is the beginning of the most incredible adventures. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="New Disneyland in Turkey" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2052602.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Water World Zone (Legend of Aqua) </h2><p>  The territory of Disneyland in Turkey (Belek), striking in its scope, is divided into several zones, which are designed based on different fairy tales.  Snow-white beaches with evergreen palm trees transfer to exotic islands.  An incredible amount of rides and a pool with artificial waves will appeal to young visitors who dive into the warm water with delight.  Older children who want to test their strength turn into experienced surfers, curbing the elements, or slide down from high speed slides. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="disneyland in turkey" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2052627.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Tired, but happy kids go on an exciting adventure on the ship, and lovers of extreme relaxation - on an unusual walk See Treck, which is the highlight of the theme park.  All comers, dressed in a special helmet that allows you to breathe underwater, get acquainted with the rich underwater world, full of special charm, and its curious inhabitants. </p><h2>  Zoo </h2><p>  On the territory of Disneyland in Turkey there is a large zoo where each guest will personally meet the cute penguins, watch the magnificent tigers, swim with cute dolphins accompanied by an instructor.  And children over 10 years old can go down to a depth of 4 meters and feed the fish.  Such an unusual adventure lasts about half an hour. </p><h2>  Evening show </h2><p>  A handmade fairy tale created for the smallest comes to life when evening comes.  New colorful performances taking place at Disneyland in Turkey captivate guests so much that they feel they are the main characters of amazing fantasies.  It seems that the director of the popular circus Du Soleil, who staged a magical performance, surpassed himself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Disneyland Turkey Belek prices" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2052603.jpg"></div>

    <p>  At exactly 9 p.m., the show, memorable for a lifetime, begins, unimaginable in scope of action.  Millions of soap bubbles fill the territory of a fabulous corner.  The working fountains designed by F. Dragon are part of a vibrant and vibrant show.  Acting as scenery, they revive real masterpieces consisting of water, light and sound. </p><p>  Gondolas float through Venetian channels, the characters of which resemble the strange characters of the medieval artist I. Bosch, who combined in his works the features of science fiction and folklore.  This is an amazing performance, causing indescribable sensations. </p><h2>  Disneyland in Turkey (Belek): prices </h2><p>  Entrance to the theme park is $ 55 for an adult and $ 35 for a child (except for guests of Rixos hotels who visit the complex for free). </p><p>  If we talk about the cost of living, then this is an expensive pleasure: for parents and a child the room will cost $ 250 per day, for an adult and baby - $ 130. </p><h2>  Disneyland (Turkey): reviews </h2><p>  Tourists enthusiastically respond about the promenade filled with people, allowing you to immerse yourself in street life.  Funny performances of artists, music concerts, various festivals leave no one indifferent. </p><p>  Adult visitors turning into young children are enthusiastic about the most trendy theme park restaurant.  A magnificent hall and a huge aquarium in which sea predators swim are fenced off with transparent glass, and dining guests with a bated breath watch the approaching sharks. </p><p>  According to travelers who have fallen into a fabulous country, the variety of holiday formats is beyond description, but here you can easily find a secluded place to relax and unwind in silence. </p>

    <p>  A decent response to the American ‚ÄúDisneyland‚Äù is not associated with Mickey Mouse - the main character in the fairy tales of the animated cartoon artist.  Despite this, the journey that visitors to the amusement park embark on is forever remembered as one of the most vivid memories. </p>
