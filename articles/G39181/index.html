  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Holidays at sea - in Russia or abroad?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Probably imagine a more pleasant time of the year than the <span>period of vacation is</span> impossible.  Especially if this vacation turned out to be spent in the summer - during the hot season, when everyone strives to distant countries in order to organize a rest at sea for themselves and their family.  Why vacation at sea?  The answer is obvious - the sea coast is always fresh air, excellent sunny weather, gentle cool water and, of course, a well-developed tourist infrastructure. </p><p>  Holidays at sea in its best form should take place on the territory of any country abroad.  Unfortunately, the infrastructure of the resorts of our state, in most cases, "does not reach" the level of similar representatives abroad.  In addition, the service and the level of service can by no means be considered satisfactory in all cases.  And this despite the fact that the cost of recreation at resorts located in our country is often at the same level as in countries abroad. </p><p>  Nevertheless, you can find a place to spend your holidays at sea without leaving the country.  It should not be forgotten that due to the diversity of natural landscapes, the wonderful combination, as well as the natural uniqueness of many of the territories - plains, mountain ranges covered with eternal snows, or succulent subtropical greenery, aquatic azure, which is given by the Black and Azov Seas, unique mineral springs with healing water and resorts with healing mud ... All of this and much more can give a rest at sea in the Krasnodar Territory, which has no analogues in all of Russia. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The territory of the Krasnodar Territory occupies a vast area exceeding 76 thousand square kilometers.  This territory is located in the southern corner of the European part of the Russian Federation, occupies the northwestern part of the Greater Caucasus (heights reach 3256 meters above sea level).  In the south-west this wonderful place is washed by the waters of the Black Sea, and the north-west makes it possible to enjoy the view of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov, as well as the <span>Kerch Strait.</span> </p><p>  The Krasnodar Territory is characterized by a rather variable climate - from temperate continental to subtropical.  The temperature here is never too low - even in January, it ranges from - 4 degrees on the plains to +5 degrees on the seashore.  In July, the <span>average temperature</span> is + 22- ... + 24 degrees Celsius.  The mountains also do not meet their guests with cold - in January the temperature is on average 8 degrees, and in the summer in July it is up to 18 degrees.  These data are for a height of 2200 meters.  In the highlands are eternal glaciers. </p><p>  Holidays at sea in the Krasnodar Territory is the most popular <span>holiday destination</span> among our fellow citizens.  Here tourists can take advantage of many hiking, horseback, water, and transport tourist routes.  The main resort areas include cities represented by Sochi, Anapa, Gelendzhik, Yeisk, Hot Key, Tuapse, Temryuk.  Very developed modern sanatoriums of the region provide an opportunity not only to have a great rest, but also to improve health - this is where many diseases are treated.  In addition to the professionalism of medical personnel, the unique nature of this place contributes to speedy healing. </p><p>  It doesn‚Äôt matter for what reason they choose a vacation at sea without leaving the country - in any case, this makes it possible to save.  If you spend a large amount on vacation there is no way, last-minute trips to the sea, as well as last-minute tours to the sea, will help - a great opportunity often provided by many travel companies.  In addition, often on the market offers pop up with significant discounts when buying tickets for a certain number of people, etc. </p><p>  Relax on the sea, give yourself and your family an unforgettable vacation, give pleasure, gain strength and improve your health! </p>
