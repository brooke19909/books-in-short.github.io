What is this number and what are its conditions? </p><h2>  How to translate Junior Suites </h2><p>  Many have heard about the variety of Junior Suite, but few people know the translation of this phrase.  Translated literally, these words will sound like ‚ÄúJunior Suite‚Äù.  Some people call these rooms simply ‚Äúsuites,‚Äù not Junior suites.  What does it mean?  The fact is that suites is a certain hierarchy of numbers in which there are several varieties of them.  One of these is the Junior Suites.  What is this step in this peculiar hierarchy?  A room with this name is considered the lowest level among all suites.  It differs from others mainly only in size, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe room is 20-25 square meters.  m </p><h2>  What is Junior Suites </h2><p>  Junior Suites are a superior room.  Most often, this number is a fairly spacious room.  The berth in it can be fenced off from the rest of the space.  In general, such a room resembles a room of a category called De Luxe.

Many people choose this category of rooms because of the very comfortable conditions.

Secondly, there is air conditioning, which is extremely important for any vacationer, especially in hot countries.

The ceilings in these rooms are perfectly flat, and can be suspended.  Wallpaper is mostly plain or have some discreet patterns, sometimes with sparkles.  The beds in them are usually wide, but not high, made from noble species of wood.  On the beds you can always see expensive bedding and soft pillows, of which there are several.  An expensive parquet or linoleum is laid on the floor, sometimes it is covered with carpets.  The curtains in the rooms are quite dense and to the floor.
