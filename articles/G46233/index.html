  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hissing microphone: causes and solutions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Quite often, PC users face a problem when the microphone hisses.  There are actually not many reasons why this happens, and all of them can be listed literally on the fingers of one hand.  This is what this article will be devoted to.  In addition to analyzing the causes themselves, we will also talk about how you can fix problems and bring the microphone to normal. </p><h2>  Bad contact </h2><p>  The first reason the microphone hisses is due to poor contact when connected.  Yes, no matter how trite it may sound, but the plug in the connector may not be fully connected, resulting in a hiss. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mightyape.co.nz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the microphone hisses due to poor contact" class="if uuid-2534251" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2534251.jpg"></div><p>  Sometimes a bad contact appears due to the fact that the connector for connection is ‚Äúloose‚Äù, and the plug there seems to ‚Äúhang out‚Äù.  This also leads to the formation of noise and hiss. </p><p>  Solving a problem is not always easy.  If, for example, the plug is not fully inserted, then it is quite simple to fix, but if the connector inside is ‚Äúloose‚Äù, it will be difficult to bend the contacts.  It is quite possible that you had to re-solder the connector to a new one. </p><h2>  High sensitivity </h2><p>  Why can a microphone hiss?  The second reason is incorrect gain and sensitivity settings.  As a rule, few users generally pay attention to these settings when connecting a microphone, but in vain.  It is sensitivity and amplification that are responsible for how loud the microphone will work and at what distance it will pick up sounds.  Of course, on the one hand, these are useful settings, but on the other, they are responsible for the appearance of an unpleasant hum, hiss, crackles and other extraneous sounds on the recording. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="microphone hisses due to incorrect sensitivity settings" class="if uuid-2534246" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2534246.jpg"></div><p>  In order to fix this problem, you need to perform a few simple steps: </p><ol><li>  In the system tray (bottom right) next to the clock there is an icon in the form of a speaker.  You need to right-click on it and select "Recording Devices" from the drop-down menu. </li><li>  In the window that appears, you must select the connected microphone, also right-click on it and select "Properties". </li><li>  In another window that appears, you must go to the tab "Levels".  There will be 2 sliders - ‚ÄúMicrophone‚Äù and ‚ÄúAmplification‚Äù.  The second item can immediately be set to 0, but with the parameter ‚ÄúMicrophone‚Äù you will need to ‚Äúplay around‚Äù.  The value must be set independently, until the hissing and extraneous noise disappear. </li></ol><h2>  Invalid format </h2><p>  Incorrect recording format is also one of the reasons why the microphone hisses.  It may seem that a higher quality value will only benefit the microphone, but it is not.  Practice shows that the higher the recording format, the more extraneous sounds and noises appear. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="microphone hisses due to incorrect recording format" class="if uuid-2534249" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2534249.jpg"></div><p>  You can fix the problem in just a minute.  You need to do all the same actions as in the previous paragraph, only instead of the tab ‚ÄúLevels‚Äù you should go to the last one - ‚ÄúAdditions‚Äù.  There from the drop-down list it is necessary to set the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù format, in which there will be no hiss.  This is usually one of the first three formats. </p><h2>  Sound card settings </h2><p>  Well, the last <span>reason why the</span> microphone <span>hisses</span> is the wrong settings in the sound card settings.  If all of the above methods do not help to remove hissing, then the problem lies in the ‚Äúsound‚Äù settings.  Usually, all sound cards have a separate driver and special software for managing and setting settings.  The default settings are not always correct, so the microphone may appear strange sounds. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="microphone hissing due to sound card settings" class="if uuid-2534248" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2534248.jpg"></div><p>  What should I do if the microphone hisses due to incorrect sound card settings?  Fix them!  To do this, go to the system tray and find the application for a sound card there.  It is usually called Realtek.  Next, with a double click, open the application. </p><p>  In the window that appears, you should immediately go to the microphone settings section.  There will be a slider responsible for adjusting the recording volume.  It‚Äôs with his settings that he will have to experiment until hissing, background and other sounds disappear.  It is also recommended to check the boxes opposite the ‚ÄúEcho and noise suppression‚Äù parameters. </p>
