    <p>  Of the shortcomings, a large bet is allocated.  If a large amount is required, it is better to collect documents, because then you can find an offer with a low percentage.  For new customers, the bank does not risk issuing large amounts without inquiries. </p><p>  The downside is the low probability of approval of the application.  Lenders inspect all customers.  Even solvents may be refused for some other reason.  Therefore, to arrange such loans or not, everyone decides for himself.  The main thing is that they be received on reasonable terms. </p>
