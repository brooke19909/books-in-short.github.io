    <p>  The centuries-old Seliger - where this lake is located, there once was a huge glacier.  It was a long time ago, 65 thousand years ago.  The glacier, plowing the bed, moved south, taking away everything that only clung to it;  in places he left ridges of stones, sand.  When it finally melted, there was no even surface in the area.  Rows of hills stretch from the north-west and southeast, the hill formed here, which is now called Valdai.  The highest point (346 meters) is located beyond <span>the Tsna River,</span> fifty kilometers from the lake.  To get to the mountain very close, you have to walk several kilometers.  The depressions formed in the area by the glacier eventually filled with water, and many lakes formed.  The largest are Seliger and <span>Ilmen.</span>  Seliger <span>Lake</span> on the map of Russia is quite simple to find, because it is located in the central part of the country. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In history, Seliger is mentioned in the chronicles of the 12th century.  The name of the lake then was slightly different - Sereger, from Finnish it translates as "lake above a hill."  However, many scientists are still debating the origin of the name of the lake. </p><h2>  Legend of seliger </h2>
