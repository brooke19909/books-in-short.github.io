However, this is not entirely true.  There are many versions of how the Slavs looked.  The theme of their appearance is very interesting, so it deserves a more detailed study. </p><h2>  Slavic tribes </h2><p>  Slavs have lived since ancient times in the central part of Europe, in the Carpathian region and on the <span>Balkan Peninsula.</span>  According to one version, advancement to the eastern part takes place between the 5th and 7th centuries of our era.  If you listen to another, you can hear the version that in Eastern Europe the Slavs were as the <span>indigenous inhabitants of</span> this part of Europe.  There were three large groups: eastern, western and southern.  Pagan beliefs determined not only the spirituality of the Slavs, but also their appearance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what did the Slavs look like" class="if" height="466" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23212/702537.jpg" width="336"></div>

    <p>  What the Eastern Slavs looked like is impossible to say for sure.  A huge number of tribes lived on this territory.  These are such as Vyatichi, Volhynians, Krivichi, Radimichi, Croats, Polotsk residents and many others.  Each of them had its own characteristic features.  Among the general ones, one can note the fact that the clothes did not have complex details, but the external design was always under special attention.  Various patterns, ornaments, figures were embroidered on the fabrics.  For decorations used <span>temporal rings of</span> various types.  On their feet they wore bast shoes.  Spacious linen shirts were worn under outer clothing.  The richer the man, the more clothes he wore.  The differences could consist in the color of the preferred fabric, the size, shape and number of decorations, methods of weaving bast shoes.  We can definitely say that the way the ancient Slavs looked was influenced by the surrounding nature, life and lifestyle of the tribes, as well as their neighbors - Scythians and Sarmatians. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Is there any similarity with the Vikings? </h2><p>  Some historians categorically reject the image that appears to us in the form of a long-haired man and with a beard.  This is less like what the ancient Slavs looked like, and more consistent with the Vikings. </p><p>  In their opinion, the Slavs opposed <span>cutting hair</span> on their heads and shaving their beards. <br>  The Scandinavians took such an appearance from religious traditions.  The Slavs in those days lived on the Baltic coast.  Unlike the Vikings, they carefully shaved and cut their hair very shortly over the entire head, leaving a forelock on their forehead.  And with long hair wise men walked.  The appearance of the Scandinavian men Slavs ridiculed.  What the Slavs looked like, scientists are trying to determine by the found skeletons.  Thanks to these finds, it is possible for descendants to get acquainted with jewelry, clothes and accessories that were used by the ancient Slavs.  Similarity with Scandinavian outfits is observed in women's hair ornaments and headdresses. </p><h2>  Appearance of Slavic women </h2>

    <p>  At all times, Slavic women used layered clothing.  And for each event different costumes were intended.  Appearance also depended on the age of the woman.  A wide-sleeved shirt was always worn on the body.  The closer to our time, the more the appearance of the Slavs was filled with luxury.  Clothing became more diverse.  The head was covered with various clothes.  From ribbons to hats of an unusual shape.  Women adorned the outfits with beads, which were bright and fell on their chest in several rows.  All clothes were long, almost to their heels.  She was decorated with sewn ribbons, small ruffles and braid.  They also liked to wear large earrings and rings. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Men's Slavic Costume </h2><p>  Men put on long shirts - vests.  They were smelled and girdled with a belt.  The shirts had no fasteners; some of them were worn on top.  Winter clothes were made from the fur of various animals.  These are sheepskin coats and mittens.  The pants were wide, they were tied up at the waist and at the bottom.  Wealthy people had several such pants.  In winter, woolen were worn on canvas.  Shoes for men and women were made from canvas.  They wrapped their legs and fastened the sole with straps.  The boots were made from a whole piece of leather. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what did the Slavs look like in antiquity" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23212/702536.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <p>  All clothes had embroidery.  Over time, it became more and more. </p><h2>  Hairstyles of the ancient Slavs </h2><p>  Hair and hairstyles occupied a special place in the life of the ancient Slavs.  By hairstyle, one could judge the social status of a person.  Cut hair ritually, following traditions.  It was necessary to do this at a certain period of life.  The boys did not grow long hair and cut their hair often enough. </p>

    <p>  Girls needed to <span>braid pigtails.</span>  For this reason, they were grown, diligently followed them, caring with the help of plant components.  Girls wore one or two braids. </p><p>  Boys, growing up, grew a longer forelock.  The rest of the head was cut very short.  Chub - it was a special attribute.  The young man was proud of him, sometimes spinning.  Adult men most often wore a "circle" haircut.  It is also called "under the pot."  It was with the help of this attribute that a similar hairstyle was made.  For the Eastern Slavs, this was also generally accepted. </p><p>  What the Slavs looked like is impossible to say for sure.  One thing is certain: their clothes were comfortable and spacious, regardless of era. </p>
