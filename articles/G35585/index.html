For this reason, old models ceased to be produced, and they gradually began to leave the shelves.  But not all models were waiting for such an end, and the hero of today's review is on their list.  So, welcome, HTC Incredible S - a gadget that lasted more than three years and all this time was in demand in the market.  What is so attractive about this smartphone?  Let's look at it in more detail and give an answer to this question. </p>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  At first glance, this smartphone is no different from other models.  In front, everything, like everyone else: a display, soft keys and a speaker with a light sensor.  But it is worth turning it around with its backside, when such a stir immediately becomes clear.  The fact is that the cover has not only a rubberized base with Soft Touch coating, but also an unusual shape.  On the plane, you can clearly see the huge SIM card squeezed out.  This solution significantly refreshed the design, while the ergonomics of use did not suffer at all.  Smartphone HTC Incredible S key layout features is standard.  Here, everything, like all models of this manufacturer: </p><ul><li>  the shutdown and lock button is located on the upper edge, next to it is a headphone jack; </li><li>  the right rib is completely freed from all sockets and buttons; </li><li>  the left edge has a volume control button and a microUSB connector for synchronizing with a computer and connecting to an adapter; </li><li>  the bottom, except for the microphone hole, has nothing more. </li></ul><p>  The back cover sits firmly and does not give any backlashes.  This is a little confusing, and some sources even mention the solidity of the HTC Incredible S case, prices, description, the characteristics of which we are considering today. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Display </h2><p>  As the <span>output</span> and input <span>device</span> in this smartphone uses a display with a diagonal of 4 inches.  A fairly sensitive capacitive sensor and perfectly adjusted screen sizes allow you to clearly hit the selected object. </p><p>  Screen HTC Incredible S specifications has good.  The first thing is a very good resolution.  Pixelization can only be viewed from a very close distance.  I was very pleased with the feature of touch soft keys.  When locked, they go out, and if you turn the smartphone in a horizontal orientation, these buttons will also make a U-turn.  As for brightness, everything is fine here.  A new matrix at that time perfectly conveys the image in bright sunlight. </p><p>  As for viewing angles, here they are the maximum possible.  When you change the tilt of the smartphone there is a slight flashing, but with further movement it immediately disappears. </p>

    <h2>  Performance and hardware </h2><p>  The "filling" of the smartphone, as was evident from the technical specifications, is not very powerful.  But she is the most stable.  Maybe for this reason, HTC still runs on single-core processors, while its competitors have long moved to more powerful four- and eight-core processors.  It is worth noting that they consume a lot more charge, which negatively affects the battery life.  RAM, although it has a small amount, but it is enough for a quick system response. </p><p>  As for productivity, everything here is at the middle class level.  Graphics, processor and data transfer speed are at the height of the smartphone.  It is worth noting that the filling here is much better than that of HTC Wildfire S. The description of the phone also demonstrates a significantly larger display in the model under consideration.  For comparison, the photo. </p>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  At the time when the HTC Incredible S appeared, the characteristics of the cameras on all devices were not very pleased.  Naturally, there were gadgets with a huge number of pixels, but they had a very high price.  The smartphone in question has an external camera with an 8 megapixel sensor.  Also, autofocus is used to create the highest quality pictures.  The flash allows you to take photos and shoot videos at night. </p>

    <h2>  Battery and battery life </h2><p>  Modern smartphones, of course, have significantly more battery power than HTC Incredible S. The characteristics have also changed very much.  But nevertheless, it was proved by user experience that the smartphone in question can easily work on battery power with an average load of up to two days.  Agree, it is not always possible to get such indicators with an energy carrier power of 1450 mAh.  The battery life was achieved thanks to an excellent economical processor and high-quality components. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  HTC Incredible S, description, specifications, test, reviews, the prices of which we briefly reviewed, left an ambiguous impression.  On the one hand, this company should already have removed the gadget from the assembly line, giving up the vacant niche for more modern models.  But on the other hand, Incredible S is almost as good as a mid-range smartphone in terms of performance and build quality. </p>

    <p>  As a result of testing over time, the reason for this surge in popularity was revealed after three years in the smartphone market.  The fact is that almost all users noted the stability of the OS and the entire filling without a single glitch for 2.5 years!  Given the fact that, on average, this indicator does not exceed 6-7 months, this is very good. </p><p>  The stiffness of the case is also very pleasing.  The smartphone is quite well protected from environmental influences and even from falling onto a hard surface.  All these properties have a positive impact on popularity and, despite a slightly overpriced price, stability lovers will no doubt choose HTC Incredible S. </p>
