  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sfat in Israel</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Safed in Israel is a small town on top of a mountain located in the north-east of the country.  Travelers looking for a mixture of history, tradition, spirituality and art will enjoy visiting Safed, which is referred to as the ‚Äúcity of Kabbalah‚Äù and is one of the four sacred sites of Judaism. </p><h2>  Historical places </h2><p>  Since the history of Safed is thousands of years old, naturally there are many historical places in it that deserve the attention of tourists: </p><ul><li>  Cemetery Safed.  It is located in the lower part of the city.  It may seem a little strange that one of the main attractions of the city is a cemetery, but this place is filled daily with visitors.  The remains of famous Kabbalistic masters are stored here: Rabbi Ari and Joseph Caro (died in 1573).  In Safed cemetery is the famous mikva (ritual bath) Ari.  A reservoir of ice water is still used by the most brave. </li><li>  The Citadel (Metsuda).  This is a beautiful park with a picturesque view, as well as the remains of a historic crusader castle.  The citadel is located at the highest point of Safed in Israel.  This is the place where battles were fought from Roman times until the war for the independence of Israel.  There is a monument in honor of those who gave their lives to protect Safed in 1948.  The highlight of this park is its beautiful shrubs and trees, as well as breathtaking views. </li><li>  Davidka.  Not far from the beginning of Midrakhov's shopping street and the top of the Great Staircase, the Davidka gun is visible.  She played a decisive role during the Israeli War of Independence.  Opposite it, bullet and shell holes on buildings are still visible. </li><li>  Great Staircase.  It was used by the British to divide the city of Safed into two parts: the Arab and Jewish quarters of the Old City until 1948.  Today, this staircase is a great starting point for visiting the artists' quarter and the historical synagogues of the Jewish quarter. <div class="photo" data-original="www.israelvideonetwork.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Streets of Safed" class="if uuid-3242917" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/115573/3242917.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Walking around the city </h2><p>  Of course, the best way to see the city is with walking tours of Safed.  Most of the best places can only be reached on foot: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Candle factory.  Not far from the Kadosh Dairy Factory on Yud-Alef Street, there is the Tzfat candle factory, where works of art made of wax reach incredible heights.  It sells traditional Shabbat and Havdala candles in beautiful colors, and wax dioramas representing biblical scenes are unique. </li><li>  House Museum Hameyri.  It documents the Jewish life of Safed in Israel for the past 200 years.  A fifth-generation native who died in 1989, Yehezkel Khameiri spent decades turning this building into a museum, which is based on two large halls, each 150 years old.  At one time, these rooms were used as the headquarters of the rabbinical court of Safed.  And in World War I, they became home to hundreds of children who became orphans as a result of the typhoid epidemic, which claimed the lives of two-thirds of the city‚Äôs population.  Today in these vaulted halls are exhibited paintings, documents and ordinary utensils used by later generations of Safed. </li><li>  Memorial Museum of Hungarian-speaking Jews.  Another little-known, but worth visiting attraction of Safed is located on a hilltop near Aliya Bet Street.  The museum is part of the Saraya complex.  Today it is known as the community center of Edith, and here is also the former khan (traveler‚Äôs dormitory) and the Noam synagogue.  Here you can also watch the charming Ottoman clock tower. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="gordontours.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tour of Safed" class="if uuid-3242935" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/115573/3242935.jpg"></div><h2>  Synagogues Safed </h2><p>  Among the modern galleries and the picturesque limestone lanes of Safed there are a number of historical synagogues that will help visitors traveling in Israel to connect with the indescribable mysticism of the holy city: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Sephardic Synagogue Ari.  She is the oldest in Safed.  In the 16th century, it was a favorite place of prayer for Arizal (rabbi Isaac Luria), who especially appreciated the view of the mountain. </li><li>  The synagogue Ari Ashkenazi also dates from the 16th century.  The aforementioned rabbi Isaac Luria prayed at this place on Shabbat.  Many people know that Shabbat is the most important holy day on the calendar among Jews.  Later a synagogue was built here.  The Holy Ark, made of olive wood, is also located in this place. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="etalontravel.co.il" data-author=": " data-source="https://etalontravel.co.il/en/excursion/sinij-cfat-kamen-nebo-kabbala-mogily-velikix-pravednikov"><img itemprop="image" alt="blooming Safed, Israel" class="if uuid-3242919" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/115573/3242919.jpg"></div><ul><li>  The synagogue of Joseph Caro.  Originally founded in the 16th century, like many buildings in Safed, it was twice destroyed by earthquakes and rebuilt each time.  An Italian philanthropist named Getta installed a marble floor here.  Local legend says that half of the budget allocated for reconstruction was spent on construction, and the other half was buried underground to use it when the messiah arrives. </li><li>  Synagogue Abuhav.  It was built in 1490.  Here is the oldest Torah scroll in the whole of Safed.  It is kept under lock and key.  Only 3 times a year they read it: on Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur and Shavuot. </li></ul><h2>  Shopping in Safed </h2><p>  A must stop for all visitors to Safed is the HaMeiri Cheese Shop, whose recipes have been used for 168 years.  And if you take a loaf of bread and some cheese, you can enjoy a picnic somewhere nearby. </p><p>  Walking along the Gallery Street, tourists will find many art shops, souvenir shops and places to eat, as well as banks and mail. </p><p>  After passing through the block of the Artist, you can see beautiful old stone houses.  Nice little restaurants hide in picturesque alleys.  To buy gifts and works of art, you must visit the Art Market, where there are many wonderful jewelry, works of calligraphic art, paintings and ceramics. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.timeout.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gallery, Safed" class="if uuid-3242908" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/115573/3242908.jpg"></div><h2>  Food in Safed </h2><p>  Hungry, tourists can go to Jerusalem Street and choose street food or dine in one of the decent restaurants overlooking the Old City and the Meron Hills. </p><p>  When you are in Safed on Wednesday morning, you can catch a shuk (open-air market), a lively place where you can buy excellent local food and have a snack with olives, sweets or pastries. </p><p>  Midrakhov is the point where the ancient spiritual Safed meets a vibrant modern city.  Shops and cafes are located opposite the most spectacular views, unique only to the mystical city of Safed in Israel.  Tourists can enjoy a refreshing drink or enjoy a meal while admiring the view of the historic Mount Meron and its surroundings.  This unique and colorful street has local shops selling everything from fruits and vegetables to home goods, clothing and souvenirs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚ÄãSafed" class="if uuid-3242911" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/115573/3242911.jpg"></div><h2>  From the beaten track </h2><p>  If there is a desire to go backstage and get to know the real Safed, you can move away from the beaten path and visit the artist's Shtender Tree of Life, as well as the Shemen Tov nature path, which promotes healing. </p><p>  Nature lovers and tourists alike will enjoy walking through the wadi, a gently sloping canyon that leads to Tiberias. </p><p>  Local buses run regularly and there are several reliable taxi ranks.  Taxis with a fixed route - Cherut - pick passengers along the bus lines and charge them a fee similar to buses, delivering tourists along the route. </p>
