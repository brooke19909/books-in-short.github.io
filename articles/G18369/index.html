Mobile air conditioning</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Air conditioning refers to household climate technology, in the choice of which the installation method is essential.  Installation of traditional models involves the creation of a special hole in the wall.  Next, the block is fixed on the surface, and its position no longer changes.  This approach to providing an air conditioning system has its advantages, but in certain operating conditions it is more advisable to use portable models.  These are floor units that can be moved around the house within boundaries that are determined only by access to the mains.  In terms of efficiency, the portable floor air conditioner is not inferior to the usual versions, but it has structural and operational features.  Such models are presented on the market in a wide range, so you can choose the best option for tasks of any complexity. </p><h2>  Benefits of Mobile Air Conditioners </h2><p>  The main advantage, which, in fact, attracts the attention of consumers to such systems, is the possibility of their movement and small size.  In terms of ergonomics, this is the best option.  It is also worth noting that a portable air conditioner without an air duct does not require a hole in the wall.  On the one hand, this eliminates the hassle of installation, and on the other, it allows you to maintain the integrity of the finish and save money.  There are also advantages in the form of ease of maintenance.  Still, the design of the mobile air conditioner is more ergonomic in terms of care.  Even an inexperienced user will be able to independently clean the fan and replace the filter. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In terms of introducing new technologies, the models of this category also show notable progress towards increasing functionality and ease of use.  For example, the Ballu mobile air conditioner, already in the middle price group, is provided with the ability to remember settings and adjust in the directions of the air flow. </p><h2>  Disadvantages of mobile air conditioners </h2><p>  Behind the pluses in the form of mobility and compactness, there are also many significant disadvantages of portable air conditioners.  One of them is a high noise level.  The reason for this flaw lies not in the absence of insulation, but in the design features.  Unlike stationary models, such a system contains a compressor in its only casing.  This component is a source of noise.  In addition, portable home air conditioning requires regular condensate monitoring.  When the pan is filled with water, a special sensor automatically turns off the equipment.  According to the owners, in hot weather you have to drain the water every three hours.  As for the quality of performing a direct function, the microclimate in rooms with such equipment is usually characterized by a slight decrease in temperature. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Varieties of mobile air conditioners </h2><p>  Monoblock devices in which all communications, operating mechanisms and electronic filling are enclosed in one case are more common.  This group also includes a <span>mini portable air conditioner,</span> which is small in size, but is able to provide the same set of functions - cooling, ionization and even drying. </p><p>  The second type of such systems involves the use of a split design.  That is, the kit includes two blocks, as in a traditional system.  One is installed externally, and the second is a device for indoor use.  As a result, the advantages of a conventional model and the advantages of mobile technology are achieved.  The fact is that a portable air conditioner for a home with a compressor taken out is spared from noisy work, but at the same time it retains the ability to move the indoor unit. </p>

    <h2>  Power selection </h2><p>  It should be noted that in average power indicators such models are inferior to stationary counterparts.  But if it is planned to operate the equipment in an apartment or a small house, then this nuance will not become an obstacle to creating the optimal microclimate.  Units with an average power level of 2 to 5 kW are on the market.  This indicator is often crucial for the reason that the cooling efficiency that a portable air conditioner can provide depends on it.  The price is also largely determined by power - for example, 2-3 kW models can cost 12-15 thousand rubles, and options for 4 kW or more usually cost at least 20 thousand rubles.  There is also a more productive technique, which is estimated at 50-60 thousand rubles.  But these are already industrial models, whose power significantly exceeds household units. </p><p>  Manufacturers, together with the power, indicate the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe room that the air conditioner can service.  For example, a low-power portable air conditioner for a home is suitable for rooms with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãnot more than 20 m <sup>2</sup> , and modifications with high power potential can be used in rooms up to 40 m <sup>2</sup> . </p>

    <h2>  Is a condensate trap needed? </h2><p>  It has already been noted that one of the disadvantages of mobile air conditioners is the need to manually drain the accumulated condensate.  However, manufacturers provide an opportunity to eliminate this defect.  They offer to equip the system with a special condensate collector.  This device will automatically collect water in an appropriate container.  Thanks to this addition, the portable air conditioner for the home becomes autonomous and more convenient to use.  But as the structural elements expand, one of the main advantages of this type of equipment is lost - compactness and ease of handling. </p><h2>  Functionality: what to consider? </h2><p>  In addition to the direct task of <span>air cooling,</span> climate technology allows you to provide a number of other functions.  For example, mobile devices are capable of multi-level filtering.  The most technological and effective in terms of air purification are considered models with a plasma filter.  This is a portable air conditioner, the price of which usually exceeds 20 thousand rubles, but for this the user can count on getting rid of smoke, smells, dust and other tiny particles.  But the point is not only in cleaning efficiency, which reaches 95%.  Such devices, even over time, do not reduce the quality of the filter. </p>

    <h2>  Manufacturers </h2><p>  The most productive and durable models are offered by the brands Fujitsu, General and Daikin.  This is a premium equipment, which is distinguished by high functionality and original design with good ergonomics.  If an inexpensive solution is required, then you should choose among budget options.  For example, Ballu mobile air conditioning at a low price is notable for decent build quality and modern electronic control.  In the middle class, options from Samsung, Toshiba, LG and other equally well-known manufacturers are presented. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  For all its shortcomings, mobile climate equipment maintains a strong market position.  To a large extent this is facilitated by the form factor of technology, the advantages of which include compactness, ease of use and attractive design.  It is worth noting the functional advantages that a portable floor air conditioner has in all price categories.  This is the ability to <span>ionize air,</span> its high-quality cleaning and drying.  Manufacturers also supply portable models with modern electronic systems for comfortable control.  The presence of timers and means of automatic adjustment of operating parameters has long been mandatory for air conditioners in the middle price group.  As for the economy class devices, they provide the owner with the ability to remotely control and adjust the direction of air flow. </p>
