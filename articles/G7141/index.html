Causes of freezing and methods for their elimination</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sometimes iPhone users are faced with various problems associated with the functioning of devices.  After an emergency shutdown or installing updates, devices may stop showing signs of life.  "IPhone" hung on an apple: what to do if its further use is impossible?  In the article, we consider in detail the causes of this phenomenon and possible solutions to the problem. </p><h2>  Main reasons </h2><p>  IPhone hangs on an apple: what to do?  This question worries many owners of Apple's mobile devices.  Causes of the phenomenon can be system failures or software errors.  A hardware malfunction of the smartphone is also possible.  Next, we consider the algorithm of actions in each of these cases. </p><div class="photo" data-original="apple.recambiosmovil.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Apple logo" class="if uuid-3200992" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3200992.jpg"></div><p>  If the owner of the gadget tried to install updates, and the mobile device freezes, we can conclude that there is a system error.  The operating system cannot reboot, so the smartphone reboots cyclically and displays the Apple logo.  Sometimes a similar error occurs as a result of the phone having insufficient free space or not having enough battery power when installing iOS updates. </p><h2>  Device reboot </h2><p>  First of all, it is necessary to determine the cause of the device freezing.  Often this problem is encountered by users who use the jailbreak system.  An error can occur during a system failure of the device or reboot.  If "iPhone 5" hangs on an apple, what to do and how to return it to working condition?  Regardless of the model of the mobile device, you can restore the function by rebooting.  To do this, just press and hold the volume and power buttons for 10 seconds.  Often after performing this manipulation, the device works well and boots up. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  IPhone update </h2><p>  If the reboot procedure did not help, you should update the operating system in Recovery Mode.  The method allows you to reinstall iOS without any changes to the data stored on the device.  However, this method is effective only if the device freezes as a result of a system update.  If the problems are related to the jailbreak or "stuffing" of the gadget, then this method will not help.  To perform the update procedure, the user will need a PC with the latest version of iTunes and a USB cable.  Then you need to open the program on the computer and activate recovery mode. </p><div class="photo" data-original="drfone.wondershare.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Device reboot" class="if uuid-3201000" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3201000.jpg"></div><p>  If "iPhone 6" hangs on an apple, what should I do and how to reboot on the device?  The user will need to simultaneously press the power button and volume control.  After about 10 seconds, a logo appears on the screen of the mobile device.  ITunes on your PC will display a notification that the gadget is detected in recovery mode. </p><p>  If "iPhone 7" hangs on an apple, what should the owners of the device do and how to return to working condition?  On all early iPhone models, you can press and hold the Home button and the Power key.  After the smartphone turns off, you will need to hold "Home" and simultaneously connect the mobile device using a USB cable to the PC.  After a few seconds, the iTunes logo appears on the screen of the smartphone.  This method will help users who are looking for an answer to the question of what to do.  "IPhone" hung on an apple - a solution to this problem through the application of this method will lead to a factory reset.  Previously, it is worth creating backup copies of the necessary data. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to detect hardware crashes? </h2><p>  In the process of updating the operating system, all components of the mobile device are checked.  If some programs do not work correctly, after this procedure the phone may not turn on at all. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rd.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Recovery procedure" class="if uuid-3201179" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3201179.jpg"></div><p>  IPhone hangs on an apple: what to do?  Before deciding on the algorithm of actions, it is necessary to understand the cause of the problem.  Hardware problems include: </p><ul><li>  faulty charging controller (often appears when a mobile device crashes); </li><li>  damage to the Power button; </li><li>  problems with the power of the device (during network surges); </li><li>  incorrect battery operation; </li><li>  software bug; </li><li>  problems with the motherboard; </li><li>  a failure in the phone's memory; </li><li>  failure of data storage chips. </li></ul><p>  Of the most difficult cases, there are power problems and a malfunction of the central processor of the device.  In the situations presented, the percentage of successful repair and stable operation of the smartphone is small. </p><h2>  Recovery through the program </h2><p>  If the iPhone hangs on an apple, what should I do if nothing helps and the device does not turn on.  In this case, you can transfer the smartphone to DFU mode using iTunes.  Connect the mobile device to the computer and simultaneously press the Power and Home buttons.  The user will see how the phone screen goes blank.  So, the device will be displayed in the program.  Next, you need to press the Shift key and the "Restore" button in iTunes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.fonepaw.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Apple Technology" class="if uuid-3201175" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3201175.jpg"></div><p>  If "iPhone 4" hangs on an apple, what should the owner of the device do?  In most cases, fixing such malfunctions on your own is quite difficult.  Experts recommend contacting a service center or a private workshop, as any technique requires a professional approach. </p><h2>  Additional way </h2><p>  If the iPhone hangs on an apple, what should I do if the above methods have not shown a positive result?  The user can check the installed tweaks for compatibility with the mobile device.  He will need to put the device into safe mode.  To do this, turn off the gadget and wait a few seconds.  Then you should press the power button and go to the Cydia application, where it is worth removing an incompatible tweak. </p><div class="photo" data-original="support.apple.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mobile device hangs" class="if uuid-3200993" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3200993.jpg"></div><p>  If the user does not want to spend personal time on restoring the mobile device, you can use the qualified help of the wizards.  Specialists will professionally approach the question of what to do.  "IPhone" hung on an apple - they solved this problem many times. </p><h2>  Brief conclusion </h2><p>  Self-repairing problems and hardware failures in a mobile device is not a good idea.  If the iPhone hangs on an apple, what should I do and can I restore the gadget?  Here it is recommended to contact a specialized service center in which professionals will make a quality repair of the smartphone under warranty.  Otherwise, the consequences may be irreversible. </p>
