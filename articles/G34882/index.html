His policy was aimed at uniting the Tatar states.  In his quest to establish supremacy in the territory previously owned by the Great Horde, he achieved significant success.  A key role in the administration of the ruler belonged to Becklerback Timur (grandson of Edigey). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Khan Akhmat" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1261917.jpg" width="270"></div>

    <h2>  Eastern politics </h2><p>  The territories once owned by the Great Horde gained independence.  In all likelihood, the main goal of the eastern policy of the last ruler was to restore his authority over Khorezm.  Khan Akhmat claimed land for at least two reasons.  First of all, he sought to unite the territory under his authority.  In addition, according to ancient evidence, the eastern lands were given to the sister of Husayn Baykara (a descendant of Timur) - his wife Badi al-Jamal.  In this situation, Akhmat‚Äôs interests were contrary to the policies of Abu l-Khaira.  The latter was at that time a powerful Uzbek ruler of the Shibanid clan.  Khan Akhmat did not dare to conflict with him.  Therefore, he simply waited for his death in 1468. Abu l-Khair was distinguished by cruelty and power.  This caused a negative attitude towards him and his descendants from both neighbors and the Uzbek nobility.  Representatives of the latter brought to power Yadgar Khan, with whom Akhmat entered into an alliance.  In 1469, the new Uzbek ruler died, and power was in the hands of the son of Abu l-Khair - Shaykh-Haidar.  A powerful opposition was formed against him, however.  As a result, in 1470-1471.  Shaikh Haidar lost most of his possessions.  After some time, the Siberian ruler Ibak took him by surprise and killed him.  Khan Akhmat concluded a peace agreement with opponents of Shaykh-Haidar, married the sister of the Nogai rulers Yamgurchi and Musa.  In addition, it is likely that he also made them promise not to interfere in his actions to capture Khorezm.  But plans prevented the death of his brother in the Volga region. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="big horde" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1261918.jpg" width="369"></div>

One of them was the independence of Crimea.  The peninsula was at one time the target of the Great Horde.  In 1476, the ruler decided to intervene in the situation in Crimea.  In 1475, Haidar and Nur-Devlet overthrew their brother Mengli-Girey.  The latter sought refuge in the Cafe (Feodosia), by then already captured by the Turks.  In 1467, a contemporary of Khan Akhmat - Khadzhik did not get along with his brother and called on the Tatar ruler.  He, taking advantage of the situation, seated his nephew Janibek on the throne in the Crimea.  Having strengthened his position, Khan Akhmat began to believe that the former power of the Tatar-Mongol state was restored. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="standing on an eel 1480" class="if" height="426" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1261923.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Relations with Russia </h2><p>  Judging by the ancient chronicles, the first campaign of Khan Akhmad took place as early as 1460. Then the ruler sent his army to Pereslavl Ryazan.  The ruler sought to restore the real dependence of Russia.  However, he did not have enough strength for this.  In 1468, the Tatars raided the region of Besputu (the right bank of the Oka) and the Ryazan principality.  In 1471, Akhmat accepted an offer from Casimir IV (the Polish-Lithuanian king) to conclude a military alliance against Ivan III, who had ceased to pay tribute.  In July 1472, an unsuccessful raid on Moscow took place.  During it, the Tatar ruler only managed to burn Alexin.  At this time, a detachment of Muhammad Sheybani <span>(an Uzbek khan)</span> attacked the ulits of Akhmad <span>.</span>  Therefore, the Tatars had to retreat. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Khan Akhmat 1480" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1261919.jpg" width="375"></div>

Venice's policy was aimed at finding a major ally with which to stop Mehmed II, the Turkish ruler.  In 1470, the adventurer Giovanni-Battista della Volpe spoke to the Senate (diplomat Ivan Fryazin, a native of Italy, who was in the Russian service).  In his report, he indicated that Akhmat could provide 200 thousand soldiers.  In 1471, Giovanni Battist Trevisano was sent to the Tatar ruler.  However, he was detained for 3 years in Moscow.  During this time, Volpe once again visited Akhmat.  In 1472, Mr .. reported to the Senate about his readiness to start a war with the Turks through the territory of Hungary, subject to a lump sum payment of 6 thousand ducats and an annual payment of 1 thousand ducats.  In 1476, Trevisiano returned to Venice with ambassadors from Akhmat.  The Senate accepted the proposal to start hostilities across the Danube.  Against the campaign, however, was Casimir. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Khan Akhmad‚Äôs campaign" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1261920.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <h2>  Khan Akhmat and Ivan 3 </h2><p>  Over the next few years, despite the regular exchange of embassies, the Tatar ruler was unable to get Moscow to restore tribute payments.  Moreover, he failed to prevent the formation of the Moscow-Crimean alliance with Mengli-Girey.  Back in 1467, after the invasion and capture of the peninsula, Akhmat sent Ambassador Buchuk to Moscow.  The ruler demanded not only the resumption of payment of tribute, but also insisted on the arrival of the Russian prince to him.  At that time, the situation was extremely unfavorable for Ivan III.  In this regard, as some sources testify, he showed prudence and friendly disposition.  It is even likely that he paid tribute.  But in 1479 the situation changed.  Ivan III managed to subjugate Novgorod, and Akhmat lost influence in the Crimea.  That is why the next ambassadors in Moscow were received defiantly hostile.  The Russian ruler tore the letter that Khan Akhmat had previously issued.  1480 was the last year of the reign of the latter.  Casimir IV promised to help the Tatar ruler.  With the support of Akhmat, he decides to make a large-scale invasion of Moscow lands.  However, it ended extremely unsuccessfully. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="contemporary of Khan Akhmad" class="if" height="273" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1261921.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Standing on the Ugra (1480) </h2><p>  On September 30, the Moscow prince returned from Kolomna to a council with the boyars and the metropolitan.  As a result, he received unanimous approval for speaking out against the Tatar-Mongols.  In the same days, ambassadors from Boris Volotsky and Andrei Bolshoi came to the prince, who announced the termination of the rebellion.  The Russian ruler granted them forgiveness and ordered them to collect shelves and go to Oka.  October 3, Ivan went to the city of Kremenets.  Leaving a small detachment with him, he sent most of the troops to Ugra.  The Tatars meanwhile ravaged the lands along the headwaters of the Oka.  Having captured the cities here, they supposed to exclude the attack from the rear.  October 8, the Tatar ruler tried to force the river.  Ugra.  However, the forces of the Russian prince repelled the attack.  Over the next few days, the Tatars tried several times to cross to the other side.  But every time they were stopped by Russian artillery.  As a result, they had to retreat 2 versts and stand in Luz.  The Russian prince took up defense on the opposite bank.  Thus began <span>‚Äústanding on the Ugra" in</span> 1480. From time to time, a shootout began, but neither side made a serious attack. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Khan Akhmat and Ivan 3" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1261922.jpg" width="525"></div>

    <h2>  The end of the confrontation </h2><p>  Between the parties negotiations began.  The Tatar khan demanded that the Russian prince or his son (or at least a brother) come to him, expressing humility, and pay tribute for 7 years.  Ivan sent as ambassador Ivan Tovarkov, the boyar‚Äôs son, with gifts.  However, the demand to pay tribute was rejected.  Accordingly, the gifts of the Russian prince were not accepted.  It is likely that Ivan went to negotiations in order to gain time.  The situation began to change in his favor - reinforcements of Boris Volotsky and Andrei Bolshoi were expected.  In addition, Mengli Giray fulfilled his promise and attacked the southern territories of the Principality of Lithuania.  Akhmat, therefore, was deprived of any hope of Casimir‚Äôs help. </p><h2>  The maneuver of the Russian prince </h2><p>  The Tatar ruler mobilized all the inhabitants of his state and did not leave any fighting forces.  Ivan sent a small detachment headed by Vasily Nozdrevaty to the possession of Akhmat.  On October 28, the Russian prince decides to withdraw his troops to Kremenets, in order to then concentrate at Borovsk.  Here he planned to fight in a favorable environment.  Akhmat, in turn, found out that Nozdrevyaty‚Äôs detachment was operating in his possessions.  Due to the long stay in one place, the Tatar army began to lack food.  The fact is that they ate the sheep they led along.  After a long stand, all feed reserves ran out.  Therefore, on November 11, Akhmat decides to return to his domain.  After returning after some time, he was killed in a sudden attack by his former allies. </p>
