    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  Dreams Vacation Resort Sharm El Sheikh (Egypt) shares its resort territory with another hotel - Dreams Beach Resort.  Guests of both hotels enjoy shared services and entertainment facilities.  Both hotels are located in the prestigious area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSharm el-Sheikh called Umm al-Sid.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe complex is seventy thousand square meters.  The hotel we are interested in accepts guests in comfortable two-story buildings.  There are nine such buildings in total, plus one administrative building. </p><h2>  Beach area </h2><p>  Beach Dream Vacation Resort Sharm El Sheikh 5 * also shares with Dreams Beach Resort.  The entrance to the sea is coral, so you should get slippers.  The question immediately arises: is there a place for young children to enter the sea?  Tourists are advised to wait for the tide and swim on a small sandy island, but still wear slippers.  But the views of the coral reefs in these places are simply magnificent. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The relaxation area on the beach is completely sandy.  Free sun loungers, mattresses, beach towels and umbrellas are provided for free.  Entrance to the sea is from a pontoon or pier. </p><p>  To get to the beach, you need to go a fairly large distance from the residential complexes, and this despite the fact that the hotel is on the first coastline.  A rather steep and long descent leads to the sea, because of which the management of the complex was forced to build an elevator.  But its minus is that it is located at the intersection of the borders of two hotels, so it is not convenient for all guests to use it.  For example, if you settled in the left wing of Dream Vacation Resort Sharm El Sheikh 5 *, then you will quickly get to the sea if the sender is on foot. </p><h2>  Hotel facilities </h2><p>  The infrastructure of the complex is huge.  As a self-respecting five-star hotel, Dream Vacation Resort Sharm El Sheikh 5 * provides free parking and a safe at the reception.  Guests can visit one of six restaurants, three of which are a la carte, located in the Dreams Beach Resort.  Additionally, there are three bars, as many conference rooms and outdoor pools. </p><p>  Also, hotel guests can visit the laundry, beauty salon, first-aid post.  Internet access is available for a fee.  In 2015, thirty minutes online cost six dollars.  Many people prefer to buy a local SIM card and thus save on gigabytes. </p>

    <h2>  Dreams Vacation Resort 5 * (Sharm El Sheikh): reviews </h2><p>  Overall the hotel is very good.  According to tourists resting, he can safely put eight points out of ten.  Well, it can't be just perfect, even in the most fashionable hotel.  The pros and cons of the rest of our compatriots will be discussed further. </p><p>  Tourists note that by paying twenty dollars, you can get a room with a view of the pool.  The guests indicate that the hotel is very polite and pleasant staff. </p><p>  By the way, quite often there are reviews that, by paying a tip, you can quickly get the desired number.  You need to remember that the usual check-in is from 14:00, and if you arrived earlier, wait your turn or pay.  If there are several rooms available, the administrator will always offer you to make a choice yourself. </p><p>  By the way, there are often reviews that in the rooms either the shower does not flow, the lock is broken, or the air conditioning is naughty.  The administration resolves all issues quickly and locally.  If you call and report a problem, they will fix it right away.  This is a very big plus of this institution. </p><h2>  Room Reviews </h2><p>  There are few negative comments about the Dreams Vacation (Egypt, Sharm El Sheikh).  The reviews of most people are generally positive.  But not about the rooms.  Unfortunately, there are more minuses than pluses. </p><p>  The poor, even dead state of the rooms is not surprising.  The hotel has existed since 2003, and there is simply not enough time to repair all 319 rooms.  The influx of people is large, and the hotel would simply lose its income if the buildings were closed.  And nobody wants that.  Partial repairs were already started in 2014, and those who settled in the restored rooms were very lucky. </p><p>  According to some tourists, they expected more from a five-star hotel.  The rooms are not very impressive guests.  Very old plumbing, everything flows, the shower practically does not work, because it flows out of the water hose more than from the divider, the toilet bowl is loose.  But the worst thing is the black fungus on the tile.  After the request to change the number, they will not always go towards you, and if they do, then it is not a fact that the number will be better than it was.  The staff tries to repair non-working equipment immediately, but, unfortunately, one has to put up with many shortcomings. </p><p>  Housekeeping is good.  Workers try, change linen and towels daily.  Be sure to leave a tip, otherwise you will not get rid of the cleaner until he gets his. </p><h2>  Reviews about the territory </h2><p>  Often you can find reviews on the hotel Dreams Vacation 4 *, Egypt.  In fact, this is the same hotel in question all this time, it‚Äôs just that it received the fifth star relatively recently, and many regular customers are still used to the old name. </p><p>  Everyone who was at Dream Vacation Resort is simply fascinated by its territory.  She is really huge.  It is a great deal of work for gardeners to keep an eye on the sophistication and accuracy of shrubs and flowers.  In dry and hot climates, the green garden is simply amazing. </p><p>  Many vacationers settle in this hotel thanks to the garden.  It is so nice to stroll leisurely on a cool evening along beautiful avenues illuminated by beautiful lanterns. </p><p>  By the way, taf-taf rides on the territory.  On it you can safely get to the elevator and go down to the sea without any problems.  To go on foot or to go by transport is a purely individual preference. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews about the sea and the beach </h2><p>  The sea is very beautiful and exciting.  Still, the Red Sea is a paradise for diving.  Corals in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthis hotel are very colorful.  They are home to exotic motley fish, which is a pleasure to watch. </p><p>  Tourists note that the water and the beach are always clean.  Sand is sifted daily by the hotel staff.  There are plenty of sun loungers and deck chairs.  Vacationers note that at any time of the day there are empty seats and there is no need to get up at five in the morning and take a seat, as in Anapa. </p><p>  Three pontoons, located at a fairly large distance from each other, allow tourists to freely enter the water without creating traffic jams.  In general, there are no complaints to the sea at all.  But be sure to take slippers with you in the water so as not to hurt your legs on the coral. </p>
