    <h2>  Holidays in Schastlivtsevo </h2><p>  On the spit, the Arabat Spit is a small, but very famous resort since the days of the USSR.  This is the village of Schastlivtsevo.  Since it is located in the center of the spit, it was even called the golden middle of the Arabat arrow.  This is a shallow warm sea, and beaches of unprecedented breadth, and the steppe air, drunk with healing substances.  The weather here is mostly warm and dry, although there are often winds.  On the other hand, in the summer heat, only they bear coolness and repose.  Until now, this resort was considered a budget, and now its reputation in this regard is justified.  It is much cheaper to relax here than in neighboring Genichesk or on the Black Sea coast.  One of the best bases in these places, of course, is the boarding house "Express" (Schastlivtsevo).  These are the impressions of tourists who visited it from different cities of Ukraine. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pension Express Arabat" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1020617.jpg" width="300"></div>
