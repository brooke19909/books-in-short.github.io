    <h2>  First battles </h2><p>  In early July 1941, Basan Badminovich Gorodovikov, whose photo is in the article, arrived in the army, having been appointed commander of a <span>cavalry regiment</span> in Ukraine.  Relocated in October 1941 in the Crimea, the regiment as part of the division entered into heavy battles with Nazi troops.  After stubborn bloody battles, the Red Army left the Crimea, and Gorodovikov was entrusted with the organization of the partisan movement.  For the successful completion of a special task, the command of Gorodovikov was awarded the Order of the Red Banner, and in April 1942 he was awarded the rank of colonel.  In Crimea, he was a partisan commander, organizing disparate Red Army units to resist behind enemy lines, and then was transferred to the mainland. </p><h2>  Participation in operations on the Western Front </h2><p>  After a short rest, Gorodovikov was appointed commander of the Vitebsk Rifle Division.  Under the command of the colonel, five settlements were liberated in the summer of 1943, which created the prerequisites for the successful offensive of Soviet troops on the entire front.  Thanks to the skillful actions of Gorodovikov, the perfectly fortified enemy defense was broken through, and then he earned the glory of the “master of breakthrough”.  The division has accounted for the successful conduct of a number of military operations, many of which subsequently became the subject of study at military universities and academies. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

The division took upon itself the main blow of those seeking to break out of the encirclement of the enemy forces, not allowing them to leave the boiler.  During fierce battles, a significant amount of military equipment and personnel of the enemy forces were destroyed. </p><p>  Having gone on the offensive, the division entered East Prussia, successfully moving forward.  The first parade of winners, which was received by the division commander, Hero of the Soviet Union Gorodoviks, took place in October 1944 on the territory of the city of Shirvindt.  In December, the general was seriously injured and until February 1945 he was treated in the Moscow military hospital.
