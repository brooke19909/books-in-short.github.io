    <p>  The formation of the Russian people took place under the influence of the Grand <span>Duke Rurik, who</span> united the lands.  The activity of the ruler began with simple sermons, which he told the inhabitants of European lands.  Thus, with righteous and right thoughts, Rurik was able to unite several peoples into a single principality, and then engage in the formation and formation of the first prototype of the state. </p><p>  Mostly the ideals of <span>Ancient Russia were</span> formed depending on the head of state.  Therefore, the next ruler - Prophetic Oleg - through his reforms inspired people that they live in a strong and independent principality.  There are legends about the great conquests and campaigns that the son of the first ruler of the Russian lands made. </p><h2>  The moral side of the soul.  Religion is hidden </h2><p>  As you know, the origins of the moral formation of the soul of the Slavic people lies in such a religion as paganism.  Since ancient times, Slavic peoples worshiped numerous idols and gods, conjuring the weather, harvest, patronizing marriage and the birth of children.  Thus, to this day, the festivities and events of Ancient Russia of a pagan nature are reflected in the daily life of modern man. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Everyone's favorite Shrovetide with the wires of winter and eating delicious pancakes comes from the pagan rites of antiquity.  In the summer, children are happy to honor the arrival of Ivan Kupala, forcing passers-by to open to the welcoming sun.  The moral ideals and covenants of Ancient Russia were reduced not only to blind worship of a mighty deity, but also to a fun pastime.  However, the moment came that completely changed the life of the Slavic people ... </p><h2>  Baptism: Reforms of Awe and Fear </h2><p>  Most princes of the <span>Slavic state are</span> known for reforms aimed at creating a universal public good.  The great son of Princess Olga and Prince Igor, Vladimir Krasnoye Solnyshko, was no exception. </p>

    <p>  The honorable <span>ruler of Russia</span> understood that the people of his state needed to strengthen their own spirit, enlighten the mind, and also to purify the soul.  And the main salvation he saw only in Christianity. </p><p>  The forced reform of the baptism of the population literally forced people to take the path of making radical decisions: die from their native religions or continue life in accordance with the newly introduced images.  As practice showed, many chose the latter ... </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Under the influence of Christianity, the <span>moral ideals</span> and covenants of Ancient Russia were formed for many decades.  The reform carried out by Vladimir, completely took root in Slavic society after only 120 years.  Thus, people began to lead their lives in accordance with the sermons of the priests: do not kill, do not steal, do not commit adultery ... The moral culture of the population at that time is characterized by a significant upsurge.  Now a single God directed the man on the true path! </p><h2>  Moral ideals and covenants of Ancient Russia: what image to match? </h2><p>  With the advent of Christianity in Russia, the worldview of the Slavs was gradually deformed for the better.  From an early age, sons tried to match the image of their father.  If a girl appeared in the family, she took care of the strength of her family with all her might, providing significant assistance to her mother.  Also, the fair sex managed to monitor the cleanliness of the house, satiety to feed relatives, and also prepare a dowry. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ideals of ancient Russia" class="if" height="385" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29298/667177.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  For adults, the ideal was most often the ruling prince.  Decent actions and favorable reforms of the ruler evoked approval and support from a significant part of peasant society. </p><p>  And the most important ideal of behavior, actions and thoughts is the image of God.  Every righteous person tried to keep the Christian commandments, helped his neighbor, fasted, and so on.  Life in Ancient Russia with the advent of the Christian religion has changed for the better.  The formation of the moral side of society made the bordering countries recognize Russia as a worthy neighbor, starting trade relations. </p><h2>  Life and education of the Slavs </h2><p>  There were no separate schools in Russia, therefore the family was the basis of upbringing and creation.  In addition, folk art or, as is mentioned in many sources, folklore played a special role in the life of every resident of the Old Russian state. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="life in ancient Russia" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29298/667175.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Folklore is a huge number of folk works that have absorbed the experience of previous generations.  Thus, even in the songs it was possible to trace not only the amusing moments appropriate for the festivities, but also life stories, stories about campaigns, and also about the significant sacrifices of rulers made in the name of their people. </p>
