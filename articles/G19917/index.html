Very large organization.  But should she be trusted?  What information about this company can be found?  What to believe?  Reviews about the Renaissance do not give a clear opinion about what this company is.  Therefore, it is often necessary to study not only reviews, but also the latest news about <span>non-state pension funds.</span>  So what do people say about this organization?  Can she really be trusted?  Or is it better not to apply here to form the funded part of the pension? </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Renaissance is a <span>non-state pension fund in</span> Russia.  He has been working in the country for a long time.  It is supported by the financial company of the same name.  Carries out activities on pension insurance of the population. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="renaissance pension fund" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1447849.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Here, as many assure, it is possible to create a contribution to which the citizen will transfer funds for old age.  This forms the funded part of the pension.  The Renaissance does not conduct any specific activities.  Only opening deposits for retirement savings.  But is it worth paying attention to this organization? </p><h2>  Reincarnation </h2><p>  It‚Äôs hard to decide.  After all, the Renaissance is a non-state type pension fund that has undergone quite a few changes over the entire period of its existence.  The thing is that he went through a merger with several pension funds several times. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The last name of the organization is "Renaissance - Sun. Life. Pension."  It is under this name that one can meet the mentioned non-governmental fund.  Therefore, to be surprised that about the "Renaissance" and "Sun. Life. Pension" the same reviews are left, it is not necessary.  This is one and the same organization. </p><p>  The frequent change of names, as well as the combination with other non-state funds of many makes us think about the integrity and sustainability of the company.  But what should you pay attention to determine as accurately as possible whether it is worth investing in the fund or not? </p><h2>  Popularity rating </h2><p>  For example, on a company rating.  Renaissance is a pension fund that is not the leading one in Russia.  According to statistics, he is in the top 20 leaders.  But at the same time he did not rise above 11 positions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="renaissance private pension fund" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1447848.jpg"></div>

    <p>  It is often indicated that the <span>Renaissance: Life and Pensions (NPF)</span> is on the 15th place in the popularity rating of all similar funds.  It is on this indicator that many are guided.  Not the best place, but nevertheless it is close to the top 10 leaders. </p><p>  This is far from the only selection criterion.  What other components do many customers pay attention to?  Is it possible to trust the above-mentioned non-state pension fund?  Or is it better to look for another place for the formation of pension savings? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Trust </h2><p>  For example, the next indicator is the level of trust.  NPF Renaissance has a fairly high confidence.  But only according to statistics.  It is indicated that the organization has a trust at the A + level.  In some sources, trust is equal to A ++.  This is the highest point of trust. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="npf renaissance" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1447850.jpg"></div>

        </script>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Nevertheless, quite often the first indicator is indicated.  That is, customers and potential investors trust the fund, but not 100%.  Good level of trust.  Especially given that the leading trusts in Russia have the highest trust. </p><h2>  Profitability </h2><p>  Renaissance is a <span>private pension fund</span> with a fairly high level of profitability.  This indicator often attracts potential investors the most.  After all, the goal of non-state funds is not only preservation, but also an increase in pension savings of citizens. </p><p>  NPF Renaissance offers a yield of about 7-8%.  Not too much, as some customers say.  Nevertheless, this is more than some similar firms can offer.  Therefore, if you believe the numerous reviews, then the organization can really exaggerate the accumulation.  Not too much, but such a prospect does exist. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="renaissance life and pension npf" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1447852.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Spread </h2><p>  "Renaissance: Life and Pensions" - NPF, which, as many potential investors say, is found in most cities of Russia.  More precisely, the branches of this organization are located in each locality. </p><p>  That is, the fund itself is a very large corporation.  As already mentioned, it is supported by the eponymous bank.  And this fact inspires potential investors with confidence in the sustainability of the fund.  In any case, the Renaissance is not petty fraudsters who only hide behind the status of a non-state pension fund in order to collect money from the population.  So, you can take a closer look at it when deciding on the formation of the funded component of the pension. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  Renaissance is a pension fund, the maintenance of which causes eternal debate.  What does it mean?  One cannot just judge how high-quality service an organization offers.  Customer opinions in this area are seriously divided. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="npf renaissance license" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1447847.jpg"></div>

    <p>  What can NPF Renaissance offer?  Clients point out that here all employees quickly answer all the questions asked.  But at the same time, the speed of direct service leaves much to be desired.  Speaking about the payment of pension savings, it should be noted that they come with serious delays.  Of course, this state of affairs cannot please the population. </p><p>  The Renaissance provides internet service.  More precisely, the "Personal Account", in which each client can order an extract on the status of his personal account.  Such service often causes investors a lot of negative.  After all, the system is malfunctioning.  Very often, even authorization in the corresponding service fails. </p><p>  Therefore, NPF Renaissance, whose rating is not the highest in Russia, has its pros and cons with respect to service.  And this fact must be taken into account.  You should not expect excellent work from a pension fund.  And there are well-founded reasons for that.  One of them makes some people panic and worry about their retirement savings.  What is it about? </p><h2>  License </h2><p>  About the license.  She deserves special attention from this fund.  Why?  Why is this area so attractive for Renaissance non-state pension fund?  The study company license is suspended.  More precisely, recalled.  And we are talking about the fund "The Sun. Life. Pension."  What does it mean? </p><p>  The Renaissance no longer has any rights to insure the public.  Doing business as a private pension fund does not take place.  Therefore, consider the organization as a place for the formation of pension savings is clearly not worth it.  Even on the official website of the FIU, information has been published that Renaissance no longer has a license to carry out pension insurance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="npf renaissance rating" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1447851.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Why did this happen?  The Central Bank decided to reduce the number of non-state pension funds in Russia and leave only the best organizations.  Renaissance is a pension fund, which, according to many sources, could not cope with its obligations.  He did not pay money to citizens if depositors wanted to transfer their savings to another pension fund on their own.  Actual violation of the law. </p><p>  However, management does not agree with this statement.  And now it is trying to sue.  So far, the Renaissance has not resumed its work.  It is not known whether retirement insurance will be returned to the company.  If this happens, it is recommended that you take special care of this company. </p>
