    <h2>  Front design </h2><p>  The <span>Huawei Ascend G6</span> smartphone is an exact copy of Huawei's once-flagship smartphone - the Ascend P6 model.  The gadget demonstrates a compact design philosophy thanks to the average diagonal of the screen, narrow frames around it and well-chosen colors.  The Huawei Ascend G6 Black looks especially impressive: the case is not just black, but rather graphite. </p><p>  Ahead, the G6 has a compact 4.5-inch display with a rather narrow frame around it (not nearly as inconspicuous as in the LG G2, but in the spirit of many analogues).  Above the screen are: </p><ul><li>  5MP <span>front camera</span> eye; </li><li>  spoken speaker grid; </li><li>  a set of sensors for automatic brightness and proximity adjustment; </li><li>  LED notifier, notifying of missed events, removal and the need to install a charger. </li></ul><p>  Under the screen, there was a place for the opening of the conversational microphone and 3 backlit touch buttons: ‚ÄúBack‚Äù, ‚ÄúHome‚Äù and ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù.  When turned on, the first drawback of the Huawei Ascend G6 is immediately noticeable: reviews indicate that their backlighting is very uneven, which greatly spoils the initial attitude to the smartphone as a representative of the premium segment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Back view </h2><p>  The rear panel is made of plastic, although visually more like aluminum.  The color scheme of the rear panel and sidewalls is diverse: Huawei Ascend G6 white, black, pink, blue, gold.  The frame around the screen can be black or body color. </p><p>  In the upper left corner is an 8 megapixel camera with flash.  To the right of the camera‚Äôs eye, the hole of an additional microphone designed for noise reduction, recording surround sound to video is barely noticeable.  The modest logo of the manufacturer is located in the center of the back panel, and the speaker grid at the bottom. </p><p>  If you remove the back panel, you will have access to two slots for micro SIM cards and a memory card (microSD format).  Dual-SIM is a serious trump card Huawei Ascend G6.  A review of the inside of the case shows that in a device with a removable panel, the battery itself is non-removable.  For devices with Android, this is a significant minus, because the battery here is really weak. </p>

    <h2>  Keys, Connectors </h2><p>  G6 ends include the following elements: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  On the right is the power and volume buttons.  They have a quiet and short click, easy to feel with your fingers. </li><li>  On the top there is a microUSB connector (synchronization + charging). </li><li>  The bottom end for the functional connectors is not involved. </li><li>  At the bottom of the left end, a 3.5 mm ‚Äúmini-jack‚Äù for headphones was strangely placed.  According to reviews - the connector is placed uncomfortable.  When watching movies and in games (that is, when the smartphone is held in a horizontal position), such a mini-jack deployment is less successful.  But when listening to music and audio books through headphones, it is difficult to put the phone in your jeans pocket.  You will have to purchase a <span>wireless headset</span> or headphones with a L-shaped connector. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone Huawei Ascend G6" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20957/494184.jpg" width="550"></div></h2><h2>  Ergonomics Huawei Ascend G6 </h2><p>  User reviews about the ergonomics of the device are mostly positive.  The optimal display diagonal, rounded ‚Äúmetal‚Äù ends, a narrow screen frame, and a small thickness of the case make it easy to manipulate a smart phone with one hand. </p><p>  The build quality of a mid-range device with a removable cover is respectable.  No backlashes, creaks.  Dimensions Huawei Ascend G6 are 131.2 x 65.3 x 7.5 mm.  The weight of the device is only 115 grams, which makes it even too ‚Äútoy‚Äù in the hand.  This is confirmed by almost everyone who held the G6 in their hands. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Display Huawei Ascend G6 </h2><p>  A smartphone review is not possible without evaluating the quality of the screen.  A high-quality <span>IPS</span> QuarterHD <span>matrix is</span> mounted in the device: 960x540 pixels.  At 4.5 inches, the picture looks clear, without glare and inversions.  Viewing angles are comfortable - the maximum possible for this type of matrix.  Color rendering, brightness, contrast - according to reviews - like most owners of the device.  Remarkable characteristics are achieved by the most modern production technology, when there is no air gap in the bond ‚Äúdisplay / protective glass‚Äù.  The phone is equipped with a brightness adjustment sensor, but, unfortunately, it works with a frank delay of 5-10 seconds.  The display is multi-touch, recognizes 10 touches at the same time. </p><h2>  Multimedia </h2><p>  Multimedia files are played by Huawei's proprietary applications.  You can use the equalizer, called DTS, but its use does not always improve the sound of your favorite tracks.  Unfortunately, there is no way to record a conversation from the menu of the conversation itself, although a separate application for recording an audio file is present.  Play video through the gallery. </p><p>  The phone speaker is located on the rear panel.  The sound quality of the front and rear speakers is mediocre, although you can still hear them in a noisy place.  Vibrating alert has the same average power indicators (it can not always be felt).  Speech transmission runs without distortion, the volume of some users is not enough. </p><h2>  Main camera Huawei Ascend G6 </h2><p>  Camera reviews are conflicting.  On the one hand, the quality of snapshots of the main camera is enough for a family album.  On the other hand, the 8 megapixel photomodule is noticeably worse than the Ascend P6 predecessor.  Many would like more megapixels.  Autofocus of the main camera sometimes ‚Äúmisses‚Äù: when you press the on-screen shutter button, a perfectly focused frame is displayed on the screen, and after a sound ‚Äúclick‚Äù of the shutter on the final photo, the focus is changed, the photo is worse.  In addition, in poor lighting conditions, pictures are very blurry.  But in the sunshine or with the flash on, the quality of the pictures increases markedly. </p>

    <h2>  Front camera </h2><p>  The front camera, which in many devices is ‚Äúfor show‚Äù, delights inexperienced public.  Resolution 5 megapixels plus high-quality photos - the key to a good "selfie".  By the way, it was Huawei with the Ascend P6 model that became the ancestor of ‚Äúselfie backgrounds‚Äù.  Photos taken on the front camera of the Huawei G6, high quality. </p><p>  The camera interface is similar to stock Android, but has nuances.  A long tap on the shutter icon activates burst shooting (reminiscent of Apple devices).  Among the various shooting modes, it is worth noting: </p><ul><li>  autofocus in motion; </li><li>  response to a smile; </li><li>  activating voice recording. </li></ul><p>  In the "Gallery" you can make a simple photo montage. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  The base is Android 4.3.  However, Huawei has proposed its own shell Emotions UI 2.0 Lite.  According to reviews, it is very convenient, although less functional shells of competitors (iOS, Lenovo, MIUI and others).  Allows you to change the design theme, gesture control settings.  A smart energy manager has been installed.  The only difference between versions 1.6 and 2.0 is the presence of a simplified interface.  This mode enlarges the font and icons on the desktops, making it easier for the visually impaired and elderly people who are only accustomed to the world of smart phones. </p><h2>  Modifications </h2><p>  There are several versions that differ not in appearance, but in technical stuffing.  In the modification of the Huawei Ascend G6 U10, the Qualcomm MSM8212 processor is installed, the less efficient graphics Adreno 302, 4 Gb non-volatile memory.  The older version of Ascend G6 4G is distinguished by Qualcomm MSM8926 processor, <span>Adreno 305</span> graphics <span>,</span> 8 Gb of memory, the new high-speed standard for data transmission LTE 4G, NFC chip. </p><h2>  Additional functions </h2><p>  The filling of the smartphone is the most modern.  A <span>light sensor, an</span> accelerometer, and even a gyroscope, not typical of low-cost models, are installed.  A useful attribute is the GPS module.  According to reviews, it accurately shows the location.  Thanks to the Geotagging function, the exact coordinates of the place where they are taken can be attached to the photo.  In the Ascend G6 U10 modification, a complete list of communication modules is presented: HSPA, HSPA +, EDGE, LTE.  The most recent Bluetooth version is 4.0.  What is a modern smartphone without Wi-Fi?  Standards 802.11b, g, n are used. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The heart of the Huawei Ascend G6 is the 2-core Qualcomm Snapdragon.  The processor model depends on the modification of the Huawei Ascend G6.  We continue the review with a clock frequency: regardless of the chip used, it is 1.2 GHz.  Paired with it is the Adreno 305 (or 302) GPU processor, which successfully copes with moderately heavy games. </p><p>  Test programs showed the following results: </p><ul><li>  Vellamo Mobile Benchmark - 1969 (452) points; </li><li>  NenaMark 2 - 52.9 points; </li><li>  Quadrant - 7667 points; </li><li>  AnTuTu - 16,460 points. </li></ul><p>  The results are not the best, but for smartphones, average performance is good.  The mobile device copes well with everyday tasks, but it starts to slow down under heavy loads.  Most games pull without annoying brakes. </p><p>  1 GB of RAM is enough (many smartphones and tablets are ‚Äúcontent‚Äù with 512 MB).  The internal non-volatile memory of the Huawei Ascend G6 is 4Gb, or 8Gb.  In fact, the user has 909 MB of RAM and 990 MB of internal space.  The rest is occupied by the system.  Expandable memory with microSD cards (official support up to 32 GB). </p>

    <h2>  Work autonomy </h2><p>  The Huawei Ascend G6 is equipped with a battery that is too small in capacity: 2000 mAh.  In addition, it is not removable.  According to reviews, when used as a phone (hour of calls, SMS, applications, the Internet, a few casual games), the device lasts about a day without recharging.  AnTuTu Battery shows 330 points - a low indicator.  With very active use, constant communication on social networks, surfing the Internet, SMS, numerous calls, you can count on 12-14 hours of work.  The device charges quickly: only 3 hours. </p><h2>  Positive reviews: </h2><ul><li>  Good quality screen; </li><li>  Branded shell; </li><li>  Attractive design and ease of use; </li><li>  The amount of RAM. </li></ul><h2>  Negative feedback: </h2><ul><li>  Low speaker volume; </li><li>  Strange location of the headphone jack; </li><li>  Short working time; </li><li>  Autofocus camera braking; </li><li>  Belatedly triggering auto-adjust display brightness. </li><li></li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In general, Huawei Ascend G6 causes positive emotions.  The device is "friendly" to the person.  Convenient, shows a good picture, has good technical characteristics.  As they call it - ‚Äúworkhorse‚Äù.  Its stylish design simply cannot but like.  The smartphone will please fans of the "selfie".  The main camera is enough for family shooting on a sunny day.  It is important to monitor the level of charge and do not forget to take a charging device with you. </p>
