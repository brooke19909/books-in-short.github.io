  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Point, point ... Spot painting by contours</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the halls of the Hermitage and the Museum.  A.S.  Pushkin in Moscow, dedicated to the work of impressionist artists, there are amazing paintings written in the technique of pointillism.  If you come closer to them and peer into the fabric of painting, you will see that the painting is created by small dotted strokes.  Thanks to this, it seems that the paintings consist of microscopic mosaic elements assembled into a single unit by the hands of the master.  Based on this technique, applied artists invented their own, which is called point-to-point and is wonderfully used to paint various decorative objects, looking at which it seems that they are all decorated with small beads or beads that create complex multi-color overflows on the surface and weaving ornament. </p><p>  For dot painting, acrylic contours are used, which are usually circled around the pattern, painting glass or ceramics.  Spot painting by contours can be used to decorate transparent glassware, bottles, ceramics, wood and glass, furniture, and small decorative items. </p><p>  <span>Spot painting by</span> contours.  Mastery Basics </p><p>  The technique of painting with contours is not complicated, but it requires patience and accuracy.  To master it and acquire the necessary skills, you can start by painting simple glasses of transparent white glass.  For work you will need: glasses, glass contours (better than Decola) of different colors, a picture for painting, alcohol or acetone, cotton buds and discs. </p><p>  We insert the figure into the glass and fix it there so that it fits snugly against the glass.  The surface of the glass is degreased with acetone or alcohol.  Gently squeezing the contour out of the tube, apply the drawing with dots of different colors.  On wide, thickened lines we draw larger points, on very thin lines - smaller ones.  We regularly rub the nose of the tube with a cotton pad, removing the excess contour.  Places of the pattern that turned out to be uneven or blurry can be corrected by letting the contour dry, and then brushing off the uneven points with a knife or razor and applying them again.  After drawing all the lines with a contour of one color, we go to another color.  So, apply the whole picture.  Let it dry for at least a day.  Then we put the finished products in the oven for baking at a temperature of 150 - 170 degrees no more.  After 30-40 minutes, turn off the oven, when it cools down, remove the glasses.  The work is done.  Baking fixes the <span>contour drawing</span> and allows the use of glasses as intended.  You can safely wash them, pour liquid into them, etc. </p><p>  Spot painting by contours can decorate wood products.  The technique of applying the pattern is the same.  The sketch of the drawing is applied to a wooden surface with a soft pencil or a helium pen.  The finished painting with contours on wooden products is covered with a protective layer of acrylic varnish to protect it from mechanical damage.  Another wonderful basis for painting contours can be ordinary wax candles, which will be a unique decoration of a festive table or interior. </p><p>  Candle painting </p><p>  The spot painting by contours on candles can be thematic, dedicated to some significant date: birthday, wedding, anniversary, etc.  For drawing a special contour based on wax is used (for example, the company Kroil (Germany)).  First, the contours of the future painting are applied to the candle with a helium pen.  Then, along these contours, a colored contour is applied with a dot pattern, squeezing the paint from the tube.  To obtain smaller dots and a finer pattern, a metal tip is used, which can be made of aluminum itself.  Dot by dot, fill the whole picture.  Allow the work to dry.  The wax circuit dries quickly enough.  The pattern on the candle will melt along with it. </p><p>  Point painting by contours - requires a lot of stress, attention and accuracy.  But the result that will be obtained at the end of the work will be amazing.  This technique captivates with its unusualness, grace and originality. </p>
