There are many reasons for this: the strips do not appear or are poorly tinted, the test was done at the wrong time, poor-quality research material, and so on.  Modern digital technologies offer you reusable pregnancy tests, which are quite simple to use and are highly reliable.  In addition, there are a number of differences that force women to prefer this particular control method. </p><h2>  What are pregnancy tests? </h2><ol><li>  The most primitive and cheapest way to <span>diagnose pregnancy</span> is a test strip, which is also quite unreliable.  It should be carried out only in the mornings and lowered into the urine for no longer than 5 seconds, otherwise an unreliable result is possible.  For safety, gynecologists recommend conducting several such tests, and then compare their data. </li><li>  More accurate and easier to use are tablet tests, the design of which facilitates the principle of the procedure. </li><li>  Inkjet tests are more effective than previous ones.  They can be used at any time of the day or night, and pregnancy is determined from the first days of the delay. </li><li>  The blue test is a small stick that should be inserted into the vagina until it touches the uterine neck.  With a positive result, it should turn blue. </li><li>  Reusable electronic tests are considered the most effective, since they determine the presence of pregnancy as accurately as possible and make it possible to calculate <span>favorable days for conception.</span> </li></ol><h2>  General characteristics of reusable tests </h2>

At a minimum, such a device is more complicated than the already familiar paper strip with indicators, and its cost is much higher.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The developers claim that with the help of such modern technologies it is possible at least every day to get a 100% result and control the ovulation process.  In addition, the test contains additional functions that are useful for a pregnant woman.  Progress has come to the point that the expectant mother can even find out the preliminary date of the future birth, which is displayed on the scoreboard during the testing procedure. </p><h2>  Electronic test <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reusable Digital Pregnancy Test" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/355872.jpg?1395164669052" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Reusable pregnancy tests will help to avoid many misunderstandings, since a double interpretation of their results is simply impossible.  In the case of the birth of a new life, the ‚Äú+‚Äù sign is displayed on the device‚Äôs display, and in the absence of fertilization of the egg, the test shows a minus.  In this case, there are no doubts and no intermediate options. </p><p>  Another advantage of this method of diagnosing pregnancy is that at the time of the chemical reaction and subsequent processing of the indicators, an <span>hourglass is</span> displayed on the monitor <span>,</span> and after three minutes a result appears that does not change with time and is stored in the device‚Äôs memory for another day. </p><p>  The reusable Clearblue pregnancy test has been very popular lately, which shows a reliable result from the first day of the delay of menstruation.  Studies have shown that this device can recognize the content of <span>chorionic gonadotropin</span> in the urine a few days before the start of the alleged menstruation.  Reusable pregnancy tests can be used for early diagnosis.  However, after a few days, it is advisable to double-check the results. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to apply reusable pregnancy tests? </h2>

The principle is quite simple: under the current stream of urine, it is necessary to substitute the receiving end for several seconds, and then expect the result of this procedure.

    <p>  The test has a rather attractive modern design, but it is not possible to purchase it in every pharmacy, since the demand for such a product is still too small.  In addition, the financial side of the issue plays a significant role.  However, a reusable pregnancy test, the average price of which is about 750 rubles, still justifies its cost, because you can use it repeatedly. </p><h2>  The principle of reusable tests </h2>

In addition, the device is equipped with a small display, which indicates information about the proposed conception, and twenty removable cartridges on which it is necessary to place the test material, in our case, urine.

    <p>  More detailed test data can be displayed on a computer monitor, where they will be in the form of a spectrogram.  It is these indicators that allow you to quickly and accurately determine the expected date of birth of the baby, and if the result is negative, they enable the couple to determine the most favorable time for conception of a new life from the point of view of female physiology. </p><h2>  For whom are reusable tests designed? </h2>

Particularly in need of it are childless couples who have been trying to have a baby for a long time, because with the help of this invention it will be easier for them to control the ovulation process.

    <p>  However, despite the fact that the electronic pregnancy test is reusable, the 20 strips that are attached to it will end over time.  But for the wife and husband, who constantly live in expectation of a miracle, this will not become an obstacle to solving the problem.  Someday, a long-awaited pregnancy will surely come, which will be resolved by the safe birth of a healthy and strong baby, and any tests will become useless. </p>
