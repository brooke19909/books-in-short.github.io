In this small country, the traveler will find historical artifacts with a long history, a healing climate, impeccable service, entertainment for every taste.  Even the beach season in Israel lasts almost all year round. </p><h2>  Israel in the fall </h2><p>  Israel is especially good in the fall.  The holiday season is in full swing, but the intense heat is already subsiding.  September is a continuation of the summer, but less sultry.  In October, a beach holiday in Israel officially ends, and from the middle of November the rainy season begins.  The uniqueness of Israel is that in its small territory fit seven climate zones. </p>

    <p>  In Jerusalem, located closer to the Dead Sea, the weather is almost the same.  The most comfortable place to stay in Israel in October is Eilat, a wonderful resort on the Red Sea.  It is sunny even in November.  Although it is also cool at night, the weather allows you to bask in the sun and swim in the warm sea. </p><h2>  Things to do in October </h2><p>  According to tourist reviews, rest in Israel in October is a time of holidays.  For example, a festival of fire and balloons.  You can visit the Tel Aviv Cyclists' Festival or the Nethenia Classical Guitar Festival.  And in October, the Israelites celebrate Judgment Day.  At this time, strict observance of fasting and special rules of conduct apply.  It is on this holiday that locals change their cars for bicycles for one day.  October is also a parade of love, and the annual ancient festival of Sukkot. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Eilat - the best place for an autumn holiday </h2><p>  On the shore of the Gulf of Aqaba of the Red Sea, Eilat is located - the southernmost resort of Israel.  You need to go to Eilat for a vacation in the fall, at least for two reasons: this is the warmest place in Israel at this time of the year and this is the only Israeli resort on the Red Sea. </p>

    <p>  The weather in October is very comfortable: sunny, warm, almost no rain.  The resort is divided by the airport runway into the city itself and its tourist part.  This part of the city consists entirely of hotels, restaurants, cafes, shops and beaches.  The flight from Moscow to Eilat takes 4 hours.  An additional comfort for Russians is that almost the entire local population knows Russian. </p><h2>  Choosing a hotel in Eilat </h2><p>  Depending on the financial possibilities in Eilat, you can choose a hotel, a separate villa, rent an apartment, room or place in a hostel.  Israel is a country of not cheap, but very comfortable rest.  Although the budget option is also possible to choose.  In Eilat, hotels are located on the South and North Gulf coasts.  The North Coast hotels are mainly five-star network complexes with impeccable service and a host of additional amenities for different groups of tourists.  For example, one hotel specializes in healthy eating and active pastime of its guests.  Another is designed for families with children.  There are hotels <span>where smoking is forbidden,</span> noisy behavior, and there are hotels where you can have fun around the clock with friends at discos, in restaurants and bars. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  An example of specialization in different customer groups is the Herods Hotel, which consists of three buildings.  The first building is designed for couples with children, the second can not accommodate children, use phones, smoke, the third building is designed for very demanding tourists who prefer special amenities and privacy.  Hotels of this category amaze with luxury and comfort.  City four-star and three-star hotels are not so luxurious, but in terms of service they meet the best European standards.  City beaches belong to the municipality.  But almost every hotel has its own small beach, which rents from the city authorities.  Many complexes have their own relaxation areas, spas and pools.  Children's activities are also remarkably organized: there are special play areas and animator services in many hotels.  From almost any hotel you can reach the sea on foot. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Holidays at sea in October in Israel will be wonderful on any coast.  You can extend this summer in Eilat.  The local beachfront stretches for twelve kilometers.  The beaches are equipped with everything necessary for a good rest: sunbeds, umbrellas, awnings, deck chairs.  Near each vacation spot there are many small cafes and restaurants.  Eilat beaches, like the city, are divided into two main zones. </p>

    <p>  On the south coast lies a coral beach.  This place is very suitable for diving.  The colorful sea bottom with colorful corals and outlandish fish attracts lovers of sea diving.  Very popular is snorkeling.  You can dive yourself or hire a guide who will show you the most interesting places.

A substantial fine is provided for this.  On the North coast are sandy and pebble beaches with a comfortable gently sloping seabed.  There are wild beaches, mainly on the South Coast.  Special attention is paid to the dolphinarium beach.  It is good to spend time with children.  There are many exotic plants and animals in the dolphinarium, there are beautiful artificial ponds.

    <p>  Families with children will be interested in visiting the ornithological center.  A huge variety of birds live here.  The tour will be very informative.  Another great place for an unforgettable experience is Timna Park.  This is a natural phenomenon, consisting of multi-colored cliffs of bizarre forms, formed in different eras.  It is also worth visiting <span>the Masada fortress, the</span> monastery of St. Helena, stone mines.  From Eilat it is easy to make an excursion to the ancient city of Petra, Jerusalem, Jordan.  In October, holidays in Israel are best devoted to excursions.  More than a hundred city restaurants offer vacationers dishes of national, as well as European, Asian, American cuisine.  Eilat was created for tourists.  Therefore, a large number of night clubs and discos, including beach ones, are open here.  You can have a great time riding a yacht, sinking to the seabed or gliding along the waves on a sailing board. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Reviews of tourists who have already rested in a particular place are sometimes more important than advertising descriptions of travel companies.  If you carefully study the reviews, you can find answers to many questions and avoid unwanted surprises.  For example, before the trip, you can order and make an individual plan of excursions.  A personal guide will accompany you on a trip to tourist attractions.  Such a trip will not cost much more than a regular group tour.  But during the individual tour you can take your time, get answers to all questions and, if you wish, deviate from the route. </p>
