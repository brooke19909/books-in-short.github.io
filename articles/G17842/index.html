However, for both amateurs and professionals, the quality of both the device and the resulting pictures or videos is important.  In order not to be mistaken in the process of selecting a camera, you should carefully study all the offers that are on the market today, as well as carefully familiarize themselves with their characteristics.  Today we take a closer look at the <span>Sony Cyber-shot DSC</span> H300.  How to charge the camera?  What technical characteristics are inherent in it?  What quality of pictures or video will the user get as a result?  Is the device worth the money?  Who would be better off buying it?  You can find answers to all of the above and some other questions by reading this article. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony cyber shot dsc h300 professional reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42841/1798917.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  General information </h2><p>  Camera Sony Cyber-shot DSC H300 reviews of professionals refer to the category of budget cameras.  Despite this, the device has a number of unique characteristics that distinguish it from the group of similar models of devices of the initial stage.  For example, the <span>Sony Cyber-shot DSC</span> H300 looks very solidly complete with a large lens.  Nevertheless, this does not change its essence.  The device remains a modest ultrasound, which has a certain basic functionality and a good technical stuffing.  Among other things, one can highlight such advantages of the camera under consideration as a decent lens and control configuration.  Nevertheless, the Sony Cyber-shot DSC H300 is not a professional review.  Even if we consider only the budget segment.  The disadvantages of this camera are as follows: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  insufficiently good functioning of certain options; </li><li>  not too high quality of the final shots taken by the <span>Sony Cyber ‚Äã‚Äãshot DSC H300</span> (examples of photos on the Web confirm this fact). </li></ul><p>  The camera in question is great for amateur use or as the first device for a novice photographer. </p>

    <h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The technical and operational characteristics announced by the manufacturers of the Sony Cyber-shot DSC H300 photo camera are said to be incredibly attractive by professionals.  What is the reason for this?  The fact that competing companies are making more and more efforts in order to increase the capabilities of devices that are part of the budget line.  However, sometimes the situation for such manufacturers is not the best.  They can‚Äôt <span>jump above their heads</span> , which means that together with a rich set of options, the user gets weak basic components.  Is the situation the same with the Sony Cyber-shot DSC H300?  Reviews say no.  However, expecting too much is also not worth it.  So, the main characteristics of the camera in question: </p><ul><li>  Size - 12.3 by 8.3 by 8 centimeters. </li><li>  Weight - about 415 grams. </li><li>  Image resolution - 16.1 megapixels. </li><li>  The sensitivity range ranges from 80 to 1600. </li><li>  Burst shooting - per frame per second. </li><li>  No video finder. </li><li>  Ability to use one SD-memory card. </li><li>  Autofocus contrast. </li><li>  The minimum distance to the subject is 1 centimeter. </li><li>  The diagonal of the display is 3 inches. </li><li>  The video recording format is 1280 by 720. </li><li>  The resolution of the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äã460 thousand pixels. </li></ul><h2>  Lens data </h2><p>  The ultrasound must have the appropriate characteristics of the lens.  After all, it is precisely what capabilities optics have for the model in question that will determine how good quality images you get.  What do we have in this case?  The magnification of the lens is 21x.  As for the focus, its working distance, as a rule, is in the range from 25 to 525 millimeters with a step of 35 millimeters.  Of course, this data cannot be called record in any way, but if we talk about amateur photography using various formats, the parameters presented are quite enough.  As the Sony Cyber-shot DSC H300 review reports, manufacturers have specifically designed a wide angle in order to comfortably shoot landscapes.  In addition, with the help of a long focus, you can easily shoot a variety of distant objects without any problems. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Along with this, the lens of the model under consideration has a number of limitations characteristic of the devices of this category.  For example, low aperture.  In practice, this means that in poor light conditions the camera will not be able to fully compensate for this. </p><p>  Also, with a large focal length, some image degradation appears.  At the same time, even if you shoot at wide angles, the quality remains quite acceptable.  But over long distances it is better not to experiment. </p>

    <h2>  Functionality </h2><p>  The complex of settings and available functions is incredibly wide.  Is it any wonder?  Not recommended.  Why?  Unfortunately, it often happens that most of the declared capabilities are completely useless, since it cannot be used due to insufficient hardware capabilities. </p><p>  So, the model under consideration from the well-known company Sony has the SCN automatic mode.  When this operating format is activated, the user gains access to eleven shooting conditions.  Each of them provides special exposure and autofocus parameters.  Some people prefer the software use format, in which both the shutter speed and aperture are set up independently by the Sony Cyber-shot DSC H300 camera.  Customer reviews still show that many are used to manually control the diaphragm.  But the model in question upsets such users with the absolute absence of such a function.  Does this mean at least some Sony Cyber-shot DSC H300 camera settings?  Yes, but you can only configure it to open and close (full).  You cannot manually influence the intermediate positions.  A similar situation exists with the limitation of the optical part.  It works in one format within the entire range of acceptable values.  And only the shutter speed can be adjusted independently. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Ergonomics Reviews </h2><p>  How convenient is it to use the camera in question?  As previously noted, the camera cannot be called compact.  For some this is an advantage, for others it is rather a disadvantage.  The external device in question looks more like a SLR camera.  A large lens, a retractable flash, and a powerful grip come up with the idea.  This is a serious application not only for status, but also for the corresponding quality of the final pictures, overall functionality, reliability, which is supported not only by the appearance, but also by the real technical characteristics. </p><p>  But user feedback on the tactile sensations of using the camera is not so positive.  Unfortunately, the overall style of the camera does not match the material from which it is made.  So, the manufacturing company used rather cheap plastic in the manufacturing process, in which rubber elements were included in some places.  It is the latter that ensure the ergonomics of this model of camera.  A large pen is also pleasing to customers, thanks to which it is very convenient to use the device with just one hand.  The buttons on the panel are also placed very conveniently.  Their configuration is comfortable for the user.  This is partly due to the fact that, thanks to the large case of the model, the engineers did not have to be constrained in the implementation of the button layout. </p>

    <h2>  Image Quality </h2><p>  As you know, the quality of the images you get on the output depends on the capabilities of the CDD matrix.  In the device in question, it has a fairly modest size.  Its resolution is 16.1 megapixels.  Even if we take into account only budget models, these indicators are not at least somewhat outstanding.  Accordingly, the specified parameters determine the future quality of photos. </p><p>  Some users feel that the quality of the pictures decreases as the ISO sensitivity increases.  And indeed it is.  However, such an effect is characteristic of absolutely all models of the category in question.  As practice has shown, for the Sony Cyber-shot DSC H300 camera, the instruction recommends not setting its level above 400 units.  If this recommendation is not followed, then the quality of the pictures will be very reminiscent of as if you took them using an ordinary mobile phone.  A noise reduction option is also present.  So, when establishing the optimal settings and subject to ideal conditions, the camera will not give noise.  However, this function invariably makes the pictures less detailed, and sometimes it simply blurs the main objects. </p><h2>  Video quality </h2><p>  For video shooting with the Sony Cyber-shot DSC H300, we recommend that you don‚Äôt take it seriously.  Indeed, for developers it is extremely difficult of the modest ability of the camera hardware to achieve a really good result.  And in the case of the device in question, a miracle did not happen.  Despite the fact that a combination of parameters such as thirty frame rates, the presence of autofocus and the format of 1280x729 really hint at the possibility of obtaining a good result, the quality of the finished video material is significantly inferior to even not too well-known analogues of the device.  For example, as the reviews describe the Sony Cyber-shot DSC H300, frustrating image darkening and a significant reduction in sharpness are frustrating.  Nevertheless, the stabilization function can to some extent improve the situation. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, experts recommend the camera in question to be acquired by amateurs or newcomers to photography.  If shooting is your profession, what you earn for your life, then you should not buy this model.  In this case, it would be better to opt for another class of devices, somewhat more expensive, but the quality of the images can be called truly professional. </p><p>  As for the device in question, it has good technical characteristics.  For example, amateur users highlight a number of obvious advantages, among which are the following: affordable cost, decent quality of sound, video and pictures, good color reproduction, excellent image stabilizer, quite powerful flash, high-quality panorama, good zoom.  In general, the device meets the parameters that the manufacturer claims. </p><p>  However, it is also impossible to call it fully user-friendly for operation.  Why?  Buyers highlight a number of shortcomings, including the lack of a mount for the lid, which significantly interferes with the video process;  lack of macro mode;  weak batteries;  long focus;  the presence of noise in the final pictures;  due to its considerable weight and impressive size, it is not very comfortable to wear.  If you also can‚Äôt put up with the presence of the listed items, then it‚Äôs better not to choose this model. </p><p>  But what if your Sony Cyber-shot DSC H300 breaks down?  Do-it-yourself repair is not recommended.  It is important to remember that the warranty applies only to equipment that they did not try to fix on their own.  Therefore, if you carefully open the case, carefully return everything to its place, and after that you want to return the device to a service center for warranty repairs, you will not accept such a camera.  Non-interference in the internal structure of the device is a prerequisite for meeting the requirements of the manufacturer for free repair.  Therefore, if you do not have specific professional knowledge and practical skills that relate to the device of this kind of apparatus, we recommend that you do not rely on your own strengths and do not try to fix the malfunction yourself.  This will protect not only yourself, but also your camera from unskilled interference. </p><p>  So what to look for when choosing the right device?  Oddly enough, the name of the manufacturer does not always guarantee the quality of the goods.  Therefore, it would be correct to carefully study the technical parameters of the camera.  First, determine for yourself what you want to use the new device for.  In accordance with this, study the information about him, as well as real user reviews. </p>
