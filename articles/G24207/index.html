One of these images that goes through the centuries is Themis.  This is a modern symbol of the legal and the entire legal system, the image of the ancient goddess symbolizes the judicial system in many countries of the world. </p><h2>  Ancient gods </h2><p>  The idea that justice is a privilege of the deity, hovered in ancient Egypt.  The famous <span>goddess Maat</span> (Ma), who is the eye of Osiris, was a symbol of truth and justice. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="goddess of justice mythology" class="if" height="233" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1126861.jpg" width="238"></div>  The symbol of the Egyptian goddess was a feather.  Her figurine was an obligatory attribute of the judge‚Äôs attire - she was hung around her neck, believing that the <span>wisdom of the goddess</span> would help to make a right and fair decision.  Other incarnations of justice had similar features.  In general, although the court has always personified a man, justice in many religions personified a woman - the daughter, wife or sister of God.

    <h2>  Goddess of justice </h2><p>  The mythology of ancient times did not escape this trend and also made the goddess a symbol of justice.  A feminine image of truth and justice is present in later religions.  Themis is the goddess of the pantheon of ancient Greece, personifying law and order in all earthly affairs.  She came from the Titans and was the daughter of Gaia and Uranus.  The goddess Themis is the first wife of Zeus.  Moira, the arbiter of fate, was born from marriage with the lord of Olympus.  Themis always sits on the right hand of Zeus, gives him advice, announces the verdict. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="goddess themis" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1126855.jpg" width="502"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Of course, such an important deity could not do without its own symbols.  The main attributes of justice were scales and a sword.  Themis Libra is an emblem of justice, a balanced decision.  The sword is a symbol of the <span>inevitability of punishment.</span>  These symbols are still used in judicial symbols of different countries. </p><h2>  Themis and Justice </h2><p>  Like any Greek deity, in the Roman pantheon, the goddess of justice had her own double.  She turned out to be the great Justice - the Roman goddess of justice.  The modern figure symbolizing a fair trial is more likely just Justice, not Themis.  This judgment is supported by an additional attribute - a blindfold, which symbolizes equality and impartiality.  Themis among the Greeks judged with open eyes.  So a curious incident arose: in the modern world, the goddess of justice is called Themis, and portrayed as Justice. </p><h2>  Themis Image </h2><p>  In general, the modern goddess Themis is necessarily portrayed as a woman of full dignity, in a long mantle, with a blindfold. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Themis is" class="if" height="355" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1126858.jpg" width="224"></div>  In her left hand she has scales, in her right she holds a sword.  The point of the sword is drawn, but lowered.  The sword and scales are among the main symbols of justice, whose history is so ancient that it would be naive to attribute such a visual emblem only to the ancient Greeks.  Most likely, this emblem came to the shores of the Aegean Sea from some ancient, half-forgotten religion.  The later symbols are the bandage and mantle - they are present only in Roman Justice.

The sword held by Themis is a symbol of just punishment.  the sword‚Äôs edge is double-edged - because the law not only punishes the guilty, but also prevents crimes.  It is also symbolic that the goddess holds the sword in her right hand - it is a symbol of the ‚Äúright cause‚Äù, of faith in justice. </p><p>  Libra is the oldest emblem of measure and justice.  On the scales of justice, evidence of guilt and innocence, good and evil, is constantly balanced.  The scales are in the left hand, which is responsible for intuition and sensations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Themis scales" class="if" height="257" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1126862.jpg" width="385"></div>

    <p>  The mantle is a ritual ceremonial decoration designed to perform certain ceremonial actions, in this case justice, of which Themis is a symbol.  This attire emphasizes how important it is for a judge in the performance of her duties to wear a robe, leaving a civilian dress for worldly affairs. </p><p>  <span>The blindfold</span> symbolizes impartiality.  A fair court should turn a blind eye to property and class differences and consider only fair facts.  When considering a case, the judge must be blind, in the sense that both the plaintiff and the defendant are only reflection of the facets of the law. </p><p>  Such a multifaceted perception of the symbols of the goddess of justice only emphasizes the ancient desire of mankind for justice.  And the divine essence of Themis reflects the eternal desire for a final, higher court, which, according to many beliefs, awaits us at the end of our life's journey. </p>
