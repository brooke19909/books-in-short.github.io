They reflect the essence of Russian man, his attitude to the homeland.  Ilya Muromets, Alyosha Popovich, Gorynya, Dobrynya Nikitich and many others devoted their lives to the service of Russia.  They fought with the countless enemies of our people, protecting and protecting ordinary people.  The exploits of the Russian heroes will forever remain in memory - in the form of epics, songs and legends, as well as another epic composed by eyewitnesses of those events.  It is they who make us proud of our people and the land that nurtured such giants. </p><h2>  The history of the heroes in Russia </h2><p>  Probably, each of us at school or on television heard stories about mighty and invincible heroes.  Their exploits inspire, inspire hope and make you proud of your own people, their strength, dedication and wisdom. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="Feats of Russian Bogatyrs" class="if uuid-559305" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19074/559305.jpg?1552375398"></div><p>  Many historians divide the Russian heroes into older and younger.  If you follow the epic and epics, you can clearly draw the line between the Old Slavic demigods and already Christian heroes.  The ancient Russian heroes are the omnipotent Svyatogor, the mighty Verni-Gora, Mikula Selyaninovich, Danube and others. </p><p>  They are distinguished by their unbridled natural power.  These heroes are the personification of the deified forces of nature and its invincibility.  In later sources, they are given a somewhat negative color.  They become heroes who cannot and do not want to use their own power for the good.  Most often, these are just destroyers, boasting power in front of other heroes and ordinary people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This was done in order to push people to a new world - the Christian one.  The hero-destroyers are replaced by the hero-creators, defenders of the Russian Orthodox land.  These are Dobrynya Nikitich, Nikita Kozhemyak, Peresvet and many, many others.  One cannot but recall the exploits of the Russian hero Ilya Muromets.  This is a favorite image for many writers and artists.  After recovering from a serious illness, the hero went to defend his own land, and then retired to the monks. </p><h2>  The most famous Russian heroes and their exploits </h2><p>  Our history contains many famous names.  Probably, everyone knows the phrase: "And the glorious, as well as strong heroes in the Russian land."  Although our people are for the most part not warlike, they prefer to work on the earth, but from ancient times powerful heroes and defenders of the Fatherland came out of its midst.  These are Svyatogor, Mikula Selyaninovich, Danube Ivanovich, Peresvet, Sadko and many, many others.  These heroes shed their own blood for their native land and stood up for the protection of civilians in the most troubled times. </p><p>  It was about them that the epics and songs took shape.  At the same time, over time, they corresponded many times.  They added new and new facts and details.  Even the character of the heroes underwent significant changes. </p><p>  The adoption of <span>Christianity in Russia was</span> especially influenced by this process <span>.</span>  This divided our history, led to the denial and condemnation of everything old.  Therefore, in the images of more ancient heroes you can now see negative traits.  We are talking about Svyatora, Relight, Danube Ivanovich. </p><p>  They were replaced by heroes of the new generation.  And almost all of them served the princes, not the people.  The most famous heroes of the Russian land are Ilya Muromets, Dobrynya Nikitich and Alyosha Popovich.  They were praised in songs and epics.  They are depicted in the famous painting by Vasnetsov.  It is them who are most known to children, thanks to numerous cartoons and fairy tales.  What have they done?  And why are they always portrayed together? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="Russian ancient heroes" class="if uuid-563221" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/563221.jpg?1552375398"></div><p>  According to the assurances of many historians, these three famous Russian heroes have never met.  According to some reports, Dobrynya lived in the 15th century, Ilya in the 12th, and Alyosha, the youngest of the heroes, in the 13th century. </p><p>  Victor Mikhailovich depicted them all together as a symbol of the invincibility and invincibility of the Russian people.  The exploits of the three heroes were accomplished at different times, but historians agree that most of them are quite real.  For example, the same Nightingale the Robber, the war with the Pechenegs, the Tatar prince Tugarin took place to be in reality.  This means that it is logical to assume that great acts were also committed. </p><h2>  Alyosha Popovich and his exploits </h2><p>  In the picture of Vasnetsov, this young man is depicted with a bow and arrow, and near the saddle you can see the harp, which speaks of his cheerful disposition.  Sometimes he is reckless, like any young guy, and sometimes cunning and wise, like an experienced warrior.  Like many heroes of the Russian land, it is, rather, a collective image.  But this character also has a real prototype. </p><p>  According to some reports, this is the son of Rostov's Orthodox priest Leonty.  But residents of the <span>Poltava region</span> (Ukraine) also consider him a fellow countryman.  Local traditions say that he often visited local fairs and helped people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  According to another version, this is the famous Rostov hero Alexander.  He lived in the 12-13th century and was a prominent historical figure.  Often his image is intertwined with another, no less noticeable character of epics, Volga Svyatoslavich. </p><p>  The glorious exploits of the Russian heroes will be incomplete without the legends about how Alyosha converged in a battle with Tugarin himself.  This Polovtsian khan is the real historical face of the Tugorkan.  And in some epics Alyosha Popovich fought with him several times.  Also, this hero earned fame in the numerous internecine wars of that time.  And he died in the famous battle of Kalka (1223). </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="Bogatyrs - defenders of the Russian land" class="if uuid-563207" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/563207.jpg?1552375398"></div><h2>  Ilya Muromets </h2><p>  This is perhaps the most famous and revered hero in Russia.  He embodies all the positive features of an <span>epic hero.</span>  There is very little confirmed information about him, but it is reliably known that he was numbered among <span>Russian saints.</span> </p><p>  This man spent his childhood and youth practically without movement, since he suffered from a serious paralytic disease.  However, at the age of 30, Ilya was healed and fully recovered.  This fact was confirmed by many serious scientists who conducted research on the remains of the saint.  Therefore, the exploits of the Russian hero Ilya Muromets begin at a fairly mature age. </p><p>  This character has become best known to all adults and children thanks to the epic which tells of his battle with the Nightingale the Robber.  This criminal controlled one of the main routes to Kiev - the capital of ancient Russia.  Prince Mstislav, who ruled at that time, instructed the combatant Ilya Muromets to accompany the next shopping convoy.  Meeting with the robber, the hero defeated him and cleared the road.  This fact is documented. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="The exploits of the Russian hero Ilya Muromets" class="if uuid-559315" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19074/559315.jpg?1552375398"></div><p>  In addition to this, other victories of the Russian hero Ilya Muromets are also known.  Epic stories about the battle of the hero with the idol Pogany.  So, perhaps, they called the rapist-nomad.  There is also a story about the fight against Baba-Gorynka and her own son. </p><p>  In his declining years, Ilya, having been seriously wounded and tired of such a military life, retired to the monastery.  But there he could not find peace.  Researchers note that the monk hero died in battle at the age of 40-55 years. </p><h2>  Great Svyatogor </h2><p>  This is one of the most famous and mysterious heroes.  Before his glory, even the victories of the Russian hero Ilya Muromets fade.  His name is fully consistent with appearance.  Usually he is represented as a mighty giant. </p><p>  We can say that there are quite a few reliable epics about this hero.  And they are all connected with death.  However, Svyatogor says goodbye to life not in an unequal battle with numerous enemies, but in a dispute with irresistible and unknown power. </p><p>  One of the legends says that the hero found a "bag of change".  The hero tried to move her, but died, without moving the thing.  As it turned out, in this bag was all the ‚Äúearthly burden‚Äù. </p><p>  Another legend tells of the journey of Svyatogor with Ilya Muromets.  Here the change of ‚Äúgenerations‚Äù of heroes is shown.  One day, friends find an empty coffin.  The prophecy on him read: whoever is destined for fate will fall into it.  Ilya, he was great.  And when Svyatogor lay down in a coffin, he was covered with a lid, and he could not escape.  Despite all the power of the giant, the tree did not succumb to him.  The main feat of Svyatogor the hero lies in the fact that he transferred all his strength to Ilya Muromets. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="Russian folk heroes" class="if uuid-563220" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/563220.jpg?1552375398"></div><h2>  Nikitich </h2><p>  This hero, depicted together with Ilya Muromets and Alyosha Popovich, is one of the most revered and famous in Russia.  In almost all epics, it is inextricably linked with Prince Vladimir Svyatoslavovich.  At the same time, it is believed that the latter is his own uncle.  In history, Dobrynya is a prominent statesman, whose advice many nobles listened to. </p><p>  However, in epics it is, rather, a collective image, which has the features of a mighty Russian hero.  The exploits of the hero Dobrynia Nikitich consist in the fight against numerous enemy troops.  But his main act is the battle with the Serpent Gorynych.  The famous painting by Vasnetsov depicts the battle of the defender of the Russian land with a 7-headed dragon, however, the plot was built on a real basis.  ‚ÄúSnake‚Äù used to be called the enemy.  And the nickname "Gorynych" indicates its origin or habitat - the mountains. </p><p>  There were also legends telling about how Dobrynya found a wife for himself.  Historians say that she was a foreigner.  Nastasya Nikulichna (in other versions - Mikulishna) had good physical data.  They began to measure their strength, and after the victory of the hero, the girl became his wife. </p><p>  Like all the exploits of the epic heroes, the activities of Dobrynia Nikitich are associated with the service of the Prince and the People.  That is why it is set as an example, compose fairy tales, songs and epics, drawing it as a hero and liberator. </p><h2>  Volkh Vseslavievich: prince-wizard </h2><p>  This hero is more likely known as a sorcerer and werewolf.  He was the prince of Kiev.  And the legends about him are like a fairy tale.  Even the birth of the Magus is shrouded in mysticism.  It is said that his mother conceived him from Veles, who appeared to her in the form of an ordinary snake.  The birth of a hero was accompanied by thunder and lightning.  His children's toys were a golden helmet and a damask club. </p><p>  Like many Russian folk heroes, he often spent time with the squad.  They say that at night he turned into a wild wolf and got food for soldiers in the forest. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="Bogatyrs of the Russian land" class="if uuid-559317" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19074/559317.jpg?1552375398"></div><p>  The most famous legend about the Magus Vseslavievich is the narrative of the victory over the Indian king.  Once the hero heard that he was plotting evil against his homeland.  He took advantage of witchcraft and defeated an alien army. </p><p>  The real prototype of this hero is Prince Vseslav Polotsky.  He was also considered a sorcerer and a werewolf, also took the cunning of the city and ruthlessly killed the inhabitants.  And the serpent played an important role in the life of the prince. </p><p>  Historical facts and traditions are mixed into one.  And the feat of Volkhv Vseslavievich began to be praised in epics, like other glorious exploits of the Russian heroes. </p><h2>  Mikula Selyaninovich - a simple peasant </h2><p>  This hero is one of the representatives of the <span>most ancient Slavic</span> heroes.  His image is a reflection of the legends of the god-plowman, protector and patron of the Russian land and peasants.  It was he who gave us the opportunity to cultivate the fields and use the gifts of nature.  He drove out the Destroyer Giants. </p><p>  According to legend, there lived a hero on the Drevlyansk land.  Unlike other ancient knights who came from princes, Mikula Selyaninovich represented the estate of peasants.  He devoted his whole life to working in the field.  While other heroes-defenders of the Russian land fought with a sword in their hands.  This has its own meaning, because all the benefits of the state and people come precisely from hard and daily work. </p><p>  The most famous works, which describe the nature and life of Mikula Selyaninovich, are epics about Volga and Mikul, as well as about Svyatogor. </p><p>  For example, in the story of the werewolf prince, the hero enters the service in a squad assembled to withstand the Varangian invasion.  But before that, he chuckles at Volga and his soldiers: they cannot even pull out his plow, which is stuck in the ground. </p><p>  The exploits of the Russian heroes have always been glorified by the people.  But you can also come across disregard for heroes who, having tremendous power, cannot correctly apply it.  An example of such an attitude can be called the epic "Svyatogor and Mikula Selyaninovich."  Two principles are opposed here - creative and destructive. </p><p>  Svyatogor wanders around the world and does not know where to use his own power.  One day he meets Mikula with a bag that a warrior-warrior cannot lift and is torn.  There is all the "earthly burden."  In this story you can see the superiority of ordinary labor over military force. </p><h2>  Vasily Buslaev </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="Russian folk heroes" class="if uuid-559320" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19074/559320.jpg?1552375398"></div><p>  This hero is not like the rest.  He is a rebel, always goes against the general opinion and order.  Despite the superstition of ordinary people, he does not believe in signs and predictions.  At the same time, this is the image of a defender-hero. </p><p>  Vasily Buslaev is from Veliky Novgorod.  That is why in the epics about him there is so much local flavor.  There are two stories about him: ‚ÄúVasily Buslaevich in Novgorod‚Äù and ‚ÄúVasily Buslaevich went to pray.‚Äù </p><p>  His mischief and lack of control can be traced everywhere.  For example, choosing a squad, he arranges several extraordinary tasks.  As a result, there are 30 well done people who support Vasily in everything. </p><p>  Buslaev‚Äôs deeds are not the feats of Russian heroes who followed the rules and in all respects obeyed the prince, respecting the traditions and beliefs of ordinary people.  He revered only power.  Therefore, his activity is a wild life and fights with local husbands. </p><h2>  Overexposure </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="Feats of Epic Bogatyrs" class="if uuid-559322" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19074/559322.jpg?1552375398"></div><p>  The name of this hero is closely connected with the battle on the Kulikovo field.  This is a legendary battle in which countless glorious warriors and boyars were killed.  And Peresvet, like many other heroes, defenders of the Russian land, stood in front of the enemy with a chest. </p><p>  Scientists are still arguing whether he really was.  Indeed, according to legend, <span>Peresvet (Alexander),</span> together with his brother Andrei, was sent to help Dmitry Donskoy by Sergius of Radonezh himself.  The feat of this hero was that it was he who inspired the Russian army to battle.  He was the first to engage in battle with a representative of the hordes of Mamaev - Chelubey.  With virtually no weapons and armor, Peresvet defeated the enemy, but fell dead with him. </p><p>  The study of earlier sources suggests the unreality of this character.  In the Trinity Monastery, in which Peresvet, according to history, was a novice, there are no records of such a person.  In addition, it is known that Sergius of Radonezh could not meet with Prince Dmitry immediately before the battle. </p><p>  But almost all the exploits of the Russian heroes - one way or another - are partially invented or exaggerated by the storytellers.  These stories raised morale, nurtured <span>national identity.</span> </p>
