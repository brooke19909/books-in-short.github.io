At a price of $ 230, the Fujifilm FinePix XP70 cannot be called a budget one, but it is half the price of some high-end compacts of this type.  And this is not due to the reduction of many functions.  XP70 is dustproof, capable of operating at depths of up to 10 m, withstands drop from a height of 1.5 m and frosts down to -10 ¬∞ C.  Wireless Wi-Fi connection, Full HD video recording, 10 fps burst shooting and HDR capture are also available.  Thanks to 16.4 MP and 5x optical zoom with image stabilization, the camera‚Äôs characteristics allow it to compete with more expensive competitors, but can it provide comparable performance? </p><h2>  Fujifilm FinePix XP70: design overview </h2><p>  There is no doubt that this is an action camera.  With catchy color options - bright blue, yellow or orange - the camera looks at home on the beach, and not in more formal conditions.  In addition, the XP70 is really nice to use.  A bright ribbed rubber comb on the front and a good grip for the thumb ensure the safety of the device when shooting.  You just need to be on the alert so that your left hand does not accidentally fall into the field of view of the lens, which is surprisingly easy, given its positioning in the upper corner. </p>

    <p>  There is no need to worry that the XP70 will be exposed to external influences, as the camera can easily tolerate water and other hazards.  You just should not expect that the glossy plastic case will avoid scratches, because, unlike higher-end cameras, the model is not protected from pressure. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Fujifilm FinePix XP70 is designed for a relatively modest 10-meter dive and features a dual-lock cover to protect the batteries and memory card slot, which is very difficult to accidentally open when the camera is underwater. </p><p>  The controls are kept to a minimum, but they are well placed and suitable for shooting with gloves on.  At the back is the standard navigation bar, which also allows you to control the flash, self-timer, macro and exposure compensation.  Underneath is a Wi-Fi activation key.  Two buttons control the zoom, and although they are not elastic enough, they do their job perfectly, leaving space on the top panel for the generous size of the shutter button, as well as the switch and video button. </p>

    <h2>  Display </h2><p>  Fujifilm FinePix XP70 sacrificed the characteristics of the LCD screen sacrificed low cost camera.  The size of the 2.7-inch display is smaller than the standard for most cameras with a reinforced 3.0 ‚Äùdesign, but with a resolution of 460 thousand pixels, the image preview is pretty clear.  Limited viewing angles are more annoying, resulting in a lack of color accuracy and contrast displays of higher quality.  You will have to turn off the automatic adjustment of the screen brightness so that on a summer day the XP70 monitor can cope with direct sunlight. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Functionality </h2><p>  Preparing to shoot the Fujifilm FinePix XP70 is simple - just press the button in the center of the navigation bar at the back to access the shooting menu.  It is a pity that this cannot be done directly.  There are many great options to choose from.  Scene Recognition mode automatically applies the appropriate scene to the focusing subject of the camera.  And to avoid additional image processing, you can switch to standard auto mode. </p>

    <p>  Exposure metering The XP70 usually allows you to get exactly the right shots, but if you need to apply exposure compensation, the Program AE mode is useful for this, which will also help you adjust the ISO sensitivity and white balance.  Usually, the last function can be provided to electronics, because in this case any unpleasant surprises or shades of color rarely occur.  HDR mode allows you to capture a larger dynamic range of high-contrast scenes.  There is also a Motion Panorama 360 shooting mode and attractive advanced filter effects - Toy Camera, Miniature, Dynamic Tones, and Fisheye. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Like GoPro models, Fuji sought to flaunt the action features of the Fujifilm FinePix XP70, which consisted of recording HD video with a wide viewing angle.  The problem is that the focal length of 28 mm in the 35 mm equivalent is too narrow for this, so the manufacturer has provided a wide-angle converter ACL-XP70, which is attached to the tripod socket and gives the camera the appearance of a bug-eyed monster.  This accessory for Fujifilm FinePix XP70 allows you to shoot video, but costs $ 70, which makes the action camera mode less attractive. </p><p>  The camera is not designed for macro photography, because its minimum focal length is 9 cm. This is disappointing, since many high-end amplified cameras support 1-cm macro.  But even at 9 cm, scene recognition does not always apply the necessary settings, manual correction may be required. </p>

    <h2>  Wireless connection </h2><p>  A feature you don‚Äôt have to pay extra for is Wi-Fi, which allows you to transfer images to a mobile device.  Communication works amazingly fast - transferring a full resolution image takes about 5 seconds.  There is no NFC, so you will have to pair the camera with a Wi-Fi access point manually, and, unlike some competing systems, the Fuji implementation will not allow you to remotely control the XP70 from a smartphone or tablet. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The XP70 is ready to shoot in about 1.5 seconds.  and does not waste time on autofocus.  In good light, the camera fires almost instantly, although under less optimal conditions you will have to wait a couple of seconds for it to capture the subject.  This is significantly slower than the more expensive Olympus TG-3 or Ricoh WG-4, but the speed and reliability of the XP70 are slightly behind. </p>

    <h2>  Duration of work </h2><p>  Finally, it is worth mentioning the battery life of the Fujifilm FinePix XP70 or rather its absence.  Fuji rates it with 210 shots, which seems insignificant compared to the 300 frames of the XP200.  According to user reviews, after 1 day of shooting, the XP70's charge level becomes extremely low, which is hardly ideal for an action camera that is designed to be used in places remote from the mains. </p><h2>  Image quality </h2><p>  At a maximum setting of 16 megapixels, the average image size is about 7 MB.  The quality of the photographs impresses with its vivid color rendition, which manages to avoid unrealistic.  The CMOS sensor provides decent detail at close range, although distant objects, such as landscapes, are subject to smoothing due to the operation of the noise reduction system.  The flip side to this is the relatively low image noise at higher sensitivity.  Even with ISO 1600 there are practically no color spots, although the graininess is clearly visible, it disappears when the frame size is reduced to 50%.  You have to pay for this with a decrease in detail.  At ISO 800, the situation improves markedly, because a balance is maintained between graininess and preservation of details.  ISO 400 and below give fairly low noise levels. </p>

    <p>  The dynamic range of the Fujifilm FinePix XP70 is said by owners to be less impressive because the bright areas of high-contrast scenes are often overexposed as the camera tries to achieve an overall exposure balance.  Activating the HDR mode may help in this situation. </p><p>  High-contrast scenes show a moderate amount of chromatic aberration and lens flare when the lens is facing the sun.  At a wide angle, the optics give a slight barrel-like distortion, but the sharpness in the corners corresponds to the center of the frame. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  The cost of the model reaches half the price of some compact cameras with a reinforced structure, but the camera offers much more.  Its 10-meter water resistance does not quite match the capabilities of the Nikon AW120 or Ricoh WG-4, but if underwater shooting is not the goal, then this is unlikely to be critical.  The shockproof rating of the camera is about 25% lower, but it is enough to withstand a fall from a normal height. </p><p>  Fujifilm FinePix XP70 reviews praise for the uncompromisingly high image quality that matches the best reinforced compacts.  Bright colors and accurate exposure make the pictures attractive, with low light sensitivity the detail is high, and at higher ISO settings the noise is relatively modest.  Lubrication of parts and limited dynamic range are problems, but you can pay a lot more and get similar results. </p><p>  Many creative effects, wireless photo sharing, Full HD recording and burst speed are additional features of the XP70, as well as excellent ergonomics and a bright screen.  It is a pity that the macro mode is average at best, and the pictures are not marked with the coordinates of the location, but this is a consequence of a fair compromise that allowed us to lower the price. </p>
