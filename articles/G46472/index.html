The young king, despite his abilities and strong character, from the very beginning of the reign needed help and advice in choosing the direction, methods and means for his transformations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="franz lefort" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29279/1115353.jpg" width="406"></div>  He found support among his compatriots who understood the need for change, and among foreigners, in whose lifestyle and way of thinking he saw certain features of the new country that he was building.  Franz Lefort was one of the faithful companions of Peter the Great, who, to the best of his ability, faithfully served the sovereign and his new homeland.

    <h2>  From a family of merchants </h2><p>  The ancestors of the Petrine admiral came from Piedmont, a province in northern Italy.  Their surname first sounded like Lefortti, then, after they moved to Switzerland, they were remade in the French fashion - Le Fort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lefort Franz Yakovlevich" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29279/1115363.jpg" width="374"></div>

A merchant career was waiting for Francois, who was born in 1656 in Geneva and the youngest of the seven sons of Jacob Le Fort.  At the insistence of his father, Franz Lefort, after graduating from the Geneva collegium (secondary school) in 1670, went to Marseille to study business. </p><h2>  Born for exploits </h2><p>  Tall, handsome, physically strong, clever and quick-witted, cheerful and energetic young man hardly imagined his future life as standing at the counter or sitting at the counter.  Franz Lefort, whose biography was supposed to be a repetition of the successful life path of his father and immediate relatives, fled from a merchant, who was called to teach him the basics of business, to the garrison fortress of Marseille, where he enlisted in the military service as a cadet. </p><p>  Enraged by the willfulness of his son, Jacob Lefort demands the return of the offspring home.  Strict Calvinist education does not allow Franz to disobey the head of the family, and upon arrival in Geneva he nevertheless proceeds to work in the shop. </p><p>  About three years passed before Franz received permission from his father and relatives to go to military service to the Duke of Courland.  At the end of the summer of 1675 he left Geneva to take part in the hostilities at the Franco-Dutch War Theater. </p><h2>  At the invitation of the Russian Tsar </h2><p>  The European wars of that time were usually waged by the forces of the Landsknecht, invited by the numerous rulers of small state formations.  ‚ÄúSoldier of fortune‚Äù of the XVII century was Franz Lefort.  A brief biography of such military experts often represented a series of trips in search of a better share. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the Netherlands, peace talks began.  Deprived of his inheritance after the death of his father, Lefort accepts the invitation of the Dutch Lieutenant Colonel Van Frosten, who assembled the team at the invitation of the Russian Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich, and at the end of 1675 he ends up in Arkhangelsk, and the next year in Moscow. </p><h2>  German settlement </h2><p>  <span>Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich</span> died by that time, his son, Fedor, was on the throne.  Three years passed before Lefort was accepted to military service with the rank of captain.  During this time, he settled in the capital of Muscovy, settled in the German settlement, made friends with the Europeans who lived in Moscow for a long time.  One of those who willingly mastered the language, tried to understand local customs and became Franz Lefort.  The nationality of the inhabitants of the foreign settlement was diverse.  Franz enjoyed a special location with the Scotsman Patrick Gordon, the future Peter's general.  He even managed to marry the daughter of an Englishman, Lt. Col. Suguet - Elizabeth. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="franz lefort biography" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29279/1115327.jpg" width="403"></div>

    <p>  At the end of 1678, Lefort (Franz Yakovlevich - so they began to call him in Muscovy) was appointed commander of the company, part of the garrison of Kiev, commanded by Gordon.  For two years of service, he, in addition to the garrison service in Kiev, took part in campaigns against the Crimeans.  Lefort enjoyed the location of Prince Vasily Golitsin, known for pro-Western moods. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In 1681, Lefort was released on vacation to his homeland.  In Geneva, relatives persuaded him not to return to the barbarian country, but to continue his service in Europe.  But Francois, speaking well of Moscow, returned to the German settlement. </p><h2>  Crimean campaigns </h2><p>  Upon his return to Moscow, he found a change in the Kremlin.  After the death of Tsar Fedor, his brothers Ivan and Peter were married to the kingdom, under the regency of their sister, the imperious and ambitious Sophia.  Prince Golitsin was her favorite and, in order to strengthen the authority of the tsarina, undertook two campaigns against the Crimean Turks.  Both campaigns were unsuccessful due to poor training, but Lefort, who was inseparable from the commander in chief, proved himself a skilled officer and was soon promoted to colonel. </p><p>  Some historians have the opinion that the failures of the second Crimean campaign (1689) were exaggerated, however that may be, but shortly after it the power of Sophia finally weakened: in Moscow, the new sovereign, Peter. </p><h2>  Rapprochement with Peter </h2><p>  Brilliant European, smart and charming, educated and skillful officer Franz Lefort soon became an irreplaceable friend for the young king.  With him, Peter could find answers to numerous questions both on the state structure, and on the preparation of a combat-ready army, and on the improvement of life in a European manner. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="franz lefort brief biography" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29279/1115332.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Thanks to the established relations with Geneva, Franz began, at the request of a royal friend, to actively invite engineers, shipbuilders, gunsmiths and other specialists from all over Europe to Moscow, in whom Peter felt a significant lack. </p><p>  Lefort's house in the German settlement was considered one of the best in decoration and society and was the most suitable place for meetings of the large company of like-minded people, which Peter gathered around him.  He allocated funds for the installation of a huge hall in Lefort's house, where the young tsar could spend his time in European style away from the conservative Kremlin environment. </p><p>  On the occasion of the birth of the heir in 1690, numerous mercies were announced in Moscow around Peter's inner circle.  Lefort was not ignored.  Franz Yakovlevich became a major general. </p><h2>  Lefortovo settlement </h2><p>  At the request of Lefort, who sought to create regular troops in Moscow, a place was allocated for the military camp on the left bank of the Yauza River.  A large parade ground was arranged there, where intensive combat <span>training</span> and <span>tactical training</span> took place <span>,</span> barracks and houses for command personnel were erected.  Gradually, an entire urban area was formed here, today bearing the name Lefortovo. </p>

    <p>  Major General Lefort with great energy took up the preparation of a new type of Russian army.  Having organized service according to the European model, he sought strict discipline and high training of soldiers and officers.  During the maneuvers - "amusing campaigns" - he showed personal courage, having once been slightly injured. </p><h2>  Campaigns in Azov </h2><p>  In 1695 and 1696, military campaigns were launched to the south, aimed at gaining access to the Black Sea and blocking the Turkish threat to the southern borders of Russia.  Franz Lefort and Peter 1 during these enterprises were in constant and close interaction.  During the assault on the <span>Azov fortress,</span> Lefort was in the forefront of the attackers and even personally captured the enemy banner. </p><p>  In preparation for the second phase of the southern war, Lefort became the admiral of the fleet.  Peter at this appointment did not proceed from the outstanding naval skills of Franz, which he did not possess.  He was interested in tirelessness at work, energy, quick wit, honesty of Lefort, his personal devotion to the sovereign.  They were required for the construction of ships for the young Russian fleet, for the training of crews.  In the second campaign, Lefort was appointed commander of the naval forces. </p>

    <h2>  Great embassy </h2><p>  In the spring of 1697, a <span>diplomatic mission</span> of 250 people set off from Moscow to Europe.  The head of the delegation was Lefort, Peter was present as a private person.  The goal of the ‚Äúgreat embassy‚Äù was to achieve an alliance with European states against the Turkish empire, and the young sovereign sought to satisfy his own curiosity regarding the European way of life, new military and civilian technologies. </p><p>  During the European tour, Lefort was the main official of the embassy.  He conducted active diplomatic negotiations, arranged receptions, corresponded with European politicians, talked with those who wanted to enter the Russian service.  He parted with the king only during his stay in England. </p><p>  In the summer of 1698, a message came up from Mosca about the uprising of the archers, forcing Peter and his associates to urgently return to Russia. </p>

    <h2>  Great loss </h2><p>  Upon his return to the capital, Lefort, on the instructions of the king, participated in the trials of the rebel archers, and there is evidence of his protest against the mass executions, in which he resolutely refused to participate. </p><p>  During the trip to Europe on Yauza, a magnificent palace was presented for Lefort, presented to him by Peter.  But the admiral only managed to celebrate the magnificent housewarming.  At the end of February, his health deteriorated sharply.  He had long been tormented by the consequences of a fall from a horse that happened to him during the <span>Azov campaign.</span>  At the end of February 1699 he caught a cold, fell ill with a fever, and died on March 2 of the same year. </p><p>  This was a huge loss for Tsar Peter.  He said that he had lost a faithful friend, one of the most devoted associates that he now especially needed. </p><p>  Lefort had true friends, as well as fierce opponents.  Franz Yakovlevich, whose brief biography is similar to the plot of an adventurous novel, aroused deep respect in some, and burning hatred in others.  Most likely, he was not the main initiator of the Petrine reforms, as some historians seem to be.  But to make of him only a cheerful royal drinking companion, as some argue, is also deeply unfair.  Before us is the vibrant life of a man who, with all the <span>fibers of his soul,</span> wished well-being for a country that had become his second homeland. </p>
