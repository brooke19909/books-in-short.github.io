    <h2>  Briefly about Seaside Posad </h2><p>  Primorsky Posad is a village with a population of not more than 500 people, located in the south of Zaporizhzhya region.  Next to it flows the Domuzla River.  But she is very swampy in this place.  The advantage of the geographical location of this settlement is the Sea of ​​Azov.  It attracts many tourists who come here on vacation.  Primorsky Posad is located at a considerable distance from major cities, industrial facilities and highways.  Due to this arrangement, the air here is clean and untagged. </p><p>  The climate in the village is temperate continental.  Summer is warm, with an average temperature of +22 ° C.  In winter, there is practically no severe cold.  As a rule, the temperature at this time of the year rarely drops below +6 ° C.  No more than 380 mm of precipitation falls during the year.  In the summer, clear weather with short-term rain showers is established in Primorsky Posad.  In this area there are many healing springs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Sea coast </h2><p>  <span>Holidays in Seaside</span> Posad are ideal for families with small children.  The depth of the sea is small.  Only 20 m from the coast does it reach 2 m. The sea warms up by mid-May.  Typically, the temperature is around +20 ° C.  By July, this figure increases to almost +30 ° C, which makes beach vacations as comfortable as possible.  Already in early May, Seaside Posad opens the holiday season, which lasts until September (only 5 months). </p><p>  The bottom of the sea is shallow, without sharp drops in depth.  The beaches are mostly sand with a small amount of small shells.  Clay cliffs are found on the coast.  During a storm, they blur, giving the water a reddish tint.  In order to avoid this, breakwaters made of natural stone were created along the coastline. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="recreation center torch seaside posad" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1416399.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  For the convenience of vacationers, the infrastructure is developing on the coast.  There are recreation centers, cafes, trade stalls and playgrounds.  Thanks to them, tourists who come to these places on vacation will not be bored.  Seaside Posad is visited not only for swimming in the sea, but also for healing with mineral waters and basalt mud. </p><p>  The resort is only at the development stage, so the infrastructure here is poorly developed.  In the center there are grocery stores, there is a pharmacy and a post office.  The rest of the entertainment facilities are mainly concentrated in boarding houses and recreation centers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Holiday Village "Fakel" (Seaside Posad) </h2>
