    <h2>  Basic concepts </h2><p>  Waste from consumption and production are the remains of materials, raw materials, semi-finished products, other products / products formed during use, as well as goods that have lost their consumer characteristics.  The appeal refers to the activity in which recyclable material appears.  It also includes operations on storage, transportation, disposal, disposal, use, collection.  Hazardous is called waste containing harmful substances having properties that can create a threat to humans and nature.  Such characteristics, in particular, include toxicity, fire and explosion hazard, etc. Hazardous waste may also contain infectious agents.  An object of accommodation is a specially equipped structure and intended for placement of recyclables into it.  It may be a sludge dump, landfill, rock dump, etc. The disposal of waste is the activity of burial and storage of recyclables.  The latter is the content of materials at designated sites.  Storage is carried out for subsequent disposal, disposal or use.  To prevent the entry of harmful / hazardous compounds into the environment, the waste is isolated.  This operation is called burial.  Waste can be reused to create products, provide services or perform work, as well as to generate energy and heat. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Subjects </h2><p>  Who gives 2-TP (waste)?
