He was killed by a French nationalist on the eve of <span>the First World War.</span>  The personality of this man and his death have become symbols of pacifism throughout the world. </p><h2>  The thinker's views </h2><p>  The future writer and thinker Jean Jaures was born on September 3, 1859 in the city of Castres, which is located in the Languedoc province.  He was the son of a small business entrepreneur.  He studied in Paris, where he also graduated from a pedagogical institute.  In 1881 he became a candidate of philosophical sciences. </p><p>  The first few years of independent life, Jean Jaur√®s worked as a teacher at the University of Toulouse.  The philosopher's worldview has changed over the years.  In his youth, he was a supporter of idealism and did not recognize other concepts.  However, over time, Jean Jaur√®s leaned towards views close to Marxism.  Because of this, his figure became popular in the USSR.  Soviet textbooks on philosophy necessarily included a chapter on this French thinker. </p>

    <h2>  Socialist deputy </h2><p>  Already in his youth, Jean Jaur√®s became famous in the circles of the European intelligentsia.  At first, his name was well known in Parisian salons, where they liked to discuss the secular news of the country.  Soon Zhores proved himself as a capable speaker.  With his speeches he could interest any public, even far from his views. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the 80s, articles began to be published all over the country, the author of which was Jean Jaures.  The biography of this person makes us understand that it was a thinker who made an excellent secular career and did not like to lock himself in his own office.  From 1885 to 1898, with a short break for several years, he was a deputy.  Public life captivated the young speaker. </p>

    <h2>  Leader of the Left </h2><p>  The socialist circles of France received a new idol, which was Jean Jaur√®s.  Quotes from his speeches and articles were constantly featured in the programs of the "left" parties, which in various ways tried to get into power in European countries. </p><p>  In the early 90s, Jaur√®s also worked as deputy mayor of Toulouse.  At this public post, he was directly confronted with the everyday problems of the population, including the working class.  In 1892, strikes began in the province, the most active participants of which were coal miners.  Zhores tried to help the protesters, including publicly defending their interests.  As a result, the coal miners made him their candidate for parliament, where he again got in 1893.  The experience gained while working in Toulouse has changed a lot in the views of Jaur√®s.  He became even "to the left."  In parliament, he became a member of the faction of independent socialists who dissociated themselves from any parties. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Journalistic career </h2><p>  At this time, all the socialist forces of France, despite some mutual disagreements, needed a single leader.  They became Jean Jaur√®s.  A brief biography of this politician is an example of a person who has not tarnished himself by abandoning his beliefs.  Thanks to his talent as a speaker, Jaur√®s made his supporters many prominent socialists, who, in turn, recognized his leadership.  Among them was Jules Guesde.  The eloquence of Jaur√®s allowed him to enlist support even in bourgeois circles, where socialists did not like at all. </p><p>  In the last years of the XIX century, France followed a high-profile trial in the case of Alfred Dreyfus.  This was an officer in the General Staff of France, who was accused of espionage in favor of the German Empire.  He was supported by many public figures and writers: Zola, Clemenceau and Jean Jaur√®s.  In short, the socialist point of view was not popular with like-minded people.  Among the "left" split began.  One of the parties to the conflict was led by Jean Jaur√®s.  The speaker lost the next election in 1898.  Leaving politics, he took up journalism. </p><p>  For several years, Jaur√®s replaced several print media.  In 1904, he founded the newspaper L'Humanit√©, which was popular throughout France.  Also, the journalist became an active worker in the socialist international, supervising the cells of the movement in his country. </p>

    <h2>  Pacifist </h2><p>  At this time, militaristic sentiments became popular throughout Europe.  At the end of the 19th century, a young <span>German Empire</span> appeared on the continent <span>,</span> united around Prussia.  This happened after the war against France, in which the latter lost.  In Jaur√®s's homeland, revanchist sentiment reigned.  Many inhabitants of the country wanted to return the provinces lost after the war with Prussia.  These were Alsace and Lorraine - important industrial areas inhabited by both the French and Germans. </p><p>  In addition, the government in Paris has for many years pursued an active colonial policy.  It mainly spread to Africa.  This continent became a ‚Äúpie‚Äù, which was divided between powerful European powers: France, Great Britain, Germany, etc. Then military alliances began to take shape, which were to play an important role in the upcoming world war. </p><p>  This policy had many opponents, including Jean Jaur√®s.  Publicist aphorisms often ridiculed the militancy of the government in Paris.  Jaur√®s was increasingly known as a pacifist, not a socialist.  In 1911, he took part in a special international congress, which was held in Basel and was organized in order to work out solutions to stop the buildup of military hysteria in Europe. </p>

    <h2>  On the eve of war </h2><p>  In 1913, French President <span>Raymond Poincar√©</span> proposed the adoption of a new law to increase the military service life to three years.  There was no war yet, but society understood that it was approaching, and only an excuse was needed.  Jaur√®s, in order to show the unpopularity of the decision of the state, gathered in Paris an unprecedented pacifist rally in which 150 thousand people took part. </p><p>  In the spring of 1914, Jaur√®s led the Socialist faction, which went to the parliamentary elections.  This association has achieved great success with 102 seats.  Once in parliament, the "left" immediately blocked the provision of a large loan to the authorities, necessary to increase military spending. </p><h2>  The murder of Jaur√®s </h2><p>  In June, Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, was shot dead in Sarajevo.  The killer was the Serbian nationalist and terrorist <span>Gavrilo Princip.</span>  Austria announced an ultimatum to a neighboring country.  Throughout July, European powers prepared for an imminent war.  During these days, Jaur√®s continued to speak publicly, urging him to abandon bloodshed.  In France, as elsewhere, on the contrary, nationalism and militarism became popular.  The politician began to receive threats.  July 31, 1914 he was killed by a fanatic shot.  This happened on the eve of the declaration of war. </p>
