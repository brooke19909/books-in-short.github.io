No need to waste time on tiresome trips, and the cost of a ticket in this way is reduced.  What is famous for "Green Grove"?  The sanatorium (Ufa) hid in the forest, therefore, despite the proximity of the capital, it has healing, clean and transparent air.

But a peaceful atmosphere is far from all the potential that this health resort has. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="green grove sanatorium ufa" class="if" height="307" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/643360.jpg" width="460"></div>
