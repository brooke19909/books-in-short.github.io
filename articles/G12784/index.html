In 2006, it was bought out by businessman Oleg Tinkov, after which Himmashbank changes its legal name to Tinkoff Credit Systems Bank CJSC.  Subsequently, the bank was renamed again, becoming the owner of the name of the owner - ‚ÄúTinkoff Bank‚Äù. </p><p>  Features are the complete absence of bank branches - the service runs remotely through online channels and a call center.  Card delivery is carried out by representatives of the bank, whose number totals more than one and a half thousand - the network covers almost the entire territory of the Russian Federation, which allows you to get a card the very next day after registration. </p>

    <h2>  Tinkoff Bank Services </h2><p>  The main activity of this financial organization is the issuance of interest-free credit cards for a maximum amount equal to three hundred thousand with a chance of receiving an individual limit of two million rubles.  In addition, the bank issues debit cards, which provide a refund of 1% to 30% by category and Tinkoff partners, as well as deposits from individuals, mortgages, and maintaining business accounts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Replenishment through partners of Tinkoff Bank </h2><p>  Today, there are a fairly large number of Tinkoff partners among banks and financial organizations through which you can replenish debit and credit cards.  For example, Russian Post, which has branches throughout the country;  Contact payment system (payment acceptance points are also located practically throughout the country);  Golden Crown, Euroset, MTS, Svyaznoy, as well as numerous payment terminals Eleksnet, CyberPlat, Europlat, which can be found at train stations, grocery stores, and other public places. </p>

    <p>  To transfer funds it is enough to know the number of the agreement or card.  Passport authorization is not required in the terminals, however, in salons or post offices, employees will require a citizen of the Russian Federation for any amount. </p><h2>  Deposit via bank transfer </h2><p>  In addition to non-banking partners of Tinkoff, the card can be replenished with an ordinary transfer from a bank account in the bank itself.  In this case, the commission will be 0%, or from any other bank, where the commission is determined by the first side of the transfer.  In addition, bank transfers from a current account to absolutely any bank are free of charge. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The same thing happens if the Tinkoff card is replenished from the card of another bank: the commission from the side of the bank that issued the card from which the funds will be withdrawn.  For this, the bank has a special service where you can carry out this operation. </p>

    <h2>  Banks collaborating with Tinkoff Bank </h2><p>  In addition to payment systems, as well as companies providing communication services, Tinkoff partners are commercial banks that allow their ATMs to be used to replenish and withdraw funds from Tinkoff Bank cards. </p><p>  We can distinguish the following large partner companies of Tinkoff Bank in Moscow, which replenish and withdraw funds: </p><ol><li>  BINBANK.  Only bank ATMs are used, the maximum amount of replenishment per month is 599 thousand rubles, the maximum amount of payment is 35 thousand rubles.  Ticket offices do not replenish cards. </li><li>  "Credit Bank of Moscow".  The maximum amount of replenishment, depending on the type of card, is from 80 to 100 thousand rubles per day; card replenishment is not carried out in branches. </li><li>  PSKB.  An innovative bank for business development, which also accepts payments, but the maximum payment amount at a time is 15 thousand rubles and only Tinkoff Bank credit cards are replenished. </li><li>  MOSOBLBANK.  Similarly to the previous Tinkoff partner, operations are carried out at the same limits and also only with credit cards. </li></ol>

    <p>  It is also worth noting that Tinkoff partners are banks that provide mortgages for bank customers, namely DeltaCredit Bank, Gazprombank, Absolut Bank, UniCredit Bank, URALSIB Bank, AK BARS Bank ‚Äù,‚Äú SMP Bank ‚Äù,‚Äú Metallinvest Bank ‚Äù,‚Äú Bank for Housing Finance ‚Äù,‚Äú East Bank ‚Äù.  All of them provided a discount for bank customers of up to 1.5% of the original bank mortgage rate. </p><h2>  How can Tinkoff Bank return the money? </h2><p>  Once every 3 months, the bank allows you to select the categories of goods, or rather MCC codes of bank terminals that accept payment.  They will be refunded at the end of each month in the amount of 5% of each purchase.  Purchases must be made on selected groups of goods that are displayed in the user's personal account. </p><p>  In addition, there is another advantage - an additional cashback, which is offered for purchases made in the partner stores of Tinkoff Bank.  It can reach as much as 30%.  However, in fact, this is the maximum percentage that the bank offers quite rarely.  Most often, this figure can be 10-15%. </p><p>  Tinkoff partners include such well-known retailers as Ozone, Burger King, various taxi aggregators (Yandex, Gett), Svyaznoy, Lamoda, Mediamarket, Reebok and many others .  According to customer reviews, you can understand that within one year you can get a fairly large reward that will pay off both the cost of servicing the card and the transfers between accounts. </p><p>  In addition to this, there are also co-branded cards that are offered to the attention of consumers.  These are cards that are issued together with Tinkoff partners.  For example, Yulmart, S7 Airlines, Mitsubishi. </p>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Are there really no pitfalls for users?  There are stones, and quite large. </p><p>  First of all, this is the geography of the bank.  No matter how popular the courier service is, Tinkoff Bank's partners are more common in Moscow than in other regions.  Customers complain about this to the bank itself, saying that they are thereby limited in all privileges. </p><p>  Secondly, the maximum amount of money returned.  6000 rubles, points, bonuses or other equivalent, intended by agreement. </p><p>  Thirdly, the lack of branches, the use of ATMs of partner banks can push away new customers due to the bank's extreme virtuality. </p><p>  Fourth, cashback categories are often underutilized.  Gas stations, supermarkets, pharmacies - often these categories are not included in the updated monthly list of categories for the client. </p><p>  Nevertheless, Tinkoff Bank remains one of the most progressive banks that does not have an actual location, however, all problematic issues of customers are resolved as soon as possible.  The reliability of the bank is proved by the presence of a significant number of customers throughout Russia, numbering millions of people. </p>
