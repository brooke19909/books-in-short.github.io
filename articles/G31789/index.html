It is called OneBlade.  In the reviews they write that this device is suitable for different types of actions.  They can shave, make clear contours, and trim the beard.  However, such versatility is not always a particular advantage.  As a rule, a device with similar functionality is not able to cope with any of the options.  In this article, we will check how realistic what the manufacturer claims is. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="one blade philips reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2124287.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What's interestnig? </h2><p>  The most interesting is that the manufacturer denies the name "razor".  The device is called a ‚Äúshaving device‚Äù or ‚Äúshaving gadget‚Äù. </p><p>  The developers claim that this device has too many functions in order to be just an ordinary device.  An additional feature of this device is that the cutting unit can perform up to 200 movements per second.  According to the manufacturer, such a characteristic is only for the better.  The device can handle bristles of different stiffness and length.  The Philips One Blade reviews confirm this fact.  If we talk about security, then the device has a special coating of the shaving part.  Also, the plastic tabs are rounded.  Double type protection can completely prevent from cuts and irritation.  This system is mobile in a vertical plane.  Thanks to this, the razor is able to perfectly follow the contours of the face. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Speaking briefly about the functions of this device, the OneBlade can trim the bristles, contours, as well as shaving. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="philips oneblade trimmer reviews specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2124288.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Testing </h2><p>  For testing, two people were selected.  One has soft bristles, the second - hard.  The task of OneBlade is to trim the beard, work with its contour, and then completely shave. </p><p>  The purpose of the test: to understand how well the razor copes with such tasks, whether it is convenient to use.  The device is quite inexpensive, its cost is 3 thousand rubles.  What were the results?  After reviewing the test results, we find out what kind of reviews about Philips One Blade leave buyers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="philips oneblade with 3 comb nozzles qp2520" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2124289.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Work with bristles </h2><p>  Two young men with a stubble of about 9 mm were taken for testing. </p><p>  The first guy has a soft structure.  First of all, a nozzle was used, which shortens the length first to 5 mm, and then to 3. Noticeable results were the second time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  During the test, subjects were confident that the device would hurt or tear out several hairs.  After all, the cost of the device is quite small.  However, as it turned out, this did not happen.  In general, this device works quite quickly, given that the size of the shearing element has standard indicators for the trimmer.  Reviews about the Philips One Blade did not disappoint. </p><p>  The holder of stiffer bristles used a treshka nozzle.  When using such a device, it should be noted that after pressing a button on the OneBlade case, the shaving head flies out of the holder.  Therefore, most likely it will have to be sought.  This new product managed without question.  The desired result was achieved.  Since the subjects did not previously work with this device, they noted that even for the first time it was convenient and everything happened without any problems. </p><h2>  Outlines </h2><p>  It is necessary to work with contours without a nozzle.  In this case, the device should be directed to itself with the back side.  This stage is the easiest.  The contours are trimmed without problems, but you should be a little careful.  Cuts are not excluded.  As they say in reviews of Philips One Blade, if everything is done correctly, the contours will remain smooth. </p><h2>  Shaving </h2><p>  This stage caused the most concern.  Trimmer functions are one thing, but shaving is less safe.  The fears were not unfounded. </p><p>  The test participant said that in general the device works well, but does not make the skin as smooth as possible.  Moreover, when shaving, hair flies directly into the mouth and nose, which is not very pleasant.  When using the device as a trimmer, the comb nozzle saves from this, but without it, things are bad.  The razor coped well with inaccessible places: with the neck and nose.  In principle, such comments are fully confirmed by the manufacturer.  In addition, the Philips OneBlade QP2530 price reviews make it clear that the balance between price and quality is perfect. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The developers said that for a comfortable shave, the device is designed to create light shaving.  It should be noted that often when creating such devices, the manufacturer does everything possible to achieve perfect smoothness. </p><p>  The second test participant stated that the effect of hair getting into the mouth and nose was also present.  However, this device is more like than disappoint.  It can be taken on a trip instead of a bulky electric shaver. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="prices reviews philips oneblade qp2530" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2124290.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  results </h2><p>  The new Philips is quite successful.  In general, for 3 thousand rubles.  you can get a good trimmer for working with bristles, a device for trimming contours and, in fact, a razor.  Cuts and jerks of the bristles, as well as irritation, of course, will be present.  However, these are not significant disadvantages that depend on the type of skin.  Reviews on the characteristics of the Philips OneBlade trimmer are as positive as possible.  Why?  Read on. </p><p>  Full battery charge - 8 hours.  This is enough for 45 minutes of use.  The device can work not only in dry conditions, but also in the shower. </p><p>  In general, the developer is positioning the new Philips One Blade razor (reviews below), as a device for male styling.  That is, you need to understand that this device is not designed for super smooth shaving, but more designed to create negligence.  However, this device is clearly not up to the top five.  The story of hair in the mouth and nose leaves an unpleasant sensation.  In addition, all spoil nozzles that can fly off. </p><p>  Plastic elements seem rather fragile, as the material is thin.  If this instrument is not handled carefully, it may break.  Do not forget that the blade is not eternal and must be changed.  Every three to four months you will have to buy a new shaving head.  The cost for one is about 1 thousand rubles, and for a set of two you will have to pay a little less than 2 thousand rubles.  Reviews about the price of the Philips One Blade QP2530 and accessories are positive.  Everyone is happy with such a price category. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="philips oneblade qp2530 trimmer" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2124291.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Advantages: reviews </h2><p>  A brief look at the benefits that users provide.  The device is convenient, accurate, and also small.  They can easily make simple drawings on the beard, if necessary.  The nozzle is removed easily and simply.  It is also worn without difficulty.  Recall that the kit comes with a Philips OneBlade with 3 QP2520 comb attachments. </p><p>  Thanks to this razor, you can easily outline the contours.  Given that many electric shavers are too bulky, curly shaving fails.  You can use a separate trimmer.  However, shaving machines will not be very convenient here.  But, in principle, according to customer reviews, you can decide that the device copes with this task perfectly. </p><h2>  Disadvantages: reviews </h2><p>  Of the minuses, it should be noted that shaving should be done only against the hair.  The accuracy of trimming is imperfect, there are problems with the tips.  The latter may fall out.  The lock button sometimes does not work, as mentioned above, often nozzles just fly off. </p><p>  During operation, such deficiencies could not be identified.  That is, when shaving, the nozzles are well fixed and hold well. </p><h2>  How to shave with this device? </h2><p>  As with a conventional machine, the head of this device must be carried along the skin.  Without problems, this device will shorten long hairs.  This sets him apart from a wet razor.  What is the trick?  With OneBlade, the blades are along the longest edge, due to this the razor cuts the beard from the side.  Therefore, hair can be of absolutely any length.  The main thing is to adapt to work. </p><p>  It should be noted that the results of shaving are good, but imperfect.  In order to get an acceptable result, you have to walk around the place several times.  Especially when it comes to problem areas.  Crucial is the direction of movement and hair growth.  As mentioned above, this device can only be shaved against the cover.  Whether irritation appears after this depends entirely on the type of skin. </p><p>  If you press the razor hard and put it into the skin, then there will be no damage.  In general, most buyers are satisfied after purchasing the device, given its cost.  The device is completely waterproof, so you can not be afraid and complete all the processes in the shower. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="philips oneblade razor review" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2124292.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Good or bad? </h2><p>  The reviews say that the Philips OneBlade QP2530 is ideal as a trimmer.  Due to the small blade, light weight and compact handle, the process of editing the edges of the beard is quite convenient. </p><p>  For greater accuracy, a man can use a nozzle that directs hair at a certain angle.  In this case, the edges will be even better shaved. </p><p>  However, in the reviews, many write that a flat nozzle works better than a corner nozzle.  In the latter case, individual hairs are skipped, which must be re-shaved. </p><p>  In the configuration, the choice of nozzles is completely small.  There are only four plastic tips.  They will allow you to change the length of the beard from 1 to 5 mm.  With overgrown hair, the trimmer will not be able to cope.  To do this, you will have to purchase a new razor, which has an integrated version of the nozzles.  It's called the Philips One Blade PRO.  Reviews of her confirm that with her help you can adjust the length of your beard up to one centimeter. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="new philips one blade razor reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2124294.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Faithful companion </h2><p>  This razor is narrow, so it is well suited for transportation.  Moreover, nothing special is needed to care for her.  It can just be washed well.  The blades are changed every 4 months, the cost of packaging has been described above.  And yet, the <span>Philips</span> QP6520 / 20 <span>trimmer</span> (QP6520 / 20 is another type of attachment) is ideal. </p><p>  This version has disadvantages.  For example, when carrying it is quite easy to break the tips.  Therefore, for the trip you will have to pack each of them separately.  If the traveler is quite active, then it is better to purchase a more expensive model. </p><h2>  Alternative </h2><p>  Buyers notice that the Remington MB320C is a good alternative.  It is not as good as One Blade in technical specifications, but it is quite suitable for an undemanding user.  It is inexpensive.  You can buy for 4 thousand rubles.  A man can choose from 10 levels of hair length.  The device itself works fine on a single charge.  This trimmer at a low price is considered one of the best. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  What should be said in conclusion?  In general, this device combines a huge number of characteristics from various shaving systems.  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãis like in an electric shaver, practicality is like working with a trimmer, and convenience is like with an ordinary razor.  However, even if the device copes well with the last process, nevertheless, it only works perfectly with trimming.  Before purchasing, read the reviews on the Philips OneBlade razor. </p><p>  It should be recalled that the device must be bought in official stores, since fakes are now quite common.  Many users write that the device quickly fails, sometimes it malfunctions, it can succumb to water, but this all guarantees that a person has acquired an unofficial product. </p><p>  You can also purchase the device in the online store.  But before you pay, you must check the operability of the device.  The warranty for the device is one year.  The manufacturer assures that during this time the device will not break and will not require repair.  However, even if this happens, replacing parts that are out of order will be quite easy.  Reviews on the Philips OneBlade razor confirm this. </p>
