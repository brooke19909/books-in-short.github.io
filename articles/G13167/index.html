People often call it simply "throat", but in medical terminology it has a different name.  Let's find out what are the functions of the pharynx and what is its role in the processes of life. </p><h2>  Scientific definition </h2><p>  From the point of view of medicine, the pharynx (from lat. Pharynx) is a connecting chain between the oral cavity and the nose.  Outwardly, it looks like a tube that begins with the larynx, and ends with the esophagus.  This is what determines its role as the most important link not only in the digestive, but also in the respiratory process. </p>

    <h2>  The middle part of the pharynx: its structure and functions </h2><p>  <span>The next part of the system can be considered the oropharynx: this area, which stretches from the root of the tongue to the esophagus.</span>  <span>The entire surface of this tube is covered with a mucous membrane, under which the muscles are located.</span>  <span>They compress the throat and help push food into the esophagus.</span>  <span>It's hard to believe, but all the muscles are in constant motion, thereby ensuring the vital activity of the pharyngeal cavity.</span> </p><p>  <span>The largest muscles of the oropharynx are called constrictors, they have a large load during the compression of the <span>muscular system.</span></span>  <span>They are usually located in the back of the pterygoid process (the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe root of the tongue) and perform the most important functions of the human pharynx in digestion.</span>  <span>In addition to swallowing food and mucus, they participate in the processes of opening and closing the pharynx.</span>  <span>Depending on the location, they are divided into the upper constrictor, middle and two lateral.</span> </p><h2>  The lower part of the pharynx is the larynx </h2><p>  <span>The lowest part of the organ is located in the back of the larynx, on the 4th vertebra, it stretches from the beginning of the larynx to the esophagus.</span>  <span>The surface of the larynxopharynx has a <span>fibrous membrane,</span> under which there are longitudinal and transverse muscles.</span>  <span>During meals, the longitudinal muscle stretches and, as it were, raises the throat, while the transverse muscles push pieces of food.</span>  <span>The role of the pharynx in digestion is largely determined by the state of the organ itself: how the tonsils work, whether they can protect against viral diseases, whether there are abnormalities in development and whether chronic, traumatic or oncological diseases are absent.</span> </p>

    <h2>  What are the functions of the pharynx in the respiratory system? </h2><p>  <span>Everyone knows that in the human throat two main elements of vital activity are actually connected: these are the respiratory and digestive systems.</span>  <span>How is it that there are no collisions at this "crossroads", and each process functions without failures?</span>  <span>It's all about the cunning device of this body.</span> </p><p>  <span>In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe nasopharynx, just above the level of the oral cavity, there is a small system of valves that alternately close or open one or another passage of the larynx depending on the process (breathing or eating).</span>  <span>The main air channel, which stretches from the nasopharynx to the larynx, is open when all muscles are relaxed, so we can calmly inhale and exhale air through our mouths.</span>  <span>When we yawn, the septum located in the region of the soft palate allows air to pass into both the oral and nasal cavities.</span>  <span>Unfortunately, a person is not able to fully control the muscles of this septum: even if you lift the soft palate and stop the air flow, the passage will still remain open.</span>  <span>This is precisely the reason why sometimes food particles can enter the nasopharynx.</span> </p><p>  <span>Next is the trachea, through which air flows from the beginning of the pharynx to the lungs themselves.</span>  <span>This organ largely contributes to the universal distribution of air flow in the pharynx, and thanks to the valve located at its base (epiglottis), the main functions of the pharynx in the respiratory system are performed.</span> </p><h2>  The main functions of the pharynx in digestion </h2><p>  <span>The pharynx is the organ through which the food ingested passes into the esophagus and then into the stomach.</span>  <span>In the throat are the most important processes that affect all further digestion.</span>  <span>It is here that food is first evaluated by taste: in the oropharynx, on the surface of the tongue, receptors are located that form the taste of food and in many ways contribute to appetite.</span> </p>
