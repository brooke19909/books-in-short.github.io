Do you think that it cannot be profitable?  Very vain.  In the conditions of fierce competition between banks, the borrower wins ...  Because it can be lured not only by particularly favorable conditions, but also by the convenience of the registration procedure. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="passport loan" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10893/84408.jpg" width="600"></div>  So where to get a loan with a passport?  Of course, in the bank.  Often, such programs are characterized by high design speed.  It is on it that the main attention of the borrower is focused.  This is done in order to distract him from really important points.  For example, the size of the interest rate.  And it can reach 50-70% per annum.  Not bad, is it?  In addition, bankers try not to advertise the amount of additional expenses of the client.  We are talking about insurance, as well as commissions.  Therefore, if it‚Äôs really ‚Äúhot‚Äù, and you draw up a loan on the basis of one document, then carefully read everything that is proposed to be signed. <br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="urgent passport loan" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10893/84406.jpg" width="334"></div>  Is there an alternative to a product like a passport loan?  Yes, she is.  Not particularly different in terms of requirements for the borrower, it is much more interesting.  We are talking about programs, the terms of which provide for the provision of a pair of documents, one of which is a civil passport.  It would seem that the difference is not so fundamental.  However, "extra" paper is a surefire way to get more money at a reduced percentage.  Moreover, it cannot be said that at the same time the terms for considering the application or the size of the maximum amount that the lender agrees to give to the borrower are greatly affected. <br><br>  The surest way to get a loan with your passport is to contact your financial institution.  Here, for sure, there are a couple of interesting products as part of <span>the loyalty program</span> to existing customers.  Financial institutions do not particularly promote them, since the level of profitability of an express loan is incommensurable with the profit that can be brought by servicing existing customers. <br><br>  Finally, if you need an urgent passport loan, you should not rush.  Instead of a feverish search for the right option, it would be more advisable to study the offers of banks for <span>credit</span> cards.  Here the procedure, maybe not so quick, but simpler and cheaper. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="take a passport loan" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10893/84407.jpg" width="300"></div>  <strong>Leader Collaboration</strong>

    <p>  Today, one of the flagships of the Russian banking industry, VTB 24, offers to take out a loan with a passport. According to the terms of the program, a citizen will only need a document and a completed application form.  The lender emphasizes that you can use the service on the way home.  Or at lunchtime.  Moreover, the conditions are very simple and interesting.  In particular, the amount of up to 150 thousand rubles can be borrowed for up to 36 months at 29% per annum.  Please note: the announced size of the loan interest is the starting point.  That is, we are talking about the fact that its size is from 29 percent and above.  To find out what is hidden behind the phrase "and higher", you need to carefully read the contract.  In addition, it should be borne in mind that this proposal is valid only in certain regions of the Russian Federation. </p>
