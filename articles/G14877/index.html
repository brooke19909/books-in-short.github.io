If there are crooked stitches, a fold of fabric sewn into the seam or a sloppy finish, all this looks cheap and of poor quality. </p><h2>  It all starts with practicing techniques </h2><p>  I always want everything that you do to be perfect, but the first time is unlikely to be able to achieve this.  And they did it in appearance; they play a key role in the perception of the image.  <span>How to sew sleeves</span> into the armhole so that they look perfect?  There is a certain algorithm of work, a technique that has been worked out by masters over the years, and there are no secrets in this topic.  For all types of sleeves, recommendations are provided in order to tell in detail how to sew sleeves into the armhole. </p><h2>  The main types of sleeves </h2><p>  In different models of clothes, there may be sleeves of different shapes, different types.  There are options that are most common: </p><ol><li>  Nonstop sleeve.  In work, it does not require a landing.  It is usually used in products where fitting is not required, it can be men's shirts, tight-fitting knitted blouses or dresses and blouses made of crumpled fabric. <div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a knitted sleeve into an armhole" class="if uuid-3159730" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56678/3159730.jpg"></div></li><li>  A sleeve that requires a fit is used in various products.  A special cut is going on here, so that the entire sleeve okay is larger than the armhole, and you need to sew it in so that there is no excess fabric.  This type is the most common.  It is used in dresses, and jackets and in blouses. </li><li>  Variants where folds or assemblies are provided for overhang, when such a sleeve is assembled, it should be 2-3 cm more than the armhole. </li></ol><h2>  For those who are just starting </h2><p>  Masters often have a set of patterns and work on them, they can expand or reduce a certain pattern almost by eye and, having skipped some stages in work, quickly make decisions on how to sew a sleeve into an armhole best. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For those who study, you need to go through all the stages.  If the sleeve and armhole coincide, then there is nothing complicated, it is enough to carefully sweep and stitch everything.  Problems usually begin where the armhole is slightly wider than the rim itself.  Sewing a sleeve nicely is not so simple.  The most common mistakes are improperly seated fit and improperly connected sleeves, even if landing was done correctly. </p><p>  You can watch video materials to better understand how to sew a sleeve into an armhole.  Paukshte Irina, a seamstress with many years of experience, maintains her blog, she offers many videos in which she clearly tells how to go through all the stages.  For some people, it‚Äôs much easier to see the work process once than to read about it.  There is also a variant of the error, when the landing is distributed incorrectly, and the sleeve is sewn incorrectly. </p><h2>  Work with concepts </h2><p>  Before you understand how to sew a sleeve into the armhole of knitted and fabric products, it is worth clarifying with the concepts that are used in the work.  Landing, what is it?  When the expression is used to plant or attach the sleeve's sleeve, it means that you need to equalize the sleeve to the size of the armhole so that it can be sewn. </p><h2>  Landing distribution by okat </h2><p>  It is better to cut a sleeve after shelves are cut out.  You need to dare the bodice and make the first fitting.  During this period, it is necessary to clarify the armhole, whether it is too shallow or deep and at this stage it should be corrected to the desired state.  And for a specific armhole, then cut out a sleeve.  We will focus more on how to work with a fabric product.  For those who are interested in how beautifully to sew a knitted sleeve into an armhole, it is worth saying that the details must be connected absolutely clearly and correctly in accordance with the dimensions.  The calculation is such that the fit of the okat on the knitted part is not needed, sew on the same way as on knitwear. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  No need to fit the okat around the perimeter.  Least of all capture is on hand in front.  The main part falls on the upper point.  When distributing a landing, it is always worth remembering that there should not be any clear transitions. </p><h2>  Preparing the sleeve for embedding </h2><p>  Before connecting the sleeve to the product, it should already be sewn, the cuffs or hem should not be done yet, because the length will be adjusted a little later. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fairfitstudio.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a sleeve into armhole paukshte" class="if uuid-3159708" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56678/3159708.jpg"></div><p>  Along the perimeter, the entire eye needs to be sewn with the largest stitch.  The beginning and end of the line does not need to be fixed.  On the one hand, a couple of threads need to be tied to a knot, so as not to accidentally pull it out.  And on the other hand, you need to select one thread and tighten it until the size of the okat does not align with the size of the armhole.  At this stage, tie this pair of strings too, so that the mark does not blossom.  Since it is not difficult to sew a knitted sleeve into the armhole, there is no need to somehow prepare it additionally. </p><p>  Another option to assemble the okat is to lay the line manually at a distance of 0.5 cm from the edge, and then pull it along the edges to the desired size.  Some masters lay 2 lines in parallel at a distance of 0.8 cm and 0.3 cm from the edge and pull them together.  This allows you to strengthen the seam so that it does not accidentally tear. </p><h2>  Work with iron </h2><p>  Before embroidering sleeves in the armhole, the okat must be completed completely.  After they are met, it is undesirable to touch them.  Since it is very difficult to smooth the sleeves on the finished product, and additional creases can be made, which are then extremely difficult to fix, and they will spoil the whole look.  When the string is pulled down to the desired size, you need to redistribute the assembly in the upper part most of all, and going down to nothing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sewingladyblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a sleeve into the armhole of knitwear" class="if uuid-3159710" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56678/3159710.jpg"></div><p>  For work, it is desirable to have a special oval-shaped roller.  Width is about 13 cm, length is 35-40 cm. It is necessary to put on the formed okat on the edge of the roller and cover it with an iron on top. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.themakeden.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a knitted sleeve into an armhole" class="if uuid-3159714" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56678/3159714.jpg"></div><p>  Then, with gentle movements, form a ridge to smooth out all wrinkles and folds.  It‚Äôs good to do it with a steam iron.  An ironclad is needed so that no gloss is left on the fabric and to protect the fabric as much as possible from possible defects.  The sleeve should cool in this position. </p><h2>  We embed a sleeve </h2><div class="photo" data-original="byhandlondon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew sleeves into an armhole" class="if uuid-3159720" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56678/3159720.jpg"></div><p>  The bodice must be turned inside out, and the sleeve, on the contrary, should be left with the front side out.  It must be inserted inside the product so as to combine the sections of the armhole and the ridge.  In this position, you need to lay a bast or pin around the perimeter with pins.  If there was only a part of the sleeve sewn into the armhole and there was excess fabric that you have nowhere to pick up, then you still need to tighten the okat.  If everything came together, then you can spend it.  The beginning and end of the seam must be fixed. </p><p>  So it looks in the completed version. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikihow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="armhole section" class="if uuid-3159704" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56678/3159704.jpg"></div><h2>  Additional steps in the work </h2><p>  The previous option is quite suitable for thin fabrics, but there is loose material, one that is very loose.  As soon as the product was cut out, the edges immediately began to stick out.  If such details are stitched together, then this seam will open in the very near future.  That is why after the product is cut out, all side sections must be glued with doubler or non-woven 1.5 - 2 cm wide. After gluing, the edges will become more dense, and then it will be possible to work with them.  All further steps follow the same pattern.  When the sleeve is sewn in, another fitting is done and its length is specified on the figure.  The bottom is processed either with a hem or cuffs depending on the model. </p>
