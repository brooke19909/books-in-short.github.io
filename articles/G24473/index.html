    <p>  Travel has long been a feature that has allowed people to build a full-fledged picture of the surrounding reality.  Information about the surface of the planet, information about the economic structure, culture, traditions, history, population of various countries - all these are the achievements of travel and the fruits of travelers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  From travel history </h2><p>  Today, the world knows such great travel chronicles as the descriptions of Herodotus, as well as the scientists who accompanied Alexander the Great.  From the time of the Middle Ages, works were preserved that tell of the wanderings of Marco Polo and Athanasius Nikitin (‚ÄúWalking over the Three Seas‚Äù), written in the first person.  Particularly popular at that time and even earlier was the trip with the aim of touching the shrines and reaching the holy places - it was called the ‚Äúpilgrimage‚Äù and was reflected in the travel notes of the pilgrim Abbot Daniel.  The next important stage in the development of travel was the era of great geographical discoveries, which qualitatively expanded people's ideas about the openness, greatness and unidentification of the vast world. </p>

    <p>  Further, in the period from the 18th to the 19th centuries, travel underwent significant changes in its very essence: they became more and more specific, acquired the character of scientific expeditions.  This began after N. M. Przhevalsky called his campaigns ‚Äúscientific reconnaissance,‚Äù which could satisfy only the need for superficial knowledge of a particular locality. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The middle of the 20th century was marked by the active development of the tourism sector, in connection with which the trip was identical to any trip carried out by a person independently, without the mediation of travel agencies.  For this type of vacation, where the rejection of the services of any companies and organizations is of fundamental importance, there is even a term of its own - ‚Äúbackpacking‚Äù (from the English backpacking). </p><p>  At present, lovers of adventurous trips organized at their own peril and risk can familiarize themselves with a particular place in advance through travel TV shows (Orel and Reshka, Travelers Club, etc.). </p><h2>  Types of travel </h2><p>  So, if it is clarified what a trip is, it is necessary to dwell in more detail on the types of recreation, which today are presented in large numbers.  These include: </p><ul><li>  Cruise Tours. </li><li>  Sightseeing vacation. </li><li>  Sports tourism. </li><li>  VIP travel. </li><li>  Health-improving trips. </li><li>  Educational tourism. </li><li>  Weekend tours. </li><li>  Travel to ski resorts. </li><li>  Event trips (traveling to festivities, special weeks, carnivals, etc.). </li><li>  Beach tourism. </li><li>  Business travel. </li><li>  Wedding vacation. </li><li>  Shop tours. </li><li>  Travel to exotic resorts and non-standard places. </li><li>  Gastronomic tours. </li></ul>

Both passive and active rest - travel of a special type can be found for anyone.  The main thing in this business is, in accordance with your own desires and opportunities to choose the type of trip that can bring as many positive impressions, emotions and benefits as possible. </p><h2>  Advantages of Traveling </h2><p>  If everything is clear with what travel is, then the question of why people travel is still open.  Psychologists and even ordinary tourists distinguish the following objective advantages of travel: </p><ol><li>  Personal development, growth and self-improvement, which is associated with the rejection of the bored ‚Äúcomfort zone‚Äù.  Unexpected situations and circumstances develop in a person the ability to react quickly, show eccentricity and creativity, communicate with people, and adapt to changing conditions. </li><li>  Making new acquaintances. </li><li>  Expansion of horizons, increased erudition.  The knowledge of the customs and customs of an unfamiliar state, the language and life of the local population, cuisine and much more - all this as a result positively affects the general level of the traveler‚Äôs culture. </li><li>  Improvement, which rests mainly on the production of endorphins, the common name of which is ‚Äúhormones of happiness‚Äù.  The journey itself is associated in a person with relaxation and positive impressions, which leads to the development of these substances. </li><li>  Spiritual enrichment. </li></ol><p>  Now it's time to consider the most popular routes that even a beginner can bring to life. </p><h2>  Golden ring (route): why you should choose and how can you go? </h2><p>  Traveling along the Golden Ring is an opportunity to touch the national history of Russia.  The route covers cities, each of which occupies a special niche in the process of development of the state.  Many of them feature attractions that are protected by an international organization of UNESCO.  In addition, the trip helps to remove the fuss, get rid of the tension imposed by life in the metropolis, and plunge into the leisurely existence of the Russian provinces. </p>

    <p>  The Golden Ring, the route of which will be presented later, is currently an active tourist zone of Russia.  By the way, travelers do not always use the mediation of travel companies and organized excursions, because no special documents are required to make a trip "savage" - only a means of transportation!  The list of cities looks like this: </p><ul><li>  Vladimir </li><li>  Suzdal </li><li>  Rostov the Great; </li><li>  Ivanovo; </li><li>  Kostroma; </li><li>  Yaroslavl </li><li>  Pereslavl-Zalessky; </li><li>  Sergiev Posad. </li></ul><p>  The total length of the route is approximately 1000 km. </p><h2>  Routes in Europe </h2><p>  Today you can go on a trip not only in Russia, but also by car ... in Europe!  To do this, you must first take care of obtaining medical insurance, international driver's licenses, as well as a special visa at the embassy of the country where entry will be made initially;  subsequently, there will be no restrictions on movement between states within the European Union. </p>

    <p>  In order to go by car in Europe, you also need to plan a competent route in advance.  The most popular among tourists are, for example, the following: </p><ul><li>  Russia, Belarus, Poland, Czech Republic, Austria.  The total length of the route is 5170 km, stops in 6 cities (Minsk, Brest, Vienna, Klagenfurt, Prague, Warsaw). </li><li>  The route from Moscow to Berlin with a length of the road of about 2000 km (you can travel for 25-30 hours, but with stops for rest, sightseeing - 4-5 days one way);  Crossing 4 borders: Belarusian, Czech, Polish, German. </li></ul><p>  Regardless of where the trip will be made, the trip should be planned and thought out.  It is recommended that you familiarize yourself with the laws and national characteristics of the countries where you will be entered. </p><h2>  Hiking </h2>

    <p>  This is one of the best options to start exploring the world of travel.  If there is still not enough experience and skills to travel long distances, hiking with a gradual increase in the length of the route and the complication of conditions is what will help to gain confidence in your abilities.  You can start with regular trips overnight to the forest (the main thing is to make sure the chosen place is safe), and continue at the intersections of mountain ranges and hilly areas of the Urals, the Murmansk region, the Caucasus and other regions. </p>
