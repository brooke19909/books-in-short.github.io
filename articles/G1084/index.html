According to manufacturers, this device is designed for real music lovers.  The device has support for Dolby Digital Plus technology, and headphones are supplied.  If you pay attention to the opinions of the owners of Lenovo A319, reviews indicate that the headset is of very decent quality.  It is worth recognizing that if you do not use headphones, the sound quality will be worse.  Externally, the Lenovo A319 smartphone looks very attractive, but its characteristics cannot be called outstanding.  But do not forget that the model is still budget.  Build quality is very decent, the device supports two SIM cards and 3G.  But at the same time, resource-intensive applications (primarily games) are not doing very well on it, the weak hardware affects it.  The disadvantages include a fairly quick discharge of the battery, and the camera does not have autofocus, which greatly complicates the shooting process.  The display in its quality corresponds to the budget segment.  Now on the market you can find offers from competitors at the same cost, but with more worthy characteristics. </p><h2>  Weight and dimensions of the device </h2>

In modern realities, the smartphone looks quite small.  Budget models of the manufacturer rarely boast a nice design, but Lenovo A319 was an exception to this rule.  The device has a thickness of 10.5 mm, and the front panel looks very attractive.  The dimensions of the device are 123.5 / 63.8 / 10.5 mm.  Its weight is 130 grams, and it turned out to be somewhat heavier than its main competitors.  The body plastic is cheap, but the build quality is good.  The cover is easy to remove, unlike some other models of the same manufacturer.  The device is available in three colors: black, red and white.

The Lenovo A319 smartphone (user reviews confirm this) has a not-so-clear picture.  The manufacturer was silent about the type of matrix, but judging by the image, this is probably TN technology.  Actually, if a better IPS were used, the company would definitely say so.  The brightness level of the display is quite low and amounts to 252 cd / m2.  Also, the viewing angle parameters are not impressive either.  It is quite difficult to see information on the screen in the sun, but in the dark you can easily read the test.  The device is equipped with <span>a light sensor,</span> the automatic brightness adjustment system copes well with its task, however, the adjustment occurs with a slight delay.  In general, the quality of the display is consistent with the cost of the device, but now you can find models from other manufacturers with an <span>IPS matrix</span> for the same money.  It is also worth noting that sometimes the touchscreen may not work correctly.

A319 is no exception.  <span>The front camera</span> has 2 MP, and the rear - 5 MP.  Again, pay attention to what the owners of Lenovo A319 say, their reviews most often indicate the lack of autofocus as the main drawback.  If she were here, a camera for its price range would be good.  The maximum resolution of photographs is 2560x1920, there are HDR functions, continuous shooting and the ability to photograph when a smile appears in the frame.  The resulting images can hardly be called good.  They lack clarity and give the impression that they are simply stretched to the desired size.  The rear camera is capable of shooting HD video.  Higher resolutions cannot be used due to a lack of CPU power.  The front 2-megapixel camera showed itself quite well during video recording and photography.  The resolution of the pictures is 1500x1200, and the video was recorded in 3GP format (640x480 pixels).  Again, I want to regret the lack of auto focus.  With it, the camera experience could be significantly better.

It is worth noting that the keys are conveniently located, one button is used to switch the input language, it is possible to use gestures when typing.  But the dictionary of the Russian language on the smartphone is clearly small.  This is also confirmed by people who already use the Lenovo A319 telephone, their reviews indicate that often with a typing error the keyboard is not able to make the required changes.  Also negatively affects the work with texts and the small <span>screen size.</span>

    <h2>  Internet connection </h2><p>  The company‚Äôs own browser on the device is missing, but the corresponding software from Google and Yandex is installed.  The programs are quite convenient, and each of them can be customized to your wishes.  There is no reading mode, but Yandex.Browser has a Turbo mode that speeds up the loading of web pages, and Google Chrome can transfer bookmarks from the desktop version. </p><h2>  Multimedia and Interfaces </h2>

All of them showed themselves in work well, with the exception of GPS, which did not want to turn on for a long time.  Buttons and connectors are located in the usual places.  The A319 has support for almost all popular codecs and formats.  The video player can even play Full HD.  Among the weaknesses of Lenovo A319, owner reviews mention light image freezes.  The weak "filling" is to blame for this.  The only drawback of the built-in player is the lack of settings.  It only allows you to loop the video clip.  The audio player is not able to independently find recordings in the FLAC format, however if you start the track through the file manager, it will play.  It is worth recognizing that this is very inconvenient.  The Lenovo A319 smartphone is equipped with a lithium-ion battery with a capacity of 1,500 mAh.  This is very small, because the device can work with two SIM cards.  This was also confirmed when playing HD video.  The batteries lasted for three hours at maximum brightness.  It is worth recognizing that the result is very bad.  Most competitors in this regard look much more interesting.  When using the audio player, the battery lasted for 10 hours, which is also not enough.  In the standard operating mode, the result was normal - 36 hours.  In general, the smartphone left a mixed impression.  Now there are competing models on the market that are superior to the A319, for example, Nokia X2 Dual SIM or Explay Tornado.  The final touch is cost.  For the specified phone they ask to pay from 4000 rubles.  So we examined the key aspects of the Lenovo A319 smartphone (price, reviews, specifications) and discussed them with you.
