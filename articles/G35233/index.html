  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Secrets of Anenerbe: history, artifacts, archives</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  During construction in a city in southern Ukraine, workers stumbled upon strange graves.  At first they thought it was a Scythian burial, but a Nazi medallion was discovered in a decayed coffin.  Archeologists who arrived at the site were shocked: dozens of graves were covered with chlorine, part of human remains were sawn into the spine, some had trepanation of the skull or no heads at all, traces of exposure to chemical compounds remained on the bones.  Glasses from quartz came across in coffins, on which, as scientists suggested, cell mutations were studied. </p><p>  Researchers found that the burial sites were traces of the work of Anenerbe, the most secret organization of the Third Reich.  At first it was a rather harmless society, which was created to study the heritage of ancestors, a departure from Christianity and a return to Germanic roots.  The organization received so powerful funding and support from the state that it covered almost all aspects of the life of the Third Reich. </p><p>  For the first time, the shocking scale of the organization recognized as criminal was announced at the Nuremberg trials.  The Anenerbe archives were divided among the winning countries. </p><h2>  The background of society: the theory of the separation of mankind </h2><p>  The Dutch-German mystic, who studied religions and languages ‚Äã‚Äãof antiquity, Herman Wirth in 1928 published the book "The Origin of Mankind."  The future first leader of Anenerbe claimed that there are two races at the source: the Nordic and the aliens from the southern continent, gripped by base instincts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  He contrasted the highly spiritual man with the beast man, a wordless and primitive creature.  The cause of the destructive processes in the Nordic race, according to German Virt, was mixing with the southerners. </p><div class="photo" data-original="totallychaos.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="secret anenerbe artifacts" class="if uuid-2977330" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2977330.jpg"></div><h2>  Creation and activities of the secret organization ‚ÄúAnenerbe‚Äù </h2><p>  The origins of the Heritage of the Ancestors society lie in the activities of the esoteric organization Thule and the hypotheses of some researchers, such as the follower of occult theories F. Hielscher and the scientist G. Wirth.  The religious philosopher Hilscher talked with researcher S. Gedin, a specialist in the East, as well as with Professor Haushofer, whose assistant was a German statesman Rudolf Hess.  It was Hess who introduced Haushofer to Adolf Hitler, who was captured by various occult-mystical hypotheses. </p><p>  The follower of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãconquering space for the higher race (Germans) in the east (on the territory of the USSR) was a friend of one of the most influential ideologists of the party A. Rosenberg A. Nikuradze.  The latter became the ideologist of the Polish society Prometheus.  His ideas had a special influence on the theory of the German race.  He considered necessary a war with the USSR and oversaw almost the entire racial policy of the Reich. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 1935, the Wirth exhibition was organized in Munich by Wirth of the German Ancestors.  Then he only defended a dissertation entitled "The Degradation of Dutch Folk Songs", in which he was engaged in the development of protomythology.  The theory of the existence of anti-people interested Heinrich Himmler, who visited the exhibition.  Both Richard Darre, the head of the SS racial-settlement department, and Friedrich Hilscher, who already enjoyed considerable authority in the party, showed interest in the exhibition.  Thus, all further covert investigations of Anenerbe were initially associated with Nazi leaders. </p><p>  Since the beginning of 1939, the organization received additional funding.  At first, the goal of this group of scientists was real proof of the theory of racial superiority of the Germans (the term "Aryan" existed only in colloquial speech, and the phrase "German race" was used in all official documents of the party) during archaeological and anthropological studies.  The work was to be carried out in accordance with scientific accuracy and scientific methods.  The results were to be popularized in a form accessible to the masses. </p><div class="photo" data-original="knowledgeofancients.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="activity of anenerbe" class="if uuid-2977335" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2977335.jpg"></div><p>  During the Second World War, the activities of the secret German organization ‚ÄúAnenerbe‚Äù officially completely reoriented to military needs.  Many of the early projects were quickly shut down, but organized by the Institute for Military Research.  Subsequently, the Nuremberg trials examined in detail the activities of the Institute.  The international tribunal recognized Ahnenerbe as a criminal organization, and the head was sentenced to death. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The organic connection of science and Nazi ideology </h2><p>  In the castle northeast of Buren, Heinrich Himmler intended to create the center of a new religion, formed by ideologists as a combination of ancient paganism, occultism and "true" Christianity.  The main hall, decorated under the influence of the legends of the Holy Grail, was used for the kind of religious meditations of the F√ºhrer and people as close as possible to the Nazi elite.  From the first days of the existence of society, scientists (philologists, archaeologists, ethnographers, historians) made propaganda films and wrote training programs.  Each member of the SS was necessarily taught ‚ÄúEdda‚Äù and taught to read runes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rune-journeys.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ancient runes" class="if uuid-2977434" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2977434.jpg"></div><h2>  Runes in the Third Reich: special characters of the "higher race" </h2><p>  The Germans searched for evidence of their ideas in the most ancient Germanic and Scandinavian runes.  Northern pagan peoples encrypted sacred knowledge for posterity with the help of secret writing.  Ancient cryptography in the early twentieth century became fashionable and even became part of culture.  Newspapers and magazines used runes as emblems; this sign was even placed on food packaging. </p><p>  In the USA, swastika - the oldest sign of prosperity and success - on winding gum inserts meant a win, and in 1929 the Coca-Cola company issued a promotional watch pocket with a swastika image.  German and Austrian soldiers of the First World War wore security amulets with runes on their chests.  Among these soldiers was the future leader of the Third Reich, Adolf Hitler.  Heinrich Himmler also showed an increased interest in the runes as a letter to the ancient "Nordic ancestors". </p><p>  Until 1939, all SS members studied runes without fail as part of a general training program.  The swastika began to be used on the eve of the war, and in 1920 Hitler chose this sign to decorate the party banner. </p><p>  The Sun Wheel (Zonnerad) was the emblem of the Viking Division, and later the Nordland Division, which was staffed primarily by Scandinavian immigrants.  Two runes "zig" made up the SS emblem.  The Wolfsangel was the emblem of the Reich tank division. </p><h2>  The question of the existence of Atlantis and the expedition to Antarctica </h2><p>  Many secrets of the Third Reich are still not revealed.  The Anenerb often raised, for example, the question of Atlantis.  Hitler was particularly interested in this.  The Institute came up with the name of the island - Helgoland - "holy land".  Ideologists sought to present history so that the Nazis could feel their exclusivity, which did not owe anything to Abraham.  After the end of hostilities, the ideas of society were picked up by the German theologian Jurgen Spanut, who identified the mysterious Atlantis with Helgoland (Helgoland). </p><p>  What terrible secrets of the Third Reich did Anenerbe deal with?  German mystics traveled across all continents, from Antarctica (looking for Atlantis) to Tibet (exploring local religions), but the most shocking were all the same medical experiments.  Returning to the question of Antarctica, it is worth mentioning that in the records of the German Colonel W. Wolf, an order was found to prepare groups of researchers for sending to the mysterious mainland.  After the war, Stalin became interested in these recordings and archives of Anenerbe.  On his orders, a Soviet expedition headed by General N. Kuznetsov was sent.  The results are classified, but it is known that Nazi military bases were found.  According to available documents, the secret base is located under Lake Vostok, the entrance is at a depth of 450 meters. </p><p>  Which archives of Anenerbe are declassified?  Of those relating to Antarctica, it is known that since 1938 German ships regularly cruised north.  Back in 1940, on the earth, Queen Maud began to create military bases at the direction of Adolf Hitler himself.  From here come the numerous theories about saving the Fuhrer.  Many believe that Hitler did not commit suicide, but hid at one of his secret military bases on the edge of the earth.  Assumptions are not unfounded, but there is no real evidence. </p><h2>  Other expeditions to the north: what you were looking for in Iceland and Greenland </h2><p>  In 1937, German Otto Rahn, an Ahnenerbe employee, an amateur archaeologist, traveled north.  First he visited Iceland, and then Greenland.  Russian researcher, candidate of historical sciences Vadim Telitsyn, claims that Ran tried to find evidence of the fortress in Greenland, information about which was contained in the early Russian chronicles.  These records are still kept in the Kiev Pechersk Lavra.  Otto Ran did not find any new artifacts from Ahnenerbe (photo of the researcher below), but he discovered cave paintings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="glazunov.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="otto wounds" class="if uuid-2977392" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2977392.jpg"></div><p>  Perhaps in the north, the Germans were looking for real evidence of the existence of the ancient Nordic race.  Back in the sixteenth century, the cartographer Gerard Mercator made a surprisingly accurate map of the continents, but Greenland was practically at the North Pole.  The Nazis believed that then the island was inhabited by the "white race", in search of which Otto Ran set off.  But the results of the expedition disappointed the top of the Third Reich, and the archaeologist himself in 1939 wrote a letter of resignation from the SS.  He went to Austria and tragically died in the Alps.  Is this also the work of the organization?  Most likely, although not all the secrets of the Anenerbe archives have yet been revealed.  Perhaps it was just an accident. </p><h2>  "Gothic district" on the Crimean peninsula </h2><p>  Employees of the "Ancestral Heritage" lectured to "scientifically" justify the total destruction of the enemies of the Third Reich.  One of the best specialists in Viking culture and prepared, Dr. G. Yankun, for example, very convincingly argued that the Germans in antiquity without regret drowned in the swamps of apostates, traitors and enemies.  Herbert Yankun became one of the ideologists who participated in planning the fate of Crimea.  After the occupation of the peninsula in the summer of 1942, Himmler sent Dr. Yankun to the region to search for the remains of a rich material culture ready (no archaeological evidence was ever discovered). </p><p>  In the future (after the end of the war) Crimea was to be completely settled and colonized by the Germans, becoming a full-fledged territory of the Reich.  The future colony was called the "Gothic district", because it was assumed that the Goths were the ancestors of the German "Aryans".  "Ariization" of the region was to be carried out for twenty years.  At first it was planned to deport the locals, then to redistribute the territories for the resettlement of Germans.  In addition, it was necessary to plant beech and oak forests (trees, by the way, were brought from Germany itself) in order to copy German forests.  On this wave, not far from the Austrian city of Graz, a biological station was created to develop new crops. </p><h2>  How in ‚ÄúAnenerba‚Äù tried to get ahead of time </h2><p>  Some of the secret artifacts of Ahnenerbe are ahead of time.  They were found in Tibet, according to the meager documentary data of the Chronos project.  Chronos is the Greek name for the ancient Roman Saturn, the god of time.  Anenerbe's special department worked on the impact on the fourth dimension - time.  German scientists believed that one could return to 1939, analyze the defeat, take into account mistakes and start a victorious war again.  For some time there were even rumors that during the last Nazi expedition to Tibet, the sacred axis of time was found.  German scientists simply did not understand how to spin it in the opposite direction. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rarehistoricalphotos.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="German expeditions to tibet" class="if uuid-2977425" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2977425.jpg"></div><h2>  The search for acoustic superweapon in the Caucasus </h2><p>  In the Caucasus, quite interesting objects are found, for example, skulls, which are neither like human remains nor animal bones.  Professor Yankun considered such findings evidence of the existence of the ancient Atlanteans.  In addition to searching for secret artifacts, Anenerbe was engaged in the development of technologies contained in megaliths of antiquity, and the study of anomalous phenomena.  One of these was acoustics.  This phenomenon is quite common, but in some conditions it can be a real weapon.  It sounds unbelievable that some ‚ÄúAnenerbe‚Äù artifacts were hiding in the Caucasus, but the acoustic weapons that Nazi scientists have been hunting for have been known for several decades.  And the fact that the Germans conducted research on the territory of the USSR is confirmed by the amazingly accurate map of Adygea compiled by the Nazis in 1941. </p><h2>  Top-secret project "Bell": the study of gravity </h2><p>  Another secret of the Third Reich and Anenerbe is the Bell project.  There is evidence that the Nazis conducted research with an object in the form of a bell made of heavy metal and filled with a violet liquid similar to mercury.  The liquid was stored in a thermos, packed in a lead casing of three centimeters thick.  The studies were carried out under a thick cap, the room area was 30 m <sup>2</sup> , and the surfaces were covered with plates with a rubber lining.  After each experiment, the laboratory was treated with saline for 45 minutes.  The procedure was performed by prisoners of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp. </p><p>  Each experiment was carried out for a minute.  The bell emitted a bluish glow.  All electrical equipment within a radius of 150-200 meters failed, almost all liquids (including blood) were divided into fractions.  The first group of researchers broke up after the death of five out of seven scientists.  In the second series of experiments, the risks were slightly reduced due to equipment modifications.  Shortly before the end of the war, all the documents were taken out by the SS team in an unknown direction, and all the scientists who took part in the program were shot by the Germans themselves between the twenty-eighth of April and the fourth of May 1945. </p><p>  What was the purpose of the Bell project?  The secret artifact ‚ÄúAnenerbe‚Äù (the bell was preserved, but the room where the experiments were carried out was dismantled, and the contents were destroyed) suggests that scientists worked on problems related to unexplored properties of gravity.  Perhaps the flow of a mysterious violet substance, similar to mercury, could excite a gravimagnetic field of considerable intensity.  This is very likely from a scientific point of view.  In addition, it is known that attempts to build an aircraft with a mercury-based installation were made back in the eighteenth century.  But in the Third Reich they were very attentive to the historical heritage, so that they could study old documents that other scholars caused only ridicule. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.historicmysteries.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="project bell" class="if uuid-2977427" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2977427.jpg"></div><h2>  Medical experiments on people </h2><p>  After Germany began the war, the secret archives of Anenerbe were replenished with shocking records.  The leading program was the anthropological development, which was carried out by the Institute for Special Missions.  Researchers used living people as experimental material.  The program was developed by Professor August Hirt, who alcoholized bodies and collected the skulls and skeletons of people of different nationalities.  The material for the experiments came from German death camps. </p><p>  In addition to anthropological experiments, the secret ‚ÄúAnenerbe‚Äù was also inhumane experiments on people.  Sigmund Rasher, a physician and a doctor in the Dachau camp, specialized in this area of ‚Äã‚Äãwork.  He wrote to his boss Himmler that Auschwitz would be a better place to conduct experiments than Dachau, because it is colder there, and the experiments will attract less attention due to the larger area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe camp.  When, for some reason, the experiments at Auschwitz did not work out, Dr. Rasher continued to work in Dachau. </p><p> Experiments were carried out to supercool people and observe the reaction of the body to a rarefied atmosphere.  Officially, experiments were initiated by the Luftwaffe to save German pilots who crashed in the waters of the cold northern seas.  But it was only a formal excuse.  The most common methods of dealing with hypothermia were already used then, so occult scientists conducted research for a different purpose.  And in general, the Nazis showed interest in the northern territories for a long time. </p><p>  The military secrets of Ahnenerbe were partially revealed at the Nuremberg trials.  The military tribunal sentenced many Nazi doctors working in death camps to death.  Prisoners were forced to participate in medical trials, most of which ended in death or disability.  Experiments were conducted to advance racial theory, develop new weapons and treatment methods. </p><div class="photo" data-original="encyclopedia.ushmm.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="concentration camp" class="if uuid-2977344" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2977344.jpg"></div><p>  These secrets of Anenerbe are shocking.  In Buchenwald, homosexual men were implanted with ‚Äúmale hormone‚Äù capsules, which were supposed to make them heterosexual.  In Dachau and Auschwitz, inmates were placed in cold water tanks or kept naked for several hours outside at freezing temperatures.  There, the Germans tried to develop a cure for malaria.  Healthy people were infected, and then they tried to treat with various drugs.  Monstrous sterilization experiments were supervised by Karl Klauberg to identify an effective way to sterilize millions of ‚Äúanti-humans‚Äù at minimal cost. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúDowsing‚Äù: how in ‚ÄúAnenerba‚Äù taught paranormal abilities </h2><p>  What other secrets did Anenerbe learn today?  It is known that in the SS they immediately took note of people who had paranormal abilities.  The organization even had courses of "dowsing", which managed to prepare three groups.  These were search engines with a rotating frame, a vine.  Dowsers were used to search for sources of drinking water, mineral deposits and were scouts during secret military operations.  In Bavaria, such specialists, for example, were involved in the search for gold.  But is it possible to teach a person paranormal abilities?  In ‚ÄúAnenerb‚Äù they were just engaged in the awakening of internal energy.  Wolfram Sievers spoke about these experiments of scientists of the Third Reich at the Nuremberg trials. </p>
