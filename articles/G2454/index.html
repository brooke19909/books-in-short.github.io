Of course, a surprise for children and the feeling that you get from an unexpected thing.  And since in the modern world the choice of gifts and holiday surprises is huge, the likelihood of getting confused and confused is very high.  Then we will tell you what a surprise to make for a birthday so that it will be remembered and liked by the hero of the occasion. </p><h2>  From somewhere from there </h2><p>  These ideas have come to us relatively recently, but are already firmly rooted in the minds: the best gift is one that you do not even expect to receive.  Typically, such surprises are packed in beautiful bags and boxes, but the modern world has found a more interesting solution. </p>

    <p>  Let‚Äôs take a look at the classic pi√±ata - a <span>surprise for children,</span> when the child‚Äôs goal is to destroy the outer shell of a suspended toy and extract its entrails.  It is often filled with sweets and various sweets, and sometimes with toys mixed with paper. </p><p>  It is not difficult to create a surprise ball with your own hands.  It has some similarities with this holiday accessory, but it is still more practical, since there is no need to look for a bat or stick, which can not only get sweets, but also harm others.  In addition, it can be made very quickly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to make a surprise ball </h2><p>  First you need to prepare all the necessary materials that may be needed in the further process of work.  They can be found in office or children's stores at a relatively low price: </p><ul><li>  Big <span>balloon.</span>  It will serve as a kind of "box" for a gift.  You can adjust its size yourself, relying on a further filler.  All balls for this purpose have one important point, which may scare the buyer during the acquisition.  This is the color of the ball, in a deflated state resembling medical gloves or even fingertips.  Do not be afraid of this trifle, as with further stretching of the product, its color will be closer to pearl or transparent. </li></ul>

    <ul><li>  Pump.  This item can be skipped if you are going to make a small ball.  But remember: the larger the size, the greater the likelihood that you can not do without a hand pump.  In addition, choosing small balls for the filler, know that it is almost impossible to inflate them manually, and if you try, it will take too much time and effort. </li><li>  Little balls.  They can be found in large numbers in holiday shops, where the choice is simply unlimited.  The larger the main ball, the more small ones you will need, so it is best to buy with a margin.  In addition, you can create your own color schemes, based on the preference of the birthday. </li><li>  How to make a surprise ball so that when it bursts everything sparkles around?  Add confetti and sparkles that will provide the gift with individuality and admiration of others. </li></ul><h2>  Warning </h2><p>  Before making a surprise ball, it is worth warning about the unexpected.  We all know that balls tend to burst loudly, scaring everyone around them.  And it‚Äôs better not to imagine what will happen if one of the balls inside bursts, because of which the others explode. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  To prevent this terrible moment, you need to monitor the degree of tension of the material - in our case, the rubber shell of the ball.  If you leave it a little lowered, while maintaining strength and rubber, then the probability of cotton on the holiday will practically drop to zero.  Of course, the quality of the material going to the balls and its properties are very important.  Therefore, it is worth choosing only trusted manufacturers and not risking a children's celebration. </p><h2>  Process of creation </h2><p>  To facilitate the work, making it understandable even for beginners in this matter, all actions will be described step by step: </p><ul><li>  First, prepare the main ball.  To do this, inflate it with a pump, slowly increasing step by step.  After he has stretched as much as possible, we will leave him in this position for a couple of minutes to achieve high material strength.  As soon as time has passed, blow off the ball and proceed to the next stage. </li><li>  It's time to add sparkles and confetti using a small paper cone to make work easier.  Pour all the components inside and proceed to further filling. </li></ul>

    <ul><li>  Poke one small ball and fix it in the neck of a large one.  Gently holding both parts, inflate it to the required size.  Then we tie the end and push further into a large ball, completely removing it from the neck. </li><li>  Step by step, fill the ball-base with small options, alternating colors and gently mixing with each other.  When it is already a little full, the further process becomes more difficult.  To lighten it, give the base a little air, and work will go faster. </li><li>  Fill the main ball completely with air so that all the components can move freely in it, tie a neck, and then shake the product well.  This step will ensure that the filler is carefully distributed. </li></ul><h2>  Straight for the holiday </h2><p>  Now that we have learned how to make a surprise ball, you can go to any celebration and be sure that it will go out well.  After all, it would seem that this is such a simple gift made from ordinary balls.  And how much happiness he will give to all participants of the holiday, which is usually expected for a whole year, because, unfortunately, a birthday is only once a year. </p>
