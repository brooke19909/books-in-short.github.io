    <h2>  Motherland </h2><p>  Many fascists were destroyed by the squadron of the 46th Guards Aviation Regiment, in which Rufina Sergeyevna Gasheva was a navigator.  Her birthplace was the village of Upper Chusovsky Gorodki.  It happened on October 1, 1921.  However, after her birth, she lived in the village of Vasilevo, Nizhny Novgorod Region, which later became the city of Chkalovsky.  From 1927 to 1928, her family was in the village of Kasimovo in the Perm Region, then moved to Perm, and already in 1930 they lived in Moscow. </p><h2>  Instead of studying </h2><p>  When the Patriotic War began, Rufina Sergeyevna Gasheva was supposed to begin her third year studies at Moscow State University.  After graduating from the 10th grade of the school, she entered the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics there.  But already in September 1941 Gasheva Rufina Sergeevna left her studies and joined the defenders of the motherland.  She liked aviation.  Therefore, in February 1942, she graduated from navigational military courses.  In the same month, she was accepted into the female night bomber aviation regiment as a gunner-bombardier.  This regiment was formed in the city of Engels, in the same place as the military aviation school, which she graduated from. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Tragic accidents </h2><p>  The first time this happened near Upper Agdum during a sortie.  The crew made an emergency landing with the engine turned off.  However, the Nazis noticed him and began to fire.  The pilot and navigator found unexpected salvation in a swamp located nearby.  But first, the girls had to crawl some distance, risking being spotted by the Nazis.  Before they saw the saving swamp, they moved away from the front line to fool the enemy.  Then they crawled over the railway embankment and hid in the reeds by the swamp.  Then they moved east, periodically bypassing German patrols.  Two days later they made their way to their own. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Last departure </h2><p>  The next time the plane was hit by enemy anti-aircraft gunners, workmate Gasheva was not lucky.  Another time they were shot down on the territory of Poland near the city of Naselsk.  An incendiary bullet from an anti-aircraft gun got into the casing and set fire to it.  Despite all the attempts of the pilot to bring down the flame, he was getting closer and closer to the gas tank.  The girls decided to jump and land on parachutes.  They were lucky, and they were in neutral territory.  However, the partner of Gasheva, Olga Sanfirova, fell on anti-personnel mines and died. </p>
