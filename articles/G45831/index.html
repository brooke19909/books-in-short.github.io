    <h2>  Childhood </h2><p>  Nikita Moiseev was born in 1917 in the family of famous Moscow scientists.  His father was a teacher at Moscow University and was of noble origin.  Mother, <span>Elena Nikolaevna,</span> died when the boy was only 5 years old, and his father was repressed in the 30th year. </p><p>  Even while studying at school, Nikita became interested in the mathematical sciences and even attended a circle at one of the higher educational institutions of the capital.  In addition, he was actively interested in sports, and he even managed to become the USSR champion in skiing.  In the graduating class he became the winner of the mathematical olympiad. </p><h2>  Education </h2><p>  The young man began to receive higher education from Moscow Pedagogical University, since his origin prevented him from getting to the Moscow State University the first time, but after a year he still managed to become his student.  During the training period, he was actively involved in mountaineering and even managed to work as an instructor.  During his studies, he also had to serve in the ranks of the Soviet army, where he taught soldiers skiing for the Soviet-Finnish war. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the beginning of the war, Nikita Moiseev just finished training and went to serve in the ranks of the army.  To begin with, he was sent to courses to master airborne engineering.  Initially, he served as an aviation technician, and then as an engineer and as the head of the armament of the aviation regiment.  He even had to perform the duties of an air gunner on the fronts of World War II. </p>

    <h2>  Scientific activity </h2><p>  In 1948, Moiseev Nikita Nikolayevich defended his thesis and began to teach at MVTU im.  Bauman.  Famous scientists of that time Korolev and Barmin read their special courses here.  He has a strong family, children, friends - a whole generation of Soviet scientists in love with science. </p><p>  Scientific schools are being created - these are whole groups of people who are connected by common not only scientific, but also moral ideas, where everyone is responsible for each other.  All the activities of the scientist are associated with a group of people who were able to pass the baton and prepare a huge number of progressive youth.  They created nuclear weapons, the latest missile technology and made the country the second in the world in the field of engineering and mechanics. </p><p>  In 1956, Nikita Moiseev came to the computing center of the Academy of Sciences and is engaged in calculations for the trajectories of space objects, the dynamic processes of the biosphere, philosophy, political science, and even creates his own school. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  He understood that humanity is on the verge of crisis and does not know where to stop so as not to fall into the abyss of non-being. </p>

    <h2>  Nuclear winter </h2><p>  All science, including mathematics, worked until the 70th year to create nuclear weapons and make war senseless.  In the early 70s, everyone realized that such a form of war was meaningless.  And the final point in this was put by a group of scientists led by Moiseev Nikita Nikolaevich, with the theory of “nuclear winter”.  There was a need for a change in course, including the political one. </p><p>  The results of the study of the student N. Moiseev, Vladimir Alexandrov became a sensation.  He is the author of the computer model of "nuclear winter."  He talked about how radioactive fallout will spread and our planet will change.  All models predict a sharp change in temperature if a certain amount of atomic charges explodes in the atmosphere.  A nuclear winter will come, the end of civilization - this is confirmed by both elementary and more complex studies. </p><p>  The most interesting thing in the research was that after the end of the nuclear war the atmosphere would not be the same and there would be no more room for man on the planet. </p><p>  The issue of nuclear winter was a particular one for Moses.  He solved planetary problems. </p>

    <h2>  General ideas </h2><p>  Nikita Moiseev is a scientist who raised the idea of ​​the morality of science.  It is now accepted by the entire scientific world.  He believed that compassion for his own people and native land would help to cope with our troubles and hardships.  He believed that a true scientist is responsible not only to science, but also to his people and planet.  Nikita Moiseev wrote that the 20th century is a century of warnings, and today we have a chance.  We need responsible collective decisions, a collective will and a collective conscience.  Humanity and the planet are one, and the human mind in its aspirations to save planet Earth should be one.  And this mind has no right to be immoral. </p><p>  As we see, the conclusions of the great man were based on his own tolerance and decency towards everything living and spiritual.  Maybe this is what helped the nuclear physicist achieve unprecedented heights. </p>
