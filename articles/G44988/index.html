However, a small piece of land has another name that has gained great popularity.  ‚ÄúIsland of rabbits‚Äù in Japan and abroad it was nicknamed because of the numerous animals that scurry about it and are not at all afraid of people.  Not only furry creatures attract tourists to this land.  Many are also interested in the mysterious history of this place. </p><h2>  Rabbit Island Location in Japan </h2><p>  First you need to figure out where this piece of land is and how to get there.  A small island is located in the waters of the Inland Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãJapan.  Not far from it is the city of Takehara, in Hiroshima Prefecture.  It is easy to get to the island by ferry, which regularly runs from nearby villages. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amusingplanet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rabbit island residents" class="if uuid-3033449" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38228/3033449.jpg"></div><p>  The location played an important role in the history of Okunoshima.  The island is quite far from densely populated cities, including Tokyo.  This is one of the reasons why it was chosen as the territory for the production of chemical weapons.  In the event of a disaster, the bulk of the country's population would remain safe. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The answer to the question of where the "Island of Rabbits" is located is given in the article earlier.  What is so famous for a small area inhabited by wild animals?  Why are tourists from all over the world so fond of this place? </p><h2>  Early story </h2><p>  The ‚ÄúWild Rabbit Island‚Äù (as it is also called) originally served exclusively for peaceful purposes.  Due to its small size, its population was limited to three fishing families.  The inhabitants of the island earned their livelihood in the waters of the Inland Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãJapan. </p><p>  The situation changed at the end of the 19th century.  In anticipation of the Russo-Japanese war, the government decided to strengthen the defense of the island, which has an important strategic position.  Around him were built ten forts. </p><h2>  Chemical Weapons Development </h2><p>  In 1925, <span>Okunoshima Island</span> disappeared from the maps.  This decision was made due to the fact that its territory was chosen for the development of chemical weapons.  The Institute of Science and Technology took up this task.  From 1927 to 1929, the construction of a plant for the production of chemical munitions was carried out on this piece of land. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="rabbit island plant" class="if uuid-3033441" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38228/3033441.jpg"></div><p>  The plant, located on the "Rabbit Island" in Japan, functioned until 1945, that is, until the end of World War II.  During this time, over six kilotons of tear and mustard gas were produced.  The work was carried out in an atmosphere of strict secrecy.  At that time, the movement against the use of chemical and bacterial weapons gained great popularity.  Chemical plant workers who worked under difficult conditions diligently kept a secret.  Many of them have acquired diseases associated with exposure to toxins.  The small population of the island was also forced to keep the existence of the plant a secret. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Post-war years </h2><p>  After the end of World War II, the Island of Rabbits (Okunoshima) located in Japan was again used exclusively for peaceful purposes.  A plant designed to produce toxic gas was burned.  The government got rid of all evidence of its existence.  Chemicals were disposed of, documents were destroyed.  The workers were promised to remain silent, after which they were allowed to leave the island. </p><div class="photo" data-original="japancheapo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Onukoshima - Japanese island with rabbits" class="if uuid-3033517" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38228/3033517.jpg"></div><p>  For many years, the history of Okunoshima has been obscured by mystery.  However, several decades later, the government began to correct the mistakes of the past.  Funds were allocated for the treatment of former employees of the chemical laboratory who were injured in the process of fulfilling their professional duties. </p><p>  In 1988, the history of the Toxic Gas Museum began.  The main purpose of its existence is to tell about the terrible consequences that the development of chemical weapons entails. </p><h2>  Where did the animals come from </h2><p>  When exactly Okunoshima was renamed in Japan in the "Island of Rabbits"?  Where did the furry animals come from on its territory, who brought them?  Two versions are being put forward to explain what happened. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amusingplanet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="former lab on rabbit island" class="if uuid-3033455" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38228/3033455.jpg"></div><p>  The first theory says that rabbits, in whose honor the island was named, appeared on its territory during the Second World War.  The roles of experimental animals were intended for furry animals.  With their help, the developers of chemical weapons intended to make sure of its effectiveness.  According to this version, rabbits were released after the plant ceased to exist. </p><p>  This version was refuted by Murakami, who for a long time served as director of the Poison Gas Museum.  This man stated that experimental animals died when a chemical weapons factory was burned down. </p><h2>  Alternative theory </h2><p>  According to the second popular theory, the Japanese island with rabbits became one several decades later.  In 1971, a group of schoolchildren arrived on lifeless land, which was delivered there for excursion purposes.  Children brought with them 8 rabbits that remained on the island. </p><p>  Over the following years, animals have bred in incredible numbers.  Now rabbits are found anywhere in the island. </p><h2>  Our days </h2><p>  Modern photos of the "Island of Rabbits" show that it is filled with fluffy animals.  Currently, this piece of land serves as the home of more than 700 furry creatures.  Rabbits freely walk around the territory, do not refuse contacts with people and even strive for them.  A large colony thrives because it feels at ease in an environment free of predators.  It‚Äôs even forbidden to bring cats and dogs to Okunoshima, as they can harm the rabbit population. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dailynewsdig.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rabbits and tourists" class="if uuid-3033519" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38228/3033519.jpg"></div><p>  How do the true owners of the island behave with tourists?  The animals are wild, but quite sociable.  They welcome visitors to Okunoshima without fear.  Rabbits hop on their knees to the guests of the island, willingly accept all kinds of treats as a gift.  Tourists are allowed to pet animals, feed them.  Many bring with them food intended for furry creatures.  In winter, the rabbits lack the natural food on the island, but its visitors do not allow them to disappear.  Rodents prefer carrots, cabbage or special foods.  The latter are sold at the hotel, which is located on the island itself.  Their cost is quite high, so many tourists prefer to bring food with them. </p><h2>  Is it safe </h2><p>  Is visiting Wild Rabbit Island safe?  The animals themselves are not able to cause tourists any harm, and there is no other living creature on this earth.  However, there is a theory that being in a territory where chemical weapons were developed only a few decades ago is a health hazard. </p><div class="photo" data-original="jw-webmagazine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="there are a lot of rabbits on Onukoshima island" class="if uuid-3033521" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38228/3033521.jpg"></div><p>  Fans of this theory reinforce their words with the fact that Okunoshima Island has never been seriously deactivated.  There are also rumors that chemical weapons burials remain on its territory. </p><p>  Despite all this, the island receives about 100 tourists annually.  On its territory there is everything you need for a comfortable stay - a hotel, a small campsite, shops, a golf course.  Hiking trails are available in significant places. </p>
