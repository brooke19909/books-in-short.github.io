  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Crock-pot 'Mulineks' - a new generation kitchen robot</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Modern household appliances are created in order to make our life easier, to make it more comfortable.  And many of these new products have now appeared in our kitchens.  These are bread makers, pressure cookers, double boiler and other appliances.  But the last "peep" of kitchen appliances are crock-pots, which successfully combine many such appliances.  After all, with the help of this small kitchen robot you can cook tasty and healthy dishes in a short period of time. </p><p>  And the Moulinex CE4000 crock-pot deserves special attention.  The technical characteristics of this model are noticeably higher than many other similar devices.  The case of this mulvark is made of stainless steel.  And this greatly increases its service life.  Another set of this appliance includes a steam basket and a bowl for cooking, which has a volume of 6 liters and a non-stick coating.  This amount is enough to feed a sufficiently large family of people for 5-6.  And in it you can simultaneously cook both the main dish and the side dish. </p><p>  The Mulinex crock-pot has several modes for cooking.  In it, with equal success, you can cook soup and porridge, stew and meat, you can fry meatballs, bake whole chicken or bake desserts.  There are many standard programs in this device.  You just need to lay the necessary ingredients in the multicooker, and she will independently cook pilaf or buckwheat porridge. </p><p>  The Mulineks crock-pot has two modes for cooking.  That is, food can be cooked under pressure when the lid is closed, as well as without the lid.  This device has a digital timer, auto power off function and a convenient display.  Upon completion of the program, an audible signal sounds and the appliance enters the mode of keeping food warm.  That is, dinner can be prepared at any time, and it will always be warm. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another multicooker Mulinex of this model has its own ‚Äúsecurity system‚Äù.  Hermetically lockable lid will allow you to keep all trace elements and vitamins in the products.  Also in this device there is automatic control over the temperature and pressure inside it.  There is also a special system that protects the housing from overheating and from overpressure.  Also, this device does not heat the air in the kitchen, as gas and electric stoves do.  There will be no problems with washing this multicooker.  Any dishwasher is suitable for this. </p><p>  Also, you can take it with you to the country, on a business trip, or even on vacation.  With it, you can save money on food.  And the Mulinex multicooker consumes relatively little energy - 1 kW.  But you need a little time for cooking dinner in it and you have been provided with energy savings. </p><p>  And this multicooker supports many cooking modes.  In it you can bake and cook, stew and fry and bake more.  With the help of this kitchen robot you can cook soups and cereals, dumplings and manti, muffins and casseroles and other dishes.  Also in the kit for this device is a book that describes one hundred recipes for a multicooker.  And from this amount, everyone can find something for themselves.  Management in it is simple, and after a short time, any housewife will be able to create their own recipes for her. </p><p>  Another good option is the Moulinex MK 7003 multicooker. It has a 4.5-liter bowl, and its power is only 630 watts.  The case of this model is also made of stainless steel, and it also has thermal insulation.  This appliance can be stewed, boiled, baked and steamed.  This multicooker is equipped with an electronic LED display, has a set of automatic programs, an automatic Keep Warm function, and a function for delaying the cooking time.  The bowl for cooking in it is removable and has a non-stick coating.  Another set comes with a basket, in which they are steamed, a spoon and a measuring cup.  And if you purchase a multicooker of this model, then a frying pan, oven, deep fryer, a double boiler and a rice cooker can be hidden in a closet and forget about these appliances. </p>
