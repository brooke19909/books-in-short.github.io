  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Subject of pedagogy</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The term ‚Äúsubject‚Äù of one or another science is understood to mean a certain part of spiritual, ideal reality, which is a logically connected, mind-based complex of thoughts of a scientist about one or another object that belongs to reality.  At the same time, reflections are not able to completely cover the entire complexity of the studied area, they are always an object-subjective character, reflecting not only the essence of the object itself, but the personal position of the scientist himself and therefore always correspond to the object to one degree or another. </p><p>  The subject of social pedagogy is a socio-pedagogical phenomenon.  It defines the principles, methods, forms of studying practical activity, the necessary conditions for its implementation. </p><p>  Social pedagogy is the theory and practice of social formation and the subsequent improvement of the individual and social groups throughout the <span>process of socialization.</span>  On the theoretical side, the industry is a system of concepts, laws, statements and laws that reveal the process of social <span>formation of a person,</span> the group management procedure in accordance with the impact of external factors on it.  The subject of pedagogy makes it possible to understand the nature of personality formation and group management procedures, existing problems of social deviations.  Moreover, within the framework of the discipline, methods are developed to prevent and overcome these deviations. </p><p>  In the process of complicating educational activities, increasing the diversity of forms, it became necessary to conduct a special analysis of pedagogical relations.  Thus, already in antiquity a special branch of knowledge was formed.  At first, it was a part of other scientific disciplines (philosophy, history, for example).  Subsequently, it began to be an independent science. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In psychology, it is customary to consider activity as a multi-level system, the components of which are motives, purpose, result, actions.  The structure of pedagogy is considered as a complex of elements that are relatively independent functional types of activities of the teacher.  So, such components as educational, organizational, and constructive were highlighted in educational activities. </p><p>  The subject of pedagogy today is determined in the form of a totality of thoughts about educational reality and how to improve it. </p><p>  Thus, the discipline as a whole is aimed at revealing the essence and patterns of learning processes in the development of personality.  The subject of pedagogy includes practical methods of increasing the effectiveness of these phenomena. </p><p>  Educational science is in close connection with practice.  This is largely due to the nature of the subject of <span>pedagogy.</span>  <span>The task of</span> science consists not only in the description and explanation, but also in the fulfillment of the normative and constructive function.  In other words, discipline raises the question of improving existing teaching practice. </p><p>  Today, the reflections of educational discipline are mainly aimed at solving some difficult, "eternal" problems. </p><p>  First of all, <span>this is the task</span> of forming the goals of <span>pedagogical activity.</span>  It should be noted that goal-setting is considered the most important issue in any activity.  Pedagogy cannot be effective without a clear understanding of the goals of raising and educating people. </p><p>  Another important problem is the question of studying the nature of man, his capabilities.  The difficulty in solving this problem lies mainly in the fact that human nature is not only stable, but also dynamic and able to change in the process of changing the world, social and natural environment. </p>
