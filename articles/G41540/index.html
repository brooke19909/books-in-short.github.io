    <h2>  about the project </h2><p>  Cottages in Opaliha, Nizhny Novgorod Region - a unique opportunity to acquire your own home near the metropolis.  The project is based on the format of a house in the village that is so popular these days, combining a number of undeniable advantages.  Instead of a three-room apartment with an improved layout, which for many Nizhny Novgorod residents is a real dream, you will get an individual house with a plot of land of 8 acres.  This option is a godsend for a large and friendly family, especially if it has small children.  The developer opted for a free layout of cottages, which allows each family to equip the interior of the house at their discretion. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  For the construction of cottages in Opaliha, a site was chosen near the federal highway M-7, namely a village of the same name, which is located only 11 km from Nizhny Novgorod. </p>

    <h2>  House price </h2><p>  Cottages in Opalihe with a plot are sold at a price of 3.7 million rubles.  The developer offers the opportunity to purchase his dream home not only for cash, but also on mortgage terms.  Those who took advantage of the offer note that the conditions are one of the most favorable in the city.  The reduced interest rate on the loan is primarily provided by the cooperation of the developer with the largest banks of the city. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Of course, cottages in Opaliha are a profitable investment, because it is unlikely that it will be possible to purchase your own house with a plot near the city for just 3.7 million rubles in another complex.  At the same time, potential buyers have a number of questions.  They want to understand that they are investing in their future and the future of their children in vain, getting the comfort they were counting on. </p><p>  Transport accessibility is the first question potential buyers ask.  In fact, the road does not take much time, but the main question is where exactly, in which area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city and at what time of the day you get.  The road to work and from work at the so-called rush hour will not do without traffic jams, but in general they are not much longer and longer than in other areas of the metropolis. </p>

    <p>  The quality of construction is hardly ideal, it has a number of shortcomings, but all of them are not critical.
