    <p>  The hotel is quiet and peaceful.  It is nice to be here, there are no noisy parties and similar events.  Therefore, they relax here with children, and people are very pleased with such a calm and measured vacation at the Petra Mare Hotel 4 *.  The reviews of numerous guests also speak of well-thought-out leisure.  In the evening, a program with animators is provided, funny events are taking place.  But at the same time, all these actions do not interfere with guests who came for silence, music or noise in the rooms is not heard.  You can choose a wonderful option with sea views, in such apartments the sound of the sea is constantly heard, it is very pleasant to fall asleep under these sounds.  But if a person wants complete silence, that is, rooms that overlook the hotel's courtyard.  The rooms are always well cleaned and the maids know their job. </p><p>  We can say that on the entire coast of Ierapetra the best hotel is Petra Mare Hotel 4 * (Crete).  Reviews indicate that everything here is at a high level. </p>
