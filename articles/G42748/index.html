    <h2>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  So, you were interested in a convector heater.  The principle of operation of this device is based on the difference <span>in air density</span> depending on its temperature.  Due to this, heavy air, that is, cold, pushes upward lighter, that is, warm.  That is why it is possible to achieve uniform heating of the room.  <span>Convector heaters</span> for the home are characterized by the presence in the lower part of the heat exchanger housing, to which cold air enters through special slots.  At the top there are openings designed for the exit of hot air.  In this case, hot air is distributed to all layers of air masses, due to which the colder gas is at the bottom, entering the convector.  The cycle will be repeated until the device is turned on. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Design challenges </h2><p>  To ensure maximum heat transfer and increase the efficiency of the heater, the heat exchanger is equipped with a whole complex of flat metal fins, which can significantly increase the contact surface area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe heated parts with air.  Most often, the plates are made of aluminum, which is characterized by the highest thermal conductivity in comparison with all other metals.  The entire thermal installation is hidden by a protective casing made of a sheet of metal, the thickness of which is usually 1 mm.  Thanks to this, the device becomes not only functional, but also a decorative element of the interior.  Temperature control is provided by means of a special heater power controller, which can have several positions or a smooth transition with an accuracy of a degree. </p>

    <h2>  Which are there? </h2><p>  A convector heater, the principle of which was described above, depending on the source of energy used, can be: electric, gas or water.  Depending on the installation site, these devices can be divided into four types: floor, wall, baseboard and built-in. </p><p>  The characteristics of the floor unit is a height of 40-50 cm, its installation directly on the floor, which is ensured by the presence of wheels or legs for the convenience and ease of movement around the apartment or house. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Wall-mounted models are usually characterized by large dimensions in comparison with the previous ones, but at the same time already the first ones, so the free space is not cluttered.  For wall mounting, special brackets are used. </p><p>  Skirting models are characterized by low height, compensated by the impressive length of the device.  Thanks to this structure, the most efficient capture of air from the lower layers is ensured, in addition, it is appropriate to install such equipment in front of <span>panoramic windows,</span> and a beautiful view will not be obstructed. </p><p>  Built-in models are mounted below floor level, for this purpose ditches are used, which are provided at <span>the design stage of the</span> home.  Usually they are placed near doors or windows, which allows you to create a so-called thermal curtain that blocks cold air on the way to the room. </p>

    <h2>  Convector type <span>electric heaters</span> </h2><p>  This option is optimal for heating houses, cottages, garages, retail and office premises with a small area.  They can even be mounted in the bathroom: at the moment, special models have been created for which increased humidity indoors is not a significant threat.  All these devices are highly appreciated for their virtually silent operation, as well as the highest safety indicators, since the heated spiral is protected by a special casing that does not come into contact with it.  The convector electric heater Electrolux (like its counterparts of other brands) is different in that it does not burn oxygen, as heat guns do.  There is no unpleasant odor, which usually appears due to the ingress of dust particles directly on the spiral of the device. </p><h2>  Options for electric convectors </h2><p>  Devices in this category can be wall or floor.  To provide a more pronounced effect of convection, they are recommended to be installed in the lower part of the wall, as close to the baseboard as possible, where the bulk of the cold air is collected indoors.  Modern electric models always have a thermostat that turns off the device during operation, preventing a fire hazard or overheating of the device.  It is important to understand that only a sufficiently powerful convector heater, the principle of operation of which was described earlier, is able to provide heating of the room in the absence of central heating.  Usually more than 2 kW of power or a set of several weak appliances is required. </p>

    <h2>  Gas convector heater </h2><p>  Devices of this type are able to cope with the heating of a small house.  Their power is usually higher than that of electric models.  However, you should not choose this option for an object whose area exceeds 60 square meters.  Such devices operate by flameless combustion of a liquefied propane-butane mixture supplied in cylinders.  This process greatly heats the massive panel, which quickly transfers heat to the air surrounding it. </p>

    <h2>  Design features of gas appliances </h2><p>  Any <span>gas convector</span> must have a switch, by means of which the power of the device is adjusted, as well as a timer, with which the device is configured so that depending on the time of day it changes the operating mode.  This greatly improves the efficiency and economy of the entire installation, which uses a gas convector heater. </p><p>  The principle of operation and the basic installation rules in this case have certain differences.  In addition to the energy source, it is also required to install a system for gas venting to the atmosphere.  The fire hazard of such devices is minimal, since thermostats shut off the gas supply if the burner flame goes out.  There is almost no noise from such units: this characteristic allows you to place it even in the bedroom, in this regard, the convector heater Ballu has proven itself. </p>

    <h2>  Water convectors </h2><p>  This type of appliance can be floor mounted, wall mounted and integrated in the floor.  The most important distinguishing characteristic of this type of device is that their place of residence is permanent.  This is explained by the need to connect them to the central heating system through pipes that supply them with the main source of heat - hot water.  The highest safety of such devices allows them to be used everywhere where there is already a water heating system.  If you are interested in such a convector wall heater, it will not be difficult to buy it, since its high popularity has made it so that now it is as important an item as various types of heating radiators. </p><h2>  Scope of water convectors </h2><p>  Devices of this category are widely used for continuous heating in country houses and apartments.  A closed water circulation system does not require updating.  It seems to some that the water convector is completely no different from a conventional heating radiator, but this is completely not the case.  He uses convection air circulation in his work, and radiators simply radiate heat into the room from the surface of his sections. </p>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Regardless of the type of device, that is, its energy source, it can also work on the principle of forced convection.  In this case, it is assumed that there is a fan in the design, which accelerates the process of forcing cold air, providing faster and better heating of the room.  The work of many models of underground and built-in convectors is most often based on this principle now.  This option allows you to get higher efficiency by accelerating the heating of the air masses. </p>
