This domestic manufacturer some time ago proudly presented its own development, equipped with two screens at the same time.  Such is the original smartphone turned out.  Although, you know, this could still be argued about.  The fact is that the technology of two screens is available in the arsenal of the South Korean manufacturer, Samsung, and the world-famous American company Apple. </p><p>  Nevertheless, we see that the above-mentioned brands have not yet released devices equipped with two displays.  But the Russian company succeeded.  The thing is that our engineers managed to optimize the technology.  Indeed, you must agree that in order to support the work of two screens, you need a good battery.  And in the present conditions, making it with an eye on the dimensions of the phone is not so simple. </p><p>  Nevertheless, today the goal of our review is different.  We will get acquainted with the smartphone, which has the name Highscreen Ice 2 White. </p><h2>  Introduction </h2>

    <p>  You can justifiably say that the manufacturer took advantage of the hype around ‚ÄúYotafon‚Äù to present his interpretation of the technology of two screens.  Of course, we have absolutely no right to talk about the equality of these two devices.  Still, in the case of ‚ÄúYotafon‚Äù we have a smart display called E-Ink, which extends to the entire rear of the device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But at the appendage "Vobis Computer" an additional screen is represented by a small window such as LCD.  From this side, the Highscreen Ice 2 Gray smartphone can show us what date it is, what weather awaits us on the street, what is the current battery charge, how much time, and whether there are missed events (these include text messages and voice calls) . </p><p>  Of course, in this case, talking about the multifunctionality of the second display, to put it mildly, is too early.  Especially actively discussing this element Highscreen Ice 2 w3bsit3-dns.com.  But let's just remember that among competing companies there are no analogues to this smartphone.  Even though we can only read some information from an additional screen, this is a real breakthrough for the manufacturer.  Which, by the way, can significantly increase sales and attract a new audience.  The point here is that the second screen can easily be used as a marketing ploy.  And this positioning will certainly be successful. </p><h2>  Functionality + Design </h2>

    <p>  An additional design solution that employees of the company applied to the back of the device gives the device additional attractiveness.  The Highscreen Ice 2 Galaxy 16 smartphone looks really presentable, and it will be difficult to argue with this.  Only the most inveterate skeptics, looking at the device, will be able to say so.  The back panel in case of contact with light will begin to sparkle with sparkles.  Maybe you already noticed such a move, if you worked with the device of the South Korean manufacturer Samsung under the name Nexus 4.  According to official polls, this smartphone in the entire trading range of the company has become the most attractive for buyers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Well, now it's time to move from words to deeds and find out what the 16GB Highscreen Ice 2 smartphone can offer us.  Its value in the market is fifteen thousand rubles.  Does the device justify its price?  Let's try to figure this out by taking a superficial look at its parameters. </p><h2>  Highscreen Ice 2. Specifications </h2><p>  The device belongs to the class of smartphones.  The form factor is, of course, represented by a monoblock.  The material for the manufacture of the case is plastic.  At the same time, the device‚Äôs touch screen is additionally protected by Gorilla Glass 3. On board the smartphone, we have the Android operating system, version 4.4.2. </p>

    <p>  If we talk about support for cellular networks, then the device works in Edge, UMTS, GPRS and GSM standards.  As a hardware filling, the integrated MediaTek processor, model MT6592.  The maximum frequency is about 1700 megahertz, which is not just good, but really good.  At the same time, eight cores work in the chipset. </p><p>  The amount of internal RAM - 2 gigabytes.  The user is invited to store personal data of a multimedia type 16 GB with the possibility of expanding the volume by installing a microSD memory card.  The following ranges of wireless Wi-Fi networks are supported: b, g, n.  The function of wireless data transmission ‚ÄúBluetooth‚Äù version 4.0. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There is a MicroUSB 2.0 interface.  It is used both to charge the device and to synchronize it with a personal computer or laptop.  A 3.5 mm standard jack is provided for connecting a wired stereo headset and listening / viewing multimedia files. </p><p>  If we talk about the display, then it is capacitive.  The matrix was manufactured using IPS technology.  The screen size is 4.7 inches.  In this case, the picture is displayed in the so-called HD quality.  This is 720 by 1280 pixels.  As mentioned earlier, glass is installed in Highscreen Ice 2, which protects the display from accidental mechanical damage. </p><p>  Good photos can be taken with the main camera, whose resolution is 13 megapixels.  For lovers of selfie, a ‚Äúfront camera‚Äù is provided, but you should not really rely on it (only 2 MP).  For night shooting of subjects in the device the LED flash is built in.  It is possible to set geotags through the use of GPS navigation. </p><p>  A set of sensors is represented by lighting and proximity.  Few people will be interested, but there is, of course, an FM radio.  As a source of battery life, we have a non-removable lithium-ion battery.  Its capacity is 2,500 mAh.  The smartphone has the following biometric indicators: height - 138, width - 67.6, and thickness - 8.7 millimeters with a mass of 135 grams. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2>

    <p>  The Highscreen ICE 2 Galaxy Blue is supplied with the smartphone itself, a USB adapter, the appropriate cord for it (provides charging and can serve as a means of synchronization with a personal computer or laptop).  At this ‚Äúcost of living‚Äù ends, and additions begin.  Among them - a wired stereo headset, a metal clip for installing / removing SIM cards, as well as all the necessary documentation.  This, of course, is a warranty card and an instruction manual. </p><p>  In general, the packaging from this phone has some differences.  For example, regarding the box from Highscreen Ice 2 w3bsit3-dns.com, the manufacturer reports that what color the device will be, the packaging itself will be the same color.  On the front side you can find the front image of the device, and on the back, respectively, the image of the rear panel with an additional screen. </p><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  Currently, the smartphone market has already begun to overflow with the same type of devices that are running the Android operating system.  Something similar is observed in the case of mobile device designs.  Almost all of them copy each other.  And in such conditions, the audience really begins to appreciate smartphones that stand out with their original appearance compared to competitors. </p><p>  Interestingly, the design does not depend almost even on the price segment.  No matter what money you spend - 5 thousand, 10, 15 - you are still more likely to get a piece of iron shackled in a plastic soft-touch coating.  The models will differ among themselves, of course, with the hardware filling.  But in terms of design, the difference may lie solely in the thickness of the edging.  This situation, unfortunately, takes place in the smartphone market. </p><p>  Recently, it has been noticeable that the South Korean manufacturer Samsung is trying to correct the situation with its devices.  Behind her, right on the heels, is the Chinese brand ‚ÄúHuawei‚Äù.  However, no one else has noticed such initiatives.  And if the subject of our review is not mentioned here, then most likely the reader already has certain thoughts. </p><p>  In fact, everything is not so bad.  Of course, the Highscreen Ice 2 mobile phone, which customer reviews about which have already spread around the international network, does not reach the bar of this masterpiece.  But there are some points that literally make the device look much more competitive against competitors.  Among such moments, of course, is the coloring of the back of the phone.  As stated almost at the very beginning of the article, sparkling glitters can be seen in lighting.  Moreover, the color will vary depending on the lighting itself.  If you look at the phone under an incandescent lamp (and also if you go outside and catch natural light), then the overflow will appear blue.  And if you use a fluorescent lamp, then pink and purple. </p><p>  The <span>Highscreen Ice 2</span> smartphone <span>, reviews</span> of which you can find at the end of the article, is precisely due to such a chip that stands out among its competitors.  Both the back and front panels are made of special material.  This is Corning <span>Gorilla Glass.</span>  Its third generation provides good protection against unintentional mechanical damage.  In fact, there are not so many devices that can boast of such technology in the smartphone market. </p><h2>  Retention </h2>

    <p>  The model we are reviewing today is comfortable and convenient in the hand.  Basically, this was made possible thanks to a thoughtful design decision.  It implies the use of smoothed corners in the design, as well as the creation of an apparatus with small dimensions.  Recall that the dimensions of the phone in all three planes are as follows: in height - 138, in width - 67.6, in thickness - 8.7 millimeters.  The mass of the smartphone does not cross the 135 gram mark. </p><h2>  Coating </h2>

    <p>  There is one more point that can be written down in the advantages of the device.  This is the presence of an oleophobic coating applied to the screen of a smartphone.  The thing is that it allows your finger to slide smoothly across the screen.  In addition, the advantage of <span>oleophobic coating</span> is that fingerprints are erased very, very easily. </p><h2>  Crash tests and operation </h2><p>  Many smartphone browsers after purchasing this device model conducted special tests to determine its level of security.  During use, it turned out that the back and left sides are less susceptible to wear.  It turned out that when falling from a height of human growth, a <span>protective glass is</span> unlikely to withstand a blow, but precedents, of course, can be.  Much depends on the surface on which the device falls. </p>

    <p>  However, let's not forget that the same can be said about the closest competitors.  You can see that around the perimeter of the smartphone laid a thick edging made of matte plastic, painted black.  Thus, we have a kind of side.  Why is it done?  The answer is extremely simple: to prevent the screen from touching the horizontal plane in the event that the user left his smartphone screen down.  This will further protect the display from scratches and scuffs. </p><p>  A slightly wider edging runs through the center.  It is also made of a material such as plastic, only painted already in dark gray.  At first glance it seems that the material of manufacture of this edging is precisely metal.  However, it is not.  A comment was received from Vobis Computer.  It turned out that from the very beginning the manufacturer assumed the laying of the second edging of the metal type.  However, due to the fact that the quality of reception (and, therefore, transmission) of the communication signal was deteriorating, the company decided to abandon the material in favor of plastic.  Another, final side protects the back of the device.  This is again a matte plastic painted black. </p><h2>  Build quality </h2><p>  This is a very important parameter that you should pay attention to when buying any phone.  In our case, it turns out that there is nothing to complain about.  The assembly is really high.  During the test period, no creaks or backlashes were detected.  In general, nothing wrong.  If you squeeze the device, we will not hear a crunch either.  Bend the back side right up to the device‚Äôs battery.  Thus, we have a good smartphone, for the manufacture of which high-quality materials were used.  If you want to buy a device that is neatly executed, with a soul, and also has compact dimensions, then the model is simply created for you.  Class, and only! </p><h2>  Front Panel </h2><p>  On the front side, you can find a speech speaker, which is located in the upper part of the device.  His engineers covered with a special metal mesh.  The latter simultaneously performs two functions.  Firstly, it protects the speaker itself.  Secondly, it is an element of decor.  The volume of the device, it should be noted, is at ‚Äúabove average‚Äù.  In addition, the interlocutor's timbre is heard pleasantly and efficiently.  There are frequencies both low and high.  In general, the interlocutor is heard loudly, legibly and clearly.  There is every chance of free conversations even in noisy environments. </p><p>  To the left of the speaker is a set of sensors.  They allow you to enable or disable the screen backlight when making a voice call, as well as adjust the brightness level of the screen in automatic mode.  There is also a front camera, the resolution of which is 2 megapixels. </p><p>  Under the screen there are touch buttons.  Central - more.  But those that are located on each side of it are smaller.  These keys are called ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù and ‚ÄúBack‚Äù.  There is a backlight, its color is white.  By the way: if the device has missed events (voice calls or text messages), then the central button will become an indicator that notifies the owner of the phone that you need to look into the smartphone and answer those who called the user.  You can adjust the color of the indicator.  This is easy enough to do.  To do this, go to the settings, open the display settings and call the ‚Äúlight notifications‚Äù item.  There is a choice of colors for a missed call, as well as a default setting.  The following colors are available for the phone owner: white, blue, light green, green, red, yellow and pink.  White will look more like light blue, while yellow will look more like light green. </p><h2>  Highscreen Ice 2 reviews. Disadvantages and advantages </h2><p>  Currently, the cost of this model of smartphone is about fifteen thousand rubles.  What does the user who purchased the device get in return for his money?  Firstly, this is an absolutely original device that supports the operation of two displays.  And it does not matter that the functionality of the second is so far limited to showing simple parameters.  Secondly, <span>it is a flawless</span> appearance.  Thirdly, the reliability that the engineers managed to achieve by installing the third generation of protective glass. </p><p>  Needless to say, hardware stuffing installed inside the device!  Eight cores operating at a clock frequency of 1.7 gigahertz, 2 gigabytes of RAM simply cannot but be approved by fans of really powerful and productive iron.  Of course, the ‚Äúrich inner world‚Äù of the subject of our review affected the smoothness of the shell and the operating system.  No glitches, no lags!  Everything works quickly, clearly, just perfectly! </p><p>  I would like to modestly note that it is superfluous to call a slot for a microSD memory card and (attention!) Four ports for SIM cards, just the language does not rotate. </p><p>  What disadvantages does the model have in the eyes of buyers?  Firstly, the main camera, perhaps powerful, produces high-quality images.  But it is terribly noisy when used.  For many, this may seem like a minus.  Secondly, a significant drawback is the lack of LTE technology, which allows you to work with fourth-generation cellular networks.  For such money, of course, I would like to see her on board our device. </p><p> Perhaps there are no more significant shortcomings.  This is the time for us to end, but many users may have questions of the following plan: is it worth buying this unit?  We‚Äôll answer: if you appreciate the original design, powerful hardware, the phone‚Äôs speed and want to try using two screens, then yes, buy the device without hesitation. </p>
