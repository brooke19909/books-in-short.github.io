Then we begin! </p><h2>  General information about the state and the resort </h2><p>  The relatively new, elegant in its impeccability hotel Acacia Palms Resort 4 * is located in an amazing location.  It was built and opened in India in the recent 2010 on the shores of the Arabian Sea, part of the Indian Ocean, near the beautiful snow-white Colva Beach in South Goa. </p><p>  Goa State - Indian Mecca for beach lovers.  This, by the standards of great India, is a small piece of land, almost entirely consisting of almost 100 kilometers of beaches not yet spoiled by civilization and people. </p>

In Central Goa is the state capital - the city of Panaji.  North Goa - the most beautiful white beaches, majestic cliffs, amazing and unforgettable sunsets.  Lovers of freedom of body and spirit, descendants of unforgettable hippies, come here from all over the world.  There is no place for peace and tranquility.  Here is a world of fun and sleepless nights.  And South Goa is in some ways the exact opposite of North.  This area, unlike the densely populated North Goa, is still the most sparsely populated part of the state.  Here is the most picturesque and beautiful nature and the widest beaches with sparkling white sand sparkling in the sun and dazzling.  But people come here not for drive and parties, but for peace and tranquility.  Young people hardly go here.  This is not their place.  People here enjoy a calm, wise life and experience.

On the beach opposite one of the hotels, you can safely and calmly rent a scooter and do an independent study of the nearest beaches and attractions of the coast. </p><p>  Also here is just a gastronomic paradise for lovers and lovers of seafood.  At the beginning of the tourist season, lovely, cozy, with stunning cuisine restaurants on stilts open.  The prices in them, frankly, are quite high (by the standards of India), but incredibly tasty cuisine and just huge portions save the situation. </p><p>  Places with more budget prices tourists easily find a little further from the center.  This place is also very popular with Ayurveda lovers.  In the huge number of pharmacies that are in the resort, connoisseurs are offered a huge selection of herbal ointments, massage oils and teas, specially made according to special recipes. </p><h2>  About hotel </h2>

Therefore, it is quite new, with all the ensuing consequences.  Due to its extremely favorable location in South <span>Goa,</span> Acacia Palms Resort is now one of the most popular four-star hotels in this resort, and indeed on the coast.

On the one hand, this is a big plus, since tourists do not have time to get tired of moving, and on the other hand, the close distance to the airport can be an unfortunate minus, because not everyone can enjoy the noise of landing and taking off planes. </p><p>  It is 8 km from the hotel to the city of Margao and the railway station of the same name, which is also very close and therefore allows active and inquisitive tourists to make independent trips around the country.  You can get to Margao from the hotel by public transport from the stop, which is very close, or by taxi. </p><h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Acacia Palms Resort 4 * hotel is just over 7,000 square meters.  It was built in the form of one main two-story building and several, or rather, six, cozy two-story bungalows. </p><p>  On the territory of the hotel there are 2 restaurants offering guests dishes of national Indian, Chinese and European cuisines, and 2 bars, which always have a large selection of various alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks and cocktails.  Also, the hotel has its own medical office with the ability to call a doctor, bike rental, tour desk, grocery and gift shops. </p>

    <h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  On the territory of the Acacia Palms Resort 4 * hotel there are 2 pools.  Guests can use umbrellas and sunbeds completely free of charge.  At the hotel, near the 24-hour reception you can rent a bicycle, book a seat on the bus if you want to go to the shopping center for shopping.  And if you are a gambler, then you are incredibly lucky, because there is a bus from the hotel to the casino. </p><h2>  Sea beach </h2><p>  Acacia Palms Resort (Goa) is located just 100-150 meters from the magnificent Colva Beach.  There is a not very wide road between the hotel and the beach.  Such a close location to the sea is quite a rarity and luxury for Goa hotels. </p><p>  At the municipal beach, umbrellas and sunbeds are provided to tourists for an additional fee or ‚Äúfor a drink‚Äù.  This "currency" is widely popular on the beaches of Goa. </p><p>  As many are well aware, many restaurants, cafes and shakes open on all beaches of the state during the tourist season.  And almost next to each of them are sunbeds.  They are the property of the neck.  If you need beach equipment, then you do not need to pay for it.  It is enough to buy juice, drink or beer in the cafe and in gratitude for the purchase you will be provided with a sunbed and umbrella, which you can use all day for free. </p><h2>  For children </h2>

There is no playground or children's room.  There is only a small pool for the smallest.

    <h2>  Hotel service </h2><p>  It provides daily quality cleaning.  The maids of the Acacia Palms Resort 4 * hotel are very conscientious in fulfilling their duties and are always ready to help.  The hotel also provides room service with the possibility of ordering and delivering food and drinks to the room, but at an additional cost.  And, in truth, tourists use this service quite rarely. </p><h2>  Settlement / Eviction </h2><p>  Check-in and check-out from the hotel must take place according to generally accepted world rules, i.e. check-in after 14.00, and check-out before 12.00.  But in this hotel the rules are practically not respected, to the great joy of tourists. </p><p>  If you arrive at the hotel late at night or in the early morning, you will be hospitably welcomed and, if available, immediately settled.  So it is with eviction at the end of rest.  Do you have a late departure?  So, it is very likely that you will conveniently spend time before the transfer, which will arrive to pick you up at the airport, in your room, quietly packing up, packing your things and souvenirs, and not ‚Äúon your suitcases‚Äù in the hotel lobby. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Many guests of the Acacia Palms Resort leave reviews directly in the hotel book or on the Internet.  But since the hotel is quite new and still not very famous, there are not very many reviews on it yet.  However, the vast majority of all available are positive. </p>
