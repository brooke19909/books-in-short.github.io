    <p>  The entire main front part of the gadget is occupied by a digital display, where time is displayed.  The model has few buttons and connectors, so it‚Äôs not difficult to deal with them.  AJ 3115 radio receiver with good signal reception (mini) is equipped with two AAA batteries, and in older versions you will need a Krona.  But autonomy can be useful only to those who like to travel, in other cases, the gadget is easily connected to a regular power supply, and the batteries serve to save data about the settings of the waves and the current date over time.  The device is also equipped with a timer to turn off the display and radio, allowing you to adjust the night time. </p><p>  Advantages: </p><ul><li>  a budget option; </li><li>  significant battery life; </li><li>  timer to turn off the display and radio. </li><li>  good reception radio; </li><li>  digital (pocket) option for travel. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  too austere design; </li><li>  There is no way to adjust the brightness of the display. </li></ul><p>  The average price in online stores is 1000 rubles. </p><h2>  Rolsen CR-100 </h2><p>  A handheld radio with good reception and a large digital display is user-friendly.  Having woken up, a person must clearly distinguish between the current time, and if he also fails, his ‚ÄúRolsen‚Äù is exactly what the doctor ordered. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  The model has a digital radio and can store in memory up to twenty radio frequencies both in the VHF and in the FM bands.  As in the previous two cases, two AAA batteries are responsible for autonomy, but with the possibility of working from the mains. </p><p>  The gadget will wake up with any of two options - a sound signal or the sounds of your favorite radio station.  You will not be able to oversleep, because the device has the function of repeating the signal.  In general, this is a very sensible and balanced radio with good reception.  Reviews about the model are very flattering, but the only thing owners complain about is the tight buttons, although you quickly get used to them and after a week you don‚Äôt notice any discomfort. </p><p>  Advantages: </p><ul><li>  large digital display; </li><li>  a budget option; </li><li>  stable and long ( <span>offline)</span> operating time; </li><li>  16 sound settings levels; </li><li>  convenient and wide signal repetition interval. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  tight functional control buttons. </li></ul><p>  The average price in online stores is 800 rubles. </p><h2>  All-wave radios </h2><p>  In this category, universal options for traveling and at home will be considered. </p><h2>  Tecsun PL-398MP </h2><p>  A radio receiver with good signal reception, powered by batteries, is a universal option that can be easily taken both to work and to relax, for a long time to enjoy your favorite thing with music.  If you have a spare set of batteries, then your favorite radio station will delight you more than one day. </p>

    <p>  The Texan radio operates on two AA batteries, has a slot for an SD card on board and is rightly called a universal model.  If you wandered somewhere in a remote place where there is no radio signal, then you can listen to MP3 music from a memory card. </p><p>  A Texan radio with good reception can operate with frequencies of different ranges: FM, VHF, CB, LW and HF.  Sound is carried out through two pretty good speakers, which allows you to get a tangible stereo effect. </p><p>  The gadget is equipped with an alarm clock and an off timer, which adds to it even more versatility.  All function buttons are located on the front control panel, so before you put the receiver in the bag, do not forget to lock them.  Judging by user reviews, the model turned out to be very successful and the only thing the owners of the gadget complain about is the high price of the device. </p><p>  Advantages: </p><ul><li>  maximum spread of frequency ranges; </li><li>  the ability to use an SD card; </li><li>  Attractive and ergonomic design </li><li>  multifunctionality of the device; </li><li>  thermometer. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  The relatively high price of the gadget; </li><li>  sound quality could be better. </li></ul><p>  The average price in online stores is 6,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Panasonic RF-3500 </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the Sony and Panasonic radio with good reception (digital) differ from similar models in quality and relatively low price, and the latter is clearly the leader in this area. </p>

    <p>  The RF line can catch the frequencies of most popular ranges, but only FM radio can boast of impeccable work.  The disadvantage of the device, judging by the feedback from users, is the lack of illumination of the range scale, which complicates its use in the dark.  As for design and ergonomics, everything is done at a high level - beauty, convenience and comfort.  This also includes excellent build quality and very good sound for one speaker. </p><p>  Advantages: </p><ul><li>  attractive appearance; </li><li>  excellent ergonomic characteristics; </li><li>  high sensitivity and confident reception in the FM range; </li><li>  high-quality sound. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  just one speaker; </li><li>  the range scale does not have a backlight. </li></ul><p>  The average price in online stores is 2500 rubles. </p><h2>  Tecsun PL-310 </h2><p>  The PL-310 model can be described as a simplified version of the flagship of this line, but this does not make it infringed on functionality and ergonomics.  The only thing the manufacturer saved on was the dynamics, so the radio with good reception turned out without a stereo effect, otherwise everything was in its place, even a thermometer remained. </p>

    <p>  The device is able to work with frequencies in five popular ranges.  The gadget can remember up to five hundred fixed radio waves, and this is about a hundred cells in one range.  The receiver works through a five-volt network adapter, and if you want to take it to nature, then you can put ordinary batteries.  It is also possible to use AA batteries as batteries, which will recharge when the device is connected to the network. </p><p>  Away from the city, reception becomes noticeably worse, but with a socket for an external antenna, the problem is solved in a matter of seconds, turning the gadget into a radio receiver with good reception at almost any distance from active radio points. </p><p>  Advantages: </p><ul><li>  advanced device functionality; </li><li>  support for five common frequency ranges; </li><li>  Attractive design and ergonomics. </li><li>  thermometer. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  a small and only speaker for such an expensive device; </li><li>  price. </li></ul><p>  The average cost in online stores is 5,000 rubles. </p><h2>  SUPRA ST-116 </h2><p>  This radio with good reception was created specifically for thrifty people.  The cost of the gadget does not exceed reasonable limits, although the <span>bargain price</span> can not be called either.  The model has a simplified design in gray or black, and on the front there is a relatively small speaker. </p>
