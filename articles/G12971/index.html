Once a leader in the mobile phone market, the company suffered heavy losses back in 2013.  A little later, it was swallowed by Microsoft, which is now doing a reboot of its beloved brand.  At that moment everything looked sadder. </p><p>  And so, one of the phones designed to restore the company's reputation and return Nokia to the global market was Lumiya 920.  The characteristics of the model, as well as its advantages and disadvantages are described in this article.  Also, analyzing customer reviews, we will find out whether the “920” model managed to become a real flagship in the smartphone line of the Finnish company. </p><h2>  Price class </h2>

    <p>  To begin with, what usually completes all such reviews - with the cost of the device.  At the very beginning of the article - about the price of “Lumiya” 920 (the characteristic of which will be given later) to understand which class the model should be assigned to and with what to compare it. </p><p>  So, today the cost of the model, which is no longer available, varies between 7400-7800 rubles, due to which the device can be equated to Chinese Android devices or budget models of "top" companies like Samsung.  However, probably at the time of the release, the phone was more expensive and belonged to the middle class.  Now it’s definitely a “budget." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Nevertheless, his parameters are clearly worthy.  By the way, we’ll talk about them. </p><h2>  Assembly and housing </h2><p>  In any case, the case of the device is what we perceive at the first moment.  And in this regard, Nokia is traditionally doing well.  The design of the “Lumia 920”, the characteristics of which will be a little further, confirms this. </p>

    <p>  The phone is available in 4 color variations - two of them are bright (yellow and red), and two are conservative (black and white).  Thus, the user can change the covers on the device, picking them to your taste. </p><p>  In general, the “Lumiya 920” has a pretty good case characteristic - the phone looks solid, no gaps and indents are noticeable.  The only remark is the creaks of the cover, which some users complain about in reviews.  However, it is difficult to say how massive this phenomenon is.  Officially, the manufacturer did not give statistics on this defect. </p><p>  In general, the management of the smartphone is organized quite conveniently.  Under the screen there are three physical navigation buttons - “Back”, “Home” (or “Home”) and the search button.  This panel looks quite impressive.  On the right side rib there are buttons for adjusting the sound and unlocking the Nokia Lumia 920 screen.  The characteristic notes that they are covered with a ceramic layer, due to which they will last an order of magnitude longer than plastic ones. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Display </h2><p>  Let's move on to another equally important element of any smartphone - the screen.  According to the stated parameters, the manufacturer installed a 4.5-inch display created using IPS technology on the Lumiya 920.  The characteristics also indicate that the glass is covered with a special polarizing layer that does not give glare and allows you to work on the phone even on a bright sunny day.  True, there is another side to the coin.  This problem is written by users themselves, based on their own experience.  Naturally, this does not contain the official specification from the manufacturer "Nokia Lumiya 920". </p><p>  Reviews indicate that it is very inconvenient to work with the phone in the dark due to high brightness.  The most annoying thing is that you can’t reduce it in the settings.  Therefore, the owners of the device have a hard time if they decide to read something interesting before going to bed. </p>

    <p>  In general, the display at Lumia is quite decent.  It responds well to gloved touches, and due to its high resolution (1280 by 768 pixels) it is capable of transmitting an excellent picture.  Thus, in the cold, you should not make unnecessary movements associated with removing gloves to work on the phone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Technical stuffing </h2><p>  Agree, the display "Nokia Lumiya 920" characteristic is pretty good.  What about the hardware and, in fact, the “stuffing” of the device? </p><p>  The manufacturer notes that the smartphone operates on the basis of Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 - a processor consisting of two cores.  Thanks to such a device, its clock frequency is 1.5 GHz.  In practice, the phone shows good performance: instantly responds to touch, does not hang and easily plays even complex games.  Perhaps the PureVision + technology, which Nokia talked about so much, helps. </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  Not bad in technical parameters, the camera is installed on the "Lumiya 920".  Characteristics, reviews, user data, marked it as quite worthy, in comparison with the best models of Apple and Samsung, available at that time in the market.  This is achieved, firstly, due to high-quality components;  secondly, with the help of new technologies, which, again, were mentioned in Nokia during the presentation of the model.  One of them, for example, is to adapt the camera to the movement of a person’s hand.  With it, you will definitely know that the lens will not twitch at the last moment, and the photo will not work blurry. </p><p>  There is also a feature, like creating several photos at the same time (and then automatically selecting the best one) and gif animations from your videos, much more. </p><h2>  Additional functionality </h2><p>  Interesting (as about the <span>“Lumia 920” feature</span> claims) are the additional features on this smartphone.  In particular, the possibility of <span>wireless charging</span> Qi deserves attention.  With it, a 2000 mAh battery can be charged in about the same amount of time as from a mains charging adapter.  In this case, you do not need to pull any wires to the phone - just put the device on a special platform. </p><p>  By the way, the battery here is really powerful - enough of it, with such a level of charge consumption, for 40-50 hours of working with the phone.  To understand what is the advantage of this model, it is worth taking a look at models with Android OS, which hold 15-20 hours at the same rate of use. </p>

    <p>  In addition, you can also mention a two-section flash, which allows you to take excellent photos even in a dark room.  Its diodes are arranged in such a way as to give uniform illumination into the space in front of the camera. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  Works "Nokia Lumiya" 920 (specifications, price, reviews of which are discussed in this article) on the operating system Windows Phone.  A natural issue that may bother readers of the article is the variety of programs that make using the phone convenient.  In particular, this applies to navigation, file sharing, multimedia. </p><p>  In Lumia 920, all this is implemented quite well.  The map here is presented by the HERE program, which includes a package for moving with the Drive car.  As for data exchange, Nokia and Microsoft, called SkyDrive, highlight the following.  You can also mention the excellent Office suite, including Word, Excel, and so on. </p><p>  That is, in general, worrying about the fact that your “Lumiya 920” will not have decent content is not worth it.  Here you can easily install many programs posted on the Market for WP.  And, as practice shows, the developers are working hard so that this directory does not lag behind the Appstore and Google Play. </p><h2>  Competitors </h2>

    <p>  Of course, a lot of time has passed since the phone was released, so the market situation has changed significantly.  However, let us pay attention to the technical characteristics of the “Lumiya 920” in comparison with the phones that were available at that time. </p><p>  For example, very similar in terms of HTC 8X.  It has almost the same parameters, including a similar design.  It's just that this model is less popular Lumia, due to which, perhaps, it made less sensation in the market. </p><p>  Speaking about similar phones with other OSs, it should be noted that Google Nexus or Optimus G are running on Android LG. Their technical parameters are very similar, while the cost of the phones was at the same level. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  So, you know what “Nokia Lumiya 920” features, price.  Customer reviews - this is worth mentioning in addition.  Most recommendations are positive;  users are advised to buy this particular model.  People note that the lack of software for Windows Phone is a myth, but the build quality, speed, camera, battery and other modules work "on top".  Therefore, the feedback on this model is impressive. </p><p>  Now, of course, in the Lumia line of devices there are other devices, for example, models 830, 640, 535 and so on.  All of them are better arranged "Lumiya 920".  In this case, of course, the developers used the experience of this device, making the rest of the smartphones as they are now. </p><p>  If you now ask the mobile market experts about how much Microsoft has advanced in sales, they are confident to note a fairly high growth.  Of course, partly it was provided by the release of the model 920, which set the direction for the development of subsequent phones.  Today, the company is confidently moving forward, increasing its customer base and increasing its image. </p>
