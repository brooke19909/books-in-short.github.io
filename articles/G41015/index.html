The opposition to the Catholic Church, which had lost all sense of measure, was very strong and, expanding more and more, encompassed many countries in Europe so quickly that the Vatican was forced to respond and introduce retaliatory measures. </p><h2>  Response action </h2>

The blow delivered by the Reformation shook the foundations of the Catholic Church, but the Counter-Reformation prevented it from being destroyed completely.  Some historians believe that these two powerful movements personify the rebellion of less advanced countries against Italy, which at that time was a highly intellectual free state.  This statement is supported by the fact that outrage at the abuses of the Catholic Church began in Germany after the speech of Martin Luther, then swept France, England, Holland, Spain, the Czech Republic, Switzerland.  Italy at that moment was so unloved that everyone forgot that it was the birthplace of the Renaissance.  The counter-reformation is an Italian-Spanish response to neighbors.

The Italian side put forward a worthy adversary to such personalities as Martin Luther, Jean Calvin, Jan Hus.  Perhaps the retaliatory measures of the Catholic Church would not have been so effective if the desire for its own reformation and liberation from those sins that its opponents reproached it did not arise within itself.  That is why the counter-reformation is also an attempt at the internal rebirth of the Catholic Church.  Quite powerful forces came out on her side - the princes of southern Germany and Italy, Emperor Charles V, Pope of the <span>Holy Roman Empire</span> and King of <span>Spain Philip II.</span>  Their main instruments were <span>monastic orders, the</span> Inquisition and the Roman Curia.  The Inquisition itself, which, along with the trade in indulgences, causes the greatest discontent and popular indignation, was transformed in 1542 and became directly papal. </p><h2>  Starting events </h2>

In 1545, the <span>Council of Trent</span> was convened <span>.</span>  At the initiative of Paul III, the then Pope, the 19th <span>Ecumenical Council</span> is going to Trent <span>,</span> which went down in history under the name Serdyksky.  Just as Martin Luther‚Äôs speech with the subsequent beating of his famous ‚Äú95 theses‚Äù to the doors of the Wittenberg church is considered the beginning of the Reformation, so the XIX Cathedral is the starting point of the Counter-Reformation.  It ended in 1563 and, undoubtedly, strengthened the position of Catholicism.  One of the landmark events of the cathedral, which significantly increased control over the minds of citizens, was the creation of the Index of Prohibited Books, which was canceled only in 1966 and lasted four centuries.  The Reformation and Counter-Reformation in Europe have their root causes and premises, lurking in the depths of Catholicism and Christianity as a whole.

About how much he did for the Counter-Reformation, says his main slogan - "The end justifies the means."  Its effectiveness was explained by the device of the order itself on a military model, severe discipline and obedience, the highest educational level of the Jesuits and their infinite devotion to Catholicism.  The Jesuits lived in peace and became famous both for their cruelty and missionary activity.  There is an opinion that the most ardent adherent is a former inveterate sinner.  According to Didro, the fanatic Loyola spent his youth in wars and debauchery.  The brutal persecution and physical destruction of heretics made the word "Jesuit" a household word, personifying cunning, betrayal and meanness.  Once again bonfires flamed across Europe.  On one of them, Giordano Bruno was burned in 1600.

In France, after the bloody Bartholomew night, which happened in 1572, when 30,000 Huguenots were cut out, religious tolerance was established.  Sweden, England, Prussia, Saxony and Denmark became protestant.  The Reformation and Counter-Reformation in Europe are the links of the same chain, which are religious wars.  The dispute between the Protestant and Catholic churches only ended after the 30th warrior.  <span>The Peace of Westphalia,</span> concluded in 1648, called the churches equal.  The new religion considered laziness, idleness and motivation to be the biggest sins.  It was fully consistent with nascent capitalism.  People were inculcated with the desire to earn and become wealthy, competition arose.  We can safely say that the Reformation and Counter-Reformation contributed to the emergence of new economic relations and the change of formations.  In the countries where Catholicism did not give up its positions, capitalism came much later.
