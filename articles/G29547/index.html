This is one of the reasons why people decide to stay here. </p><p>  The hotel has three bars and two restaurants.  One specializes in international cuisine (buffet is served there), and the other in Japanese.  There you need to pre-book a table. </p><p>  About how things are going with food in institutions, reviews will best tell.

But for drinks, "all inclusive" applies only from 10:00 to 00:00. </li><li>  Every day, a new themed dish of Mediterranean, Greek, Middle Eastern and other cuisines appears on the menu. </li><li>  There is a separate table for children. </li></ul><p>  So we can conclude: the all-inclusive service in the case of this hotel is fully justified.  You don‚Äôt have to disappoint. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="louiscretaprincess.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rooms of the Louis Creta Princess 4 * hotel in Greece" class="if uuid-2300075" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2300075.jpg"></div><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Now you can tell about the apartments in Creta Princess Louis.  The following numbers are available: </p><ul><li>  Double, 24 sq.m.  With side and direct sea views.  Two options are offered: with one 2-sleeping or two standard beds.  There is a bathroom with a toilet and a private balcony.  The amenities are: shower, heating, air conditioning, telephone, fridge, hairdryer, plasma TV, safe. </li><li>  Family  25 sqm  There are also rooms with side and direct views.  All rooms have a double bed and a sofa bed.  There may be two of them - it depends on the number of guests.  The amenities are the same. </li></ul><p>  All rooms at the Louis Creta Princess Hotel (Crete) look very stylish and modern.  The furniture is new and comfortable, the plumbing works flawlessly - the comfort of the guests will not be disturbed. </p><h2>  Who is the hotel suitable for? </h2><p>  Having studied the reviews left about Louis Creta Princess 4 *, we can conclude: this complex is most suitable for people looking for a budget option for a family vacation. </p><p>  Children here like pools, playgrounds, a games room, discos.  Parents of the kids say that they don‚Äôt even want to leave the mini-club - the teachers are guided by the interests of each child, they play with them and do not let anyone get bored.  Children willingly go there.  And this is good, because while the child is under supervision, parents can relax in solitude. </p><p>  The beach is also convenient for vacationers with young children - the calls are good, and you don‚Äôt have to go far. </p><p>  If people are going on vacation who do not plan to stay at the hotel all the time, then it will be useful for them to know that buses run to the city of Chania, the village of Platanias and to the resort of Agia Marina every half hour.  And in general, tourists resting here are happy to note the developed infrastructure.  There is a shop a few meters from the hotel, and a supermarket is a 10-minute walk away. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebookers.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beach hotel Louis Creta Princess 4 *" class="if uuid-2300078" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2300078.jpg"></div><h2>  pros </h2><p>  It was briefly described above about what Louis Creta Princess 4 * is located in Crete.  On the pros and cons, you can draw certain conclusions based on this information.  But what do people relaxing at the hotel say?  They mainly focus on the following points: </p><ul><li>  Climate.  This, of course, is not a feature of the hotel, but of the area, but if you want moderate heat, and not hellish heat, then you should go to Maleme. </li><li>  Pools.  Always clean, the smell of bleach is almost not felt, the water is moderately refreshing. </li><li>  Staff.  The hotel employs very friendly and sympathetic people who quickly solve any questions that arise. </li><li>  Aquapark.  Like very young children and adolescents. </li><li>  Beach.  There are always enough free sun loungers, you can not get up early in the morning to take. </li><li>  Cleaning.  Daily and high-quality, linen is also regularly changed. </li></ul><p>  As for the rooms, the impression is mixed.  Many were satisfied with the comfort and atmosphere, but some had too little space. </p><h2>  Minuses </h2><p>  They are everywhere.  Louis Creta Princess 4 * in Greece is no exception.  This hotel has few disadvantages, but it would be unfair not to mention them. </p><p>  Most tourists are upset by poor sound insulation.  Out of season, when the hotel is half empty, this flaw does not manifest itself.  But at the height of summer, everything that happens in the neighboring rooms is audible. </p><p>  There are also not very well-located apartments.  Rooms overlooking the sea are quieter.  On the opposite side are generators, and some right under the apartment.  People living in these rooms say that vibration even with closed windows is palpable.  But you can always ask to change the apartment.  The administration does not refuse such requests, and no surcharges are also required. </p><p>  Another nuance, perceived by many as a minus, is the presence of a huge number of small children.  But as already mentioned, this is the concept of the hotel.  Therefore, people who dream of a quiet, peaceful and relaxing vacation, it is better not to go here.  There can be no question of any romance in restaurants and near pools when the kids are making noise around. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tonkosti.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Louis Creta Princess 4 * (Greece, Chania, Crete)" class="if uuid-2300083" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2300083.jpg"></div><h2>  Vouchers </h2><p>  Many people choose Greece for their future holidays.  In Louis Creta Princess 4 * (Chania, Crete) you can go on a package tour, which is the most profitable and optimal option. </p><p>  A good tour will cost two vacationers about 60,000 rubles.  This package includes payment of the following expenses: </p><ul><li>  Tickets from Moscow to Heraklion and back. </li><li>  5 nights in a standard double room with sea view. </li><li>  State tax per night. </li><li>  13 percent VAT. </li><li>  City tax of 0.5%. </li><li>  All-inclusive meals. </li><li>  Insurance. </li></ul><p>  And there are cheaper offers.  It all depends on the particular tour operator and season.  Do not forget about last minute deals!  Sometimes you can save 30% of the cost of the tour, or even more.  In general, you just need to track information and wait for the right moment. </p><p>  In any case, a ticket - it is profitable and convenient.  No need to independently search for airline tickets, book a hotel and pay taxes additionally.  Fuel surcharge unless. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.expedia.ie" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Greece: hotel Louis Creta Princess 4 *" class="if uuid-2300089" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2300089.jpg"></div><h2>  Reservation </h2><p>  If tourists plan their holidays themselves, and do not buy a ticket, then they need to know some rules. </p><p>  Firstly, it is better to reserve apartments in advance.  By the beginning of the holiday season, which opens in May, the reservation will be scheduled until September. </p><p>  Secondly, check-in starts at 14:00, and check-out lasts until 12:00.  This information must be taken into account when buying tickets to save yourself from waiting. </p><p>  Thirdly, for children who are not two years old, you do not need to pay extra.  They live for free, and cots are also provided. </p><p>  Fourthly, when booking, you must provide your credit card details.  And then, upon check-in, present it with your passport.  The property is hosted by American Express, Visa, JCB and Master Card. </p><p>  And the last: the hotel can order a transfer from the airport (the service is not available on public holidays and on Sundays).  But for this you need to contact the administration to clarify the details of the arrival and find out about payment. </p>
