  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The structure of scientific knowledge - what is it</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Those who are faced with science and its features, at the very beginning should understand <span>what the structure of</span> scientific knowledge is and what it means.  And, strangely enough, any knowledge can be classified in some way, highlighting certain types of knowledge, some specific features and even forms.  Moreover, it depends a little on what specific scientific sphere you decided to delve into, because each of them has a common ‚Äúbackbone‚Äù.  And if we talk directly about component levels, then in any system of knowledge we can distinguish: empirical, theoretical and philosophical levels. </p><p>  <strong>Empirical level</strong> </p><p>  With the help of empirical (sensory) knowledge, scientists have the opportunity to establish contact with reality, gaining knowledge about certain events.  Equally important is the identification of the properties of certain objects or processes that are being monitored (the main <span>empirical method).</span>  The implementation of this category of scientific knowledge is possible only through sensation, perception and representation.  And here are especially important: visualization and objectivity, sensuality, reproduction of external properties. </p><p>  <strong>Theoretical level</strong> </p><p>  It is important to note that the theoretical level is a whole system of scientific knowledge.  It is this area that defines the basic concepts, categories and laws.  Here it is especially important to be able to think, to be an expert in <span>logical operations</span> and, in spite of everything, to be able to rely on a sensual level of knowledge.  However, this level is also shared: </p><p>  1. Fundamental theories.  Here we are talking about ideal and abstract objects. <br>  2. Theories that describe a specific area of ‚Äã‚Äãreality based on the previous component. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When it comes to what the structure of scientific knowledge is and what it implies, one should never forget that the theoretical side is aimed at explaining objective reality, but at the same time it describes not existing realities, but something ideal. </p><p>  <strong>Philosophical level</strong> </p><p>  Those people who own philosophy, often have the property much faster than others, to comprehend any particular science.  And this is due to the fact that this is a rather specific ability, which allows you to learn scientific truths without any reliance on logic and scientific evidence.  This level belongs to the category that generates the most disputes and discussions.  Here the questions are aggravated about that thin line that cannot be drawn between the <span>empirical and theoretical</span> levels, about the substantiation of a particular <span>scientific theory.</span>  And it is precisely this level that makes it necessary to master the main types of scientific knowledge, without which it becomes even more difficult to determine what the structure of scientific knowledge directly represents. </p><p>  <strong>The main types in scientific knowledge</strong> </p><p>  Regardless of how long you have been in science, everyone should know these definitions.  Therefore, the following <span>types of knowledge</span> exist: </p><p>  1. Everyday knowledge - they are due to personal experience and are based on <span>common sense.</span>  <span>This is the</span> specific basis of domestic relations.  This structure of scientific knowledge is based solely on an empirical level. </p><p>  2. Practical knowledge - based on direct actions, mastery of certain things and the transformation of the world. </p><p>  3. Artistic - the basis of this knowledge is the image. </p><p>  4. Scientific knowledge - does not exist without foundation on concepts. </p><p>  5. Rational - involves the reflection of reality in a variety of logical concepts. </p><p>  6. Irrational - a direct reflection of reality that does not obey the laws of science and logic. </p><p>  7. Personal knowledge - depends on the basic abilities of a person and on his specific intellectual activity. </p><p>  The structure of scientific knowledge is a question that deserves attention and detailed consideration. </p>
