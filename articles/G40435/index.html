The time of development and prosperity of the Crimean land.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Tauride province was an administrative-territorial unit of the Russian Empire and lasted from 1802 to 1921.  The center was the city of Simferopol.  After joining Russia and the wise reforms of Catherine the Great, there was a significant upsurge in all areas of life.  Turkey, seeing the success and prosperity of Crimea, wanted to return the peninsula to its control, but was defeated.  As a result of these events, Russia further increased its influence in the Crimea, and also strengthened its power not only over the Black and Azov Seas, but also over the Bosphorus and Dardanelles. </p><h2>  Crimea goes to Russia </h2><p>  In 1784, on January 8, a state act was signed between the Turkish and Russian sides.  This was <span>an important historical event.</span>  This act stated that Crimea would be annexed to Russia.  However, this event was not news.  Crimean fate was predetermined during the Russo-Turkish war, which lasted from 1768 to 1774.  According to the peace treaty, Crimea gained independence.  Turkey no longer had influence in these territories.  Russia received Kerch and the possibility of movement along the Black and Azov Seas. </p><p>  By decree of Catherine II, Crimean Murza (Tatar aristocrats) acquired the status of the Russian nobility.  They preserved their territories, but did not receive the right to own serfs, which were Russian.  Thanks to this decree, most of the nobility went over to the side of Russia.  The imperial treasury replenished with incomes and lands of the Crimean Khan.  All Russian prisoners in the Crimea received freedom. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  The formation of the Tauride province </h2><p>  Tauride province was formed as a result of the separation of Novorossiysk, which happened in 1802.  Then one of the three detached parts became part of Tauris.  Tauride province was divided into 7 counties: </p><ul><li>  Evpatoria; </li><li>  Simferopolsky; </li><li>  Melitopol; </li><li>  Dneprovsky; </li><li>  Perekopsky; </li><li>  Tmutarakan; </li><li>  Theodosian. </li></ul><p>  In 1820, the Tmutarakansky district withdrew and became part of the Black Sea Army area.  In 1838, Yalta formed, and in 1843 - Berdyansk district.  By the beginning of the twentieth century in the Tauride province, there were 2 city administrations and 8 counties.  According to the 1987 census, the city of Simferopol was the third largest (141,717 people). </p>

    <h2>  Changes in Crimea </h2><p>  In 1784, the city of Sevastopol appeared, which is the base for the Russian fleet.  Formed Nikolaev and Kherson.  In the latter, the construction of the first ships for the Black Sea Fleet takes place.  In order to increase <span>the population of the</span> city ‚Äã‚Äãof Kherson, Sevastopol and Feodosia are declared open.  Foreigners are free to enter, work and live here.  At will, they could even become Russian subjects. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The following year, customs duty was abolished in all <span>Crimean ports</span> (for 5 years).  This entailed a significant increase in turnover.  The former poor Crimean territory has become a prosperous and developing land.  Agriculture and winemaking rose significantly here.  Crimea becomes the largest naval base of the Russian fleet.  As a result, the population of Tauris is growing significantly. </p>

    <h2>  Turkey requirements </h2><p>  In 1787, the Turkish side demands the restoration of the peninsula's vassality, and also wants to inspect the Russian ships going through the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus.  It is supported by Prussia, France and England.  Russia sends a refusal to these requirements.  In the same year, Turkey declares war and is defeated in an attack on Russian ships.  At the same time, the attacking side had a numerical superiority.  The Russian army takes Anapa, Izmail, Ochakov.  Suvorov troops finally smash the Turks.  The attacking country did not expect such a turn of events - it had to sign the Iasi Peace Treaty.  Thanks to this document, the Russian Empire secures its rights to the Crimea and the Northern Black Sea Coast.  She unconditionally owned the entire Tauride province.  The map shows the borders of the region.  Its territory captured the modern lands of Ukraine. </p>

    <h2>  Census of Tauride Province 1897 </h2><p>  In 1897, a census was conducted in all 10 counties of the province.  Crimea has always been a territory with a multinational composition of the population.  The census data indicate that most of the inhabitants spoke the Little Russian (Ukrainian) language.  The second most popular was the Great Russian language.  Further distribution of the Crimean Tatar, Bulgarian, German, Jewish, Greek, and also other languages ‚Äã‚Äãwas noted.  The total number of inhabitants of the province was almost 1.5 million.  In 6 counties, the Russian population prevailed: in Kerch, Simferopol, Sevastopol, Yevpatoria, Dzhankoy, Feodosia.  In Balaclava, slightly more than half of the population was Greek-speaking.  Also, many people of this nationality lived in the <span>Old Crimea.</span> </p><p>  The Tauride province lasted for more than a century, other states wanted to take over its territory, but the Russian Empire finally strengthened its influence on these lands. </p>
