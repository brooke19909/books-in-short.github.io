    <h2>  State nicknames </h2><p>  This part of America is called the "North Star State." </p><p>  The word Minnesota itself comes from the dialect <span>of the</span> Sioux <span>Indian tribes</span> and translates as "Cloudy Water", where the word water is the root of "mini".  At the same time, there are dozens of names of rivers, waterfalls and cities with this prefix on the territory of the okrug.  This is not surprising, because in general, on an area of ​​225,181 km², 8.4% of the surface is water bodies.  That is why the state of Minnesota has a middle name, which sounds like "The State of Ten Thousand Lakes." </p><p>  This phrase can be seen on almost every Minnesota license plate.  Although in fact, there are about twelve thousand lakes in the state (nobody realizes to calculate their actual number).  The largest of them is the Upper, which is part of the <span>Great Lakes</span> system <span>.</span>  Also on its land originate more than six thousand rivers and streams.  One of the largest rivers in the world, the Mississippi, begins its turn there. </p><p>  One of the funniest nicknames is "gopher state."  At one time, this striped rodent caused devastating losses to the fields and was a real disaster for farmers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Minnesota also has names such as “bread and butter”, “sandwich county”, and “breadbasket”.  This is due to the high development of agriculture. </p><h2>  Interesting laws </h2><p>  The whole world is surprised at materials about strange US laws.  This state was no exception.  For example, a myth about the rule runs around the world’s network, according to which it is not allowed to cross the border with a duck on his head.  But in reality, such a topic is absent in the legislation.  Also, you cannot sleep naked, and all bathtubs should be standing on their feet.  Even on the main street of Minneapolis, authorities prohibit driving a red car.  If the last rule is really present, then no one observes this anyway. </p>

    <p>  But most of these points were legalized in connection with certain circumstances or events that Minnesota survived.  Cities of the state (Cottage Grove, for example) have their own rules.  They decided that lawns near houses that have a double number can only be watered on even days.  This item was adopted in order to save water consumption.  But the idea did not justify itself, because the authors did not consider the option that on the permitted day, lawn owners will flood their yards overtime.  Therefore, I had to look for another way to save. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Another violation is to tease gophers.  There are a lot of them on this earth, but, despite their sweet and affectionate appearance, annoyed animals can be very dangerous. </p><h2>  Land characteristic </h2><p>  Each area is governed by its own center.  Two significant cities has Minnesota.  The state capital is St. Paul.  Minneapolis is adjacent to it.  This city is the first in the state in terms of size and population.  Saint Paul and Minneapolis are separated by a river.  They are popularly called twin cities. </p>

    <p>  A significant part of the inhabitants are Germans.  There are about 40% of them in the state.  15% are Norwegians.  In third place by nationality - the Irish.  Their coefficient is about 10%. </p><p>  The religious composition of approximately equal parts are Protestants, Catholics and Evangelists. </p><h2>  Minnesota Weather </h2><p>  Minnesota has a temperate continental climate.  This is due to cold winters and humid summers.  Temperature indicators range from +40 to -40 degrees Celsius.  At the edge of the state is a “nation’s refrigerator."  This is the city whose name is International Falls.  It is considered the coldest place in the United States.  The record low temperature that was recorded there was minus 49 degrees. </p>

On its open spaces in the summer months, violent tornadoes sweep (more than twenty a year).  Perhaps this is precisely what the law on legally binding baths is associated with.  After all, it is best to hide in rooms without windows, therefore, in the toilet room, and cover yourself with a heavy object, that is, a bathroom that can be removed.

    <h2>  Homeland of the White Eagle </h2><p>  The state is the largest <span>iron ore</span> mine in the country.  Nevertheless, the economy there is based on industry, woodworking enterprises and tourism.  The most environmentally friendly part of the state is Minnesota.  The United States contributes to the development of reserves, parks and the conservation of wildlife in this area.  In 1971, an area of ​​88,000 km² was allocated to the Voyagers National Park.  Since the 80s, a bald eagle population has been restored on its territory, which until then was considered on the verge of extinction.  It is this bird depicted on the coat of arms of America. </p><p>  The pearl of the state is Minnehah Falls.  Its height is 16 meters.  It is most beautiful when it completely freezes and becomes an ice wall. </p><h2>  Gifted staff </h2><p>  Many residents of the state are known beyond its borders.  These are film workers such as director and screenwriter Mark Stephen Johnson (known as the creator of the film Ghost Rider), screenwriter and producer Edward Kitsis (worked on the TV series Lost) and animator Pete Docter (his work is Monsters Corporation) and "Up"). </p>
