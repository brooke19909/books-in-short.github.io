Transport leaves the bus station Kotelniki located at the metro station of the same name.  It‚Äôs easy to find a cash desk there.  From the exit from the subway you have to go straight about a hundred meters.  After going through a small market, shops and cafes, as well as a bus stop, you will find bus routes and a ticket office.  A ticket there can be purchased for 420 rubles.  If you have dimensional baggage with you, purchase a ticket in advance for it as well.  It costs inexpensively, within a hundred rubles per person.  Travel time: 3-3.5 hours. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Buy an express ticket that runs 3 times a day (on Fridays two more additional evening tickets are allowed).  They all leave from the Kazan station (metro Komsomolskaya), and come to Ryazan-1 station.  The cost varies from 530 rubles to 730 (economy and business class, respectively).  It ride a little less than three hours.  A comfortable and fast train with comfortable chairs and a table.  There are toilets in even wagons. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelchoice.org.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Train with people" class="if uuid-2657575" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98503/2657575.jpg"></div><p>  For 422 rubles you can get from the Kazan station to Ryazan also by train.  It goes from 3.5 to 4 hours and stops for 1-2 minutes at each station.  You will sit on not very comfortable benches, there is no air conditioning, as in the express train.  The toilet is located only in the first and last cars.  The entire distance is divided into certain zones where controllers enter and check if you have a ticket.  So do not try to get on the train without a ticket, otherwise you will be forced to pay a fine several times more. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="54.68582239012513" data-lng="39.75653101249998" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="7"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/6/2/0/5/6205.png"></div><p>  <span>Ryazan can be reached from the Kazan station by any passing train.</span>  <span>There are a lot of them, and tickets can cost even less than by train, bus and express.</span>  <span>From about 380 rubles.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.kartinki24.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kazan Station" class="if uuid-2657576" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98503/2657576.jpg"></div><p>  Do not forget that there are benefits for schoolchildren (according to the certificate from the school), students, senior citizens and disabled people.  You can buy a ticket at a specific time 50% less than the usual cost. </p><h2>  Rating </h2><p>  But did you know that the direction Ryazan - Moscow is one of the ten in terms of popularity of covered distances?  Traffic jams are almost constantly on the Ryazan highway, it is almost impossible to buy a ticket to the express train to Ryazan unless you take care of this in advance.  Buses run from the Kotelniki bus station every thirty minutes, but they are all filled with passengers, and often there are simply no empty seats.  This is mainly due to the fact that Muscovites purchase cottages in Ryazan.  Moreover, it is believed that in this city to buy food, clothing and other things is much cheaper than in the capital. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.themarkeworld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Road trip" class="if uuid-2657574" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98503/2657574.jpg"></div><p>  How many kilometers from Ryazan to Moscow we found out by adding the distance from one settlement to another along the road to the capital.
