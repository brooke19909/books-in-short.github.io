    <p>  Buying a good humidifier is not an easy task.  There are many nuances here that the simple consumer is not even aware of.  First of all, these are the technical characteristics of the devices.  They are selected in accordance with the features of the premises where it is planned to use an Air-O-Swiss air humidifier.  The reviews of people who already use the devices allow us to draw certain conclusions.  Based on their arguments, the most suitable in all respects are ultrasonic models.  Further we will examine in more detail the products of a Swiss company that has earned an impeccable reputation, using the modern device brand AOS U650 as an example.  However, first we look at the general characteristics of the humidifiers of this manufacturer. </p><h2>  Varieties of Boneco &amp; Air-O-Swiss Products </h2><p>  The first thing you want to pay attention to is a wide range of product lines.  Here you can find devices that will satisfy any requirements.  As a rule, they differ not only in external design, but also in functionality, as well as the principle of operation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Although the humidifier <span>Boneco Air-O-Swiss</span> belongs to high <span>-end</span> products and deserves a lot of money, the company nevertheless made sure that traditional devices were also presented in this model range.  Their work is mainly based on the production of cold or hot steam.  But for ultrasonic devices represented by multi-purpose complexes, the principle of operation is somewhat more complicated.  Here, unlike traditional models, the fluid is processed by ultrasonic vibrations. </p>

    <p>  The performance of these devices also deserves special attention.  Due to the high level of functionality, the Air-O-Swiss humidifier (customer reviews confirm this) has become a real legislator in this area.  Its distinctive feature is ease of use.  As a rule, almost all models are able to maintain optimal humidity in the room during the day (50-60%). </p><h2>  TM Air-O-Swiss: a brief overview of the lineup </h2><p>  A Swiss company specializing in the manufacture of humidifiers has introduced three main types of devices to the market: </p><p>  - traditional; </p><p>  - ultrasound; </p><p>  - steam. </p><p>  The simplest and most inexpensive models have a simple design, which is based on the principle of cold evaporation.  The most common are AOS E2441, AOS E2241, AOS E2251.  Their design consists of a fan and a filter that humidifies the air.  The indisputable advantage of such models is silent operation.  They are ideal for installation in rooms such as the bedroom and the nursery. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The modern ultrasonic humidifier Air-O-Swiss stands out against the general background of the models, as it has many advantages.  Like the first option, it does not emit extraneous sounds at all during operation.  This effect is achieved by minimizing the amount of steam.  It is worth paying attention to the high power of such devices and ease of operation.  They are completely safe for children.  The humidifier itself has a fairly compact size and is equipped with sensors that automatically control the humidity level in the room. </p>

    <p>  Steam devices are slightly different from the above.  First of all, the fact that the principle of their work is to heat the water.  Such humidifiers can be used in rooms with a large area, for example, in greenhouses, museums, libraries.  Due to its high performance, it is easy to maintain a moisture level in the range of 60-70%.  However, these devices have pronounced disadvantages.  This is the noise they emit during operation, the lack of humidity control and the consumption of large amounts of electricity. </p><h2>  Highlights When Choosing Humidifiers </h2><p>  A person who does not have detailed information about humidifiers needs to know the main points that will come in handy when purchasing devices of this type.  Recommendations are selected based on customer reviews. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The first thing that is most important when buying a device is the technical parameters.  What exactly is included here: </p><ul><li>  tank volume - its capacity is directly proportional to the duration of continuous operation of the device; </li><li>  functionality, for example, the absence or presence of automatic control of the humidity level or the option of self-switching off when the water is completely evaporated; </li><li>  performance - selected depending on the size of the premises; </li><li>  noise level is a very important parameter, especially if a humidifier is needed for rooms intended for relaxation. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Distinctive features </h2><p>  The main advantage of the humidifier is the ‚ÄúWarm Steam‚Äù mode.  Thanks to this option, the liquid heats up to 80 degrees inside the device before entering the ultrasonic membrane.  This mode cleans the generated steam and significantly increases productivity.  The membrane is made using Titaniumnitrite technology.  It eliminates the appearance of rust and provides a high level of protection against chemical and physical damage. </p><p>  <span>The Air-O-Swiss Humidifier</span> (Model U650) is perfect for rooms with wooden furniture and antiques.  As you know, with insufficient moisture the basis of such products begins to crack and the aesthetics of the appearance is lost.  The specified humidification parameters will make it possible to avoid undesirable consequences for wood and damage to other household items. </p><p>  As for the plants in the room, for their healthy growth it is necessary to observe not only the desired level of lighting, but also a certain humidity.  Thus, the AOS U650 is also great for flower greenhouses.  The device supports a high level of humidification in rooms up to 150 cubic meters.  meters.  Installation of the device can be carried out on any horizontal surfaces. </p><h2>  Water disinfection </h2><p>  A new sample of the AG + cartridge incorporates silver particles.  They are designed to disinfect water and purify the air (steam) from dangerous microbes and bacteria.  Thanks to this configuration, the Air-O-Swiss U650 humidifier completely eliminates the subsidence of salts present in tap water on home furniture and appliances. </p><h2>  Control </h2><p>  Problems with setting the right parameters and choosing the right mode will not arise due to the practical and modern control unit, which has a touch type.  Any change in settings is accompanied by an unobtrusive sound.  You can select automatic or night mode.  When choosing the latter, optimal hydration will be maintained throughout the night and spontaneous shutdown will occur in the morning.  The water level in the tank is reflected on the display and makes it possible to constantly monitor and quickly add fluid. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="air humidifier air o swiss reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1066779.jpg" width="359"></div>
