    <p>  And in the middle of the playing field there is a slot machine called Jackpot and Bank of the Charity Fund.  The purpose of these cells will be considered later.  Cards with the corresponding names are placed on the cells "Chance" and "Movement", which are located through one, two or three cells along the perimeter of the playing field.  Place them with a ‚Äúshirt‚Äù up so that the player does not see the upcoming task in advance. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Beginning of the game </h2><p>  During the draw, the player who makes the first move is selected.  In the board game "Millionaire" begins counting cells clockwise from the word "Start".  Before starting any game, you need to appoint a banker of the players.  He must give out the initial capital - 2,000 Fanta with banknotes of different denominations.  When a player rolls dice, points are counted, the chip moves to the appropriate number of cells.  If you are "lucky" and a double has fallen, you will have to roll the dice again.  But if the double falls in a row three times, then the player is forced to go to the box with the inscription "Tax Police".  Such a move is fraught with the payment of penalties. </p>

    <p>  According to the rules of the "Millionaire" Classic board game, if the chip gets on the cell of the enterprise, then the player takes a site card on which it is written in detail how much taxes need to be paid for the enterprise itself or the rental rate for it.  If this company does not yet have an owner, then the player can buy it, deposit the required cost for it to the Bank.  The site card remains with the player in the pack. </p><p>  If the player is not interested in buying this site, he puts it up for sale, independently determining its value.  The plot goes to the player who offers a large amount at the auction. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If on your site as a result of a dice throw you find another player‚Äôs chip, then for staying in another company you will have to pay as many forfeits as indicated on the card.  There are situations when a chip falls on a cell belonging to a monopolist, that is, a player who has bought all the enterprises in a given industry, then the rate doubles, rent is already paid at a double rate. </p><p>  There are also pleasant moments.  When a player completes a full circle on the playing field, then according to the rules of playing the board game "Millionaire", he receives a bonus of circular income of 200 forfeits. </p><h2>  Surprise cells </h2><p>  In the process of throwing the dice, the players' chips can also get on the cells with the shirts turned upside down.  These are "Chance" and "Movement".  Let us consider in more detail what should be done in such cases: </p><ul><li>  Turning the card over on the cage, the player reads the task and must complete it.  If at this moment he is not able to fulfill the set, then this can be done later. </li><li>  When hit on the "Move", as the name of the card, the player will need to move the chip to the distance indicated on it.  If the chip suddenly falls on the "Start", then the player loses the circular income, that is, 200 forfeits.  If, during the transfer, the chip falls on the White Business or Charity Fund cell, the player receives a cash prize from the funds of the Bank or the Fund.  But there is also a box with the inscription "Black Business".  Having got to it as a result of moving the chips, the player automatically moves to the square of the "Charity Fund", where it is already necessary to contribute 50 funds to charity. </li><li>  Jackpot.  A slot machine is located in the center of the playing field, so if a player hits it, the player can play.  In the board game "Millionaire" according to the rules of the game, you first need to make a bet.  Then only one die is thrown, the throwing is done three times.  After each throw, the player must rearrange the column up by the appropriate number of squares.  If the pictures coincided with the winning combination, the winner receives a bonus prize.  But if the player is not lucky, the combination did not match, then the bet remains at the Bank's cash desk. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Corner cells </h2><p>  On the corner squares of the playing field there is a "Tax Police" and "Tax Inspectorate."  If the chip falls into the inspection after the move, then the tax is simply paid.  If the chip found itself on the police cell, then you need to roll the dice 3 times (until the double falls out) to leave the territory of the site.  If the double never fell, then you have to fork out and pay a fine. </p><h2>  Board game "Monopoly: Millionaire" </h2><p>  This is a new economic game, beautifully and stylishly designed.  Children can play it from the age of 8.  Players can be from 2 to 4 people.  The main goal of the game is to become a millionaire, that is, to earn a million.  The first to conquer this peak is the winner.  Each player has three chips in his hands. </p><p>  The game begins with the cell "Forward", on which they put one chip.  The rest are still standing on the side of the table.  Bankers are not used in the game.  On the playing field there is a cell where all the money of the players is stored.  First, the game is distributed to each of 372 thousand notes.  Buying here is no longer necessary for enterprises or houses, but for elite property - this is an island, a city of attractions, a castle, etc. They choose a realtor who issues cards with real estate. </p>

    <p>  If the chip makes a full circle on the playing field, then the player changes it to a larger one.  This indicates the next level of security - "Living in luxury."  And the higher the level, the greater the player‚Äôs income.  But for such a transition will have to pay 50 bills. </p><p>  In this game, there are already familiar ‚ÄúChance‚Äù cards to the players, but there are also new ones, for example, ‚ÄúLife of a Millionaire‚Äù and ‚ÄúFortune‚Äù.  You can find very interesting offers in them: receiving a wedding present from other players or money from the sale of a sports car, etc. </p><p>  There is still a new cell "Prison".  If you just hit the chip with it, you can‚Äôt do anything until the next move.  The player who is ‚Äúlucky" to throw in a dice three times in a row doubles there.  You will have to either sit in the dungeons for three moves, or give the appropriate card. </p><p>  The rest of the game rules are similar to the classic "Millionaire".  You can also buy, rent, sell your property.  Only instead of industries are there monochrome objects. </p><h2>  Business game </h2><p>  Millionaire is a board game that already has many options.  Now consider another one issued by a Russian company.  Designed game for children from 7 years.  She teaches them business in a fun way.  The goal is the same, as in all other options - to get rich by buying real estate, selling services and goods.  Represented 17 types of activities and industries. </p>
