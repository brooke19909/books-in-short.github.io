The reason for this is the remoteness of this Russian nature reserve from many central cities of the country, the long and sometimes difficult road, and the incomplete awareness of all the unique sights and features of this region.  Meanwhile, here you can find service of the highest level, and food is no worse than in elite restaurants.  All who are planning to come here are invited by the hospitable, comfortable, convenient in all respects recreation center "Chara".  Baikal splashes a few minutes walk from its gates, the buildings are surrounded by pretty fir trees, the base employees put their whole soul into their work.  That is why anyone who ever arrives at Charu will definitely want to come back here. </p>

    <p>  The fireplace hall is very popular among vacationers, especially on cool days.  This room for up to 30 people has an unusually cozy design that contributes to pleasant relaxation, intimate conversations.  Hot drinks are served here - coffee, tea, as well as alcohol.  For children, there is a large selection of soft drinks, and for all there are a lot of types of local pastries. </p><p>  There is a bar on the outdoor Chary terrace, which offers fantastic views of the surroundings.  This place is ideal for organizing receptions. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  The recreation center "Chara" has many advantages.  Lake Baikal, which is only a 4-6 minute walk away, is one of them.  Legends make up the crystal clearness of its waters.  Its mineralization is so small that it is actively used as distilled.  However, this water is not just cold, but icy.  Even at the peak of the season, its temperature does not rise above +9 degrees.  But ‚ÄúChary‚Äù tourists will have a surprise: even babies can swim in the bay, where the base is located, since here the water temperature is warmer in summer than on the South Aegean Sea and is +25 ... +26 degrees.  The reason for this is the huge island of Olkhon, which obscures this water area from icy waters.  A summer beach holiday at the base is one of the main ones.  In winter, he is replaced by ice skating.  The second most popular place is fishing.  Such a fish as on Lake Baikal is nowhere else, so many lovers of this activity come here for fishing.  Vacationers at the base can cook their catch at the stake in specially designated and equipped areas. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="recreation center Chara Lake Baikal" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/955881.jpg" width="531"></div>
