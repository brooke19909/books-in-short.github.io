It is a favorite vacation spot for tourists from all over the world.  There are not four, but two seasons - the hot season and the rainy season.  The best months to relax are November, December, January and February.  At this time, the air temperature on the island ranges from +22 to +35 degrees Celsius.  The most equipped is the west coast.  There are many comfortable hotel complexes, hotels, guesthouses, villas, which have their own white beaches washed by the crystal clear waters of the <span>Andaman Sea.</span>  Many of them are included in the ranking of the best <span>hotels in Phuket.</span>  Well-developed tourist infrastructure.  The east coast is more suitable for a secluded holiday.  There are also fairly well-equipped hotels, but there is little entertainment. </p><p>  The island is conditionally divided into several zones: Bang Tao, or Laguna Beach (the most luxurious and expensive resort on the island), Patong (a youth recreation area rich in entertainment), Kata Beach (a resort designed for a secluded holiday), Karon Beach ( the most environmentally friendly and beautiful beach on the coast of Phuket). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel rating phuket" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/315845.jpg" width="600"></div>
