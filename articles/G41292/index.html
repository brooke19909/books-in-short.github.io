It is becoming more popular every day, so many users need to learn how to create and configure their own networks.  Of course, a professional in this matter will cope with a similar task in a few minutes, but what can ordinary people do?  First you need to deal with a concept such as <span>IP-telephony.</span>  <span>What it is</span> and how it works is described later in the article.  The main issue under consideration is the problem of creating a do-it-yourself connection with a minimum expenditure of funds or completely free of charge. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself IP telephony" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1668372.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What is IP telephony? </h2><p>  This type of communication arose in 1999, and is accordingly considered one of the youngest.  It was then that <span>the SIP protocol</span> was approved <span>,</span> which laid the foundation for the development of the described type of telephony.  Its ancestor and predecessor can be considered the connection H.323.  However, it is now used as rarely as possible.  This protocol differs from the modern one in that it does not save traffic, is itself quite complex and does not support human mobility. </p><h2>  SIP Protocol </h2><p>  An IP telephony network, namely the SIP protocol, is considered simpler and more flexible.  Due to it, you can significantly save traffic, and most modern devices and applications are able to work on it.  Each person using this protocol receives his (unique) ID.  Telephony allows users to freely move around the planet without changing this number. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The protocol enables a person to make calls, communicate via video, transfer various files, messages, and also play online games.  In order to perform some of these actions, the protocol accesses the <span>Internet,</span> but for the rest, a special IP-telephony gateway is used (moreover, it is not one). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="IP telephony what it is and how it works" class="if" height="215" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1668373.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Work principles </h2><p>  In order to use this type of communication, an ordinary person does not need to study its working principles.  Moreover, he does not need to try to delve into how exactly this or that protocol functions.  As a rule, users are interested in questions about the cost of such services, the availability of additional options, and so on.  However, for those who reveal a desire to create such a connection as IP-telephony with their own hands, that this and how it works are quite relevant issues. </p><p>  Consider the principles of network operation via the VoIP protocol.  For an explanation we will take two phones connected precisely with it.  While the gadget is in standby mode, it is connected to the Internet and connected to another through the operator‚Äôs server.  Immediately after the subscriber calls the internal number of the interlocutor, the protocol will establish his location and send a special signal.  Communication over the network occurs immediately after the subscriber receives the call. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Accordingly, we can conclude that this action (like everyone else) occurs via the Internet, without the help of a mobile operator.  That is, subscribers only pay for traffic.  Often it is free. </p><p>  VoIP-telephony allows you to call a subscriber who is with the interlocutor on the same network.  In this case, SIP-ID is used, that is, unique numbers of each.  It is possible to call a subscriber from another network.  Then a special identifier called a URI is used.  It looks like an email.  You can also call from VoIP numbers to mobile and landline phones, and vice versa.  Such calls are made thanks to special gateways.  This allows you to make calls over the Internet, saving on the services of a mobile operator. </p><p>  The program for IP-telephony makes it possible to safely travel around the world.  It will allow you to call anywhere in the world where there is an Internet connection <span>.</span>  Billing will not change. </p><p>  It should be noted that calls that take place within the same network are free.  At the same time, the location of the interlocutors does not play any role.  The same is true with direct numbers.  One subscriber can be in Kiev, the other - in Seoul.  Billing will be the same, and the quality of communication at the highest level.  This property is called mobility. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="IP telephony systems" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1668374.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is worth noting that this nuance is quite relevant.  VoIP telephony has spread worldwide.  Due to what?  It not only saves money, but also provides excellent communication quality and so on.  This protocol also provides free calls to a subscriber who is registered with the same provider. </p><p>  Everyone knows how ordinary conventional telephony works.  The farther the interlocutor is located, the more expensive the minute of communication will cost.  IP-telephony allows you to talk for free with a person who is on the other side of the planet.  No need to pay for voice data transfer and connection.  Additional charging is not carried out.  Due to this, the cost of a call to a subscriber who is on another network and registered with the ‚Äúleft‚Äù provider will be much lower than that of a regular mobile operator. </p><p>  For calls within the network, payment is not made.  In the predominant part of incoming calls, they also do not have to give money.  Landline and mobile numbers are charged at about 40 kopecks per minute.  This is quite a bit. </p><p>  You will have to pay for using direct numbers.  It is impossible to say the exact cost, but it is small and is monthly. </p><h2>  How to configure DIY IP telephony: general information </h2><p>  Everyone who has a landline telephone at home knows how to make a traditional call.  It is necessary to write an application to the company of the desired provider, wait for its consideration.  After that, you will have to wait when a special line is stretched or <span>equipment is installed</span> to operate the device. </p><p>  Connecting IP-telephony is much easier, it can be done independently without the help of the provider and professionals.  What is needed for this? </p><p>  For a stable and good network operation, the Internet is required.  Its speed should not be lower than 100 Kbps.  You will need a computer or phone that works with VoIP.  It is from them that the call will be made.  It is also necessary to create an account with the provider.  All this does not require any costs.  The only expenses will be to purchase the already described type of device, if it is not.  Next, we consider in more detail the process of connecting this type of telephony. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="connect ip telephony" class="if" height="432" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1668375.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The first stage is the choice of provider </h2><p>  Setting up IP-telephony begins with the choice of provider.  You need to look at the reviews on each of the available.  The provider should provide the lowest possible price for calls and good quality communications.  If you wish, you can pay attention to the ability to contact additional numbers, hold calls, and so on.  The second line support function will also be useful.  The basic subscription options that are offered by providers for free, as a rule, have a low level of charging. </p><p>  Most consumers recommend using Comtube services.  What is needed to connect?  You should register on the site, inventing a unique username and password, replenish the internal account.  This completes the connection.  What does the user get after carrying out these actions?  He gains an active account, which makes it possible to make intranet calls.  The user receives the caller ID.  He is also allowed to receive incoming calls. </p><h2>  Paid services </h2><p>  To call, you need to replenish the internal account.  After this operation, IP-telephony systems will give access to calls both within the Russian Federation and abroad. </p><p>  If desired, you can purchase a direct number.  It is assigned to a specific city.  There are about a thousand of them.  Why is this necessary?  While in Russia, you can answer calls that go to an American number.  This allows you not to spend a lot of money and save traffic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="telephony ip server" class="if" height="452" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1668376.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The second step is the need for a phone </h2><p>  We continue to create such a connection as IP-telephony, with our own hands.  In order to receive calls and make them, you need a special technique.  This can be done both through computers and through special VoIP-phones.  Below we consider the nuances of using both options. </p><h2>  Computer programs </h2><p>  When using the first option, it makes sense to install the software.  It simulates a stationary device.  The IP telephony server easily connects to the device after completing the settings.  This allows you to make calls and receive them.  But when using a computer, you must have a headset. </p><p>  The downside of such a phone is that the program should always work in the background, and the PC should always be in the active state.  That is why a SIP phone is considered as convenient as possible.  Next, let's talk about him. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="IP telephony gateway" class="if" height="418" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1668377.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Work with a SIP phone </h2><p>  A SIP phone costs at least 2 thousand rubles.  For such a small price you can buy a standard device that supports the protocol.  Even budget phones have the functions of noise reduction, call hold, able to function with speakerphone and conferences.  But there is no caller ID. </p><p>  More expensive options provide the most convenient use of telephony.  As a rule, such devices are universal.  What does this mean?  The fact that they are able to work with IP-telephony and with urban networks.  Often, such devices support the function of determining the number, using multiple communication accounts.  They allow you to work with additional wireless handsets, have an impressive sized phone book and a color display. </p><h2>  The third step is setting up a VoIP phone </h2><p>  DIY IP telephony is pretty easy to create.  One of the steps is to set up a stationary device.  This is what allows you to receive and make calls to subscribers.  Moreover, you will have to configure both computer programs and landline phones.  An explanation of the steps for changing the parameters is carried out using the example of the Comtube provider.  In order to enter the necessary menu, one should find the category ‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù in the section ‚ÄúMy profile‚Äù.  We are interested in ‚ÄúBasic IP Telephony Settings‚Äù. </p><p>  There you need to register the account login and password, server address and special port numbers.  You should also enter your personal account there.  If there are any problems, then you can contact the service center.  It will help to cope with problems.  However, often setting up programs and phones occurs without glitches and errors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="setting up ip telephony" class="if" height="210" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1668378.jpg" width="600"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <h2>  The fourth step is to use multiple phones </h2><p>  Some families need several devices for comfortable work with telephony.  It should be noted that in order for the two urban devices to function, you will have to create separate lines and conclude a couple of contracts.  This requires a lot of money, time and nerves, since in the Russian Federation providers have been considering connection requests for quite some time. </p><p>  Digital telephony makes it easy to use multiple devices.  When registering an account, many lines are created immediately.  They provide the ability to simultaneously receive and call from everyone.  However, this is available not in the "Basic" tariff, but in the "Premium".  Subscribing to it costs a little more, but for busy and serious people who constantly talk on the phone, it will be suitable.  This tariff supports the creation of up to 100 lines at a time.  Most often, these services are used by offices. </p><p>  In order not to purchase several separate phones in the apartment, you can buy a device that supports working with additional wireless handsets.  Each of them is allowed to determine on "their" line.  More expensive models are able to work with multiple accounts and optimally distribute them automatically between the handsets. </p>
