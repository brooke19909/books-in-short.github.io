  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Damaging factors of a nuclear explosion and action</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Nuclear weapons are one of the most dangerous species on Earth.  The use of this tool can solve different problems.  In addition, objects that must be attacked can have a different location.  In this regard, a nuclear explosion can be carried out in air, underground or water, above ground or water.  This <span>type of weapon</span> is capable of destroying all objects that are not protected, as well as people.  In this regard, the following striking factors of a nuclear explosion are distinguished. </p><p>  1. The <span>shock wave.</span>  This factor accounts for about 50 percent of all the energy released during the explosion.  The shock wave from a nuclear weapon explosion is similar to the action when a conventional bomb explodes.  Its difference is a more destructive force and a longer duration of action.  If we consider all the damaging factors of a nuclear explosion, then this is considered the main one. </p><p>  The shock wave of this weapon is capable of hitting objects that are far from the epicenter.  It is a process of strong <span>air compression.</span>  The speed of its propagation depends on the pressure created.  The farther from the place of the explosion, the weaker the impact of the wave.  The danger of a blast wave lies in the fact that it moves objects in the air that can lead to death.  Lesions by this factor are divided into light, severe, extremely severe and moderate. </p><p>  You can hide from the effects of the shock wave in a special shelter. </p><p>  2. Light emission.  This factor accounts for about 35% of all the energy released during the explosion.  This is a stream of radiant energy that includes infrared, visible and <span>ultraviolet radiation.</span>  Red-hot air and red-hot explosion products act as sources of light radiation. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The temperature of light radiation can reach 10,000 degrees Celsius.  The level of the damaging effect is determined by the light pulse.  This is the ratio of the total amount of energy to the area that it illuminates.  The energy of light radiation goes into heat.  The surface heats up.  It can be quite strong and lead to carbonization of materials or fires. </p><p>  As a result of light radiation, people get numerous burns. </p><p>  3. Penetrating radiation.  The damaging factors of a <span>nuclear explosion</span> include this component.  It accounts for about 10 percent of all energy.  This is a stream of neutrons and gamma rays that come from the epicenter of the use of weapons.  Their distribution occurs in all directions.  The farther the distance from the explosion point, the lower the concentration of these flows in the air.  If the weapon was used underground or under water, then the degree of their impact is much lower.  This is due to the fact that part of the neutron flux and gamma quanta are absorbed by water and earth. </p><p>  Penetrating radiation covers a smaller area than a shock wave or radiation.  But there are types of weapons in which the effect of penetrating radiation is much higher than other factors. </p><p>  Neutrons and gamma rays penetrate tissues, blocking the work of cells.  This leads to changes in the functioning of the body, its organs and systems.  Cells die and decompose.  In humans, this is called radiation sickness.  In order to assess the degree of exposure to radiation on the body, determine the dose of radiation. </p><p>  4. Radioactive contamination.  After the explosion, some of the substance does not undergo division.  As a result of its decay, alpha particles are formed.  Many of them are active for no more than an hour.  The area in the epicenter of the explosion is exposed to the greatest degree of <span>radioactive contamination</span> . </p><p>  5. <span>Electromagnetic impulse.</span>  It is also part of the system that the damaging factors of nuclear weapons form.  It is associated with the occurrence of strong electromagnetic fields. </p><p>  These are all the main damaging factors of a nuclear explosion.  Its effect has a significant impact on the entire territory and people who fall into this zone. </p><p>  Nuclear weapons and their damaging factors are being studied by humanity.  Its use is controlled by the world community in order to prevent global catastrophes. </p>
