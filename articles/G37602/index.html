    <p>  The village of Kamenka (Leningrad region) is located in the Vyborg district.  The population is approximately 5.5 thousand people. </p><p>  By the way, not everyone knows that literally until 1948 this settlement was called Kaukj√§rvi.  That was the name of the lake, located near the village.  Currently, this pond is called Beauty. </p><p>  By the way, historians have found confirmation that people lived in these places in very distant times from us - III thousand years ago. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get to your destination? </h2>

    <p>  You can get to the village of Kamenka (Leningrad Oblast) using the bus from St. Petersburg (route number 837).  Travel time is almost 1.5 hours.  Departure - from the bus station (metro station ‚ÄúParnas‚Äù). </p><p>  It will not be superfluous to remember that several flights were organized during the day: the first at 8.25, and the last at 16.30.  For more information, you should contact the village of Kamenka itself (Vyborg district of the Leningrad region), for example, by calling back to the local bus station.  Why?  The fact is that the number of flights, as well as the time of their departure, can vary depending on the season. </p><h2>  The history of the village of Kamenka (Leningrad region) <strong> </strong></h2>

    <p><strong></strong>  Before the military 1939-40.  the village, which was located in the place where modern Kamenka is today, was part of Finland. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In fact, Kaukj√§rvi consisted of several small villages.  After the railway was built (19th century), by which it was possible to get to this object, the rapid construction of summer cottages began in it, and the Bobochino holiday village was formed. </p><p>  Many famous Petersburgers (A.V. Suvorin, A. Keybel, etc.) spent their holidays in these places. </p><p>  A little later, part of the territory of Kaukj√§rvi was used to build an artillery camp, which functioned mainly in the summer. </p><p>  At the end of 1939, there were more than 200 houses in this village.  During the retreat of the Finnish troops, the village was destroyed by fire by order of the Finnish command.  In 1941, Kaukj√§rvi was again occupied <span>by</span> Finnish <span>military units</span> , after which the people who returned from the evacuation restored their homes within 3 years.  However, they had to leave them in 1944. </p><p>  After the end of hostilities, the Lensnabugol farm was located in these places.  Later it was renamed Brooks, then Vladimirovo, and in 1948 it became known as Kamenka.  Starting from this time, an artillery range was created in the area adjacent to Kamenka. </p><h2>  How does the village live today? </h2>

    <p>  Kamenka has many modern monuments.  The Leningrad Region, it should be noted, in general, is famous for its careful attitude to history. </p><p>  The memorial in this village is a reminder to all people of the heroes who honorably fulfilled their duty and sacrificed their lives. </p><p>  One of them is Sergey Petrovich Kurnosenko, who was the chief of staff of the 133rd separate tank battalion of the 45th guards motorized infantry division.  During the attack, when a gunner was wounded in the crew of the tank, S.P.  Kurnosenko took his place and continued the battle.  He managed to destroy 3 armored objects.  In battle, the hero was wounded.  The wounds were incompatible with life. </p><p>  Hero of Russia Alexander Viktorovich Semerenko, major, chief of staff of the 129th motorized rifle regiment, is buried in Kamenka.  During the storming of Grozny, the regiment was ambushed and heroically repulsed enemy attacks.  There were big losses when he managed to get out of the ambush.  A.V.  Semerenko died on January 1, when the world celebrated the new 1995 year. </p><p>  One of the granite slabs of the Memorial was erected in honor of Major General Mikhail Yurievich Malofeev, deputy commander of the North Group of Forces, which took part in restoring constitutional order in the Chechen Republic.  M.A.  Malofeev died in Grozny on January 17, 2000. </p>
