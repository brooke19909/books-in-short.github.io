With the help of a passbook, citizens can store funds or exchange finances between people and organizations.  A savings book is a stable and reliable way to manage money.  How to open a savings book in Sberbank and what methods exist, this article will tell. </p><h2>  What is a passbook </h2><p>  A savings book is a special <span>financial document,</span> which is a form of strict reporting.  A savings book is used to record transactions on a client‚Äôs account.  Each client who conducted the opening of a <span>savings account with Sberbank</span> was issued a similar document.  Now savings books have not lost their relevance, so they are issued as a supplement to open accounts.  As a rule, such documents are used by citizens who receive compensation and other payments, as well as by pensioners. </p><h2>  How to issue? </h2><p>  Many customers are interested in whether it is possible to open a savings book in Sberbank, as the banking organization announced their gradual cancellation.  The bank states that the existence of passbooks was justified when there were no remote communication channels with the bank.  However, there is no reliable information on this issue, therefore, savings books continue to be in demand among the population.  Therefore, if we talk about whether it is now possible to open a savings book in Sberbank, then customers should not doubt the legality and legality of this action.  Savings books have proven themselves exclusively on the positive side, so they will always be in demand from the public. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.collegemouse.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Conclusion of an agreement" class="if uuid-2691416" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/2691416.jpg"></div><p>  In order to open a savings book in Sberbank, you need to contact the nearest branch of a banking organization.  The client must inform the bank specialist about his intention to have a passbook and the purpose of its registration.  It should also be reported which individual or organization will accrue.  A bank employee will select the most suitable financial product. </p><h2>  What is necessary for registration </h2><p>  A client can open a savings book in Sberbank only by personally visiting a banking organization.  To arrange this service, the client enters into an agreement with a financial institution.  The client needs to have a passport and a small amount for a down payment of 10 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.alliantcreditunion.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Clearance procedure" class="if uuid-2691420" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/2691420.jpg"></div><p>  Many people who are interested in how much it costs to open a savings book in Sberbank should know that this procedure is free.  It is only necessary to deposit the initial amount, which will be on the savings book.  This amount is the <span>minimum balance</span> that is stored in the account until the account is closed.  The savings book has an unlimited duration.  The document belongs to the category of securities, which is filled in according to the established model.  Also, this document confirms all operations performed on the account. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Extradition Procedure </h2><p>  It is possible to open a savings book in Sberbank for an individual in any branch.  The client needs to receive a coupon with an individual number if the electronic queue system is used in the bank branch.  In case of difficulties in obtaining a coupon, the client can contact the bank employees.  At the reception with a specialist, it is necessary to present a coupon and an identity document.  After that, the bank employee will offer the client to familiarize themselves with the contract. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nerdwallet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Making a Passbook" class="if uuid-2691415" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/2691415.jpg"></div><p>  One copy of the contract will be stored in a banking organization, and the other client will receive it.  After signing the contract, the client will need to deposit a minimum amount into the account.  As a rule, the first payment can be accepted by a specialist.  In some units, cash is deposited through the bank's cash desk.  The savings book records the date and amount of the deposit.  If the savings book is issued in order to receive social payments, you should ask the specialist for details of the account.  Bank employees will answer all your questions and help with filling out the necessary documents.  Clients should check the data entered in the contract for errors. </p><h2>  Balance check </h2><p>  The client can monitor the status of the account in the following ways: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  online account; </li><li>  personal visit to the banking department. </li></ul><p>  On a personal visit, the specialist will provide complete information about the status of the account.  However, an <span>online service is the easiest and easiest way to check the balance.</span>  <span>The user can use the services of an online account anywhere with an electronic device and Internet access.</span>  <span>On your personal page you can find all the transfers and the size of the savings.</span> </p><h2>  Cash withdrawal </h2><p>  A client can withdraw funds only at a branch of a banking organization.  First you need to come to the reception of a bank employee who will form the posting for the issuance of cash.  Then the specialist will provide the client with a coupon indicating the name and surname, as well as the amount due. </p><div class="photo" data-original="medium.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Saving money" class="if uuid-2691405" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/2691405.jpg"></div><p>  This document must be presented to the cashier, who is engaged in cash transactions.  You need to have a passport with you, since the bank employee will <span>identify the client</span> <span>using it</span> <span>.</span>  <span>You can also use the self-service machines.</span>  <span>In this case, the client will need to draw up and attach a plastic card to the account.</span>  <span>The user can transfer funds to the card using a personal account or through an ATM.</span>  <span>Connecting to Internet banking entails certain financial costs, but it will greatly facilitate the conduct of various operations with the account.</span> </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages of passbooks </h2><p>  A document such as a passbook gives citizens a sense of security, as it is associated with a reliable state structure.  A bank card does not provide the opportunity to see the completed transactions, while the passbook clearly shows the cash flow.  Regardless of the type of transactions performed, all entries that are recorded by the operator are reflected in the passbook.  Among the shortcomings can be highlighted the inconvenience of using this document.  This is due to the fact that to complete the operation, you must <span>personally visit the office of a banking organization and have a passport with you.</span> </p><h2>  What is the percentage on the passbook </h2><p>  Depending on the <span>type of deposit</span> , the interest rate is determined.  Also, the percentage directly depends on the amount deposited and the duration of the deposit.  The ability to open a savings book in Sberbank at interest is available to any client of this organization. </p><div class="photo" data-original="moneycompass.com.my" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cash storage" class="if uuid-2691403" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/2691403.jpg"></div><p>  Pensioners are set maximum interest rates, regardless of the size of the deposit.  A savings book is issued for a specific contribution and is tied to its conditions. </p><h2>  Passbook operations </h2><p>  A bank specialist carries out operations only when a client provides a passport.  The passbook contains a table that is located on all sheets (except the first).  The document contains information about the date of the operation, the expense, the receipt of funds, as well as the total balance, which is displayed by calculation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.gemalto.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Conclusion of an agreement on registration of a passbook" class="if uuid-2691429" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/2691429.jpg"></div><p>  Operations are confirmed by a memorial warrant of a banking organization.  The client can withdraw funds only in the branch of the bank in which the savings book was opened.  If there is a need for remote withdrawal of funds, you must make a request to the bank branch at the place of residence. </p><h2>  How to open a savings book in Sberbank for a child </h2><p>  The savings book is a type of bank deposit.  Many parents <span>open a deposit</span> in the name of their children.  This manifestation of concern gained popularity in the USSR, when grandparents filled out savings books with their grandchildren.  Such a contribution provides protection of the child from possible financial difficulties and a successful life start.  Before opening a deposit, it is necessary to carefully study the savings program of a banking organization.  Most banks provide customers with the opportunity to open a savings book in Sberbank with a relative or any other person.  Therefore, parents can easily open a contribution in the name of their children. </p><div class="photo" data-original="inspirationfeed.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Simple procedure" class="if uuid-2691423" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/2691423.jpg"></div><p>  Clients can open a savings book in Sberbank for an individual whose name is specified in the agreement.  It is not possible to open an account in the name of two or more persons.  The depositor may draw up a power of attorney to replenish the account, receive funds and perform other operations on the account.  This document is drawn up in accordance with the established form. </p><h2>  Varieties of accounts </h2><p>  Sberbank offers the following types of accounts: deposits, current accounts and card accounts.  Cash on deposit can be placed for a strictly defined period.  With a certain periodicity, interest will be charged on the balance.  Their size directly depends on the specifics of the bank offer.  You can open a deposit through an online account or with a personal visit to a banking organization. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.vitalchek.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Varieties of accounts" class="if uuid-2691455" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/2691455.jpg"></div><p>  Current accounts are suitable for storing funds for a short period of time.  As a rule, they are used to make transfers of large sums or when conducting large transactions related to the purchase of a car or real estate.  To open, you must contact the office of a banking organization.  Clients should be aware that no interest is accrued on funds held in this type of account. </p><p>  Using a card account, the owner can independently manage financial resources.  Also, the client can perform any operations without a visit to the bank office.  Such accounts are used to withdraw cash, make purchases, pay for services and other household needs.  Any of the bills presented is tied to a savings book or plastic card.  With the help of a passbook, a client can manage only one deposit.  Using a plastic card, you can perform many operations and attach several banking products to your account. </p><h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  Many customers of Sberbank report that it is difficult to withdraw funds from the savings book, since it is necessary to visit the bank's office.  Among the positive aspects, customers highlight the efficiency of depositing and receiving funds on the account.  Also, the passbook is a visual document that provides information on all completed operations. </p><p>  Customers also note that the passbook does not need to request additional documents, since all the data certified by the operator is displayed on the pages.  Some reviews say that the passbook significantly limits the possibilities for its use.  Users report that to carry out a transaction it is necessary to have not only a passbook, but also a passport. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Existing legislation recognizes savings books as a form of bank deposit agreement.  Many customers are wondering if Sberbank is opening savings books today.  In the near future, the existing rules for the circulation of savings books and registration of deposits will be reviewed.  Savings books do not lose their popularity with customers, despite the significant expansion of the banking product line. </p>
