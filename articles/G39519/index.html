    <p>  The balconies in this hotel, judging by the reviews of many tourists, are quite comfortable.  But, unfortunately, there are no ropes for drying beach items on them.  It is better to take this accessory with you from Russia.  Of course, there are no clothespins on the balconies of the hotel.  At the same time, it is necessary to use them when drying beach items.  After lunch, a fairly strong wind usually rises in the village.  Therefore, going on vacation to the resort of Sunny Beach, future hotel guests should definitely bring clothespins with them. </p><p>  Some disadvantage of rooms in the hotel Hotel Condor 3 * guests consider the noise.  The fact is that they mostly go to the busy streets of the city, where life is in full swing, including at night.  Therefore, sleep in a room with an open window or balcony, most likely, will not succeed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The showers in this hotel, unfortunately, are not too comfortable.  When bathing due to the small tray and short curtains, water is sprayed throughout the room.  However, since the bathrooms in the hotel are equipped with ventilation, there is never dampness in them.  Do not clog in the showers of this hotel and plums. </p><h2>  Hotel Infrastructure </h2><p>  On the territory of the Condor 3 * Sunny Beach hotel, reviews of which are actually very good, guests can use: </p><ul><li>  safe at the reception; </li><li>  currency exchange office. </li></ul><p>  The hotel also has a medical office and a hairdresser.

    <h2>  Hotel infrastructure reviews </h2><p>  Opinion about the service offered at this hotel was very good for its guests.  First of all, tourists attribute the advantages of the Condor Sunny Beach 3 * hotel to the fact that there is a swimming pool.  Also, the advantage of the hotel is the availability of free Wi-Fi.  True, he catches a network in a hotel only in the lobby.  Another advantage of the hotel guests consider that in its lobby there is a cozy TV corner.  Relaxing here in the evenings or at lunch is really quite convenient. </p><p>  Outdoor pools are not available in all, but in many hotels in Bulgaria.  They are, for example, in the popular Hotel Veris, Diamant Residence, Amaris Hotel, etc. Of course, hotels with an outdoor pool in Bulgaria, as in any other resort country, are especially popular among tourists.  After all, their guests have the opportunity to swim, even if the sea is stormy.  The pool at the Condor Sunny Beach hotel, judging by the reviews of tourists, is quite comfortable.  You can swim in it comfortably, since the water is clean, and bleach does not add much to it. </p><p>  Tourists who come to Bulgaria with their families usually praise this hotel for its facilities, including for children.  The paddling pool in the hotel is quite comfortable and safe.  In the dining room of the hotel, among other things, there are highchairs.  If necessary, parents can also book a cot in the room. </p><p>  The staff at this hotel is extremely polite.  Some workers even speak Russian.  So, if necessary, Russian tourists do not have special problems communicating with hotel staff. </p><p>  Some of the shortcomings of the Condor hotel (Bulgaria, Sunny Beach) are many vacationers who do not settle in the rooms here before the due date.  At the same time, the persuasion and the promise of additional payments to the staff have absolutely no effect. </p><h2>  What you should know about </h2><p>  A feature of this hotel is that guests are not allowed into the rooms with any food.  The administration is motivated by the fact that because of food debris, cockroaches are bred in the hotel.  At the entrance to the hotel, tourists can arrange almost searches about this.  Of course, many guests attribute this to the minuses of the hotel. </p>

    <h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  Rooms for rent in the hotel with breakfast.  On the food in this hotel there are both positive and not too good reviews.  Meals at the hotel residents are taken on a buffet basis.  Breakfast at the hotel is served, according to many tourists, not particularly tasty.  The milk in the dining room is powdered, and meat dishes are not meat at all.  In addition, the portions themselves in the hotel buffet are not too large.  Most tourists believe that it is best to take eggs, cheese with bread, tomatoes and cucumbers in the dining room for breakfast.  Delicious enough at this hotel and pastries.  But, unfortunately, it is taken apart very quickly. </p><p>  In addition to the dining room, the hotel also has a bar where you can order a cocktail or beer, as well as some light snacks. </p><h2>  Hotel Beach Reviews </h2><p>  The coastline is just a couple of minutes walk from the hotel.  The beach of the hotel, many tourists consider it very convenient for relaxation.  The coastline belonging to the Condor Sunny Beach 3 * hotel is always clean.  The same goes for water in the sea.  The beach is covered with fine yellow sand.  Walking on it, as well as sunbathing on it is actually very convenient. </p>

    <p>  Offered on this beach for tourists and all kinds of water activities.  If you wish, you can ride a tablet, banana or parachute.  There are toilets on the beach.  True, for their visit you need to pay separately.  Of course, if you wish, you can take a sun lounger or umbrella on the hotel's beach.  It costs to rent these accessories is not too expensive. </p><p>  Tourists consider some disadvantage of the hotel's beach that there is no direct path to it.  The guests have to go in zigzags, which, of course, is not too convenient. </p><h2>  Useful advice </h2><p>  An excellent beach holiday and a developed tourist infrastructure is what the Sunny Beach resort offers to tourists.  Sunny Beach Condor 3 * - the hotel is comfortable and guests can relax here very well.  However, with ignorance of local customs, a vacation in Bulgaria can be greatly overshadowed.  Experienced tourists are advised to be extremely attentive in this country.  The fact is that the Bulgarians are very fond of deceiving one of their compatriots or tourists.  Moreover, this happens everywhere.  Taxi drivers are sure to try to smuggle visitors in the longest way, employees of exchange offices - to drop old bills, etc. </p><p>  Tourists should also be prepared for the fact that many Bulgarians traditionally do not like Russians.  Domestic holidaymakers can be rude in public transport, slip poor-quality products on the market, etc. But, of course, not all Bulgarians treat Russians in a similar way.  Many of them are quite sociable and polite. </p><h2>  City infrastructure near the hotel </h2><p>  Of course, there are many catering establishments and shops near the <span>Sunny Beach Hotel</span> (Bulgaria).  For example, next to the hotel there is a large shopping center "Zora Plaza".  Here, if desired, you can purchase fresh Bulgarian milk, delicious cottage cheese, natural juices. </p>
