    <h2>  First operation </h2><p>  The Whirlpool AWS 63213 washing machine is an indispensable assistant for every housewife.  However, in order for it to work flawlessly, it is necessary to comply with the manufacturer's recommendations before starting operation.  What are they?  Let's look at them. </p><ul><li>  Before installation, the device must be completely unpacked and the shipping bolts removed. </li><li>  Use the rotating legs to level the washing machine. </li><li>  Connect the device to the water supply and sewage system.  For these purposes, only new hoses are used, otherwise leaks may occur. </li><li>  The device is connected to the power supply only through a grounded outlet.  It is important during the operation of the washing machine not to occupy it with other household appliances. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="front-loading whirlpool washing machine" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1553148.jpg" width="500"></div></li></ul><h2>  Choice of detergents </h2><p>  Damage and subsequent repair of Whirlpool washing machines can be eliminated in most cases, if the right detergent is selected.  The manufacturer in the instructions suggests familiarizing yourself with important information that will help in their selection.  There are four criteria for this: </p><ul><li>  color of linen; </li><li>  degree of pollution; </li><li>  temperature condition; </li><li>  type of fabric. </li></ul><p>  Currently, there are several types of powders and gels that are used in different conditions.  For example, at 95 ¬∞ only white linen can be washed.  In this case, a sufficiently effective detergent with bleach is used.  For colored linen, the optimum temperature is 40 ¬∞ -60 ¬∞.  For this type, special powders of soft action have been developed.  They do not contain bleach.  In their composition there are particles that saturate the color. </p><p>  The focus is also on the type of detergent.  Special mixtures with low foaming have been developed for automatic washing machines, since a large amount of it can lead to problems in the operation of the device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine whirlpool aws 63213 manual" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1553099.jpg" width="516"></div>
