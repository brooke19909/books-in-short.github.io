Serving not only metropolitan airlines, but also foreign airport Vnukovo is often necessary for ordinary citizens.  It has long been noticed that connecting flights to one final destination can be served by completely different airports.  That is why it is important to know how to get from Sheremetyevo to Vnukovo and vice versa, spending a minimum of time and money. </p><h2>  Distance between airports </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.anna.aero" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sheremetyevo airport" class="if uuid-2628612" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46104/2628612.jpg"></div><p>  Before you directly determine how to get from Sheremetyevo to Vnukovo Airport, you should know what kind of territorial gap you have to overcome.  If you lay a virtual diagram, indicating the desired route, then in total when traveling along the highway you will have to overcome about 60 kilometers, but the path itself in a straight line is only 41 km.  That is why the question arises of how to get from Vnukovo to Sheremetyevo in the shortest possible time so as not to get into the huge metropolitan traffic jams. </p><h2>  Driving directions </h2><div class="photo" data-original="itqm2014.hse.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Aeroexpress Route" class="if uuid-2629178" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46104/2629178.jpg"></div><p>  If you intend to travel between two airports on your own, be sure to pre-print the card on sheets A4 with the route laid.  The answer to the question of how to get from Vnukovo to Sheremetyevo with a scheme will be much simpler than without it.  It is also advisable for yourself to note landmarks, that is, intermediate points through which you must pass in order not to get lost later. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Aeroexpress </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.google.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Way through the Aeroexpress" class="if uuid-2628611" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46104/2628611.jpg"></div><p>  Quite often, people ask how to get from Vnukovo to Sheremetyevo by aeroexpress.  This type of transport is the most expensive, but, perhaps, convenient in this situation.  It should also be borne in mind that Aeroexpress does not work at night, and is available only from 6 am to midnight.  However, in the daytime it is practically not necessary to wait for it - a new flight takes place every half hour.  A two-way trip will cost 900 rubles.  The distance between the two points is 51 km, so you can get there relatively quickly and without worrying about traffic jams. </p><h2>  Procedure </h2><p>  If the traveler decided to make a move by Aeroexpress, then he will need to perform the following algorithm of actions.  It should be strictly observed, because in order to get to the final destination, you will have to make transfers.  Thus, the question of how to get from Vnukovo to Sheremetyevo can become quite difficult for a number of people. </p><p>  Arriving at Vnukovo Airport, you need to pick up your luggage, and then follow the signs for the platform, from which the express train leaves directly.  In total, such a trip to the transfer point - Kievsky station - will take about half an hour, after which it will be necessary to get off. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Further along the metro line you will need to make a trip from the Kievskaya station to the Belorusskaya station.  Be sure to take into account the fact that this road is a ring road, and therefore take it as one of the landmarks. </p><p>  After that, from the Belorussky railway station you can reach the final destination - the Sheremetyevo Airport itself.  At the station, it is best to go through the 3rd or 4th terminals.  Through them, you can easily go through a quick check-in for domestic flights. </p><p>  After that, via Aeroexpress you can directly arrive at one of the two terminals of Sheremetyevo 2 Airport - F or E. </p><p>  Buying tickets is quite simple, they are quietly sold not only at the box office, but also through vending machines that issue change and accept bank cards. </p><h2>  Bus </h2><div class="photo" data-original="proboknet.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Urban transport" class="if uuid-2628616" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46104/2628616.jpg"></div><p>  Many people, wondering how to get from Vnukovo to Sheremetyevo, prefer to use minibuses or buses out of habit.  Such a trip is really the most economical option, however, getting to the destination by bus is quite difficult.  Airports are located quite far from each other, almost at the opposite ends of the city.  However, if you want to make such a trip, it is quite possible. </p><h2>  Route algorithm </h2><p>  Those who wish to get to Sheremetyevo from Vnukovo by bus are recommended to adhere to the following travel algorithm.  In total, there are two possible options, so the traveler must independently determine the preferred one: </p><p>  1. At the bus station of Vnukovo Airport, take the 611 bus.  It should take you to the metro station "Salaryevo".  Then through the subway you should get to one of the stations of the red line, namely, Okhotny Ryad.  After this, follow the signs to the Teatralnaya stop.  In the future, the underground path should end only at the River Station.  Now you should go to the surface and take one of the buses - No. 817, 851, 948, 949. They keep their way directly to the terminals of Sheremetyevo Airport. </p><p>  2. If the terminal B or C is the destination, it is best to use this route.  Follow the same 611th bus, but get off at the Yugo-Zapadnaya station.  After that, take the metro to "Culture Park", then follow the brown signs to the ring line and continue the trip to the Krasnopresnenskaya station.  On it you will have to go back to Barrikadnaya, and then move to Glider.  After that, go upstairs and take the 817 bus, which is directly on the way to the necessary terminals. </p><p>  Minibuses and buses go about once every half an hour.  Such a trip on a bus will cost 20 rubles per ticket, on a minibus - 60 rubles. </p><h2>  Taxi </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.transfers2go.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Personal car" class="if uuid-2628615" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46104/2628615.jpg"></div><p>  If deciding how to get from Vnukovo to Sheremetyevo, you are afraid to get lost on the subway line or in the city in general, then you should choose a taxi.  Perhaps this particular mode of transport is the most attractive for nonresident.  However, you should not take a taxi directly to the airport, the prices for services here are much higher.  That is why make a pre-order for services through an online system or call so that a car will be waiting for you at your exit from the airport.  Typically, the driver picks up a plate with the name of the passenger so that it can be easily identified, and then helps in an optimal and quick way to get to Sheremetyevo. </p><p>  However, such a trip can become unusually long due to traffic jams in the city center, so it is best to be patient and have a lot of time if you do not want to be late.  This way will cost about 2 thousand rubles, so it‚Äôs better to order a taxi for the company, because then a trip for one person will be noticeably cheaper. </p><h2>  How to get from Vnukovo to Sheremetyevo at night </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.rbth.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vnukovo at night" class="if uuid-2628613" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46104/2628613.jpg"></div><p>  If you need to make such a trip at night, it is best to pre-order a taxi.  This is the most convenient and traditional way.  However, you can also use the night bus number H1, which runs every half hour.  Its route runs along the outskirts and center of Moscow, but in the end it ends only at the airport terminals.  Such a trip will take a lot of time - at least 2 hours. </p><p>  As you can see, the question of how to get from Vnukovo to Sheremetyevo is quite simple to solve.  Communication between the two airports is stable and well-functioning, and therefore, each person can easily choose the option that suits him for comfort and finances. </p>
