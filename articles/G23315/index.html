In any case, the art of embroidery is at least 3-4 thousand years old, and maybe more.  Be that as it may, many techniques were invented on different continents that differ from each other in the way they sew stitches, the surface texture of the resulting products, and the theme of the patterns.  Among them is the bargello embroidery, the patterns of which allow you to create magnificent pillowcases, lambrequins and upholstery for chairs and sofas. </p>

    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Florentine embroidery, better known as the Bargello technique, was invented in the Middle Ages.  Although Italians claim that it was invented by residents of the northern regions of their country, there is a legend pointing to its Hungarian origin.  It is said that many centuries ago, Princess Jadwiga was married to the Polish king.  She brought with her to the dowry many beautiful things that were decorated with unusual embroidery with threads.  To surprise new subjects, the queen undertook to make vestments for the Archbishop of Esztergom Budapest.  Coats of arms of the two countries embroidered on it.  The Poles liked the equipment so much that local girls and women began to use it to decorate their toilets and homes.  Later, the Italians learned the secrets of such embroidery, calling it a bargello.  Another version of the origin of the bargello technique is that it became known in the city of Perugia at the turn of the 10-11th centuries thanks to Queen Grisella (969-1038) - the wife of the King of Hungary Stephen the First. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Revival of Bargello embroidery </h2><p>  After World War II, Europe freed itself from "junk."  Everything that reminded of life before bombs fell from the sky in the cities of the Old World, and people in Nazi uniforms marched through the streets, was declared tasteless and vulgar.  Such a fate went to embroidered gizmos.  Soon, even old women stopped spending time creating hand-made decor items to decorate their homes, being content with grocery shopping, and it was impossible to put young girls at the hoop.  Most likely, the bargello embroidery (the diagrams are presented below), which was not very popular due to the complexity of execution and laboriousness, would be forgotten forever.  However, everything changed in the 70s, when several young designers who were looking for new sources of inspiration drew attention to her.  They began to use products with decor made by Florentine embroidery, as a bright accent in the monochrome interior. </p>

    <h2>  What is required </h2><p>  First of all, you need a suitable fabric for embroidery.  Experienced craftswomen recommend using a cotton cloth with a rare binding, for example, a single rare canvas.  In addition, for work you will need: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  needles with a wide eye and a slightly blunt end (tapestry No. 18, 20, 22 and 24 are well suited); </li><li>  bright threads (for beginners it is better to choose a <span>thread floss)</span> ; </li><li>  small sharp scissors; </li><li>  hoop (for small work, you can use round, the desired diameter, and for large paintings should use a frame). </li></ul><p>  Best of all is Florentine embroidery with threads of a thickness equal to the diameter of the fabric holes.  Otherwise, the product will be very stiff or a canvas will appear from under the pattern, which will worsen its appearance. </p><p>  If floss is used, it is recommended to disassemble them into threads and reconnect.  In this case, you will get a more magnificent and beautiful embroidery. </p>

    <h2>  Features of the technique </h2><p>  Bargello embroidery (patterns can be invented independently on the basis of existing ones) comes out bright and has a magnificent view on both sides. </p><p>  The stitches in bargello are embroidered from left to right, and vice versa, provided that the pattern is the same.  Before starting work, according to the selected pattern, markings are put on the canvas. </p><p>  If this is your first bargello embroidery, it is better to choose the simplest patterns. </p><h2>  Types of Stitches </h2><p>  The most important thing in bargello is the nature of the seam.  The main stitches in this technique are classic 4-thread vertical embroidery.  Then a subsequent seam is performed, which should be shifted slightly to the side by one vertical thread.  Thanks to this technique, the pattern on 2 sides of the embroidery is identical. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The described stitch is the main one, however, there are patterns that are executed in a different way.  In particular, depending on the pattern, size or displacement may vary.  In addition, in cases of square embroidery, the stitches should be horizontal. </p><p>  The only thing that remains unchanged is the use of only one thread between paired stitches. </p>

    <h2>  Herringbone </h2><p>  The embroidery technique of the bargello is quite diverse.  For example, using oblique seams, you can get a herringbone pattern.  Such a figure is formed if you cross the threads at the base.  In this case, they lie at an angle, and the seams display each other, as in a mirror.  This gives the drawing a special texture.  Bags and wallets are often embroidered with such a stitch, as well as upholstery for upholstered furniture. </p><h2>  Main ornaments </h2><p>  There are several ways to embroider the main patterns in the Florentine bargello technique.  Most often use a pattern with pointed ends.  As a result, when making stitches in width, they get an image of a zigzag shape, or, as it is called in Italy, carnation. </p><p>  The bargello embroidery technique attaches great importance to the combination of threads of different colors.  In particular, you can use the creation of a pattern first with stitches of one shade, and then another, which are located in one direction.  With this variant of embroidery, each subsequent stitch is placed above or below the previous stitch. </p><h2>  Arches </h2><p>  The ornament for embroidery in bargello is not always pointed.  Often, round shapes are used for the pattern.  Such arches using the bargello technique are created due to the special arrangement of the seam.  The difficulty lies in the exact choice of distance to obtain a figure of a specific size.  Even the most experienced craftswomen use schemes applied to the canvas for this purpose.  When embroidering, the stitches are raised 3 threads up, if you want to get a thin and high arch, but for the wide one you need to make stitches at your level, then raise them 2 threads. </p>

    <h2>  Flame </h2><p>  Recently, in the interiors of the most luxurious apartments in Europe and the USA, embroidered pillows with a fire-like pattern can be seen.  This is a rather complicated option, which is not as easy to implement as it may seem.  The pattern is an open arch.  However, it has an important feature: it has the same element under it, but in the mirror opposite.  In this case, the stitches are embroidered with a shade that does not differ much from the basic background, and the subsequent ‚Äúwave‚Äù is performed with threads darker or lighter by one tone.  Such a transfusion gives the product a special flavor. </p><h2>  Scales </h2><p>  Such an original and intricate pattern is considered one of the most complex, but it is with it that embroidered pillows look most beautiful.  Scales are created on the basis of the "flame", but in a more bizarre way. </p><p>  To complete this pattern, you need to take a thread of your favorite shade and make the first row.  Then you should continue in accordance with the pattern of embroidery with a ‚Äúflame‚Äù pattern, but trying to get squares with rounded edges.  In final form, the drawing will consist of a series of small humps and depressions. </p><h2>  Kaleidoscope </h2><p>  Such a non-standard ornament is made in the form of a square, with the repetition of a figure in a coup.  In order to embroider it, 2 oblique strips should be made, with a repeated pattern.  Work begins with the creation of a triangle that is embroidered at the top.  Then it is turned over and a second such figure is made.  In this case, the color of the threads alternates.  The result should be a square figure, consisting of 4 repetitions of the same type of ornament. </p>

    <h2>  Florentine embroidery: embroidery kits </h2><p>  The most difficult moment to work in the bargello technique is the development of circuits.  For its implementation, a very accurate calculation of the blocks of the pattern is required to create its clear geometric outlines. </p><p>  For this reason, bargello embroidery kits primarily include such patterns.  In addition, they can include threads of various types, a cloth and needles with a fairly wide eye. </p><p>  Now you know some secrets of the old Florentine single-canvas embroidery technique.  As practice shows, teaching to create products in the style of bargello is not as difficult as it might seem at first glance.  Engaging in this type of needlework will make your leisure time more interesting and allow you to decorate the interior with products that store the warmth of human hands.  For example, pillows, wall panels, or vibrant lambrequins that fit perfectly into an Art Deco style look great.  In addition, a decoration in the form of Florentine embroidery on wardrobe items will turn them from banal to exclusive and attracting everyone's attention and envious glances. </p>
