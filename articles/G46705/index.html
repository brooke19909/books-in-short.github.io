A sort of <span>Benvenuto Cellini</span> in the field of electronics.  The mobile phones and smartphones segment was no exception.  At first, devices released by the concern were not very popular.  But over time, users learned the charm of Lenovo gadgets and began to buy the company's products with enviable constancy.  This helped the manufacturer to stand almost on a par with such recognized masters as Samsung and Apple.  But the company chose the budget segment as the main industry.  Lenovo devices are easy to use, reliable, have an attractive appearance and boast decent performance.  And the average user does not need a bigger one.  A striking representative of budget-level gadgets is the Lenovo K5 Plus.  Reviews about this smartphone are mostly positive.  But there are also unpleasant moments.  Let's take a closer look at it.  But first, let's talk about the manufacturer. </p><h2>  Some information about the company </h2><p>  Lenovo was founded in 1987.  Its main creator was the Chinese Academy of Sciences.  To this day, she owns a controlling stake.  In those days, the newly-minted company was engaged in importing personal computers to China and finalizing them to ensure adequate work with hieroglyphs.  The first computer was built in the early nineties of the last century.  At the same time, the concern begins to produce its own computers and laptops under the Lenovo label.  In 2010, the manufacturer buys out a bankrupt legend - IBM.  This allowed Lenovo to produce IdeaPad and ThinkPad laptops.  However, not only PCs and laptops occupied the leadership of the company.  The manufacturer began to produce low-cost and reliable entry-level smartphones.  And the acquisition in 2013 of another bankrupt legend allowed the Chinese to improve the quality of their devices.  It's about the cult company Motorola.  Using the experience of the latter, the Chinese managed to create smartphones of a new level under the Moto brand.  However, our today's hero has nothing to do with Moto.  This is a <span>Lenovo K5</span> Plus smartphone.  We will review reviews about him right now. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Smartphone Design Reviews </h2><p>  What does the <span>Lenovo K5</span> Plus phone look like?  Design feedback is supportive.  Many owners believe that it looks like a pretty high-quality mid-range device.  Pleased users with the presence of metal elements.  The most valuable thing about the gadget is that it has a completely metal frame, which makes it much stronger than plastic "colleagues".  Those who purchased this gadget note the high quality materials of the case.  Also, according to the owners, all the elements fit tightly: there are no gaps anywhere.  The design feature of this smartphone can be considered rounded corners.  Thanks to this, the gadget lies perfectly in the hand and does not strive to slip out.  And in your pocket, sharp corners do not stick into the body, because they simply do not exist.  Many also consider touch navigation buttons to be a plus.  They are quite large, have a backlight and are in the usual place - under the screen.  However, users negatively respond to the decision to place two speakers on the rear panel at the bottom.  It‚Äôs inconvenient to play or watch video, because the speakers overlap with the palm of your hand and the sound is distorted.  But this is all the little things.  For the most part, the design of the device pleased the public.  Now let's move on to technical specifications and performance. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews on the performance of the device </h2><p>  Now consider the hardware platform "Lenovo K5 Plus."  Customer reviews in this case are mixed.  Some praise its capabilities, while others are frankly not happy that the device turned out so weak.  But until we have moved on to a discussion of opinions, it should be recalled that we have before us a smartphone of the budget segment.  This means that it is not intended for games.  And it cannot boast of special performance.  It has an eight-core Qualcomm Snapdragon clocked at 1.7 gigahertz.  What heavy toys can we talk about?  RAM in the amount of two gigabytes is enough for smooth operation of the operating system and launch applications.  But you have to forget about the games.  But not about everyone, but only about the most demanding.  Owners of the device note that the device copes well with all tasks that do not require heavy processing of 3D-graphics.  That is, watching Full HD video, Internet surfing, almost all applications and some games - these are the main areas of activity of this smartphone.  And users say that the device copes well with this.  This is the task of a budget mobile device. </p>

    <h2>  Screen Reviews </h2><p>  What do they say about the Lenovo K5 Plus screen?  Reviews about this component surprise with their uniformity: they are all positive.  Everyone likes the resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels (Full HD), IPS-matrix, a diagonal of 5 inches and maximum brightness.  Owners of the smartphone note that the screen perfectly reproduces almost all colors, has a decent anti-reflective coating and almost does not collect fingerprints.  Also, some users note this fact: in direct sunlight, all information remains readable.  This means that the anti-reflective coating works as expected.  In general, the screen is a matter of pride for the creators of this smartphone.  He can easily argue with the displays of gadgets of the middle price segment.  Not all state employees can find such a high-quality screen.  And users appreciate it, leaving positive reviews about the device. </p>

    <h2>  Camera Reviews </h2><p>  Now let's move on to the Lenovo K5 Plus cameras.  Specifications and reviews suggest that the photomodules are on a budget level.  This is to be expected.  Lenovo does not like to pamper customers with good optics in cheap smartphones.  It happened with this gadget.  The owners note that the main camera of the device adequately copes with its work only in good lighting conditions or in broad daylight.  As soon as the quality of lighting deteriorates, artifacts, blurring and other bad things immediately appear.  There is nothing surprising.  The gadget uses a 13-megapixel module with 2.2 aperture.  But the flash is very weak.  And the lens is not fast enough.  Hence the artifacts.  The owners claim that the front camera does a good job.  It has at its disposal 5 megapixels.  For selfie and communication in social networks it is quite enough.  Yes, the camera does not shine with cameras.  But he does not need it. </p>

    <h2>  Operating system reviews </h2><p>  What do they say about the Lenovo Vib K5 Plus software platform?  Reviews about the firmware and the proprietary shell can also please the manufacturer.  Although quite ancient ‚ÄúAndroid 5.1.1‚Äù is installed on the device, everything works very quickly and smoothly.  Also, customers really liked the VibeUI proprietary interface.  It does not look like the stock Android and does not resemble the OS from Huawei (EMUI).  Everything is done with taste.  The shell itself is not particularly heavy.  Even a device with such modest technical characteristics can easily cope with it.  And if someone does not like the company interface, then you can always change the firmware. </p>

    <h2>  Battery and battery life reviews </h2><p>  Now let's talk about the autonomy of the Lenovo K5 Plus.  Reviews and photos convince us that the gadget has a 2800 mAh battery.  However, a dry figure will not tell us how much battery is enough in real conditions.  Most owners are inclined to believe that when using the smartphone in normal mode, its charge will be enough for a full two days of work.  Of course, under load, he will live less.  Just a day.  And if you load it with some game, then a couple of hours.  Autonomy results did not impress buyers.  However, everyone recognizes that this is better than the autonomy of modern flagships. </p>
