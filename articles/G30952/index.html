  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The structure of the penis and other genital organs of men</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>The genitals</span> (male) are divided into external and internal.  The scrotum and penis can be attributed to the external ones, and what is hidden from the eye - the testicles, appendages, spermatic cord and tubercle, glands (bulbar, urethral and prostate) and <span>seminal vesicles.</span>  The structure of male organs is subordinated to their main function - the reproduction of offspring and the transfer of genetic information to a partner. </p><p>  At all times, most attention was paid to the penis.  The remaining organs were undeservedly forgotten and remembered only on the occasion of an illness, but the symbol of masculinity - a member - clearly became the subject of interest of both the male and female half of society.  Even the ancients worshiped the member as a deity, and even performed all kinds of rituals with him.  And on the stone members deprived of innocence ... </p><p>  The structure of a member has long been inaccessible to understanding.  So, for example, the ancients believed that during an erection it was filled with air - now these speculations are completely debunked.  Only with the development of anatomy in the Middle Ages, under pain of church punishment, physicians began to study the human body, and with it the structure of the penis. </p><p>  The penis consists of the body, head, foreskin and mouth of the urethra.  The length of the body of the penis is from six to ten centimeters at rest, and the girth is approximately six centimeters.  <span>The head of the penis</span> is hidden under the foreskin, which protects it from mechanical damage.  At the end of the head is the mouth of the urethra, from which sperm and urine are secreted.  The penis can be visually divided into such parts.  The internal structure of a member is much more complicated.  The entire body of the penis consists of <span>cavernous bodies.</span>  During an erection, blood pressure rises in the cavernous bodies, which can become equal to the total blood pressure with an especially strong voltage.  By the structure of the body, I remind you of cylinders surrounded by a protein membrane that pass on both sides of the penis.  With their ends, they abut and attach to the <span>pubic bones,</span> thus forming a root.  An urethra passes between the bodies, through which urine is transported out and out through the meatus (a hole in the head of the penis).  The structure of the penis is so organized that sperm and urine normally never mix - a special tubercle is responsible for this, which swells during intercourse and as if presses the <span>urethra.</span> </p><p>  In the scrotum, divided by an internal septum into two parts, there are testicles and spermatic cords.  The testes are responsible for the most important functions - the production of sperm and androgens.  The testicular feature is that their temperature does not correspond to the general body temperature - in the testes it is two degrees lower.  Such a "cooling effect" specifically ensures the preservation of sperm. </p><p>  Testicular appendages are special organs that are regulated by androgens.  They are responsible for the full cycle of sperm, which lasts two weeks - it is during this time that the sperm reach the maturity at which they are able to fertilize the female <span>reproductive cell.</span>  In order for the sperm to be delivered to the egg, they are mixed with the secretion of the spermatic cord, rich in nutrients.  In this fluid, sperm find energy that supports their metabolism, as well as contributing to their movement.  All this activity is provided with blood supply.  The arteries and veins that feed the testicle are enclosed in the spermatic cord. </p><p>  Another important organ is the prostate gland.  She is responsible for the volume of ejaculate, increasing it, for liquefaction of sperm, sperm resistance to infections and their non-sticky. </p><p>  The structure of the member may have deviations from the norm.  If a pathology is detected, you should consult a doctor as soon as possible in order to maintain the further sexual and reproductive function of the man. </p>
