Almost every country offers its residents and guests fun in this kind of entertainment centers, but they are especially popular in resorts.  There is even an organization that regulates their activities and safety - the World Association of Water Parks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Troy water park in Turkey" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20113/451364.jpg" width="600"></div>  Modern water parks occupy large areas and offer guests a wide range of entertainment - you can slide down the slides, splash, swim in the pool, visit the dolphinarium and an aquarium (they are quite common in water parks) or simply ride along a slowly flowing river on a mattress or inflatable circle.

There is everything for a great vacation - a wonderful climate, sea, sun, many hotels and restaurants (from the highest class to inexpensive budget options) and a very developed entertainment industry.  Local hotel and hotel owners are constantly thinking about what else to attract visitors with and create all the conditions for a memorable pastime.  Not the last role is played by all kinds of fun, both for adults and for children. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Water parks in Turkey </h2><p>  The first Turkish water amusement parks began to be built in the 90s.  Almost every resort has its own water park, sometimes there are several.  In Antalya you can visit the Dedeman complex, one of the first in the country, built in 1993.  In addition to it, Aqualand is famous - it is newer and larger in area and capacity.  Alanya invites guests to the Water Planet water park, Kemer to the Water World.  The resort of Marmaris operates Atlantis.  In Kusadasi - ‚ÄúAdaland‚Äù, recognized as one of the largest in Europe.  In addition to him, you can visit the "Aquafantasy".  One more Dedeman is operating in Bodrum.  All parks are well equipped and operate throughout the season. </p><h2>  Troy - water park in Turkey </h2><p>  This is one of the most famous and interesting parks.  The place where the Troy water park is located is <span>Belek, Turkey.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey water park troia photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20113/451363.jpg" width="600"></div>  Wealthy tourists from all over the world come here.  It is located in the fashionable Rixos Premium Belek, which is open to all visitors to the amusement park.  Troy, a water park in Turkey, was built relatively recently - in 2005.  Its area is relatively small - about 12 thousand square meters.

The park is decorated in antique style, all slides and attractions are stylized as Trojans.  This explains its name.  Throughout the park there are scattered and laid out armor, shields, swords, buildings and structures that look like old Roman-Trojan fortifications.  Photography is not forbidden - you can use the whole surroundings.  Children love to be photographed with swords and in armor, a life-size chariot layout made with full respect for all the features of the original enjoys special attention. </p><h2>  Trojan horse </h2><p>  In the center of the water park is a model of a Trojan horse made in full size - its height is 25 meters.  The owners claim that this design was used to create the film of the same name "Troy".  Legend has it that during the Trojan War, the Greeks undertook a cunning maneuver - they brought a huge wooden horse to the inhabitants of the city, supposedly as an offering to the gods.  In fact, the best warriors were hiding inside the building, who, after dark, got out and opened the gate.  And Troy fell ... </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="belek water park troia Price" class="if" height="466" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20113/451361.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The water park in Turkey uses the above-mentioned design not only to decorate and maintain the appropriate atmosphere - the horse is a ladder through which climb 5 water slides, 3 of which are open and 2 are indoor.  Their length exceeds 100 meters. </p><h2>  Rides </h2><p>  Troy offers its visitors a wide variety of entertainment.  For lovers of extreme sensations slides "Kamikaze" and "Phantom" are provided - they are designed in such a way that they have a fairly sharp slope - at an angle of 40 degrees.  The speed when descending from such a mountain reaches 80 km / h. </p>

By the way, there are practically no queues for this attraction.  For children, special playgrounds are provided in the form of a ship with pools, and small slides create a good mood for the kids.  All other designs can be divided into 2 types - open and closed.  In the closed dark inside, the descent through the open is accompanied by spray.  A total of 15 water slides for adults and 10 for children. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The best water park in Turkey" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20113/451359.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Another highlight of the park can be called the famous attraction "Master Bumbaster" - it is not provided for going down, but going up.  Water hits a special gutter from the bottom into the bottom of the rubber ring, and it rises up to a height of 13 meters.  All over the world there are only 2 such structures - one in the Troy water park, the second in the Emirates. </p><p>  All slides are quite meandering and long.  Descent to them takes place on special water circles, without them it is forbidden to ride.  At the top of each attraction there is a special employee who strictly monitors compliance with this rule. </p><p>  An artificial ‚Äúlazy river‚Äù flows along the perimeter of the water park, you can ride on it in circles and mattresses - the flow is calm and unhurried, you can sunbathe and enjoy the views.  Its length is about 3 km.  <span>Artificial waterfalls are</span> impressive and cheer up vacationers.  There is a special pool where the waves are also ‚Äúman-made‚Äù, however, there are all conditions for surfing.  For fans of extreme adventures in the center of the park there is a special indoor pool where you can swim with ... sharks - in a safe suit and, of course, under the guidance of a rescue instructor.  There is an entertainment cave "Lost City" on the territory.  According to many tourists, Troy is the best water park in Turkey! </p><h2>  Security </h2><p>  One of the modern requirements for the entertainment industry is compliance with safety rules for vacationers.  Troy, a water park in Turkey, is constantly working on this issue.  All attractions are divided into adults, where children and adolescents are not allowed, teenagers (adults will not let them go there), and children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water park troia belek turkey" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20113/451362.jpg" width="399"></div>  Everywhere pay attention to the weight category.  The staff of the park is following the order.  On the territory there is always a doctor and rescuers.  Admission is by tokens, they are issued only to adult visitors - you must ensure that the child is not lost.  Water in different pools can be different - sea and fresh.  Its quality and cleanliness is constantly monitored by a special control service.
