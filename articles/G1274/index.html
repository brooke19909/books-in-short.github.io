How to prepare for work</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Weaving from beads or glass beads can be mastered without long training.  Beading for beginners does not require complex or expensive fixtures.  And yet, before proceeding with the manufacture of products, it is necessary to work out simple methods of lowering. </p><p>  What materials and tools does beading for beginners require </p><p>  For successful work you will need: </p><ul><li>  Beads, small beads, bugles.  Beads can be any size and color.  Old or crumbling beads will come in handy - you can make new original jewelry from them.  How to store bead material?  It can be glass vials, boxes or bottles with caps, in which each individual <span>type of bead</span> will be located <span>.</span>  During operation, it can be poured onto a fleecy cloth or kept in small outlets.  This will help to easily collect material on the needle.  In the arsenal of the craftswoman there should be beads or beads, which have a larger hole than conventional beads.  Such beads are called "bundles" and large holes are needed in them so that you can easily pass the needle and thread through the bead several times. </li></ul><p>  To make beadwork for beginners successful, try to select beads of the same size according to the color of the pattern and make sure that the beads lie tightly to each other, without sagging. </p><ul><li>  Needles need thin with a long eye.  Can be lowered without a needle.  In this case, use a thread whose end is dipped in nail polish or glue.  The needle threader can also be used with success to string beads without a needle. </li><li>  Fishing line.  Weaving with beads on a fishing line implies that it should be thin. </li><li>  The threads used are ordinary - cotton bobbin, nylon, silk.  To work without using a needle, they take a single thick thread (No. 10, 20), and a thin cotton thread (No. 40, 50) or kapron is folded in half.  The thread on which they will collect the beads and lower the product is called the ‚Äúworking thread‚Äù. </li><li>  Wax.  To give the thread elasticity and elasticity, it is waxed - wiped with wax. </li><li>  Albums with patterns, felt-tip pens, <span>colored pencils.</span>  This will be needed to create patterns and sketches of future products using beadwork technique, for beginners this is a very useful help. </li><li>  Scissors. </li><li>  Machine for weaving.  It is not difficult to make it, with the help of the machine they perform the original weaving with beads, bracelets for beginners using the textile technique.  The machine is a plank with a thickness of 1 cm, 6-10 cm wide, and length depending on the planned product: 60 cm for short weaves and 150 cm for long.  At the ends of the planks, wooden slats are attached - they are called "sills".  Their width is 2 cm and a height of 2 to 5 cm. Small cloves in a checkerboard pattern (their distance from each other about 3 mm) are hammered on the slats.  These carnations are needed to fasten the warp threads.  Sometimes, instead of carnations, cuts are made on the sills. </li></ul><p>  How to weave using a weaving machine </p><p>  With this technique (weaving), the warp threads should be one more than the number of beads in the pattern across the width of the product.  Pull the threads should not be too tight so that the finished product is not warped and wrinkled. </p><p>  The threads are pulled from one side to the other, creating the so-called base according to the principle that is used in weaving.  In this case, the role of the shuttle will be played by the needle, and the role of the duck will be the working thread on which beads are strung. </p><p>  First, on the plank of the machine, you need to apply a center line dividing the plank in half, which will show the middle of the product.  It should also be applied with a pencil on the plank from each edge along the line indicating the beginning and end of the work, that is, the length of the finished product.  For short products - at a distance of 15 cm from each nut, and for long products - at a distance of 25 cm. </p><p>  Beading for beginners is always performed as follows - the work is in the left hand, while the fingers of the right hand lead the thread of work.  There is nothing complicated. </p>
