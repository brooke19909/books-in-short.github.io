Biography, the mystery of death</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  This person earned the title and position on his own, without resorting to kinship or money.  From the first days of World War II, he served as company commander.  He participated in landmark battles near Leningrad, and also defended the complex Stalingrad and Ukrainian front.  After the war, the career of Sergei Fedorovich went up.  And in 1982 he was awarded the title of Hero of the USSR, and a year later Akhromeev - Marshal of the Soviet Union.  Two children, grandchildren, wife, love for the motherland - everything is fine.  But on August 24, 1991, the body of Sergei Fedorovich was found dead, hanged on a window handle and in a sitting position. </p><h2>  Education </h2><p>  Military service at Sergei Fedorovich began at the age of 17, when he entered the naval school.  A year later, the young man was forced to go as part of the infantry battalion of cadets to defend Leningrad.  After the blockade, his weight was up to 40 kg, and the frostbitten limbs that the doctors intended to amputate miraculously remained under Akhromeev.  In 1942, the guy takes courses of lieutenants at the Astrakhan School, after which he becomes the commander of a small platoon, and in 1944 he is the commander of a battalion of machine gunners. </p>

    <p>  In 1945, Sergey completed his studies at the Higher Officer School.  The future Marshal Akhromeev is not going to stop raising knowledge in the military sphere.  The biography of Sergei Fedorovich in terms of education contains the following list of achievements: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  1952 - Academy of Armored Forces, gold medal; </li><li>  1967 - Academy of the General Staff, <span>gold medal.</span>  And in the same year he became the chief of staff of the army. </li></ul><h2>  A family </h2><p>  When in the circle of relatives and friends everything is smooth and for love, once again I do not want to share any information with others.  Apparently, the Akhromeev‚Äôs family was also happy, since there is little information about relatives in the biography. </p>

    <p>  It is known that Sergei met his wife Tamara at Moscow School No. 381 during joint studies.  When the future Marshal Akhromeev served as commander of a battalion in the Far East, his family was replenished with another person.  They had a daughter, Tatyana.  After moving to Moscow, Sergey and Tamara become parents a second time.  By this time, Sergei Fedorovich was given the rank of general. </p><h2>  Service under Gorbachev </h2><p>  By the mid-80s, Sergei Fedorovich was one of those who believed that the authorities needed a reboot.  Therefore, with the choice of the Secretary General in the person of Mikhail Sergeyevich, Akhromeev appeared to want to work.  He saw interest and intentions in Gorbachev to understand army problems. </p>

    <p>  <span>Dmitry Yazov,</span> being the Minister of Defense and a friend of Sergei Fedorovich, in an interview, said that before the events of 1991, Akhromeev sought to get into the "paradise group".  This is the unspoken name of the society under the Minister of Defense, created under Stalin.  But it was not destined to enter it, since Gorbachev offered Sergey Fedorovich the position of his adviser. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This circumstance became fatal.  Akhromeev - the marshal of the Soviet Union - did not want to see how a superpower destroys its security system. </p><h2>  Background to the signing of the disarmament treaty </h2><p>  When Marshal Akhromeev became the presidential adviser to Gorbachev, the biography of the latter takes a new milestone, which led Sergei Fedorovich to a secret death.  As early as the 1970s, missile guidance techniques were created in America and the USSR to achieve accuracy in hitting a target.  This was the beginning of a race in the development of a defense system in the nuclear field.  In 1976, <span>USSR Minister of Defense</span> Ustinov decided to build up intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) to cover the western direction with a warhead capable of hitting several targets simultaneously.  When 300 missiles were already deployed on the borders of the Soviet Union, and 572 American missiles were supposed to be deployed in Europe, negotiations began between the countries. </p>

    <p>  The dialogue, which began in 1980, acquired a compromise after the death of D.F. Ustinov.  Prior to this, the Soviet Union intended to conduct negotiations on space weapons and Euro-missiles on the same plane.  And in early 1986, M. S. Gorbachev put forward a program for the gradual elimination of nuclear weapons, which is seen as a concession to the USSR. </p><h2>  Disarmament </h2><p>  The program proposed by Gorbachev alarmed Japan, and later the PRC, in that the USSR would redirect missiles to these countries.  At the end of 1987, the resolution of the issue was the destruction of medium- and short-range missiles under the control of inspectors. </p><p>  Akhromeev, the Marshal of the Soviet Union, then reported to Gorbachev that disarmament was unilateral and the USSR was losing its combat effectiveness.  In reality, America was destroying obsolete military power, while the United States retained the sea-based missiles, which represented a danger in the form of nuclear weapons intended to control the Soviet country.  According to the historian, writer Alexander Shirokorad, the Soviet Union destroyed most of the R-36 missiles, which in America were nicknamed "Satan." </p><p>  The United States destroyed 100 medium-range missiles, and five times more in the USSR.  And formally, both states were supposed to disarm in equal numbers. </p><p>  The final act, which finally disappointed Akhromeev in Gorbachev‚Äôs policy, was the destruction of the best weapons of the Oka, which didn‚Äôt fit, in terms of parameters, to those that were subject to destruction under the agreement.  But after the arrival of the US Secretary of State, Schulz, Mikhail Sergeyevich agrees to reduce the operational-tactical complex.  Sergei Fedorovich understands the stupidity of the situation and asks Gorbachev not to do this.  To which the latter said a categorical "no." </p><h2>  The death of Marshal Akhromeev </h2><p>  In August 1991, Sergei Fedorovich with his wife and granddaughters rested in Sochi.  He did not know that a coup was being prepared, although he was in friendship with Yazov, the then Minister of Defense.  On the 19th of the same month and year, Akhromeev flew to Moscow.  At that time, an emergency committee was created under the Kremlin, which opposed the reorganization of the USSR into the <span>Union of Sovereign States.</span>  Upon arrival in Moscow, Sergei Fedorovich offered one of the GKChP members his help in collecting information from the field.  This was his participation, but he was not a member of the State Emergency Committee. </p>

    <p>  The failure of the putsch greatly upset Sergei Fedorovich, after him Marshal Akhromeev (relatives later spoke about this in an interview) was awaiting arrest.  On August 25, the lifeless body of the <span>Hero of the Soviet Union was</span> found in the Kremlin office.  He sat, and there was a loop of postal twine on his neck. </p><h2>  Doubts about suicide </h2><p>  The death of Sergei Akhromeev remains a mystery: did he take measures on his own or was there any help from outside?  The first thing that researchers cite in favor of a premeditated murder is a shameful death that the officer could not afford, because Akhromeev is the marshal of the Soviet Union.  The gallows was considered a murder weapon for traitors to the motherland, but he was not. </p><p>  The second doubt in suicide is the mood of Sergei Fedorovich on the eve.  Before his death (murder), he was not oppressed, on the contrary, Akhromeev visited his daughter in the evening of August 23, and the next day, before going to work, he promised his granddaughter a joint walk on his return.  The behavior was calm, and according to the official version, he was already mentally preparing a loop for himself. </p>

    <p>  There is a version that he laid hands on himself, but artificially, that is, he was let down for this.  Most likely, they gave something to eat or drink.  The corpse of the officer lay in the office for 10 hours, no one was interested in the fate of Sergei Fedorovich, except for the family, which did not put the telephone in the hope that the native person would answer at the opposite end. </p><h2>  The mystery of the death of Marshal Akhromeev, funeral </h2><p>  Of the foregoing, it is noteworthy that the Soviet military leader did not deserve to rest at either the Vagankovsky or Novodevichy cemeteries.  The obituary was not published in the newspaper Pravda, and a scanty number of people came to escort him on his last journey. </p>

    <p>  Marshal Akhromeev was buried without honors and without a proper ritual.  Photo of a modest grave you can see above.  This is all that remains of the principled and courageous Sergei Fedorovich. </p><p>  Even when he was already in the land, a non-Christian, non-human act was performed in relation to the late Sergey Fedorovich: the excavation of the grave of Akhromeev and the removal of his uniform with medals.  It is unreasonable to consider this fact as a way of profit, because there are always other ways of making easy money.  But the fact that this Vandal act was committed to hide evidence, seems to many researchers and historians appropriate. </p>
