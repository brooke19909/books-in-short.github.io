  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The situation in the real estate market of Rostov</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Although the proposals of banks for those wishing to buy housing on a mortgage are quite attractive, not all Russians can afford to sign an agreement that will oblige them to make regular payments for eight or more years.  Therefore, announcements about leasing for a long term one-, two- and three-room apartments in Rostov remain in demand. </p><p>  Real estate market analyst A. Chumakov notes that after the financial crisis that erupted in 2008, the cost of square meters is gradually growing in some regions of Russia, while incomes - if not decreasing, then at least remain at the pre-crisis level.  At the same time, the mortgage is considered by many as a real alternative to renting an apartment in a prestigious area.  They say that the size of the mortgage and rental payments is approximately the same, but when buying on credit there is an important advantage - the property is transferred to the person.  therefore <noindex>  <span>buy an apartment in Rostov</span> </noindex>  prefer those who can collect all the necessary documents and prove that in the coming years he is able to pay the debt. </p><p>  However, some citizens cannot count on this scenario, they have to look for where apartments in Rostov are cheaply rented out.  It should be remembered that a one-room apartment can be rented for 15-20 thousand rubles (average price), a two-room apartment - for 20-30 thousand rubles, a three-room apartment - for 25-40 thousand rubles.  For comparison: mortgage payments are 19-22 thousand rubles for 15 years.  “Odnushki” are in the greatest demand both for buying and for renting, according to A. Chumakov in September 2013, about 60% of users were interested in this particular category of real estate.  Demand for “dvushka” was a little more than 22%, for three-room apartments - 6.15%.  A part of Rostovites were interested in communal apartments - almost 7%, and almost 4% were interested in gostinok. </p><p>  The reason that forces Rostov residents to rent an apartment in Rostov, rather than buy, is also considered to be the case, when registering a mortgage, you need to make an initial payment, which amounts to a certain percentage of the total value of the property.  Not everyone can pay a large sum at once, so they have no choice but to choose the optimal rental option. </p><p>  Therefore, a universal solution to the dispute, which method: rent or purchase on a mortgage - to choose, in fact, does not exist.  It depends on many factors, such as financial stability, the need for a certain footage, the desire to get housing as quickly as possible, and so on. </p></div></article>
