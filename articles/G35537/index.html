Tunisia is an Islamic country, but pork is served for tourists.  Holidaymakers really liked the seafood restaurant, they also note the high quality dishes of the Brazilian restaurant in PrimaSol El Mehdi Aqua.  Reviews about the establishments indicate a sufficient amount of meat and fish on the menu.  Chicken with potatoes and rabbit meat are popular.  Youth and children will enjoy the chips.  PrimaSol El Mehdi Aqua restaurants serve visitors at the highest level, fresh vegetables and fruits were always present in the diet.  Hot pizza was constantly being prepared for guests.  Therefore, every lunch and dinner, she collected huge lines of people who wanted to feast, which caused some inconvenience.  Breakfast, as tourists noted, is not the best, consisting of unappetizing hot snacks and yoghurts.  Tea was also offered not the highest quality. </p><p>  The resort is ideal for couples with children.  At the same time, young people felt obvious discomfort, as the hotel is located away from party places with night clubs and bars.  But not everyone wants to get a taxi to another city.  Young people have to go to bed at 10 pm.  Mahdia is a very traditional beautiful area of ‚Äã‚ÄãTunisia, but it does not at all have a nightlife. </p><p>  The selection of alcoholic drinks in bars and restaurants is a bit limited.  The menu includes coffee, water, juices, local beer or wine.  There is also an assortment of strong alcohol.  In the bar or at the reception, there is always unlimited water with or without gas.  All bar staff are polite, speak several languages, so there are no communication problems. </p><p>  All rooms have a sea view.  The rooms have good sound insulation thanks to the concrete walls.  The cleanliness of the rooms is maintained at a decent level.  The hotel is not new, the furniture is outdated, so you should not expect something special.  The staff is diligent, the maids in the rooms maintain perfect order. </p><p>  Most of the hotel guests are from Germany.  The French are also resting.  In summer, it is very popular among Italians, Swiss and Russians. </p><p>  From late March to mid-April the sea temperature is about 19 degrees, so most tourists rested near the pools.  The beach itself is white with clean sand.  Children enjoy playing on the beach.  In summer, the sea is calm and warm.  The air temperature in the summer months reaches 35-40 degrees Celsius every day.  There are practically no cloudy days; the sun is constantly shining. </p><p>  Pools.  Like in the sea, the water in the outdoor pools in the spring is a little cool, since it is not hot in April yet.  Tourists like the quality work of the rescue service staff.  In cool weather there is the opportunity to swim in the hotel's indoor pool. </p>
