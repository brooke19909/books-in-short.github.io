It is the art of making graceful paper figures by folding, folding, and unfolding a regular sheet of paper. </p><p>  This hobby appeared a very long time ago, in those days when it was customary in Japan to fold official documents in an original way.  But in the Edo era (from 1603 to 1867), origami became very popular.  According to art critics, it was during that period that the mastery of folding origami was brought almost to perfection.  The secrets of this art are transmitted in families from one generation to another.  Many adult Japanese people remember their childhood with great warmth, they watched with bated breath as their mother showed how to make an origami crane and other delightful toys. </p><p>  And today, origami techniques are widely used in industrial design and in architecture.  Medicine also uses them as a reliable way for the rehabilitation exercises of the elderly and the disabled. </p><p>  Types of Origami </p><p>  The art of origami, depending on the properties of the resulting figures, can be of two types: </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Classic </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Copyright </p><p>  Classical origami is the manufacture of all kinds of paper figures of animals, cranes, frogs, insects, plants, bombs or boats. </p><p>  Copyright origami is performed in a technique that differs from traditional techniques that have come down from the depths of centuries.  These are, as a rule, figures of large dinosaurs, bizarre insects and other original intricate forms. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How to learn to make origami </p><p>  In order to master the techniques of classical origami, you need only accuracy and observation. </p><p>  Any paper is suitable for work - be it a newspaper, wrapping paper, advertising materials.  You can select quality, sizes and its color at your discretion.  But if you are planning to make something really unique, then you should pay more attention to choosing the tone and quality of the paper.  There is a special Japanese paper for this work - Washi, it is handmade, made according to old technologies. </p><p>  For work, in most cases, square-shaped paper is used.  To check this, fold the sheet by aligning the opposite corners.  The sides should match in length. </p><p>  How to make an origami crane </p><p>  Imagine an origami crane made of one piece of paper.  Its proudly spread wings, a long thin neck and an elegant head with a characteristic beak.  Such a cute origami crane is obtained from a square-shaped leaf.  Twelve simple neat additions - and the origami crane is ready. </p><p>  Studying according to the scheme, be prepared that the origami crane may not work out right away.  In this matter, perseverance and perseverance solve a lot.  If you have the opportunity to meet an origami connoisseur, try not to miss the opportunity to learn from him the techniques of this fine art. </p><p>  Crane manufacturing sequence: </p><p>  1. Fold the square diagonally; </p><p>  2. Bend the workpiece in half "valley"; </p><p>  3. To open the "mountain" pocket and flatten it; </p><p>  4. Flip; </p><p>  5. Scroll to the right the top layer of the paper sheet; </p><p>  6. Open and flatten the next pocket; </p><p>  7. Fold the sides of the "valley"; </p><p>  8. Expand; </p><p>  9.
