    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The nearest international airport is in Phuket - it is about 40 km from the hotel.  Flights depart here from so many cities in Russia, so that every tourist can choose the most convenient flight option.  As for the way from the airport to the hotel, you can agree in advance with the hotel on the transfer or take a taxi.  If you plan to use the second option, it is better to have local currency with you, since the exchange rate for taxi drivers is very unprofitable.  Travel time from the airport to the hotel is approximately 40 minutes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Type of hotel and its location </h2><p>  "City" - this type belongs to Baramee Hip Hotel 3 *.  ‚ÄúHip Hotel 3 * Bar‚Äù is surrounded on all sides by various entertainment venues, <span>cafes, restaurants,</span> clubs, bars, spa salons, which is especially liked by young people who want to enjoy all the pleasures of relaxation in Thailand.

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  As already mentioned a little above, Baramee Hip Hotel 3 * is a city, not a beach hotel.  Accordingly, the sea is not so close as many vacationers would like.  The beach is approximately 1 km from the hotel.  It will take 15-20 minutes on foot.  Although the road is never boring, because there are many entertainment venues, cafes, a market and much more that can diversify this walk. </p><p>  If you don‚Äôt feel like going to the beach, then hotel residents can take a bus that regularly runs flights from the hotel to the sea.  The schedule can be obtained at the reception.  However, it should be borne in mind that you need to book a flight in advance, because the bus carries passengers from several hotels and there may not be seats for the desired time. </p><p>  As for Patong beach itself, it is quite dirty, like water in the sea.  Therefore, many vacationers Baramee Hip Hotel 3 * (Phuket) choose Surin and Paradise for their time, despite the fact that these places are a little further. </p>
