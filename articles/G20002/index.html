    <h2></h2><h2>  What are the sleeves </h2><p>  The simplest classification of a knitted sleeve is: simple and set-in.  They differ from each other, primarily in shape.  The first has the shape of a trapezoid, and the second is rounded on top.  In this regard, knitting a set-in sleeve is a little more difficult.  Usually the sleeves are knitted from the bottom, but there are other options.  For example, knitting sleeves on top with knitting needles can hardly be called a complex process, especially when it comes to a simple trapezoidal shape.  Much less often, the sleeve is knitted on the side.  This is not always convenient if the sleeve is long.  In addition, it is difficult to maintain the length, because the thread can stretch and contract during the knitting process.  In the general scheme, the sleeve is knitted quite simply. </p><ol><li>  First comes the gum about 10 rows. </li><li>  After that, the main pattern and the smooth addition of loops. </li><li>  In the case of a simple sleeve, the loops are closed at the same time, and then it is sewn to the product. </li></ol><p>  If you knit a set-in sleeve, then the reduction of the loops will be different.  First you make a sharp decrease in three loops on both sides, then two more loops in the next row.  Then a smoother decrease, forming a semicircular shape of the top.  The middle loops also close simultaneously.  This sleeve is described in more detail for each specific model.  Crochet sleeves is done in a similar way.  Depending on its design as a whole, a sleeve can be called a raglan, a ‚Äúflashlight‚Äù, it can be a bat-shaped sleeve or have a length of three quarters and so on.  Let's start with the most common form - raglan. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Knit a simple raglan sleeve </h2><p>  This sleeve is often used in men's sweaters and sports models.  In such models, movements are not constrained, but it looks very attractive.  The principle of its knitting is simple: you make uniform decreases at the end of the sleeve on both sides, which form a kind of isosceles triangle.  All remaining loops close simultaneously when the neckline is reached.  It should be noted that the reduction is done on the back and front.  You need to reduce one loop in every second row.  Both sleeves fit symmetrically.  As a result, there will be very few loops at the very top, about five to six cm. They can be closed simultaneously or in two steps.  Such a sleeve can also be knitted from above.  This is done easily.  Just when you tie the front and back to the sleeve (and you can do this on circular knitting needles, so there will be no seams at all), leave five loops on the pins.  Of these, you will make <span>raglan.</span>  <span>Knitting the</span> sleeve on top with knitting needles is no different, only the loops do not decrease, but, on the contrary, are added first, and then their number gradually decreases to the base of the hand. </p>

    <h2></h2><h2>  Set-in sleeve on knitting needles </h2><p>  Such a sleeve looks more organic and is used most often, so it will be useful to find out how it fits.  Before dusk, everything is simple, you need to evenly add loops throughout the entire knitting.  Their frequency depends on the length of the sleeve and your size.  Difficulties begin when the sleeve is knitted out.  In this case, the number of loops of half of the sleeve is conditionally divided into three segments.  They can even be noted with colored thread.  Similarly done on the other hand.  These marks are needed in order to make the ridge smooth and fit seamlessly into the finished model.  The loops from the first group decrease sharply: first 4, then 3, and then 2, until everything ends.  Next is a smooth decrease in one loop in each row.  And in the third part, turn down three loops until all the loops end.  This is a general outline of how a sleeve fits. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Bat-like sleeves </h2><p>  In fact, <span>knitting with the needles</span> of a <span>‚Äúbat‚Äù</span> sleeve is good, first of all, in that the finished sleeves will not need to be sewn on to the sweater then, and you cannot miscalculate with the size.  Just when you <span>knit a sweater</span> and the moment comes to start the sleeve, you add a lot of loops in several steps, so that is enough for a large sleeve.  Such sleeves are then tied with an elastic band to get the desired length.  In general, those who like knitting, knitting sleeves of this format will master easily. </p><h2>  Short sleeve knitting </h2><p>  Such a sleeve can be knitted in one of the methods described above, or it can be one-piece.  Due to its small size, it will successfully look in the finished model.  The principle of knitting is very simple: the back and front expand by the desired number of loops at the time of transition to the sleeves.  Knitting a short sleeve with knitting needles differs from a ‚Äúbat‚Äù in that the transition is carried out abruptly, rather than smoothly.  The sleeve seems to be at an angle of 90 degrees to the main knitting. </p>

    <h2>  The letter "P" </h2><p>  Another version of the jacket, in which there is not quite an ordinary sleeve.  Imagine a jacket in which there is a sleeve, and all shoulders are open.  The back and front fit evenly or with tucks to the level of the middle of the chest.  Now we start <span>knitting sweaters.</span>  Sleeves are simply long knitted stripes resembling a scarf in shape.  Only knitting is better on circular knitting needles to avoid an extra seam.  Then these strips are sewn to the jacket in front and behind, and the sleeves remain free.  Of course, they are not lying on their shoulders, but lowered.  In general, the entire jacket resembles the letter "P".  Just do not forget to tie the sleeves with a dense elastic band so that the jacket better holds its shape. </p><h2>  Crochet </h2><p>  If you do not like <span>knitting, knitting</span> sleeves is even easier to master with a hook.  Some masters completely prefer this tool.  There are many reasons for this, but what are the sleeves in this case?  Exactly the same as already described above.  Only the additions look even simpler: you either double-knit the same loop, or dial a chain of air loops in the amount required.  To reduce loops, you need to knit two or three loops at the same time.  Difficulties can arise only in openwork patterns.  Here you need to make sure that the pattern does not go astray, you need to knit according to the drawing, and not according to the pattern.  Crocheted sleeves can be both set-in and raglan.  The sleeves of the bat are much less likely to fit in this way. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting short sleeves" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13524/347466.jpg?1393946033882" width="333"></div>  More often it is used only in mesh models.  Such wraps should be very loose, so this sleeve will fit perfectly.  At the same time, crocheted sleeves are crocheted in the form of a small accordion or wings.  This can‚Äôt be done on the knitting needles.  The rest of the crochet sleeves is no different.

    <h2></h2><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Here are not all ways of how sleeves fit.  These are the basic principles.  There are private moments, but you can read about them in the description of each specific model.  The sleeve can be sewn with a regular needle with a wide eye and thread, or it can be crocheted, but the seam in this case will be tougher, although more reliable.  To make the seams softer, they can be steamed with an iron.  But do not overdo it, otherwise the thing will be deformed and stretched.  Even if this is not indicated in your model, it is better to start any sleeve with an elastic band, even a short one.  This tip does not apply to crocheting.  Start boldly knitting, knitting sleeves is not as difficult as it might seem, so do not leave your creations unfinished.  After all, you can always bandage a sleeve and change its shape.  It is not so long and certainly not difficult. </p>
