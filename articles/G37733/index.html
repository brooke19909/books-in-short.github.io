In particular, tourists who have already been here like the boarding house area - large, beautiful and calm.  Vacationers and the local dining room are praised.  The choice of dishes is not very wide, but everything is fresh and very tasty. </p><p>  It is believed that you can relax in Sheksna with great comfort.  The disadvantages of this pension include only fairly high prices for additional services and the lack of a stable Internet (Wi-Fi catches only on the beach).  But this is a common misfortune of many Black Sea villages. </p>
