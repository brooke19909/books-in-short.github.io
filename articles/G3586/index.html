    <h2>  The principle of operation of the doubler </h2><p>  The principle of operation of the doubler is based on voltage conversion.  For this, the device has a whole chain of capacitors.  They differ in pole conductivity and capacitance.  The diodes in this case are mounted on contactors.  When voltage is applied to the doubler, the thyristor is switched on.  The specified element is able to work at certain frequencies. </p><p>  In this case, much depends on the manufacturer of the modification.  Some models use a lining that acts as an insulator.  <span>DC</span> models pass through a capacitor circuit.  The rectification takes place on the module, which is an integral element of the diode.  At high output voltages, pulsed interference often occurs.  Also, the weaknesses of the voltage gain can be attributed to the disadvantages of doublers.  Transformers do not have such problems. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Low ripple models </h2><p>  The low ripple voltage doubler is suitable for controllers and is often installed on comparators.  Many models operate at low conductivity.  Stabilizers are used with diode-based expanders. </p><p>  You can make a voltage doubler with two capacitors.  Directly, the diode is fixed on the transceiver.  If we talk about indicators, then the maximum overload for models is about 15 V. Moreover, the deviation coefficient can reach 10%. </p><h2>  High ripple devices </h2><p>  A <span>high</span> ripple <span>voltage</span> doubler <span>is</span> used in AC power.  Quite often, devices can be found in household appliances.  These modifications are distinguished by good conductivity, since they use several pairs of capacitors.  Installed models through the thyristor.  Many modifications are made with a lining and have good security.  The main disadvantage is the high threshold sensitivity.  Additionally, you should pay attention to the diodes.  On some models, they are used without an expander.  A 12-volt DC voltage doubler operates at a frequency of 30 Hz. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Features of low-frequency models </h2><p>  Low frequency doublers are installed on comparators of low power.  If we consider a simple voltage doubler, then he uses three capacitors.  The diode in this case is mounted on a linear resistor.  Conductivity in devices can increase quite a lot.  In this case, the frequency is maintained by the stabilizer.  Many models have several insulators.  In this case, the connection of the doubler can occur through the transceiver.  The most common models are considered to be two triodes. </p><h2>  High frequency devices </h2><p>  A high-frequency voltage doubler is assembled on the basis of an adjustable capacitor.  The models use two diodes.  Their conductivity is approximately 55 microns.  It is also worth noting that in doublers of this type a rather high sensitivity.  Some modifications are assembled with capacitive stabilizers.  Models are well suited for comparators.  However, they are not used in lamps.  The problem in this case is the overheating of the capacitors.  It is also worth noting that the modifications are not able to work with pulsed interference. </p>

Many modifications are made with several capacitors, in which the capacitance is not more than 50 pF.  It is also worth noting that models with several diodes are produced.  If we consider a conventional DC voltage doubler, then the input conductivity is on average 5 microns.  The contacts in the devices are made of copper.
