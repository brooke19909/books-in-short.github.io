There it is a massive masquerade that takes place on the streets of the city.  We have the idea to celebrate the Day of All Saints fell in love with many, but has not yet gained such widespread distribution.  In most cases, young people throw theme parties and dress up in interesting and scary Halloween costumes.  And the most important thing on such a holiday is to match the image as much as possible.  Any suit can be sewn on its own, because this option will not only be original, but will also save money. </p><h2>  Costume Ideas </h2><p>  Any image should be associated with evil spirits.  It is better for princesses and fairies to visit another holiday.  On a day when dark forces awaken and leave their shrines, it is best to follow this theme.  Scary Halloween costumes can display the following characters: vampire, devil, corpse, ghost, zombies and of course the witch. </p><p>  An integral symbol of Halloween is a pumpkin.  It can be of any shape and size.  Holes for the mouth and eyes are cut in the vegetable, the middle is completely removed, and a candle is placed instead.  The costume of this pumpkin can also be original. </p><p>  Girls are happy to dress up as a vampire, a dead nurse, or a bloodied princess.  The couple can pay attention to the pirate and his faithful companion. </p><p>  Among the general fun, there are also positive characters: Van Helsing, Harry Potter and his friends, Jack Sparrow, Terminator, Transformers, Spider-Man and other superheroes, Zorro. </p><p>  But the witch is the most popular way for adult girls, women and little girls.

But modern fairy tales and films dictate their fashion about how the witch should look.  It is from cinematic tapes that you can draw ideas.  This will help you figure out how to make a witch costume for Halloween and what details to pay attention to.  Here are some examples of the most popular images. </p><p>  <em>Witch from old tales</em> </p><p>  Such an old woman appears to us as Baba Yaga on a broomstick and in a mortar.  She has gray hair, a sly look and warts on her face.  If you are not afraid that children will be afraid of such an image, then feel free to experiment.  In clothes, take a look at your grandmother's old castoffs: a long skirt, an apron, a shirt and a vest on top.  Cover <span>with a mantle with a hood.</span> </p><p>  <em>Sorceress from the forest</em> </p><p>  She can be good or bad.  Add to your image natural elements: leaves, berries.  Let them be present on a hat or dress.  In the color scheme adhere to green-yellow shades.  The main outfit can be dark green or brown, the cape is made of light air materials.  The little hat will look original.  Pay special attention to eyes and makeup, whiten your skin and add green or blue shades. </p><p>  <em>Charming Gothic</em> </p><p>  Such a sorceress never smiles and is very strict.  Her dress and all other elements are exclusively black.  Her lips are red-red, and a terrifying depth lurks in her eyes.  All accessories are spiders, cobwebs, black cats, crosses.  For this look, choose a long <span>black dress on the floor.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <em>Fashionable witch</em> </p><p>  This is the image of a cheerful perky witch.  She is laid-back and light, sexy and very alluring.  For a fashionable witch, a short puffy dress or skirt is suitable.  Do not be limited in color: it can be a combination of black and pink, purple, lime or green.  Such a witch may even have a <span>wand</span> instead of a broom <span>.</span>  The most daring way to experiment. </p><p>  <em>The Inaccessible Queen</em> </p><p>  Imagine the Snow Queen.  She is strict, mysterious and impregnable.  She has a gorgeous dress and a high collar.  She may not have a hat, but a cold look is required.  When choosing a dress, pay attention to the fluffy long skirt, decorated with many pleats.  Be sure to throw on the shoulders an elegant mantle. </p><h2>  Witch Costume Components </h2><p>  Beautiful evil sorceresses from fairy tales always attracted with their mystery.  Remember tighter Maleficent.  Her one look was bewitching.  A beautiful bright costume with a black cape and a long fluffy skirt on the floor is such an unusual outfit you can easily buy in the store, but making a witch costume for Halloween with your own hands is very simple.  Consider the main components of any such outfit: </p><ul><li>  hat; </li><li>  corset; </li><li>  skirt; </li><li>  cape. </li></ul><p>  Corset and skirt can be combined in a single dress.  But without special skills in cutting and sewing, you can separate these elements and get no less amazing result.  Consider how to make a witch costume at home in stages. </p><h2>  Hat </h2>

    <p>  What does a witch's hat look like?  That's right, it is acute-angled with wide margins.  If your house does not have a suitable one, then it can be easily carved and made.  What is needed for this: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  cardboard of white and brown color; </li><li>  ribbons or any other decorations on the hat (you can make spiders from black paper); </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  glue; </li><li>  needle with thread. </li></ul><p>  A hat instead of a paper one can be made into a fabric one.  For this purpose, felt is ideal.  It does not roll in, keeps its shape well and is easy to use.  In addition, various decorations are better attached to such a fabric. </p><h2>  Hat Manufacturing Instructions </h2>

    <ol><li>  The first step is to cut a circle from a white cardboard with a hole in the middle.  The diameter of the hole should be equal to the circumference of the head. </li><li>  Then you need to transfer the size of the circle to the brown cardboard.  Contours are drawn with a pencil, but the hole is not completely cut out.  Instead, triangular cuts are made in it along the entire diameter and bent.  They will become the basis for fixing the cone. </li><li>  The cone is made like this.  Brown cardboard must be folded like a bag for seeds.  The bottom edge must be aligned and cut to the same length.  The diameter of the base of the cone should be equal to the inner circumference of the hat fields. </li><li>  Then you need to put the cone on the triangles and glue it well. </li><li>  After that, decorate the hat with a ribbon, securing it with a needle and thread.  As decoration can be any other elements: stars, strasses, spiders made of fabric. </li></ol><p>  The hat can be of any size.  Little princesses are happy to wear a neat hat on a hair clip or rim.  If you don‚Äôt want to wear a bulky accessory, you can experiment with other <span>jewelry on your head.</span>  For example, a bat headband will do. </p><p>  Find a stencil on the Internet or draw a bat silhouette yourself.  Transfer it to black cardboard and cut it out.  Try to make the mice different in size so that the composition looks more lively.  Bend each blank in half, so you get the impression of a fluttering mouse.  In the center, make two holes through which to fix the wire.  Fasten the other end of the rod to the rim.  Put it on your head and amaze everyone with how wonderful you managed to sew a witch costume. </p><h2>  Corset </h2><p>  In order to sew the simplest version of clothing, a witch costume pattern is not needed.  Any black blouse, T-shirt or body can serve as the top for the dress. </p>

    <p>  In the above version, a long black floor-length dress is used as the main element.  Surely this is in the wardrobe of any lady.  If you are not sure if the black color suits you, give preference to other shades, such as purple or gray.  In general, going to Halloween, do not think about which color scheme should dominate.  Only your imagination should work here. </p><p>  For the authenticity of the image, decorate your top with some symbolic elements: rhinestones, stars, beads.  Place a crow or a black cat on your shoulder. </p><h2>  Skirt </h2><p>  Witch costume (adult) involves the use of a long skirt on the floor.  If you don‚Äôt have one, borrow from your grandmother or a relative you know.  You can also buy it, but you‚Äôre unlikely to ever wear it again. </p><p>  There are a lot of design options for a skirt.  In order for the witch's Halloween costume, created with his own hands, to be original, do not be afraid to show imagination.  If you don‚Äôt have a long skirt, take a short one.  Or maybe you have a dress in general, then it‚Äôs also good.  From a transparent fabric of black color, cut a rectangle half the length, and in width it should be twice as large as the circumference of your hips.  Make folds with your hands, fix them with a needle and thread.  Stretch a long ribbon and tie it around your belt.  The skirt is ready! </p><h2>  Halloween children's full skirt </h2><p>  Some of our babies also want to wear a witch costume.  The children's version is practically no different from the adult.  All the same elements, the same materials.  Consider how to make a fluffy skirt for the holiday, using a specific example. </p>

    <p>  First of all, the waist circumference is measured.  It should be noted that such a skirt is suitable for both an adult and a child.  The time for its manufacture is half an hour. </p><p>  Next, cut strips from the tape.  You need to calculate the length like this.  First, determine the desired length of the skirt.  Suppose for a child it will be 50 cm. Multiply this figure by two and add 2 cm. Total - 102 cm. Cut a lot of such strips. </p><p>  Begin to fasten strips on elastic bands, following the scheme presented in a photo below. </p>

    <p>  Fold the tape in half and thread through the elastic.  Alternating colors, fasten all the tapes.  You will see how they puff.  That is why for such purposes, dense materials are best suited: organza or tulle. </p><p>  Everything, the skirt is ready! </p><h2>  Cloak </h2><p>  A witch costume for Halloween, created with his own hands, will be incomplete without a cape or cloak.  The easiest option is to borrow at any nearby costume rental.  But we are doing an original image.  So, our dear lady will wear a witch costume from improvised materials. </p><p>  What are we looking for?  For a cloak or cloak, we will need any dark material available in the house.  It can be a scarf, a husband‚Äôs t-shirt, an old cloak, anything.  Perhaps you will find a beautiful openwork shawl of dark color.  Then the issue of the cape is resolved.  You will try on the image of a vintage dark seductress. </p>

    <p>  Fold the material in half and then in half as shown.  Begin to make a pattern from the edge where the folds are.  Measure the girth of the head.  Divide the resulting number by 2. This length plus 2 cm set aside from the edge of the fabric and put a mark.  From the second corner, do the second.  Connect the dots in a semicircle. </p><p>  In the horizontal direction from the beginning of the bent edge, set aside the length of the cape.  The length of the arms will be approximately 70 cm in one direction.  Measure from the neckline point.  Cut a semicircle.  You should get a pattern like a sun skirt. </p><p>  Any mantle will have a similar shape.  Find on the Internet a pattern of an ordinary sun skirt, replace the waist with a neckline, and the mantle is ready.  If necessary, you can sew a hood.  To do this, cut out two semicircular parts, sew in a straight line and attach in the neck from the back. </p><p>  We proceed to the formation of the web for our example. </p>

    <p>  With chalk, draw vertical strips from the neck down to the fabric.  This will help maintain proportions.  Figured out the bottom.  In the horizontal direction, draw each segment of the cobweb.  Use sharp scissors or a clerical knife to cut out the marked holes. </p><p>  If the fabric rolls, twist the edges.  For any mantle, try to use light and thin fabrics that will not burden the image.  Halloween witch costume and its decorative element are ready! </p><h2>  Optional accessories </h2>

    <p>  How to make a witch costume for Halloween, we figured out.  The hat is ready, the skirt is in place, the top is picked up.  There is even a cloak.  But that is not all.  We need additional accessories to complete the look.  What applies to these elements? </p><ol><li>  Tights.  If the event is held indoors, then, naturally, you need to wear thin ones.  Under a short skirt, it is better to wear black tights with a pattern.  Choose an original ornament or mesh.  For an event taking place on the street, it is better to choose a warmer option, still the end of October.  Stop your choice on striped leggings. </li><li>  Footwear.  It can be shoes or boots, it doesn‚Äôt matter at all.  Choose a platform that makes it convenient for you to dance and have fun until the morning. </li><li>  Earrings.  Bright eye-catching jewelry is what you need.  Halloween is that holiday where everything cannot be too much.  Feel free to choose earrings with large stones, in the form of a cobweb or black cat. </li><li>  Rings, brooches, necklaces.  Everything should be thematically stylized.  Do not be too lazy to go shopping and pick up accessories for the witch costume. </li><li>  Handbag.  The best, of course, will look like a small classic clutch.  Brave girls can successfully replace it with a bowler hat.  By analogy with a <span>hat, a bowler hat</span> can be made independently from cardboard and sheathed with a dark cloth.  A little tip: you should not store a mobile or wallet in it. </li><li>  Broom.  Well, what a witch without a broom?  It can be small, in the form of a brooch, or large, one that can be held in your hand.  A broom must be present! </li></ol><h2>  How to make a broom </h2><p>  If you live in a region where there is still no snow at the end of October, then you are very lucky.  Go to the nearest park and pick up a lot of small twigs.  Gather them in a bunch, attach a thicker long stick to them and you're done! </p><p>  Instead of branches, you can use dry grass.  It will also look no worse, and most importantly, it is so safer. </p>

    <p>  You can make a small broom.  She decorates an outfit or a festive table.  For needlework you will need: bamboo skewer, plaits, thin threads, scissors. </p><p>  Cut the flagella with a length of at least 7 cm. Make a small bundle, put a skewer into it and tighten on one side with a thin thread.  Turn out the threads and pull the thread again at the base.  The broom is ready. </p><p>  Making a Halloween witch costume with your own hands is very simple.  If you do not have skills or talent in sewing, use simple materials, ready-made skirts and t-shirts.  After all, the most important thing in preparing the image is to properly decorate things and apply makeup.  Do not forget about the basic elements of the image of any witch: hat, mantle and broom. </p>
