Despite the four stars that are assigned to him according to the hotel classification system, he offers guests chic conditions and a lot of entertainment.  The bay in which it is located is slightly inferior to Sharm el-Sheikh in the number and beauty of the underwater fauna - because it also boasts almost untouched coral reefs.  Here is a very green, beautiful and well-groomed area, professional and funny animation, helpful attentive staff.  You can safely go here to both young people who want to have a good time, and married couples with children who want peace and comfort.  This hotel has French management and real Parisian charm with an Egyptian touch.  Maybe that's why Club Azur Resort is becoming increasingly popular with guests from all over the world, including from Russia.  This can be proved by the reviews they left about vacations in this hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Club azur resort" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1065865.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Makadi District </h2><p>  This is the resort region of Hurghada with a great future.  It actually arose from scratch, because it was built specifically for vacationers.  And in the near future it will turn into an independent administrative village.  Even its center - Madinat Makadi - is not an old city, like, for example, the center of Hurghada, but the territory of the Sol I Mar, Jazz and Iberotel hotels.  They are built in a single Moroccan style, and look like the scenery from the film about oriental tales.  Resorts here are mainly with foreign management - French, German and Italian.  Makadi Bay is removed from all the noisy establishments and entertainments.  Its coral reefs are very good and attract tourists from other areas of Hurghada.  The hotels here are excellent, with European service.  They stand on deserted shores, and all infrastructure is concentrated on their territory.  There are no bars, discos, or shops around, although markets are already forming near some hotels.  So, for example, the situation is with the Club Azur Resort hotel (Makadi).  Picturesque surroundings, desert and mountains, romantic sunrises and sunsets and landscape not yet spoiled by man are the hallmark of these places.  Russian tourists have only recently discovered this Egyptian zest.  Comfortable hotels and nature in all its originality are the perfect combination for a family vacation or a romantic pastime.  The beaches in Makadi are long, and despite the fact that they belong to hotels, you can walk along the coast for a long time. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Almost all world hotel chains have opened their branches here.  The sea and corals are ‚Äúliving‚Äù here, so divers are eager to get into Makadi.  In this regard, the resort has opened several professional diving centers.  Rather wealthy people settle here, or at least with incomes somewhat above average. </p><h2>  How to get there and what's interesting is located nearby </h2><p>  Hotel Club Azur Resort, as already mentioned above, is located in the popular bay of Makadi Bay among divers, twenty-five kilometers from the airport.  Almost as much drive from here to the center of Hurghada.  Transfer from the airport - about forty minutes.  The hotel is part of the huge Azurov hotel complex.  Nearby is the Royal, and across the road is the Grand.  The hotels "Stella" and "Harmony" are adjacent to this complex, on the beaches of which the guests of "Azura" are allowed without problems.  Nearby is a market where you can buy cheap souvenirs and fruits.  A quarter of an hour walk from the hotel is Makadi center with a pedestrian zone and a disco, bars and a shopping gallery.  Guests of the Club Azur Resort (Hurghada) can easily get here to spend the evening if they get bored with animation, or want to see the surroundings.  Makadi does not have its own promenade, characteristic of other Egyptian resorts, and this is the only place for walking. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Club Azur Resort Hotel consists of a stylish park with tropical trees, palm trees, flowers, walking paths, and several two- and three-story buildings.  Its architecture - the so-called <span>colonial style</span> - is conducive to coziness and comfort.  An amphitheater is intended for holding shows or concerts.  Since the hotel is a club hotel (that is, it has the concept of a ‚Äúmini-town‚Äù), there is its own shopping gallery where tourists get all kinds of little things for the beach, souvenirs, and even jewelry.  The hotel has a large conference room.  There are many toilets on site, even with hygienic showers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Club azur resort" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1065869.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  There is a professional water center on the beach.  For extra money you ride a banana, water skiing, carry fishing.  A rental mask for snorkeling is free.  Windsurfing, kayaking and a catamaran as a test for thirty minutes are given free of charge for each room.  If you like, further rental for a fee.  The hotel Club Azur Resort (Egypt) has two pools.  One of them is intended for children, and it is heated in winter.  The second, for adults, is huge, stretching almost across the entire territory.  Beautifully decorated with hydromassage and artificial waterfalls.  It is literally a few steps inland, and if someone doesn‚Äôt have enough sunbeds by the sea, you can sunbathe by the pool - this is very close.  Therefore, many tourists prefer to spend time on green lawns.  Beach towels give out large and fluffy. </p><h2>  Where to go and what to see </h2><p>  A characteristic of Makadi is the lack of public transport that would go in the area.  Tourists have to move between hotels on foot.  Some resorts provide especially shuttle basses to get to the center of Hurghada, but this is usually expensive.  Therefore, the most popular form of transport is a taxi or hitchhiking.  This lesson is not very tiring, because any car for ten dollars for the whole company will drive anywhere voting tourists.  In the Club Azur Resort 4 * hotel (Egypt), you can book excursions.  Of the not very distant tourists prefer to sail on the island of Giftun and dive with a mask, or even go fishing.  Or visit the Bedouin village in the desert on ATVs, meet the sunset in the mountains and return home under the stars.  From long journeys advise a trip to Cairo.  Although tiring, it is very informative.  Closer to Makadi are attractions such as the monasteries of St.  Anthony and St.  Paul, as well as the luxurious Luxor with its temples and tomb.  If you live in hotels in other areas of Hurghada, then this trip stretches for two days.  But the journey from Makadi lasts no more than twenty-four hours. </p><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  But what to bring home to those who visited the Club Azur Resort?  Reviews of tourists indicate that the most popular among holidaymakers in Makadi are products made of local gold or silver.  Jewelry shops can be found both in the hotel and in the resort center, where there is a pedestrian zone.  Egyptian medicinal and perfume oils are also purchased here.  Hookahs and tobacco for them ‚Äî cherry, apple, and other smells ‚Äî are always popular with tourists.  The largest and most expensive with accessories cost no more than thirty dollars.  When traveling to Luxor, vacationers usually buy different crafts made of stone, vases and statuettes of the gods.  True, in Makadi all this will cost significantly more than in the same Hurghada.  Therefore, even if you take a taxi and spend half an hour traveling to the bazaar, you will save much more on buying souvenirs.  In Hurghada, there are many more, and it is better to bargain.  But it is up to you to choose. </p><h2>  Club Azur Resort 4 * - reviews </h2><p>  In their responses, tourists write that the hotel made a very good impression on them, and they are pleased with their stay here.  The staff is not only working, but very attentive and cordial in communication.  No rudeness, the attitude towards everyone is beautiful.  Animators are beyond praise, they work day and night, and constantly involve guests in their fun undertakings.  Spacious, comfortable and clean rooms.  Fine, varied and decent food.  According to the all-inclusive system, more options are provided here than in the fives.  Tipping is not required, alcohol is not diluted.  Shop assistants are unobtrusive.  Unlike the neighboring Azurov, the territory of the Club is very compact, no need to go far anywhere.  Tours at Club Azur Resort attract people who prefer quiet meditation at sea, diving and water sports, as well as European-level service, to noise and hustle. </p>
