Behind the hot battles for medals, exciting competitions, colorful closure ... But the motto of the Olympic Games is not forgotten.  The words <span>"Faster, Higher, Stronger!"</span>  for athletes around the world mean the desire for victory and new records.  Where did this motto come from? </p><h2>  History of Olympic Games </h2><p>  Briefly dwell on how the Olympic Games appeared.  They come from ancient Greece, where famous sports were organized.  On the Peloponnese peninsula, in the ancient sanctuary of Olympia, running competitions were held, races on quadrigs, i.e. light chariots, in which four horses were harnessed.  Subsequently, they ceased. </p><p>  They were resumed in the VIII century BC.  e.  The games were held every 4 years, and at this time a sacred truce was established.  The sports were <span>long jump,</span> running, wrestling, pankration, fist fights, chariot races, javelin and discus throwing, archery.  The winner was crowned with an olive wreath.  In his homeland, general admiration and respect awaited him. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="motto of the olympic games" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23410/575063.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In 394, the Olympic Games as pagan were banned by Emperor Theodosius, who professed Christianity.  They were forgotten for a long time. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Modern Olympic Games </h2><p>  The world owes its revival of the Olympic Games primarily to Pierre de Coubertin.  In 1894, he convened the first meeting of an organization called the International Olympic Committee, at which he proposed to make the competitions traditional, following the model of ancient Greek competitions.  The first games were planned to be held in Paris in 1900, but, at the suggestion of the Greek poet Demetrius Vikelas, they decided that they would be held earlier in Athens.  This was to symbolize the connection between the ancient and modern Olympic Games. </p><p>  April 6, 1896 was the beginning of the first Games of our time.  King of Greece George I announced the start of the Olympics, then the Olympic anthem was performed.  And since then the first traditions have appeared.  One is that the Games are opened by the ruler of the country that hosts the Olympics.  The second is the singing of the Olympic anthem during the opening of the Games.  And the third - the Olympics once every 4 years, and in different places.  This was the decision of the IOC in response to a proposal by Greece to always host the Games. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="history of the olympics briefly" class="if" height="280" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23410/573024.jpg" width="408"></div>

    <p>  In 1924, the first winter Olympics was held in the French city of Chamonix. </p><h2>  The advent of the Olympic motto </h2><p>  We all know very well how the motto of the Olympic Games sounds.  The words ‚ÄúFaster, Higher, Stronger‚Äù belong to Coubertin's friend, priest Henri Didon.  It was with this expression that he opened sports competitions in the college in which he worked.  In Latin, the expression sounds like "Citius, Altius, Fortius."  Coubertin liked this slogan so much that he proposed it as the Olympic motto back in 1894, at the first meeting of the newly created IOC.  Then the IOC Bulletin came out, in the title of which was now the familiar motto of the Olympic Games. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what does the olympic motto sound like" class="if" height="215" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23410/575139.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Officially, it was introduced only in 1924 at the Olympics in Paris. </p><p>  The motto of the Paralympic Games is ‚ÄúSpirit on motion‚Äù.  This expression symbolizes the <span>strength of mind of</span> athletes with disabilities who defeated a physical illness and achieve high victories. </p><h2>  "The important thing is not to win but to take part" </h2><p>  This expression is the unofficial motto of the Olympic Games.  Many believe that these words were said by Coubertin, but this is an erroneous opinion. </p><p>  The appearance of the motto is associated with the Italian marathon runner Dorando Pietri.  In 1908, at the Games in London, he was disqualified and deprived of Olympic gold for the fact that at the very end of the race he was assisted.  Much ahead of all rivals, Pietri was so exhausted that on the last leg of the journey he fell several times, and the judges had to help him up. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="modern olympic games" class="if" height="285" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23410/574207.jpg" width="577"></div>

    <p>  Pietri's strength of mind amazed everyone who saw this dramatic competition.  He received a special cup from the hands of Queen Alexandra.  And the American bishop Talbot, speaking in a sermon in the London St. Paul‚Äôs Cathedral, spoke out that there can be only one winner, but everyone can participate.  This is the main lesson of the Olympics. </p><p>  With the presentation of Coubertin, this expression in a more aphoristic form spread throughout the world. </p><h2>  Other Olympic Games Symbols </h2><p>  Over time, the full symbolism of the Olympic Games has developed.  And the motto has become a part of it.  Besides him, there are the <span>Olympic flag,</span> rings, fire. </p><p>  As the history of the Olympic Games shows, we can briefly say that most of the characters appeared during the VII Summer Olympics in Antwerp (1920). </p><p>  Olympic rings intertwined in a special way symbolize the unity of the five continents.  They show that the Games are world wide.  The logo is authored by Pierre de Coubertin.  He proposed the Olympic flag - a white silk cloth with the image of the Olympic rings. </p><p>  By the way, the first flag hung over the stadium for only two days.  And then he disappeared!  A new one was urgently made, which rose during the opening of the Games until 1988, before the Olympics in Seoul.  And the mystery of the missing banner was revealed only in 1997, when a century-old sports veteran American Priest confessed that he simply stole it.  Three years later, he returned the IOC flag. </p><p>  Very often, along with the rings, the image of the olive branch is used.  This is also an echo of the Olympic Games of antiquity.  Then an olive wreath was laid on the head of the winner.  Since then, he has been a <span>symbol of victory.</span> </p><p>  During the opening of the Games, one of the most respected athletes takes the Olympic oath on behalf of all participants to honestly fight for victory.  And judges swear to judge objectively and honestly.  This echoes the traditions of the ancient Greek Olympic Games. </p><h2>  Olympic flame </h2><p>  The tradition to light the fire of the Olympic Games also comes from Ancient Greece, where he was dedicated to the feat of Prometheus.  It was revived in 1928.  Long before the start of the next games in the <span>temple of Hera in Olympia,</span> one of the main symbols is lit from the rays of the sun.  Then the relay of the Olympic Torch transfer to the venue of the Olympics begins.  Participation in it is very honorable for athletes.  After a long journey across all continents, the torch is delivered to the Games opening ceremony.  The Olympic flame is lit from him, which symbolizes the opening of the Olympics. </p>

    <h2>  The motto of the Winter Olympics in Sochi </h2><p>  Recently, each of the Olympics has its own motto.  Countries hosting the Games try to make them concise and memorable.  The motto of the Olympic Games in Sochi (2014) sounded like "Hot. Winter. Yours." </p><p>  According to the organizers, this expression succinctly reflects the features of the Sochi Olympics.  ‚ÄúHot‚Äù is the passions among the participants and fans, ‚Äúwinter‚Äù - the nature of the Games and the traditional idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãRussia as a frosty and snowy country, ‚Äúyours‚Äù - expresses a sense of ownership of everyone who participates in it or watches it. </p><h2>  Emblems and mascots of the Games </h2><p>  The modern Olympic Games are characterized by the fact that each Olympiad has an emblem that serves as a recognizable symbol of these Games.  Along with them appeared talismans.  Countries hosting the Olympics are trying to show their peculiarities in them or use common clich√©-images of this country.  It is not surprising that the <span>Olympic Bear</span> became a symbol of the 1980 Moscow Olympics <span>,</span> which was very popular even after its completion. </p>

    <p>  The Olympics is a holiday in which the main role is played by peace and sport.  The Olympic Games show that the states of the world can compete not in who has how much money or weapons, but in sports achievements.  No wonder the Olympic medals are a matter of pride not only for the winners and record holders of the Games, but also for all the inhabitants of the country.  As in antiquity, Olympic heroes become national heroes.  And the Games held in the country are an excellent occasion for the unity of all its citizens. </p>
