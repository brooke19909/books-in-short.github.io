The luxurious rooms must be accompanied by the same food, and invariably through the system of "ultra all inclusive."  If you go on vacation to the Mediterranean coast of Turkey, then you should think about the needs of children.  What will they eat, how to organize their leisure time?  The hotel, positioning itself as a family vacation destination, especially a luxury hotel, provides its guests with a large selection of entertainment.  After all, someone dreamed all year to relax in the warm water embrace of the spa, someone else in the winter, St. Nicholas promised a trip to the water park, but someone just did not tear it from the bar.  And all these various entertainments can be found in one hotel called Alva Donna Exclusive Hotel Spa 5 *.  What do tourists say about him?  In this article, we will characterize the Alva Donna Exclusive Hotel differently from the way brochures describe it.  We analyzed the reviews of travelers who visited there in the past (two thousand and sixteenth) year, systematized them and now provide you with a description of the hotel through the eyes of an ordinary tourist. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alva Donna Exclusive Hotel" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1633538.jpg" width="600"></div>

However, everyone knows that luxury hotels with a large territory are not built among noisy neighborhoods.  Seven kilometers from Belek is the small village of Bogazkent.  On its outskirts, a kilometer from the center, the hotel we are describing is located.  Naturally, as a hotel of its status should be, Alva Donna Exclusive &amp; Spa stands on the very shore of the sea, having its own beach three hundred meters long.  In the holiday season, this hotel operates on an "ultra all inclusive" system and accepts the so-called "package" tourists.  Therefore, you don‚Äôt have to worry about how to get to the place.  Indeed, a ticket from a travel agency necessarily includes a transfer from and to the airport.  But if you are interested in knowing how quickly you get from the air harbor of Antalya to a vacation spot, we will inform you of such information.  Alva Donna Exclusive Hotel is located forty kilometers from the international airport, that is, it will take you about an hour to go.  This is not too long compared to the average transfer time to Anatolian resorts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alva Donna Exclusive Hotel Spa" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1633542.jpg" width="600"></div>

Its area is sixty-four thousand square meters - a whole town!  The hotel opened the doors of the first guests in two thousand and five.  Then it was called "Riva Donna."  In two thousand and nine it was acquired by the Alva Hotels hotel chain, and the hotel got its current name.  The new hotelier built in two thousand and thirteenth year a building with improved rooms.  The Main Building is closer to the sea, and the Deluxe is a little further away.  Both cases are connected by a bridge.  But in general, the Alva Donna Exclusive Hotel has seven four-story buildings.  A lot of photos tourists devote to the hotel.  She is very well thought out.  Wherever you live, there is no feeling that you are ‚Äúout of the way‚Äù or at the very epicenter of stormy fun.  All services are close.  At the pools, in the water park, on the beach, restaurants have toilets.  This, of course, is a trifle, but in other hotels, because of such a trifle, you have to go to your room.  Landscape designers did their best to turn the sea coast into a wonderful park.  Everywhere there are beautiful sculptures, flowers and shrubs grow.  In a word, I want to walk along all these malls and lawns.  The last major renovation in the hotel took place in two thousand and thirteenth year, and the complex seemed to have changed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alva Donna Exclusive Hotel 5" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1633541.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  What is nearby </h2><p>  Of course, Alva Donna Exclusive Hotel resembles more a pleasure town than a hotel, but still I would like to know what is beyond its walls.  Bogazkent is the newest of the coastal resorts of Turkey.  You cannot find a stormy night life in the village - you need to go to Belek for it.  Make it easy.  Indeed, between the village and the city ply marching dolmushi.  But whoever likes Bogazkent is nature lovers.  The entire surrounding territory, together with the village itself, is part of the Bird Paradise National Park.  There are about forty species of birds.  And not only birds live in this paradise.  Very often on the sandy sections of the beaches of Bogazkent you can see the inscription "Caution, turtles!"  This means that the place is chosen by a representative of the type of caretta-caretta for laying eggs.  If your child doesn‚Äôt want to see the local inhabitants of the reserve, take him to the neighboring Bellis Deluxe hotel.  It has a zoo.  In general, reviews call the village of Bogazkent a very safe resort.  It is all built up exclusively with fashionable hotels.  But all the entertainment of the resort is usually located on the territory of hotels. </p><h2>  Rooms where tourists relax </h2><p>  Do not assume that in the old building there are only budget rooms for tourists.  Of course, all the rooms of the "standard" category (and there are two hundred and fifty-four) are located in the Main Building.  But there is something better in this building.  Standards are for two guests.  For families there are categories of ‚ÄúFamily Bankbad‚Äù (with a bunk bed for children), the usual Family Room, ‚Äúquadruple‚Äù categories.  There are superior rooms in this building.  They can accommodate both two guests and families for three or four people.  The main decoration of "Main Building" are the "suites".  They are decorated in the Ottoman style, so their names are corresponding: "Pasha", "Sultan", "Madonna", "President".  And in the main building there are three rooms for guests with special needs.  In the new building, room categories begin with deluxe.  Their lion's share is designed to accommodate two guests.  But there are "junior suites" for three people and four.  There are rooms with an adjacent door.  In the ‚ÄúDeluxe‚Äù building there are also suites.  These are ‚Äújunior‚Äù, ‚Äúexecutive‚Äù and ‚Äúroyal‚Äù (royal). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alva Donna Exclusive Hotel Spa Belek" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1633539.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Description of rooms.  What tourists say about guest rooms </h2><p>  Most of the reviews concerned ‚Äústandards.‚Äù  This is a fairly spacious bedroom and en-suite bathroom.  If you are not lucky, then the windows will open onto the parking lot.  Again, there is nothing to be ashamed of: if the Alva Donna Exclusive Hotel does not have a full load, the girl at the reception at your request will change your room.  Mostly tourists were satisfied with the premises of the "standard".  As befits a five-star hotel, guests are offered bathrobes, slippers and various pleasant little things (a notebook with a pen, a sewing kit, a sponge for shoes, etc.).  The "Family Room" consists of two bedrooms with an adjacent door.  This room type has a balcony.  The family superior has two bathrooms instead of one.  In the deluxe building, all rooms have balconies.  Especially worth mentioning about the "suites".  They consist of a bedroom, a living room, several bathrooms, one of which has a jacuzzi.  The pride of the Alva Donna Exclusive Hotel is Madonna and President Suite.  These rooms occupy separate floors.  They even have a dedicated spa area with a sauna and a jacuzzi.  And, of course, they are serviced according to the VIP program. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Alva Donna Exclusive Hotel Spa" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1633547.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where to eat at Alva Donna Exclusive Hotel Spa </h2><p>  Usually in five-star hotels there is one main restaurant and several a la carte.  But Alva Donna Exclusive is an exception even for hospitable Turkey.  This hotel has two main restaurants - in the main building (Panorama) and the new Deluxe building.  Serving them is carried out according to the buffet program.  You can visit both, regardless of the "registration" in the buildings.  Weather permitting, you can enjoy your meal on the open veranda.  The restaurant of the Deluxe building has a children's room.  The concept is this: for younger guests it is more interesting to trapeze each other in society.  They can choose the dishes themselves and feel fully grown.  Therefore, in the hall are small tables and chairs.  And on the trays - baby food dishes.  In the refrigerator you can take juices in bags, yoghurts, curds.  As for nutrition for adults, here tourists note a variety of dishes, the quality of products and cooking skill.  In Alva Donna Exclusive Hotel 5 * hotel (Belek), in addition to the main restaurants, there are seven more a la carte.  Tourists claim that their visit is paid, but discounts are possible for early bookings.  And to top it all, vacationers are waiting in nine bars.  They are on the beach, and by the pools, and in the lobby.  There is also a hookah, but this particular service is paid. </p><h2>  What nutrition reviews say </h2><p>  Each room at Alva Donna Exclusive Hotel Spa (Turkey) has an electric kettle and a set with coffee and tea, as well as a minibar, which is free to use.  It is replenished every day.  The Ultra All Inclusive system assumes the enjoyment of imported, expensive alcohol, as well as endless snacks, should such a desire come to your mind.  What rest by the sea without boiled corn?  We got used to it in childhood, when we went to Berdyansk or Vityazevo.  And so that tourists can not change traditions, boiled corn is offered here, and for free.  And you can taste the matchless Turkish cakes G√∂zleme or ice cream.  For breakfast, they give freshly squeezed orange juice, and coffee, although from a vending machine, is very tasty, natural.  A bottle of wine and a fruit basket awaits you in your room upon your arrival.  And if you have a birthday for the vacation period, then you will receive a compliment from the hotel in the form of a festive cake.  The bars are calm, there are no queues, and this despite the fact that the hotel is chosen by Russian tourists.  A la carte restaurants are available for a fee and upon reservation.  But this does not stop tourists who want to diversify their vacation.  They leave favorable reviews primarily about the Steakhouse.  Grilled meat lovers will love it there.  The restaurants of Japanese ("Teppenyaki"), French, Italian ("Sapphire"), Chinese and fish ("Roma Fish") cuisine were also praised. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alva Donna Exclusive Hotel Spa 5 Turkey" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1633543.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach owned by the resort </h2><p>  Why go to Turkey, if not for the sun and sea?  Alva Donna Exclusive Hotel Spa has its own three hundred meter beach.  It is sand and pebble.  Reviews note that the pebbles when entering the sea are small and smooth.  So the presence of pebbles on the beach does not cause any inconvenience.  The coast is well equipped.  There is a toilet, a fresh shower, and changing cabins.  Rescuers are on duty, a bar is working.  There is a clearly defined sixteen plus zone on the beach.  This is the age limit below which children are not allowed on this section of the bream.  There are also tents with soft four-poster sofas on the beach.  The use of these "Bali House" is paid.  Tourists who visited the hotel in the winter of 2016-2017 note that you can plunge into the sea even in the off-season.  The coast is protected from winds and storms, and at noon shallow water is already warming well.  And the official holiday season on the Anatolian Riviera opens on April 20th. </p><h2>  Pools and water park </h2><p>  Anyone who prefers to swim in calm and fresh waters rather than trusting his body to the elements of the sea will have complete expanse in the Alva Donna Exclusive Hotel 5 *.  Let's count.  Two bedroom buildings have one outdoor pool.  If you believe the reviews of winter tourists, these tanks are heated to a temperature of plus twenty-nine degrees.  The buildings themselves have indoor pools.  They are heated even in the summer.  There is also a pool filled with mineral water.  Water park slides descend to the sixth reservoir.  Despite the fact that adult pools have shallow water for splashing kids, Alva Donna Exclusive Hotel 5 * has three tanks for bathing children.  First of all, it‚Äôs a mini club pool.  Secondly, a reservoir where four slides of a children's water park descend.  And most importantly, there is also a pool on the beach.  It is filled with sea water.  He is becoming a very useful alternative to the dangerous elements in the storm.  Tourists who visited the hotel in winter argue that adult outdoor pools are located in a sheltered place from the wind, so you can not only swim for fun in warm water, but also sunbathe in the sun on the sunbeds.  The only minus is that the water park does not work all day, but only from noon to three hours.  Of the nine slides, five are for adults only.  In a children's water park, one attraction is designed completely for kids.  Winter tourists assure that the water park is open even out of season.  The pools where the slides go down are heated. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alva Donna Exclusive Hotel Spa 5 reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1633550.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Spa and sports activities </h2><p>  It's time to talk about this type of relaxation at the Alva Donna Exclusive Hotel Spa (Belek).  The spa has a clear division into paid and "free" services.  The latter include the use of the Finnish sauna and Turkish steam bath (hamam).  And you can visit them unlimited.  The main thing is that this does not harm your health.  Also, absolutely free, you can relax as much as you like in the jacuzzi, which are located in the indoor pools of the two bedroom buildings.  Paid procedures include all kinds of massages.  The hotel employs real experts.  If you relax in Alva Donna Exclusive Hotel Spa 5 *, reviews advise you to try at least one session of Turkish (foam) massage.  The hotel also has a beauty salon, the services of which are paid.  But you can absolutely freely work out on modern simulators in the fitness room.  For those who cannot live a day without sports, there are volleyball and basketball courts, tennis courts, a field for indoor soccer.  The necessary equipment, including darts, chess, ping pong, can be borrowed for free.  Money will have to be paid only for billiards and bowling. </p><h2>  Services for children </h2><p>  Younger guests are the most preferred tourist category at the Alva Donna Exclusive Hotel Spa.  Reviews say that whenever you come, there are always a lot of children.  For the smallest guests the hotel provides cribs, playpens, pots, high chairs for feeding.  If the baby is a little older, the administration will install a toilet nozzle and a washbasin stand in the bathroom so that the child can reach the sink.  We already mentioned the children's room of the restaurant with the corresponding diet menu.  And for mothers of infants there is a microwave, a device for heating bottles and can food for babies.  If the child is already four years old, he can be sent to a mini-club.  There, animation girls will be engaged with him.  Modeling, competitions, outdoor games and watching cartoons - children speak about the mini-club only in enthusiastic colors.  There is a trampoline on the playground.  In the evenings, discos are organized for the privileged category of guests. </p><h2>  What reviews did Alva Donna Exclusive Hotel Spa deserve </h2><p>  Tourists who visited the hotel in the winter claim that they did not feel any discomfort of the ‚Äúnon-season‚Äù.  All services work like in summer.  Reviews also note that mainly groups from Russia call at this hotel.  It is up to you to decide whether this is plus or minus.  But all the employees, both at the reception and in restaurants and bars, know the Russian language.  In summer, even pop stars are invited for adult animation.  Tourists celebrate the cordiality and friendliness of the staff.  For many, rest in this complex seemed to be a stay in a luxurious palace, where any of your wishes are fulfilled.  True, sometimes for a fee. </p>
