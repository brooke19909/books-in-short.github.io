Some of them are located on the shores of the Indian Ocean and delight their visitors with magnificent beaches.  Others are located in the center of the island, where a quiet and cozy atmosphere reigns, allowing you to enjoy a relaxing holiday.  This is not to say that all parts of Bali are the same.  Each of them is unique: its microclimate, atmosphere, nature, as well as infrastructure.  Due to this difference, the island is incredibly attractive for active and passive recreation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="for-travels.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="best areas" class="if uuid-2713461" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/2713461.jpg"></div><p>  All areas of Bali for leisure are divided into four parts: southern, northern, eastern and western.  Tourist destinations flourish in the south.  The eastern part provides an opportunity to relax from the bustle of the city and truly relax.  Those who want to see real life on the island are sent west.  Many are surprised by the fact that the size of each district of Bali is relatively small, but the atmosphere and microclimate are different everywhere.  It is for this reason, before choosing which area to relax in, you need to find out more about each district separately.  And only thanks to the knowledge gained you can choose the best place for you to relax. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Kuta District </h2><p>  Kuta is considered the first resort in Indonesia where tourism began.  Forty years ago, the inhabitants of this simple fishing village could not even imagine that once there would be a large paradise here, in which tourists of all tribes and peoples would gather. </p><p>  Today, the Bali Kuta region has great tourist potential.  It has built many hotels designed for the average tourist, many entertainment venues, canteens, souvenir shops, shops, etc. In addition to infrastructure facilities, the Bali areas are full of numerous beaches both for outdoor activities and for a more relaxing one.  Among them, beaches for surfers are very popular.  They are appreciated even by those who have never picked up a board. </p><p>  The central beach of this area of ‚Äã‚ÄãBali is called Kuta Beach, as it laid the foundation for the development of the tourism industry.  It is very wide, the entrance to the water on it is shallow, and the sand is white and white.  All hotels located in this area are designed for middle-income poor tourists.  But also there are several hotels of a higher level.  Kuta is considered one of the best areas of Bali. </p><h2>  The area for the rich </h2><p>  The richest area in Bali is Nusa Dua.  All hotels that are included in this one have 4 or 5 quality stars.  This area belongs to closed areas and is intended more for foreign guests who can afford not only long-term stays in expensive hotels, but also active holidays on an all-inclusive basis. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.agoda.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nusa Dua" class="if uuid-2704567" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78450/2704567.jpg"></div><p>  The resort is located in the eastern part of the island, near the Bukit Peninsula.  Thanks to the highly developed infrastructure, all residents of the Nusa Dua region fully feel the high level of comfort.  Even very demanding tourists do not remain disappointed.  Although the cost of living in this area is very high, on the forums reviews about the areas of Bali experienced tourists recommend booking accommodation as early as possible. </p><p>  On the entire beach there is a strict restriction that does not allow you to buy anything from ‚Äúwalking‚Äù sellers.  Therefore, some vacationers are constantly surprised that they can not even meet these strollers.  In addition to the positive aspects, this region has a small drawback: rather frequent and strong tides, which cause many inconveniences to many coastal residents.  In this regard, in almost every hotel a schedule is posted that indicates the recommended time for relaxing on the beach. </p><p>  Nusa Dua has plenty of spas and all the shopping facilities.  But there are not many attractions here, but you can visit other areas of Bali at any time. </p><h2>  Jimbaran District </h2><p>  This area is located in the southern part of the island and is intended for tourists who prefer a quiet and relaxing holiday.  There is an airport five kilometers from the resort, so you can get to it in a few minutes.  The hotel base provides many options for accommodation, ranging from a cozy guest house near the beach to a five-star hotel with luxury apartments and magnificent views of the ocean.  The level of comfort will depend on your preference. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jimbaran District" class="if uuid-2704584" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78450/2704584.jpg"></div><p>  As for the beaches, they are all perfectly clean, and the water is a bright blue.  This is what attracts many tourists here, especially couples.  Convenience on the beach is provided by special sunbeds and large umbrellas.  In which area of ‚Äã‚ÄãBali to live, it is up to you to decide, but it is Jimbaran that is famous for a large number of cafes and restaurants where you can taste many dishes prepared with seafood. </p><p>  If you are a surf lover, then in this area you will not be able to swim normally, because the waves here are very small.  The best option is to go on an excursion to other areas of the island of Bali. </p><p>  One of the main attractions of this area is the <span>fish market,</span> which has a wide variety of aquatic inhabitants, most of which are caught in the local waters.  A huge selection of budget hotels, beautiful and perfectly clean beaches, a short road to the airport and enchanting sunsets will not leave you disappointed after a vacation in the area. </p><h2>  Tanjung benoa </h2><p>  The Tanjung Benoa area is next to Nusa Dua.  Not so long ago there was only a huge fishing village on this place, but now many 3-4 star hotels, various shops, souvenir stalls and much more have been built here.  Also in this area is a thriving enterprise providing tourists with water activities.  The beaches are unstable due to frequent ebbs and flows. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.jettravel.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tanjung benoa" class="if uuid-2704590" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78450/2704590.jpg"></div><p>  The encouraging factor is that the cost of living here is much lower than in the neighboring elite area of ‚Äã‚ÄãNusa Dua.  Various restaurants and cafes prepare delicious gastronomic dishes from almost any cuisine in the world. </p><p>  One of the advantages of this area is a huge selection of hotels.  It also has excellent infrastructure, a short road to the airport and a unique microclimate.  The disadvantages of Tanjung Benoa include low-quality beaches and the absence of any attractions.  Probably for this reason, this area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe island is a more budget option. </p><h2>  Sanur </h2><p>  Sanur is located on the southeast side of Bali.  Construction in this area was intended specifically for tourists, so Sanur is one of the first resort settlements.  Here, quiet and calm beaches, highly developed infrastructure, 4-5 star hotels, all the conditions for an elite vacation.  Which area of ‚Äã‚ÄãBali to choose for a vacation?  Take a closer look at the Sanur area, where you can relax from the bustle of the city.  Most of the residents are elderly tourists who prefer a quiet and comfortable atmosphere. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bali-indonesia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sanur District" class="if uuid-2704594" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78450/2704594.jpg"></div><p>  The 5 km long beach of the same name stretches along the coast, along which a stone path is beautifully laid, providing comfortable movement both on foot and by bicycle.  Near the coast in the ocean is a coral reef, thanks to which you can safely sunbathe and swim, as there are no tides. </p><p>  One of the most popular sports in the area is diving.  Perfectly clear water, a wide variety of aquatic inhabitants, as well as the complete absence of poisonous algae and jellyfish, allow divers to truly enjoy unforgettable underwater beauty.  If you are not a fan of diving, then you can take a paid training in windsurfing and kiteboarding. </p><p>  As for the attractions, among them one can distinguish the Mangrove Reserve and Le Mayer Museum.  Also in this area there are a large number of recreation areas, so that each visitor can choose where he needs to relax. </p><p>  One of the drawbacks is too expensive hotels and hotels.  As a rule, you need to pay a lot of money for a cozy and quiet atmosphere, which not everyone can afford.  The debris of coral, which can often be found on the beach, is also very annoying. </p><h2>  Ubud </h2><p>  Not sure which Bali area to choose?  Take a look at the resort of Ubud, which is famous for its picturesque landscapes and Balinese culture.  Also, this area lures many tourists with its exotic atmosphere.  It has a highly developed infrastructure: many shops, spas, gymnastic schools and more.  The only negative is the lack of beaches.  If you want to swim normally, then you will have to go 20-30 minutes to the nearest beach. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bali-indonesia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ubud District" class="if uuid-2704596" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78450/2704596.jpg"></div><p>  As for hotel rooms, there are enough of them.  There is a choice between a budget hotel with 3-4 stars and luxury apartments with 5 stars.  If you do not know how to diversify your leisure, then in the Ubud area quite often there are entertaining shows and events that will not let you get bored.  Also, there are many different exhibitions that will appeal not only to adults, but also to youth. </p><p>  Ubud is the center of Bali culture.  It is in this area that almost all the main attractions of the island are collected: </p><ul><li>  Goa Gaja Cave; </li><li>  elephant park; </li><li>  Tirta Empul water sources; </li><li>  monkey forest. </li></ul><p>  The main advantage of the Ubud area is its location.  It is located on the highest point of the island, on a mountain hill.  Due to this location, you can view almost the entire island of Bali, all its areas.  Particularly impressive are the amazing landscapes of evening sunsets, various gorges and waterfalls.  Which area of ‚Äã‚ÄãBali to choose?  If you are against outdoor activities, then Ubud is what you need. </p><h2>  Amed </h2><p>  Amed is located on the eastern part of Bali with the beach of the same name.  This area, as well as Ubud and Sanur, has all the conditions for a quiet and relaxing pastime.  Amed beach is more suitable for couples, as surging waves and low tides are extremely rare.  The coastal strip is covered with <span>coarse sand of a</span> dark color. </p><p>  Housing here is also very diverse.  If you need to find economical options, then it is worth taking a look at hotels 3-4 stars, and if you are interested in luxury rooms, then several hotels of 5 * quality level are presented at your choice.  It is also possible to rent expensive villas, but only for a long time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="balihellotravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amed Beach" class="if uuid-2704601" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78450/2704601.jpg"></div><p>  What to say about the sights?  Near the resort is the Gunung Agung volcano.  On the island of Bali, this is the highest point above sea level.  Fans of outdoor activities are very grateful for the trekking routes, thanks to which you can climb to its top.  The underwater world and the amazing coral reef will also not let tourists engaged in diving and snorkeling get bored. </p><p>  Those waking up early in the morning can watch a lot of dolphins have breakfast near the beach.  This is a truly amazing sight that can only be seen in this area.  It is also interesting to go on an excursion to the palace of Kerth Gos or to look into the beautiful cave of Goa Lavah. </p><h2>  Seminyak, Kerobokan and Petitenget </h2><p>  These areas are located in the northwestern part of Bali.  They are intended for tourists who really appreciate the rest and are willing to pay a round sum for it.  Therefore, the infrastructure in these areas is very developed: many grocery and grocery stores, cafes, restaurants, spas and much more.  But these areas have gained their popularity due to the large number of expensive holiday villas. </p><div class="photo" data-original="eng.taiwan.net.tw" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bali Canggu District" class="if uuid-2704643" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78450/2704643.jpg"></div><p>  One of the drawbacks is the long road to the airport.  To get to it, you need to spend at least 30 minutes, and this is subject to free of traffic jams.  In the central area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSeminyak there is a beautiful beach, in the open bars of which you can enjoy amazingly delicious cocktails and watch the sunset. </p><p>  The infrastructure in these three areas is one of the best, because it has developed in tourist destinations, focusing on the wishes of both local and foreign guests.  The location of the central Seminyak district allows vacationers to go on excursions to neighboring areas. </p><p>  In addition to the positive aspects, it is worth noting that in the regions of Seminyak, Kerobokan and Petitenget there are several pronounced problems, namely: </p><ul><li>  lack of housing for a relaxing holiday; </li><li>  the cost of living is prohibitive; </li><li>  the current on the beach is quite strong. </li></ul><p>  But despite all these shortcomings, the number of indigenous people in these areas is several times less than tourists.  And their popularity is growing every year. </p><h2>  Canggu </h2><p>  The Bali Canggu area is located 5 kilometers from Seminyak.  In addition to the indigenous people, this area is inhabited by expats who have been living here for quite some time.  The infrastructure is also very developed here.  In addition to hotel rooms of different price categories, beautiful villas and small houses in which tourists live, in the area there are many other buildings: cafes, restaurants, spas, sports clubs, surf camps, etc. It is interesting to see with your own eyes and rice fields on the slopes of the mountains. </p><p>  As for recreation by the sea, in this area there is a unique, not crowded beach of volcanic color.  Here you can also find several surf spots of various levels that train both brand new surfers and more experienced ones, helping them hone their skills. </p><p>  One of the most visited places in Canggu is a small restaurant located right on Eco Beach.  During lunch, you can watch surfers, and towards the evening you can see a bright red sunset, while enjoying a wide variety of dishes prepared from seafood. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Which area in Bali is best to relax depends on your preference.  In this article, we examined the conditions of rest in each district separately, learned that they all differ in their infrastructure, price range, and that each of them has its own unique atmosphere.  Many souvenir shops, spas, various excursions and a variety of local attractions will not leave you indifferent to this amazing island. </p><p>  If you have already decided that the areas of Bali for relaxation are what you need, we recommend that you get to know each of them better in order to choose the best one that will appeal not only to you, but to your whole family. </p>
