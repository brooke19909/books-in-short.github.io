For several centuries, its center was surrounded by new structures, not all of which have survived to this day.  However, those that have survived attract tourists year-round.  One of the most visited places in Kaliningrad is Zakheim Gate.  Read about them in the article. </p><h2>  All gates of Konigsberg </h2><p>  Tourists still come to this city, which used to be a fortress in ancient times, to look at samples of German architecture, to listen to stories about how their history has developed.  Initially, K√∂nigsberg was surrounded by ten gates, however, during the Second World War, some of them were destroyed.  There are eight of them left. </p>

    <p>  All of them are made in different styles of German architecture.  Now they are almost not used for their intended purpose.  They are popular tourist destinations.  In contrast with buildings built at other times, they attract people from all over the world. </p><h2>  What are the gates used for? </h2><p>  At different times they served for different purposes.  Now almost all of them are places where you can spend cultural time.  The gates of K√∂nigsberg, or Kaliningrad, include: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  The Freeland Gate, in the premises of which a museum was organized in 2002.  Here you can visit the exhibition of ancient objects found in the postwar period.  There is also a museum of local lore, where you can find information about how the way of life was built in old Kaliningrad. </li><li>  The Brandenburg Gate is still functioning as intended: transport passes through them, and there are tram tracks.  They are protected by the state, as they are an architectural monument. </li><li>  <span>The Friedrichsburg Gate</span> is currently being restored.  However, this does not interfere with the work of the branch <span>of the World Ocean Museum</span> located in them <span>.</span>  Here you can find out the history of shipbuilding, see drawings and photographs dedicated to this industry.  In addition, samples of boats produced in Russia are also in this museum. </li><li>  Rosgartenskie - one of the most beautiful of all preserved gates of Koenigsberg.  Currently, they have a cafe.  The casemates that surround the opening are used as an entrance and exit, wardrobe, utility and kitchen rooms. </li><li>  <span>The royal gate</span> has been rebuilt and destroyed more than once.  Once a bookstore, cafe and even a warehouse worked in them, now they are a branch of the Museum of the World Ocean.  The most valuable amber samples are collected here. </li><li>  The Ausfal Gate used to be a military center, a bomb shelter, and warehouses.  A water collector was once located here.  At the end of the twentieth century, the chapel of St. George was erected in honor of the fallen soldiers.  Now both the chapel and the gate are part of the city art-historical museum. </li><li>  Zakheim Gate is widely used for all kinds of cultural events.  As a rule, various conferences, concerts and exhibitions are often held here. </li><li>  The railway gate belongs to the museum of history.  They lead to the park, but soon on the squares will be displayed on the theme of the war. </li></ul><h2>  History </h2><p>  Zakheim Gate is part of the first shaft fortification of Kaliningrad, which was built at the beginning of the seventeenth century.  The architectural project was created by Professor Strauss, who taught at the University of Koenigsberg.  In the 1860s, the building was rebuilt according to a project proposed by Ernst Ludwig von Aster.  Before in 1848 they became what they can be seen now, they were wooden. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Until the end of the nineteenth century, it was possible to get into the city only through this gate, because it was here that there was a certain checkpoint. </p><h2>  Architecture </h2><p>  If you select an analogue, then the Zacheim Gate is most similar to the Friedrichsburg.  They have a massive structure, they are heavy, durable and massive.  They even have towers decorated with lancet-shaped windows and high reliefs.  They depicted the heroes of the wars with Napoleon.  Two portrait medallions could be seen military figures such as Johann David Ludwig York and Friedrich Wilhelm B√ºlow.  Unfortunately, there are currently no high reliefs on the gates. </p>

    <p>  On their outer side was the Black Eagle.  Now it is impossible to see him in the same place, but people remember him.  The fact is that he became one of the free symbols of the city called K√∂nigsberg, or Kaliningrad.  Zakheim Gate was the place where the highest Prussian award, the Order of the Black Eagle, was located.  His motto was the words: "To each his own." </p><h2>  Layout </h2><p>  As for the layout of the structure, it can be called special.  For instance: </p><ul><li>  The niches that are located between the loopholes resemble the <span>Latin cross,</span> which is also called the cross of the West, as well as the cross of Life. </li><li>  At the entrance to the city was an opening for a drawbridge.  Now the moat through which he led looks like an overgrown ditch. </li></ul><p>  In addition, the presence of two portrait medallions with high reliefs and the Black Eagle make the gate architecture special. </p><h2>  Appointment </h2><p>  Initially, the gate called Zakheim was supposed to be part of the city's defensive system.  They were built strong and powerful in order to fulfill their function for many centuries.  However, soon the ramparts, which were also part of the first Konigsberg fortification, lost their function, so the gate began to be perceived as an analogue of the triumphal arch. </p>

    <p>  The Zakheim Gate, whose history spans several centuries, has served for various purposes.  After the outbreak of World War II, they were used as premises for a warehouse.  So they served until the sixth year of the third millennium. </p><p>  After that, their restoration began, then they were transferred from hand to hand.  As a result, they were given under the control of the Kaliningrad Union of Photographers.  Since that time, that is, since 2013, an art platform called ‚ÄúThe Gate‚Äù was created here. </p><h2>  Treasures </h2><p>  It is believed that one of the places in which a large number of treasures is located is the city of Kaliningrad.  Zakheim Gate, photos of which can be found in this article, once again confirm this point of view. </p>

    <p>  So, in the twentieth century, and if you call the exact date, then on September 1, 1979, in the basement of this architectural monument, a most valuable treasure was found.  The box that was excavated here contained unique samples of dishes made of porcelain lace, crystal and minerals. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  People who live in Kaliningrad or decide to come to this city to get acquainted with its sights must visit the Zacheim Gate.  An excursion to this place will give tourists the opportunity to better know the history and see examples of German architecture. </p>

    <p>  Kaliningrad was once known as the greenest city in the country.  To restore its former glory, people everywhere plant trees and create whole squares.  One of them is located near this gate.  In addition, there is a lake near the Zacheim Gate, which should also be visited while walking along the old K√∂nigsberg, or Kaliningrad. </p>
