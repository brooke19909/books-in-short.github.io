    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Lindos Imperial Resort SPA 5 * is located on the shore of Kiotari Bay.  This is the east coast of Rhodes.  It is located at a distance of 55 kilometers from the airport, which is both a plus and a minus.  On the one hand, this is good, since landing and taking off planes will not interfere with the quiet relaxation of guests.  But on the other hand, it‚Äôs not very, because after arrival you will have to get to the hotel for about an hour.  Although this short-term inconvenience can be endured. </p><p>  The hotel is 50 kilometers from the center <span>of Rhodes</span> .  Nearby, about 5 minutes by car, is the village of Lardos.  And 8 kilometers away is the town of Lindos.  Despite the fact that only 600 people live there, the place is interesting.  One of the main attractions is the St. Nicholas Orthodox Church, built in the 13th century. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In general, the hotel, although remote from the bustling city life, but the location is still favorable.  By the way, it is relatively new - it was built in 2007. </p><h2>  Restaurants </h2><p>  First of all, I would like to note that Lindos Imperial Resort SPA 5 * is one of the few hotels in Rhodes that offers an all-inclusive system.  As a matter of fact, it was largely thanks to this that he became so popular. </p><p>  First, guests are offered a light continental breakfast (early).  It is served in the main restaurant from 6:30 to 7:00.  Then - an ordinary breakfast, American, according to the "buffet".  It is also served in the main restaurant, but from 7:00 to 10:00.  There is also a brunch, which can be enjoyed from 10:15 to 11:00. </p><p>  Then - lunch.  Also in the main restaurant, from 12:30 to 14:30.  There is also an alternative lunch, served from 12:00 to 16:30 (buffet).  In the Activity Pool Bar at this time you can still enjoy ice cream. </p><p>  Dinner runs from 19:00 to 22:00 in the main restaurant.  It is also served in Italian, only from 19:30 to 22:30.  There is also a Greek restaurant, you can have dinner there at the same time.  Just decide where you want to taste the evening dishes, stands for a day to have time to sign up. </p><p>  From eight in the evening until midnight, a restaurant called Surf and Turf Pool Bar Restaurant serves wine, cocktails, salads and homemade burgers.  Light snacks can be enjoyed in the main bar from 23:00 to 24:00. </p><p>  And it‚Äôs also interesting that in the restaurant of the Lindos Imperial Resort SPA 5 hotel * themed nights are held every week devoted to Mexican, Greek and Chinese cuisine.  By the way, Italian cuisine is accompanied by wine from Italy. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Check-in and reservation </h2><p>  The Lindos Imperial Resort SPA 5 * hotel (Rhodes) is very popular.  Therefore, if you want to relax in it, you need to be puzzled by the issue of booking apartments in advance.  Not even a few months.  Better even in a year.  To some, this may seem like a long time, but if you try to make a test test reservation for fictitious dates, you can see that most of the apartments are really busy. </p><p>  Check-in is from 14:00, and check-out is before noon.  By the way, the hotel is not allowed accommodation with small, infants.  As mentioned earlier, the hotel complex is located in a quiet and secluded place in which visitors can enjoy peace and tranquility.  For this, many love Lindos Imperial Resort SPA 5 * (Greece, Rhodes).  Therefore, the hotel adheres to this concept - very young children can interfere with the rest of guests. </p><p>  But the administration is generous with surprises.  For example, newlyweds are handed a bottle of wine and a fruit basket upon arrival. </p><h2>  Other hotel policies </h2><p>  It is worth knowing about some of the provisions established by the hotel.  Firstly, people are not allowed to enter the rooms, not only with small children, but also with pets.  So it is accepted here. </p><p>  Also, people in short pants and T-shirts are not allowed in the restaurant.  All institutions have an appropriate rating, so you need to ‚Äúgo out‚Äù in the appropriate outfit.  Going on vacation, girls should take several weekend dresses, and for men - light trousers and long-sleeved shirts. </p><p>  Upon arrival, guests will be required to present an identity card with their photo and credit card.  The first should be a foreign passport.  General civil is also suitable.  By the way, if there was no flight for later hours and guests will arrive earlier, then they may not wait until 14:00.  You just need to warn the administration in advance by contacting the property.  They will prepare the apartment in advance, if possible. </p>

    <h2>  Guest opinions on accommodation </h2><p>  Now a few words are worth telling about the reviews that people who stayed here about this hotel leave.  Mostly they are positive.  There are negative ones, but they relate mainly to prices.  However, one must understand that the complex is 5-star, also with the all-inclusive service, because apartments in such a hotel cannot be cheap. </p><p>  Placed very quickly in Lindos Imperial Resort SPA 5 *.  Reviews in 2016 claim that check-in is as quick as possible and, as many claim, free of charge, even if it turned out a few hours earlier.  This is a plus, as many hotels charge an additional fee for the so-called emergency accommodation. </p><p>  The rooms are gorgeous.  With modern furniture, comfortable beds, clean bathrooms and, of course, eye-catching sea views.  The food is varied, and each dish is tasty and unusual in its own way.  Many people decide to dine at the bar because there is no dress code.  Not everyone is comfortable dressing in a suit or dress to go eat.  But these are the rules.  In principle, any restaurant has a dress code, so this is not surprising. </p><h2>  About staff </h2><p>  Polite, smiling and cordial service staff - these are the people who rest in Lindos Imperial Resort SPA 5 * who are noting for their attention.  Reviews in 2016 confirm this.  It is always nice when in a new and unfamiliar place they are ready to come to the rescue and suggest something.  This hotel is just that.  Many people traveling abroad have fear.  A foreign country, an unfamiliar language - all this is natural.  And at Lindos Imperial Resort SPA 5 * (Rhodes, Lindos) there are polite people who also know Russian.  And if you have any questions you should not be shy to contact them for advice. </p><h2>  Recommendations </h2><p>  This hotel complex is not just big, it is huge.  It has not one, not two, or three hundred rooms, and all of them are located in several so-called levels.  Guests recommend booking apartments that are located on the first, second and third.  To make it easier to navigate - these are those closer to the sea.  Because the fifth is the water park.  And entertainment venues with animators.  So the rooms nearby can be noisy.  This will not appeal to people who want peace and solitude.  Of course, you can close the windows and turn on the air conditioning so that it is not hot, but you don‚Äôt feel like sitting without fresh air.  Therefore, it is better to clarify in your reservation. </p>
