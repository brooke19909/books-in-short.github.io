    <h2>  From the history of the city </h2><p>  For the first time, the settlement is mentioned in historical chronicles of the times of the Frankish king Clovis I, who negotiated in 504 with Alaric I (the Visigoth ruler) on the island of <span>Golden Lake.</span>  Since the IX century, a small settlement near the ford passed into the possession of the Amboise family.  Representatives of the clan strengthened this place by erecting a dungeon here - the central tower with internal chambers. </p><p>  In the second half of the 15th century, the town became the property of King Charles VIII, who was born in these places.  With him, Amboise Castle turned into a real architectural masterpiece. </p><h2>  The city's attractions </h2><p>  The town of Amboise is famous not only for the royal castle.  Next to the main attraction of the city is the medieval castle of Clos-Luce, famous for the fact that the great Leonardo da Vinci created here.  Now here is a museum of the world famous Italian.  In addition, tourists are interested in the seven-tier pagoda Chantelou (XVIII century) of the Duke of Choiseul, built on the shore of an artificial reservoir of semicircular shape, late Gothic gates with a carillon and a town hall (XVI century).  In the city hall of Aboise, historical exhibits are stored, for example, a pistol, from which Pushkin was wounded in a duel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="castle amboise france" class="if" height="207" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1321009.jpg" width="600"></div>

He played the role of a defensive fortress.  Its owners (the Amboise family) lost the castle after being charged with betraying the king.  The Amboise castle was first transferred to the state treasury, and later Charles VIII made it a royal residence.  At the same time, its restructuring began.  A chapel was built, decorated with patterns resembling stone lace, the wing of Charles VIII appeared, two towers were built - Franciscans and Gyurtot.  A magnificent park was laid out near the castle.  The garden with fountains and luxurious flower parterres was created by the talented gardener Mercogliano. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="castles of the loire" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3663/1321871.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The young king was a fan of Italian culture.  To complete the work, he invited the Italian architects Domenico and Giocondo da Cortona.  They were the first to bring the culture of the Renaissance to France.  I must admit that the castle of Amboise in those days was mainly decorated in the Gothic style. </p><h2>  Palace at Francis I </h2><p>  Charles VIII suddenly died in the castle of Amboise at a very young age.  According to historians, he hit his head hard on a too low lintel, and died of his injury.  He was only twenty eight years old.  Louis XII, who continued to improve the palace, became his successor, but Amboise Castle reached its heyday under his son Francis I, who was the recognized patron of science and the arts. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  He gathered famous masters in France.  <span>Benvenuto Cellini</span> responded to his invitation <span>.</span>  In 1515, Leonardo da Vinci was invited here.  He settled in the estate of Clos-Luce near the royal castle.  The master brought unfinished work from Italy, among which was the Mona Lisa.  In Clos-Luce, the painter was finishing work on masterpieces.  Here he lived for three years, the last in his life. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="castle palace in amboise" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3663/1321868.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Chateau Amboise (France) connected the secret underground passage with the estate of the Master.  <span>Francis I was</span> very fond of spending evenings in the company of the artist, talking with him about life and art.  The great master died in 1519.  He was buried in Amboise, in the church of St. Florentine. </p><p>  The remains of the great artist were disturbed in the troubled times of the revolution.  The rebels practically destroyed the temple, and the grave was desecrated.  During the French Revolution, the main part of the castle was looted and destroyed.  Barracks were set up here, a button factory was opened.  The royal treasures were ruthlessly plundered.  To stop this chaos, the remaining parts of the castle by the Third Republic were transferred to the possession of the Orleans House. </p><p>  To restore the castle, the Duchess of Orleans did a lot.  She, in fact, revived the castle and restored almost all of its lands.  Her son, the future <span>king of France,</span> Louis Philippe, after the death of his mother, acquired 46 houses in the vicinity of the castle.  He planned to demolish the "extra" buildings and free up the territory in front of Amboise. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  St. Louis Foundation </h2><p>  In 1974, the castle was transferred to the management of this fund.  He is led by the Count of Paris.  Immediately after the end of World War II, large-scale restoration work began in the palace, which is still underway.  Thanks to the efforts of the foundation's staff, the internal gardens of the complex are in excellent condition. </p><p>  For visitors, fascinating excursions and trips through the mysterious dungeons of the castle are held here.  Especially a lot of people who want to visit night walks.  Especially for them, designer Yukijung developed an amazing light show with laser projection, video and audio effects. </p><h2>  Amboise Castle: architecture description </h2><p>  The architectural features of the Renaissance harmoniously intertwine in this building with the traditions of the Middle Ages.  According to experts, all the castles of the Loire (including Amboise) are of great interest to researchers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="castle amboise description" class="if" height="352" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1320862.jpg" width="595"></div>

    <p>  Having entered the fortress and climbed the ramp, tourists enter the terrace, fortified with a wall, which offers amazing views of the Loire Valley and the city.  Here you can see the Saint-Hubert chapel, which is decorated with magnificent sculptural compositions.  The remains of the great Leonardo da Vinci lie in it. </p><p>  Having risen on the roof of the Knight's Tower, you can see the residence of Charles VIII.  The balcony of the third floor is thus the "balcony of the hanged", from which Valois looked at the execution of the Protestant conspirators.  At the end of the inspection, you can climb the spiral staircase to the top floor of the Minim tower.  Its diameter is 20 meters and its height is 40. </p><h2>  Indoor facilities </h2><p>  Everyone can visit the magnificent castle as part of an excursion group, which is accompanied by a professional guide.  The description of the castle of Amboise does not give all the fullness of sensations from visiting this wonderful building.  Nevertheless, we suggest you take a virtual tour of the inner chambers of the palace. </p><p>  Famous Flemish artists made a huge contribution to the interior design of the castle.  For rooms, tapestries were delivered from Flanders, and carpets from Turkey.  Passing inside the castle, tourists first get into the hall of the Guard, decorated with a Gothic chest, sideboard and carved benches.  The hall of the noble guard presents <span>Milanese armor,</span> which is decorated with many emblems.  On the pediment are statues of worshipers <span>Anna of Breton</span> and Charles VIII.  In the south and north transept there are fireplaces designed for the convenience of royalty. </p><p>  The castle - the palace in Amboise has several magnificent halls.  In the drummers hall, which was intended for musicians who once played in the stands, you can see magnificent Flemish handmade rugs created in the 16th century. </p><p>  The meeting room with its Gothic arches is decorated with lotus flowers and ermine tails - attributes of the power of France and Brittany.  Here you can see portraits of <span>Louis XIII</span> and King Henry IV. </p><p>  Eschanson Hall (the minister serving drinks to the king) is interesting for Aubusson's exquisite tapestries and carved furniture. </p><p>  The bedroom of Henry II is decorated in the style of a classic renaissance.  There is a huge bed, decorated with four columns, and skillfully crafted furniture. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="castle amboise description contacts" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1320864.jpg" width="600"></div>
