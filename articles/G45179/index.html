Even large landowners in Russia did not have locks.  There were estates. </p>

    <p>  In our country, there are about 100 objects that fall under the definitions of "castle", "Kremlin", "fort", "fortress".  And how many specifically are the first?  Because after all, a castle is not quite a fort, and not a Kremlin at all. </p><h2>  Castles are not only in the West </h2><p>  Medieval castles of Russia are located in the west of the country.  Now these are architectural and <span>historical monuments,</span> because they were built mainly in the Middle Ages.  But in the 19th century, several buildings appeared in Russia, stylized as European medieval palaces-fortresses.  And, looking at them, you understand that this is a castle, such as described in fairy tales, it was in this building that the princesses lived.  And so sorry that almost all of them are now abandoned. </p>

    <h2>  Swedish fortress </h2><p>  The surviving ancient castles of Russia are represented by such a pearl as <span>Vyborg Castle,</span> which belongs to a small number of historical monuments that have been preserved almost completely.  Located in the Leningrad Region, the object is an excellent example of Western European medieval military architecture. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful castles of Russia" class="if" height="296" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1000306.jpg" width="598"></div>  It was built for a very long time - from 1293 to 1894.  The Swedes erected it when they went on the third crusade to Karelia, an ally of Veliky Novgorod.  Having destroyed the completely fortified point of the Karelians, previously located on Castle Island, the Swedes erected a castle fortress here, the wall thickness of which reached 2 meters, at the towering tower it reached four meters.

However, Peter I in 1710, after a 2-month siege, took the castle.  It was completely restored and a Russian garrison was stationed in it.  After a very strong fire that happened in 1856, the fortress suffered, but by the end of the XIX century it was again completely restored, in accordance with the original outlines.  During the Second World War, the castle was not damaged.  Now it houses the museum of the same name. </p><h2>  Prison and ruined knight's castles </h2><p>  The list of “Castles of Russia” can be continued by the Butyrsky castle, which is still younger and has survived to this day.  True, this is a prison fortress.  It was originally built by decree of Catherine II as a prison.  The author of the project was the famous architect Matvey Kazakov.  Four round towers are located at the corners of the castle.  In the center was a temple destroyed by the Bolsheviks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ancient castles of Russia" class="if" height="319" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1000307.jpg" width="500"></div>  And now Butyrka is used for its intended purpose: it is the largest pre-trial detention center in Moscow.

    <p>  The list of Old Castles of Russia also includes Insterburg, located in the Kaliningrad region.  This bastion was erected by Master Dietrich von Altenburg in 1336.  The castle was badly damaged during the Great Patriotic War.  But there is hope that it will be restored, although restoration work is very slow.  This object is known for annual knightly tournaments. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Pearl of the Black Sea coast </h2><p>  The most beautiful castles in Russia can be represented by the "Swallow's Nest".  And although from a historical point of view this is a new building, it is so beautiful, romantic and so reminiscent of the ancient castles of Europe that it is simply impossible to ignore it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the most beautiful castles in Russia" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1000308.jpg" width="600"></div>  It was built by architect Leonid Sherwood, whose father was the author of the project of the Historical Museum on Red Square.  The Historical Museum itself also resembles both a castle and an old Russian tower at the same time.  He built the Swallow's Nest in 1911, Baron von Steingel, who misses his native Germany.  In Russia, he was engaged in the development of Baku oil.  The pearl of the Black Sea coast is located on Aurorina rock, at an altitude of 40 meters above sea level, near the village of Gaspra on Cape Ai-Todor.

    <h2>  Castle of the Northern Capital </h2><p>  Mikhailovsky, or Engineering, castle in St. Petersburg, if not the most beautiful, then the largest architectural monument, which completes the history of architecture of the Northern capital of the XVIII century.  Paul I ordered it. This castle on the water became the place of his death.  The author of the project is Vincenzo Brenna, years of construction - 1797-1801.  The name of its construction is due to the church of Michael the Archangel (patron of the Romanov dynasty), located in the building of the imperial palace.  He himself was ordered to call the castle by Paul I himself, because he raved about everything in Europe, and besides, he accepted the title of Grand Master of the Order of Malta, who does not fit to live in towers or palaces. </p><h2>  Castles of the Kaliningrad Region </h2><p>  Separate words deserve the castles of Russia located in the Kaliningrad region.  Many of them are in poor condition.  In addition to the aforementioned Insterburg, there is the only surviving tower of the Teutonic Castle, the construction of which dates back to the 13th century (Kurortnoye village).  Valdu Castle (Nizovye village), founded in 1264, is one of the three surviving <span>castles in the Kaliningrad region.</span> </p><p>  The next two are Georgenburg, located near Chernyakhovsk, and the Tapiau castle in Gvardeysk.  All of them were founded by the knights of the Teutonic Order.  After WWII, Tapiau was turned into a prison, and only in 2013 the prisoners were transferred from there, and the castle was transferred to the city authorities for restoration.  There is a partially destroyed ancient (the first mention dates back to 1257) <span>castle Schaaken</span> on the territory of the region <span>.</span> </p><p>  Speaking of the Kaliningrad region, one cannot ignore the 4-star <span>hotel-castle Nesselbek,</span> styled in antique style.  This beauty is located in the village of Orlovka.  Recreated according to old drawings, it is equipped with everything necessary for the most demanding tourists. </p><h2>  Castles of Moscow Region </h2><p>  Beautiful castles of Russia are also available to the east of the western border.  Of course, built primarily in the 19th century, they were created under the influence of European buildings, admired by Russian moneybags who wished to have a piece of medieval Europe in their homeland.  It is in the suburbs that there are several estates stylized as ancient castles or Gothic palaces.  But we have to admit that the majority of Russian structures are in decline. </p><h2>  Forgotten Beauty </h2><p>  The abandoned castles of Russia, which retain traces of former beauty and grandeur, for some reason are not being restored.  And how good they would be restored, can be judged by the estate Podushkino.  Baroness Meyendorf's castle, stylized as a knightly structure of the Middle Ages, is a private property, and only the church is open to visitors.  The castle is very good, but an exception.  He was lucky because he is on the territory of Barvikha, and the local people will not insult their eyes with ruins.  Abandoned castles of Russia (photo attached), such as the Muromtsevo estate located between Vladimir and Murom, the Uspenskaya and Vasilievskaya estates, once the most beautiful structures that are in no way inferior to the licked western prototypes, cause sadness.  And the two-story church, located not far from Bykovo Airport, is this not the princess’s castle?  Authorship is attributed to the great Bazhenov. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="abandoned castles of Russia" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1000309.jpg" width="600"></div>
