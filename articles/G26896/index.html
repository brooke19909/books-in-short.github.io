The homeland of Pythagoras and Epicurus deserves the attention of those who want to relax at sea, and all lovers of the ancient culture.  The rich architectural heritage and many beaches will pleasantly surprise foreign travelers who prefer privacy. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Samos, the ninth most populated island, is separated from Turkey by Eptastadio, a canal about 1600 meters wide.  The lands of the paradise, part of the Eastern Sporades archipelago, are considered the most fertile in Greece, and the wonderful wine with a mild taste ‚ÄúWafi‚Äù has long been known outside the country. </p><p>  Before the ice age, Samos was part of <span>Asia Minor,</span> and due to its favorable geographical position, the Greeks quickly populate it.  In ancient times, it was one of the richest colonies of Hellas, and later the island becomes an economically developed metropolis of Ancient Greece. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samos island greece" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1540629.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the Byzantine period, it receives the status of autonomy, and in the 15th century its inhabitants leave the fertile place due to the constant raids of pirates.  And only ten years later, the <span>uninhabited island of</span> Samos is inhabited by Orthodox migrants who were looking for a secluded corner across the ocean.  In 1830 it was annexed to the Ottoman Empire, and during this period the center of the Ionian culture literally flourishes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the beginning of the 20th century, Samos became part of Greece.  During World War II, it was occupied by Italian and German troops, and bombing destroys many of the sights of the island.  And only with the development of tourism a unique example of the history and nature of Greece returns its lost position. </p><h2>  Climate Legends of the Island </h2><p>  The mild Mediterranean climate, characterized by sunny summers, short and warm winters, will appeal to adults and children.  Beneficial to the respiratory system, it contributes to a pleasant pastime throughout the year.  Summer heat (up to 35 degrees) is easily tolerated thanks to a refreshing sea breeze.  The swimming season begins in May and ends at the end of October. </p><h2>  A place for relaxed and active relaxation </h2><p>  <span>The Greek island of</span> Samos, whose capital is the city of the same name, is a wonderful place to relax.  Equipped beaches, warm sea, picturesque landscapes, developed hotel infrastructure have recently attracted an increasing number of tourists.  Many attractions allow guests to spend their holidays to good use. </p><h2>  Temple of Hera </h2><p>  In the south of the resort is its historical center, named after Pythagoras.  Here are the ruins of one of the most important monuments of ancient civilization - the temple dedicated to Hera. </p><p>  Even the historian Herodotus in his works singled out several wonders of the world, among which was the majestic sanctuary of the wife of Zeus, located on the territory of a blossoming corner of paradise.  According to legends, Hera from the island of Samos became the wife of the formidable son of Kronos, who knows the whole world.  The followers of the cult of the goddess who patronized the marriage set out to erect a structure in her honor, and in 720 BC a temple appeared surrounded by a large number of columns. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hera from Samos" class="if" height="489" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1540653.jpg" width="600"></div>

The high temple served as a model for other structures, but after a strong earthquake it was destroyed.  Now visitors to the archaeological site can observe one column, which has been preserved since time immemorial. </p><h2>  Underground Aqueduct Tunnel </h2><p>  In Pythagorio, the second important attraction is located - the aqueduct, which is an underground tunnel.  Hollowed out in the rock, he provided the inhabitants of the island with clean water.  A unique building, which is a masterpiece of engineering at that time, Herodotus also included in the list of the main wonders of the world. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samos island" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1540640.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Monument to the philosopher and a cave named after him </h2><p>  The name of the great Pythagoras is associated with several more interesting places that tourists who come to the picturesque island of Samos must visit.  Attractions are of <span>genuine interest</span> to guests of the resort.  On the seashore stands a monument dedicated to the ancient Greek philosopher, and at the foot of Mount Kersis there is a cave named after him.

    <p>  Nobody leaves here without a bottle of sparkling drink and freshly squeezed olive oil. </p><h2>  What else to bring from the island? </h2><p>  The main souvenir of Samos is considered the "circle of justice" invented by Pythagoras.  At that time, water was worth its weight in gold, and the <span>ancient Greek mathematician</span> and philosopher were instructed to come up with a special vessel that would allow working slaves to fairly distribute life-giving moisture among themselves. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samos island greece reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1540674.jpg" width="342"></div>
