    <p>  Guests of the complex can use two tennis courts, windsurfing, snorkeling.  For the youngest tourists, the hotel has a mini club (for children under 12 years old), a separate pool, a children's playground and a games room.  The main restaurant for kids has a special menu. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Amwaj Rotana Jumeirah Beach Residence 5 * hotel is located on the coast itself, in order to get there is no beach you need to walk only through the complex and cross the road.  But it is worth noting that the hotel does not have its own territory on the coast.  Directly in front of the hotel is a public beach where everyone can relax (free of charge).  The only drawback is the fact that in this place the coast is not equipped with sunbeds and umbrellas.  Everything you need to relax must be carried with you from the hotel.  If it does not seem convenient for someone, then guests of Amwaj Rotana Jumeirah Beach Residence 5 * (photos are given in the article) can always relax on the equipped beach of the neighboring complex. </p><h2>  A bit about the resort </h2><p>  The UAE is a stunning country, which until recently has not stood out from other states in the Middle East.  Today, the emirates delight numerous tourists with luxury and stunning architecture.  In a matter of years, the desert sands were replaced by the unique beauty of the greenery of new plantings.  In record time, not only the entire coastal strip of the Emirate of Dubai was built up, but also whole islands were washed up, on which many hotels and entertainment complexes currently operate. </p><p>  The fabulous riches, beauty and splendor of cities, large plantings, expensive shopping centers, entertainment venues, networks of the latest freeways - all this splendor attracts thousands of tourists.  New fashionable areas are adjacent to the golden sands of the desert and the blue waters of the bay, combining natural beauty with the creations of human hands. </p><p>  The city of Dubai itself extends along the coast of the beautiful Persian Gulf for 134 kilometers.  The most popular place for a beach holiday is the Jumeriah (Jumeirah) area.  The most respectable and luxurious hotels have been built here, including Amwaj Rotana Jumeirah Beach Residence 5 * (UAE).  Such a huge popularity of the area is explained very simply.  Here are the best beaches of the resort. </p><p>  The coast of Jumeirah can be roughly divided into two parts - Jumeirah Beach (occupies 25 kilometers of the coast) and Jumeirah Beach Residence (JBR) (length 1.7 kilometers).  JBR is part <span>of the Dubai</span> Marina area.  Jumeirah Beach Residence is small (about two square kilometers), but in this region 40 skyscrapers rise from 18 to 49 floors.  All buildings end 200 meters from the beach, leaving the picturesque wide coastal strip untouched.  The area was built quickly enough.  Within three years, all 40 buildings were erected.  In 2010, the entire complex was commissioned.  Now the area is a stunning beautiful place.  Here you can live on the beach throughout the year and at the same time be close to all the modern benefits of civilization. </p>

    <p>  Along the coast a promenade lined with paving stones was built.  Along the boardwalk, decorated with palm trees and lanterns, there are numerous shops, restaurants and bars with outdoor terraces.  In the evenings, the promenade becomes the center of resort life, thousands of tourists go for a walk along it.  The influx of people subsides only far after midnight. </p><h2>  Amwaj Rotana Jumeirah Beach Residence 5 *: tourist reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, I certainly want to refer to the reviews of guests who have visited such a luxurious place.  Since Dubai is a large enough resort city, it would not hurt the newcomers who are planning their first train to come to the areas to understand where they are going, because the beaches and infrastructure in different regions are different.  As we mentioned earlier, Amwaj Rotana Jumeirah Beach Residence (photo gallery is in the article) is located in the expensive area of ‚Äã‚ÄãJBR.  Here are the best and most beautiful hotels of the coast.  One of these is Amwaj Rotana Jumeirah Beach Residence (‚Äú29 palms‚Äù - Pavel Aksenov‚Äôs blog will help inexperienced tourists to choose an area for their vacation in Dubai). </p><p>  The multi-storey modern complex is located in a new area by the sea, so all the apartments have a beautiful view of the coast.  Not every hotel can offer such a nice bonus.  On vacation, it is always nice to admire the chic sea views, rather than the construction site or the windows of the neighboring hotel.  All rooms are equipped with French windows, which allows you to see the sea without getting out of bed. </p>

    <p>  Near the complex there is a bus stop.  Hotel guests can always combine a beach holiday with shopping trips to the Dubai Marina shopping centers.  The hotel also has a shuttle bass that takes tourists to shopping malls.  His timetable can be found at the reception of the complex.  Near the hotel there is a tram with links to the metro.  In general, the hotel has a favorable location. </p><h2>  Room Reviews </h2><p>  Amwaj Rotana Jumeirah Beach Residence (Dubai) is a young complex.  Its number of rooms is distinguished by luxurious interiors and good equipment.  The apartments are well-conditioned, it is very important in high temperatures.  Bathrooms are equipped with good fixtures, maintained in excellent condition and clean.  There are always detergents on the shelves, replenished daily by maids, slippers and bathrobes are also provided for guests. </p><p>  The furniture in the room is new, without defects.  Large flat-screen TVs are connected to satellite TV, but the selection of Russian channels is small.  Ironing facilities are available upon request. </p><p>  The room has a minibar filled with drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic); upon settlement, a deposit must be paid for it.  If you do not plan to use it, then simply do not leave money and ask to remove its contents.  Every day, tourists are given a bottle of drinking water and replenished assortment of tea sets in the room. </p><p>  Apartment cleaning is commendable.  Every day, the maids very carefully clean the apartment, leaving behind pleasant little things in the form of floral arrangements on the bed and fresh towels.  Experienced tourists still recommend leaving a tip to staff.  Although none of the hotel employees hints at a cash reward.  It can be seen that the staff was carefully selected and instructed to the smallest detail.  Each employee smiles and greets you several times a day.  Here you will never see a displeased expression addressed to you. </p>

    <p>  For any questions you may contact the reception.  Tourists note that at present a lot of Russian-speaking workers have appeared in the hotel, so knowledge of English is not necessary. </p><h2>  Hotel Food Reviews </h2><p>  What about the food situation at Amwaj Rotana Jumeirah Beach Residence?  Tours offered by agencies allow you to choose the type of food that is most acceptable to you.  But, as a rule, our tourists prefer all inclusive.  The main restaurant offers an incredibly large assortment of buffet dishes.  Vacationers can enjoy excellent dishes of world cuisine. </p><p>  The waiters in the restaurant are top notch.  The power system is organized in such a way that no queues arise.  Breakfast is served from the very early morning until eleven o'clock: sleep lovers have the opportunity to enjoy morning relaxation, and the ‚Äúearly birds‚Äù can eat and go to the coast. </p><p>  Some tourists do not return to the hotel for lunch, but prefer to order food in one of the restaurants and cafes on the waterfront (the journey from the beach to the hotel takes no more than five minutes). </p><p>  Twice a week, the hotel hosts a Ladys Knight.  Ladies visiting the complex‚Äôs restaurants on these evenings receive a bonus in the form of two free drinks.  The hotel has several bars offering its visitors the most delicious drinks.  All tourists are very pleased with the quality of food and the range of dishes.  Such positive reviews about food are far from often encountered, since this particular issue causes a lot of disputes between vacationers. </p><h2>  General impression of the complex </h2><p>  Analyzing the reviews of tourists, we can say that the hotel is a great place for a beach holiday.  Located on the coast itself, it has direct access to the sea.  The beach opposite the hotel is not equipped with umbrellas and sunbeds, but this is not so important.  Umbrellas can be rented at the hotel and taken to the shore, or you can use the nearby beach, which has all the benefits of civilization.  For guests, beach towels are provided free of charge. </p>

    <p>  The coast of the JBR region has access to the open sea, unlike the coastline of Jumeirah Palm, which can be attributed to significant advantages.  The beach near the hotel is not overloaded with people, there is no such crowding as in other areas of the city, which has a relaxing holiday.  Sunset in the sea is gentle and sandy. </p><p>  Experienced tourists who managed to visit this hotel more than once notice a slight decrease in prices for tours to Amwaj Rotana Jumeirah Beach Residence 5 *.  Room reservation in such a complex guarantees a wonderful stay in comfortable conditions with a decent level of service.  Therefore, reducing the cost of tours is a great opportunity to visit one of the Rotana hotels. </p><p> The hotel complex is of interest not only as a great place for a beach holiday, but also good for business trips and shopping.  There is no animation at the hotel, but yoga classes are held in the mornings.  A spa, which is recommended for tourists to visit, and a modern fitness center are on site.  In the evenings, vacationers can walk along the promenade, where until late at night there is a noticeable revival - here is the center of resort life.  In general, it is difficult for a non-seasoned tourist to ‚Äúembrace the immense‚Äù, because for such a short vacation time you want to see as much as possible.  Dubai offers its guests so many interesting things that in one trip it is impossible to see even a small part of its beauties. </p><p>  Representatives of tour operators offer vacationers all kinds of trips: Creek Canal, Dancing Fountain, Jumeirah Mosque, Dubai, Venice, the gold market, spice market and much more.  Convenient transport interchange near the hotel, gives tourists the opportunity to independently visit some attractions and large shopping malls. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Amwaj Rotana Jumeirah Beach Residence (the reviews are given in the article) is a worthy hotel for relaxation with a high level of service and comfort.  If both of these components are important for you on vacation for a full-fledged relocation, the complex will become a good vacation spot, in which the principle of "price-quality" is fully respected. </p>
