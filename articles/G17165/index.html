The lion's share of companies that manufacture such devices are Chinese manufacturers who actively copy design from the ‚Äútop‚Äù world-famous development companies. </p><p>  Today we will talk about another <span>Chinese company</span> that presents its products in our market.  It's about Haier.  A manufacturer with that name may not be familiar to you at all.  However, this does not mean that its products do not deserve our attention.  Especially if you are interested in similar budget models that are becoming more technological and functional. </p>

    <h2>  About company </h2><p>  If you think that we are now characterizing some small brand that has just begun its path to leadership in the mobile industry, you are mistaken.  In fact, the Haier phone has long been in demand and is actively sold in the Chinese and South Korean markets.  Simply, having received recognition at the local level, the manufacturer decided to go outside the country and look for new markets.  It is not surprising that a Russian buyer who prefers budget smartphones can also appreciate the device.  Perhaps soon the Haier phone will become more famous and will successfully compete with other manufacturers from the Middle Kingdom. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is also difficult to name a ‚Äúyoung‚Äù company: it has been present on the market since 1996.  Of course, during this time she managed to compose her line of mobile devices presented in the lower price segment. </p><h2>  About smartphones </h2>

    <p>  First of all, we will characterize the smallest model presented in the manufacturer's lineup.  We are talking about a smaller display and, in addition, having the most affordable cost, a phone.  Outwardly, it also looks quite simple, showing with its design that it was created for some of the simplest practical solutions.  Despite this, the phone has 3G support, interacts with two SIM cards and costs, at the same time, 2,990 rubles.  It is not surprising that customer reviews call it a great model that completely pays for its price. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The model has a small screen measuring 3.5 inches with a resolution of 480 by 320 pixels;  256 MB RAM, a 0.3 megapixel camera.  Among other things, the device is equipped with a Wi-Fi module, as well as a Bluetooth transmitter. </p><p>  The processor is used MediaTek MT6572, running on two cores with a clock frequency of 1 GHz.  Characteristics show that the Haier w701 is best used as an additional telephone for calls and, moreover, as a portable network access point, which is at hand. </p><h2>  Heier w757 </h2>

    <p>  The reviews characterizing this Haier phone show it on the positive side, noting the excellent value for money. </p><h2>  Powerful W818 </h2><p>  There are gadgets in the manufacturer's lineup, the emphasis of which is on performance, despite the low cost and ‚Äúbudget‚Äù in the assembly of the device.  At a price of 4990, a Qualcomm processor - Snapdragon MSM8212, operating on 4 cores with a frequency of 1.2 GHz, was installed on the Haier w818.  The RAM here, however, did not increase, leaving it at 512 MB. </p><p>  The screen resolution is 540 by 480 pixels, while the density of their placement on the Haier w818 is 220 dpi.  This indicates the clarity of the picture and the high quality of the display of the device as a whole.  We also managed to find reviews about the model very positive, noting the speed of the device.  This Haier phone can really give a head start to its ‚Äúcolleagues‚Äù in the line. </p><h2>  Tech W852 </h2><p>  At a cost of 5,990 rubles, quite interesting for users of budget smartphones, the W852 model may seem.  It combines a colorful display (having a resolution of 960 by 540 pixels), whose size is 4.5 inches.  Its matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãmade on the basis of IPS technology, which makes the phone an excellent device for watching movies and other entertainment.  The camera has a matrix resolution of 8 megapixels, which allows us to talk about acceptable photos. </p><p>  Additional modules, such as Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth on the Haier w852 device are also available. </p>

    <p>  As for the hardware platform, as already noted above, the phone has a very strong 4-core <span>MediaTek MT6582 processor.</span>  Its core frequency reaches 1.3 GHz;  while the amount of RAM is 1 GB. </p><p>  We can call <span>Haier w852 a</span> very popular device, because it really combines the price with technical specifications and the wide functionality provided by the Android operating system. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúFlagship‚Äù W970 </h2><p>  Like any other manufacturer, the company producing the Haier phone has its own ‚Äúflagship‚Äù - a model that is positioned as the ‚Äúbest‚Äù (in all respects, including the highest cost) in the entire line.  Such is the device W970.  At a cost of 10,990 rubles, the device has a 13-megapixel camera, an HD screen with a resolution of 1280 by 720 pixels, a quad-core processor with a clock frequency of 1.3 GHz. </p><p>  This Haier phone can safely be called the most high-tech of all the other models promoted by the brand.  At the same time, as we see, even if you compare it with other Chinese devices, it has certain advantages.  In particular, the reviews very positively characterize its assembly and the quality of the materials, as well as the entire appearance. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  In fact, we have already seen hundreds of such phones: presented in the budget segment, they have an unremarkable design, developed by a little-known manufacturer in our market.  However, there is something special about these smartphones. </p><p>  According to reviews, freezes and software crashes do not happen here every 10 minutes, unlike many other similar phones.  This means that although the phones are ‚ÄúChinese,‚Äù you can count on their long-lasting service.  In addition, as shown by the manufacturer's instructions, Haier gives a guarantee on its equipment.  And customer reviews confirm this: if you have a problem with the phone, it will be changed.  And it pleases, because you can‚Äôt get such a service from sellers of Chinese online stores, where the price of the device can be the same, and sometimes even higher. </p><p>  Therefore, in general, we can recommend phones of this brand for purchase. </p>
