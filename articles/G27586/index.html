  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Want to know how much to fly to Crete from Moscow? We consider airline offers</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you are going on a trip (and not only to the Greek island of Crete, but anywhere), it is important to think through all the details.  Indeed, the pleasure that you get from the trip depends on planning.  One of the stages of making a route is the purchase of tickets.  In this sense, the question of how much to fly to Crete from Moscow is by no means an idle one.  After all, the popular island can be reached by direct flight, and with transfers.  Moreover, the last option, paradoxically, may be much cheaper than the first.  Of course, a trip with one or more transfers will take time.  But you can relax at the docking airports and at least out of the corner of your eye to see new countries.  And at the same time, it‚Äôs also significant to save on airfare.  Let's find out in more detail how much to fly to Crete from Moscow. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fspilotshop.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How much to fly to Crete from Moscow" class="if uuid-2234575" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2234575.jpg"></div><h2>  Direct flight </h2><p>  If you fly to the island to relax, you want to reach your destination as quickly as possible.  Therefore, it is worth thinking about a touchdown point, which will not be very far from your hotel.  There are three airports on the island, and all of them have international status.  But direct flights from Moscow are accepted only by the main air harbor of Crete - Nikos Kazantsakis in the main city of Heraklion.  It should be noted that the transport connection on the island is excellent.  And if you are determined to take a direct flight, then from <span>Heraklion airport</span> you will quickly get to your resort.  How long does it take to fly to Crete from Moscow?  It depends on the chosen airline.  So, liners of the Greek company ‚ÄúAegean Airlines‚Äù will fly you to Heraklion in three hours and forty-five minutes.  If you trust the Russian air carrier more, then Aeroflot will deliver you to the capital of Crete in 4 hours 10 meters. A trip with another Greek company, Ellinair, will be ten minutes shorter.  As you can see, the path is short-lived.  Four hours on board is a relatively short period.  And you will not get off the ramp as tired as if you were following the Dominican Republic or Australia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="flight-report.com" data-author=": YONATAN PAZ, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow - Crete: flight time" class="if uuid-2234585" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2234585.jpg"></div><h2>  How many flights to Crete from Moscow with transfers? </h2><p>  If you want to save money and get to Heraklion airport for less money, you will have to use connecting flights.  And here a truly huge selection opens before the traveler.  You can use the services of reputable airlines, famous for their high level of service and comfort, as well as low-cost airlines, offering just ridiculous prices for tickets on the Moscow-Crete route.  The flight time will increase.  But if you guess, then not by much.  If you make a transplant in the capital of Greece or in the second largest city of the country, Thessaloniki, then the whole trip will take only five hours and ten minutes.  In this case, you need to use the services of Egeyan Airlines and Olympic Air.  Another tempting offer - with a change in Prague.  Traveling with Smart Wings and Czech Airlines will last six and a half hours. </p><div class="photo" data-original="news.gtp.gr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow - Crete: how much to fly" class="if uuid-2234600" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2234600.jpg"></div><h2>  How to save on a ticket, but quickly get to Crete </h2><p>  In the summer, Heraklion Nikos Kazantsakis Airport is very crowded.  Numerous charters arriving from different countries, including large cities of Russia, are added to regular flights.  These are travel companies chartering planes and sending their customers to the island's resorts.  Of course, 99% of charter passengers bought the whole package of services.  But there is still one percent that an independent traveler can take advantage of.  On such Moscow-Crete liners, the flight time is the same as on regular flights, but the ticket costs much cheaper.  Charters have their drawbacks.  So, a ticket can be bought just a few days before departure.  And there will be less services on board.  Charter flights can postpone or delay departure. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mirumvillas.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Flight Moscow - Crete" class="if uuid-2234603" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2234603.jpg"></div><h2>  Moscow-Crete: how much to fly to other airports of the island </h2><p>  If you get with transfers, then why not choose the closest air harbor to the resort as the place of landing?  There are no direct flights to Chania and Sitia from the capital of Russia.  But the flight Moscow-Crete will not be long if you first get to Thessaloniki or Athens on the wings of Aeroflot.  The whole journey will take six hours at a glance, because Olympic Air liners fly from these Greek cities to Chania several times a day.  The third international airport of <span>Crete, Sitia,</span> can be reached with the help of Egean Airlines.  In this case, passengers are waiting for a transfer in Athens.  <span>It</span> takes six hours and 45 minutes to <span>travel</span> .  There is another option, with a landing in Istanbul.  Turkish Airlines and Olympic Air will take you to Sitia in seven hours and 40 minutes. </p>
