In order to somehow protect themselves in an accident, the driver needs to take out an insurance policy. </p><p>  Every year, more and more motorists are wondering how to restore the CTP insurance discount.  This is due to the fact that when renewing a car citizen, the cost of the policy is calculated without taking into account the discount.  This is a rather unpleasant situation, especially if the driver has a large continuous accident-free experience and the discount amount reaches 50 percent. </p><p>  The burning of accumulated bonuses may seem like a hopeless situation, however, there are several ways by which you can restore the KBM ( <span>bonus-malus coefficient)</span> .  This and much more will be discussed in this article. </p><h2>  Why can MSC be calculated incorrectly? </h2>

    <p>  All information about insurance experience and previous policies is stored in a single electronic database AIS, which is under the jurisdiction of the PCA.  When making changes to the database and updating data on a particular driver, various errors can be made that will cause an incorrectly calculated discount on car insurance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition, there are a number of other reasons for the reduction of MSC, among which the most common are: </p><ol><li>  <span>Replacement of a driver‚Äôs license</span> or data about an individual. </li><li>  The insurer did not transmit driver information to RSA. </li><li>  Mistakes made by the insurance agent when filling out the policy. </li><li>  Change in insurance program. </li><li>  Interruption of trouble-free experience. </li><li>  Permission to drive a car to several drivers. </li></ol><p>  Regardless of the reason for the burning of insurance points, each driver can return the overpayment for compulsory motor third-party liability insurance and restore the discount in one of several ways, which will be discussed a little further, but for now, each reason should be considered in more detail. </p><h2>  Replacing a driver‚Äôs license or personal data </h2><p>  One of the most frequently asked questions for many drivers is: "How to restore the CTP insurance discount after replacing a license?"  And this is not surprising, because every motorist has changed his driver‚Äôs license at least once in his life.  Each document is assigned an individual number, which must be entered into a single electronic database.  If this is not done, then the insurance history is reset, and you will not receive any discounts when applying for the policy.  The same applies to changing the name. </p><h2>  The insurer did not transmit to the PCA the necessary information about the client </h2>

How to restore the CTP insurance discount (Rosgosstrakh offers its customers such an opportunity) will be discussed a little later.

This is due to the fact that if incorrect data are entered into the policy, then they will also go to the AIS, as a result of which the driver will be perceived as a completely different person. </p><h2>  Admission to driving a few persons </h2><p>  This situation applies mainly to corporate transport, which is used by several company employees.  In this case, when registering the MTPL policy, the smallest size of KBM will be taken into account. </p><h2>  Change in insurance program or interruption of trouble-free service </h2><p>  If the driver has not been involved in traffic accidents for one full year, then he will be credited with insurance points that provide a discount when renewing the policy.  If the insurance program has been changed or the driver has not been driving a car for more than one year, then all the accumulated points are burned up and the KBM is reset.  How to recover discounts on <span>compulsory motor third party liability insurance</span> in this case?  Unfortunately, nothing. </p><h2>  Is it worth restoring insurance points? </h2>

If the car owner regularly gets into an accident, then when applying for an insurance policy, a coefficient of 2.45 is charged to him.  It follows that he will have to pay almost 2.5 times more for the insurance of his vehicle than the average driver.

In addition, if the insurer incorrectly calculated the coefficient for previous policies, then when restoring points, the driver will receive compensation. </p><h2>  The main methods of recovery of the KBM </h2><p>  So, you turned to the insurance company to renew the policy and found that it has risen in price.  What to do in this case, and how to restore the CTP insurance discount?  VSK offers its customers help, other insurance companies - too.  The first thing to calm down, because there is nothing wrong with that. </p><p>  You can return the previous discount by: </p><ul><li>  applying to the UK; </li><li>  appeals to the Central Bank of the Russian Federation; </li><li>  compiling a <span>complaint to the PCA.</span> </li></ul><p>  Each of the methods has certain nuances, therefore, it is necessary to dwell on each of them in more detail. </p><h2>  <span>Solving a problem</span> through an insurer </h2><p>  Many drivers are interested in the question: "How to restore the CMTPL discount after replacing the rights?"  The easiest and fastest way will be to contact your insurer.  Current legislation obliges insurance companies to consider all complaints and appeals of clients related to CTP. </p><p>  In this regard, on the websites of most UK there is even a special section in which you can file a complaint online.  Scans of the previous policy or a certificate certifying the absence of insurance cases from the client issued by the insurer will need to be attached to the form.  If you do not have access to the Internet, you can write a written application and send it by registered mail to the physical address of the company.  The application must be submitted in duplicate, and also photocopies of the above documents are attached to it. </p>

According to the legislation of the Russian Federation, the insurance company has 10 days, during which it must establish the problem of combustion of KBM and solve this problem.  And how to restore the CTP insurance discount, if a year has passed, you ask?  Unfortunately, this case does not provide for the possibility of restoring the MSC.

    <h2>  What if the insurance company was liquidated? </h2><p>  If the insurer with whom you issued the insurance policy no longer operates, then you can restore the MSC through the CBR or RSA.  You will learn more about the procedure for applying and submitting documents to these authorities. </p><h2>  Applying to the Central Bank </h2><p>  How to recover a CTP discount through the Central Bank of the Russian Federation?  It is very simple, however, it is necessary to take into account the fact that this instance considers only those appeals of citizens submitted under compulsory motor third-party liability insurance that have completed their operation no more than one year ago. </p><p>  To restore the KBM, you need to go to the Internet reception of the Central Bank and fill out an online form, making all the necessary information and specifying ‚ÄúIncorrect calculation of the KBM‚Äù as the reason.  It will also be necessary to attach a scan of the previous policy or a certificate confirming the absence of insurance payments to the form.  This method is very convenient, since the driver will receive notifications about the status of his application for e-mail.  The time it takes for the Central Bank to make a decision can take up to 30 days, during which the authorities will check the relevance of the information provided by the driver, establish the cause of the problem and make a final decision. </p><p>  Now you know how to recover a CTP discount.  Alfastrakhovanie and the Central Bank of the Russian Federation help to solve this problem on the same principle.  If suddenly, for any reason, contacting these instances does not bring any results, then you should file a complaint with the PCA, which is the most powerful tool in solving this problem. </p><h2>  PCA appeal </h2>

It can not only exert significant pressure on the UK, but also deprive them of a license, which every insurer is afraid of.  Therefore, when mentioning only the name of this instance, any insurer will strive by all means to solve the client's problem.  It is worth noting that the PCA is not entitled to make any changes to a single electronic database, since this is the responsibility of insurance companies.

    <p>  So, how to restore CTP insurance discounts in RSA?  The official Internet resource of this instance provides detailed instructions on how to restore discounts on the CTP policy.  You can also find the corresponding application form and contacts for advice. </p><h2>  Recovery of KBM through an insurance broker </h2><p>  This method of restoring insurance points is not the most successful, but it cannot be completely ruled out.  Motorists prefer to avoid these companies, as they charge a fee for the provision of their services.  Nevertheless, they work very quickly and will be able to help you restore the CTP insurance discount for 1 day.  The only exception is the case if you have previously been involved in a traffic accident, the culprit of which you yourself were. </p><p>  Appeal to <span>insurance brokers</span> will be justified if you do not have time to independently repair the KBM for auto-citizens, and the accumulated points provide a really big discount.  Otherwise, you will pay for the services of the company much more than save on insurance. </p><h2>  Repair KBM over the Internet </h2>

    <p>  On the World Wide Web, you can find many online services, among which there are both paid and free, which allow you to quickly and easily recover KBM.  All that is required of you is to fill out a special form and attach scans of the necessary documents to it.  However, one should carefully approach the choice, since in recent years a lot of cybercriminals have divorced. </p><h2>  What documents may be needed to restore the MSC? </h2><p>  To restore your legitimate discount on insurance earned for many years of trouble-free driving, you must submit certain documents.  The most important of these are last year's insurance policies.  If for some reason you cannot find them, then in this case you will need to contact the insurer and ask him to submit a certificate proving the absence of insurance cases. </p><p>  In some cases, the insurer may ask you from the traffic police about the absence of offenses, so that the recovery process went as quickly as possible, it is worth getting it in advance.  However, there is one small caveat.  The thing is that the traffic police is not obliged to provide such certificates, so it all depends on the loyalty of the law enforcement defender. </p><p>  It will not be superfluous to take screenshots from the PCA website, as well as photocopies of the technical passport for the vehicle, driver‚Äôs license and certificate of inspection.  Having copies of all these documents can significantly speed up and simplify the application process. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

This article examined all the methods for solving problems with car insurance that exist today.  As practice shows, in most cases it all ends with contacting the insurance company.  Indeed, despite the fact that insurers are very reluctant to accept applications from their clients, however, no one wants to pay a large fine or lose their license.  However, if suddenly for some reason the UK was unable to solve the problem of the incorrect calculation of the coefficient, then you can always contact the higher authorities.
