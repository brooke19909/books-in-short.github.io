  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Steam cleaner Karcher. Universal Assistant Reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In this article I want to bring to your attention a <span>Karcher steam cleaner, reviews</span> of which you undoubtedly saw on the Internet.  Probably, for every woman, cleaning is a punishment.  Imagine how hard it is when you scrub, clean, clean, and the like all day, and there wasn‚Äôt the desired cleanliness in the house.  And what to do in this situation?  Women go to all kinds of tricks and experiments.  More and more new detergents are being produced.  I dare to note that over the past ten years the number of people who are contraindicated to use them has increased several times.  A steam cleaner Karcher can come to the rescue in this situation. </p><p>  Devices of this type will help you get rid of indelible stains on tiles, in the bathroom, in the kitchen.  You can use a steam cleaner to get to the dirt in hard-to-reach places - behind the toilet and in radiators.  Feel free to walk your steam assistant on carpets and furniture.  Many people buy such devices in order to regulate the humidity in the house. </p><p>  Let's look at how Karcher steam cleaner works and how much it costs.  Reviews indicate that the devices of this company are much cheaper than their counterparts from other manufacturers, and in some cases they have even more power.  As for the price, it is justified and relatively low.  Especially this news pleases allergy sufferers. </p><p>  If you are allergic to <span>detergents</span> or just dust, then you definitely need a Karcher steam cleaner.  Reviews indicate that with a steam engine you can forget about detergents for a long time.  Powerful jets of steam remove dirt, dust, fungus, stains on the floor and tiles.  From my own practice, I can say that the best assistant in removing greasy stains and scale on a stove is the Karcher steam cleaner.  Reviews about him do not lie and even sometimes downplay his capabilities. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In my opinion, among the products of this manufacturer there is no absolutely perfect model, each of them has its own small flaw.  The most unpleasant of them are a monolithic tank with water and an unwindable power cord.  These are the biggest disadvantages, but considering the compactness and overall efficiency of the device, this is not so important. </p><p>  Even when buying, I was afraid that it would be very difficult, because  quite often you need to pick it up and carry it with you.  It turned out I was wrong.  The total weight with a full tank does not exceed 5 kilograms.  In my opinion, the undoubted advantage is that Karcher steam cleaners have a very long steam supply pipe, though not telescopic, but nevertheless, with this hose you can even reach those corners of your apartment that you did not know about.  The only thing my apparatus could not handle was the fat in the oven of my oven.  As I did not try, getting rid of it without detergents was quite problematic. </p><p>  I want to note that with the advent of this device in our home, I stopped worrying about furniture ticks and mold in the joints on the tiles.  After cleaning with a steam cleaner, it seems as if the apartment is completely sterile.  In fact, the way it is, the temperature of the steam when applied to the work surface is about 120 degrees Celsius.  You must admit that no microbe can survive at this temperature. </p><p>  By the way, many friends ask what to do with carpets and furniture, because by direct supply of steam you can simply wet the sofa, but there is no effect.  In such a situation, it is better to use a nozzle for carpets with a special removable napkin, which is included in the kit.  A standard set of steam cleaners also comes with a set of nozzles for spot injection and a brush for the kitchen.  It is worth noting that before starting cleaning it is better to stock up with enough rags, as  this is not a vacuum cleaner, but a cleaner, therefore, wipes need to be changed periodically. </p>
