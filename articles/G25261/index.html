    <h2>  About the cost of living </h2><p>  Luxury Bahia Principe Esmeralda 5 * receives positive reviews, and this is not surprising - after all, here, in addition to a high-class level of service and comfortable conditions, prices are still quite modest for five stars. </p><p>  If, for example, one and a half months before arrival in the winter, two guests decide to book a room for a week, then they will have to pay only 90 thousand rubles.  And this is with the all-inclusive service!  Are you planning a trip together?  Then the price will increase to 125 thousand rubles.  But it will be even more economical, because then each person will have to pay only 40 thousand per stay. </p><p>  If the third person is a child, then the price will be 110 thousand rubles.  during the week.  But rest for 2 adults and their two children will cost about 135 thousand rubles. </p><p>  But you should know that these are not fixed prices.  They vary depending on the season and other nuances.  Therefore, if you want to save money, it is better to regularly monitor prices, and try to choose a moment for relaxation, in which they will be the lowest. </p><h2>  Important information </h2><p>  There is one significant nuance that anyone interested in vacationing here should know.  So, starting from the first of January next, 2017, only adult guests (from 18 years old) will be allowed to stay at this hotel.  That is, arrival with children will already be impossible.  Which, in principle, is logical, because the hotel is aimed more at youth recreation. </p><p>  And a couple of nuances about living.  Check-in starts at 15:00, but if people have arrived earlier, and their room has already been cleaned and prepared for living, they will be taken to the apartment immediately.  But the departure lasts until 13:00, so tickets for the flight back need to be selected, taking into account this fact. </p><p>  When applying for a reservation, you will need to provide your own credit card details - either ‚ÄúVisas‚Äù or ‚ÄúMaster Card‚Äù.  Then it will have to be presented upon check-in.  But payment is only in US dollars - these are the rules of the hotel. </p>
