  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Holidays in Hungary.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Every year more and more people gather for holidays in Hungary.  In 2010, for all the time there were more than 40 million tourists, some of whom came to this country more than once during the year.  Basically, all vacationers are attracted by both the natural and special architectural beauties of the country.  The great capital of Hungary, the small city of Budapest, is especially rich in various famous sights.  Very close to it are resorts with therapeutic <span>thermal springs.</span>  The city itself is located on the territory of the picturesque banks of the Danube, which in turn are surrounded by a chain of mountains.  For the unusual and romantic atmosphere prevailing here, the famous <span>capital of Hungary</span> received its unique name ‚Äúlittle Paris‚Äù. </p><p>  The mouth of the Danube, which is located just north of its common source, is a favorite destination for local residents and foreign tourists.  For the sake of this place, many travelers buy last-minute tours to Hungary.  In addition, the low chains of the local mountains that are marked by the ‚ÄúAlpine‚Äù character, and have throughout their wooded slopes a lot of small rest houses and tourist hotels, are especially notable.  The numerous resorts have unique towns of hotels that were developed in ancient times by artists and sculptors.  Also, there are countless art galleries and small but cozy romantic restaurants. </p><p>  <span>Lake Balaton,</span> in turn, is the center of children's and family vacations in the country.  But besides children, <span>sailing</span> legends <span>,</span> rowing and surfing enthusiasts, as well as ordinary tourists who spend active vacations in Hungary on <span>water skis</span> or fishing rods, spend their holidays here every year.  The hillsides around the lake, covered with volcanic type of rocks are the most valuable places for shrinkage of vineyards and, accordingly, for the development of winemaking.  It is worth noting especially the taste of the local wines, because Hungarian wines are almost inferior to the famous Tokai drinks. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The sandy southern shore of Lake Balaton creates excellent conditions for swimming in the summer.  Unlike the unique, picturesque and less developed northern side of the coast, the southern, in turn, has been developed much more, although resorts began to develop here about a hundred years later.  But during this time they managed to lay down well-maintained beaches, which also have a variety of active entertainment, which in many ways attract many travelers of any age to rest in Hungary.  So, last-minute trips to Hungary with the advent of new resort centers began to be bought even more often. </p><p>  National color and relaxation in Hungary. </p><p>  One of the natural national features of this country is music and dancing.  Hungary is a unique country of music and dance, in which this wonderful mixture has grown into real national Slavic music with subtle oriental shades and passionate gypsy motifs.  Hungarians can actually spend a tremendous amount of time playing their musical instruments.  That is why, they like to arrange many modern music festivals, which most often begin at the beginning of the year, and end with a real carnival in the summer, during the arrival of tourists.  In addition, if the dances and musical customs of this country have not really impressed you, then you have a great opportunity to go to the famous Formula 1 in early August and cheer on your favorite riders.  Also, carnivals of flowers and wine weeks are held here annually, which end at the end of the year with hydropathic and bath houses. </p>
