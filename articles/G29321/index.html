  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Visa-free countries are a great outlet for Russian tourists.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many of our compatriots are interested in the answer to the question of which visa-free countries a Russian tourist can go to.  The fact is that the visa process is often not very pleasant.  In our country, so it happens beyond measure of all sorts of bureaucratic difficulties in processing various documents.  Countries with a <span>visa-free regime</span> attract travelers so much, just because there is no need to overshadow the anticipation of the trip by submitting documents.  In addition, it is necessary to prove their solvency, and then just languish, not knowing whether they will refuse or not.  Experts say that visa-free countries often attract more tourists than those requiring a visa.  Surely many people know that there are countries for which the procedure for obtaining a visa is a simple formality and you may well be able to go through it right at the airport. </p><p>  If you study this issue in detail, you can find that there are as many as 90 visa-free countries that Russians can freely enter or get a visa without delay right after arrival, absolutely free or for a certain amount.  Of course, this figure includes the <span>CIS countries,</span> which often cause not so much interest as European or African.  But most of all visa-free countries are represented only on the Asian continent. </p><p>  Each country has its own characteristics of a visa-free regime.  Sometimes it also happens that getting a visa upon arrival is no easier than if you were doing this at home a month before the trip.  Suppose, if you want to get a visa, having arrived in Qatar, then first you have to get permission from the local Ministry of Internal Affairs. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Often in countries with a visa-free regime or if you need to get it right upon arrival, you must definitely have confirmation that you have a hotel reservation, return tickets, and also prove that you are solvent.  There are countries where this is just a formality, but it can also happen that you are strictly asked all of the above points. </p><p>  When traveling to Tunisia, it will not be amiss to learn about one feature.  You have the right to be in this country without a visa, only if you arrived by direct flight from Russia, and it is mandatory as part of an organized tourist group, and not longer than 30 days. </p><p>  South Korea also has its oddities.  You can enter this country without a visa only by flying to Jeju Island with a direct flight.  Further miracles begin: if you want to enter this country without a visa no longer than 15 days, then this is only possible if you have been here at least four times in the last 2 years or only 10 times. </p><p>  A Schengen visa can help to visit visa-free countries.  With her, without unnecessary formalities, you will be able to visit Macedonia and Albania.  And in some countries they decided to simply facilitate the preliminary visa application process.  For example, Mexico has already reported that the Russians will be able to freely apply for a visa via the Internet.  To do this, you just need to visit the embassy website, fill out all the necessary documents and an answer will be sent to you by e-mail. </p><p>  In addition, there are not rare cases when Russians are fully confident that there will be no problems with entry, only at the airport they met with gloomy strict border guards who claimed that they had never heard of concessions for Russian citizens.  Therefore, before you go to any country, conduct a thorough investigation and make sure that it applies specifically to visa-free travel. </p><p>  In the far abroad there are also visa-free countries where, under certain conditions, you can freely enter.  For example, Guatemala, Salvador, Fiji, Philippines, Honduras, Colombia, Tunisia, Syria and others. </p><p>  Negotiations are underway with Turkey and Spain regarding the introduction of a visa-free regime for Russians.  Therefore, going on a trip is not so difficult. </p>
