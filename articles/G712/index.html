Reviews of neighbors and acquaintances in this matter, of course, are important, but the owners themselves must competently approach this issue.  This will allow them in the future not to be disappointed in the purchase. </p><h2>  What are washing machines </h2><p>  Essential household appliances are divided into: </p><ul><li>  frontal, in which the loading of linen is carried out through a round transparent hatch located on the side; </li><li>  vertical, the cover of which is located on top. </li></ul><p>  As for the front-view washing machines, they are recognized as the undisputed sales leaders.  They are offered in large quantities by all retail outlets that sell household appliances. </p>

In addition, the range of such models is not very wide.  However, the machines in which top loading of things is carried out have a plus that is very attractive for many housewives.  They can report the laundry during the washing process, without fear that water will flow from the unit.

First of all, you need to determine in which place the automatic washing machine you bought will stand.  Only after this is it possible to choose a model of full dimensions or a super-heavy device. </p><p>  Typical dimensions of washing machines are within the following limits: </p><ul><li>  in width - from 40 to 60 cm; </li><li>  in depth - from 32 to 60 cm; </li><li>  in height - 85 cm. </li></ul><p>  In the event that a frontal washing machine is purchased, which is better?  Customer reviews are advised to purchase units whose depth is 32 cm. These machines are just perfect.  They easily fit even in the smallest corner of the corridor or bathroom, and also fit freely in the kitchen under the worktop.  When choosing a place for your future indispensable assistant, it is worth remembering that her hatch door will require additional space, since it must rotate 180 degrees.  If there is no such area, then you will have to consider buying a car with a vertical filling.  However, it should be borne in mind that the upper part of such a machine cannot be used as a shelf. </p><p>  Laundry is loaded into such super-heavy washing machines of 3 kg.  A machine of this type in this connection is only suitable for small families of several people. </p><h2>  Choosing a car by washing volume </h2><p>  For this parameter, which washing machine is better?  User reviews suggest that a family of 4-6 people will need a full-fledged model.  Such aggregates can wash from 4.5 kg to 5 kg of dry items in one cycle. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  For a very large family, you will need a washing machine, 6 kg of load for which is a normal operating characteristic.  These units are often used by medium and small businesses - small hotels, cafes and restaurants. </p><p>  However, a full-size automatic washing machine, 5 kg or more of dry laundry in which you can wash in one cycle, is not always located in a city apartment.  Then a super-heavy device will be a good way out for a large family.  It is used several times a day, giving the car some time to rest between cycles. </p><h2>  Tank material </h2><p>  For this parameter, which washing machine is better?  Reviews of experts are advised to purchase such units that would not spoil the laundry that is washed in them.  And this is only possible with a stainless steel drum.  Such high-quality material can last more than eighty years.  However, inexpensive washing machines cannot have such a part, since its cost is quite high.  If the family budget does not allow you to purchase equipment that is in a high price category, then you need to consider the option of a tank made of plastic.  This is a composite polymeric material that is resistant to corrosion, the action of detergents and high temperatures, capable of absorbing vibration and is silent in operation.  Manufacturers claim that the life of such tanks is in the range of 20-25 years. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Technical Selection </h2><p>  So, the purpose of your purchase is a washing machine.  Which is better?  Reviews of experts recommend paying special attention to the technical characteristics of the device.  Certain parameters, indicated in the unit's passport in large Latin letters, allow the models to serve their owners the optimal time.  So, pay attention when buying should: </p><ul><li>  the class of the wash itself, indicating its quality and humidity of the laundry at the end of the process; </li><li>  the spin class, on which the careful attitude to things depends; </li><li>  energy class indicating the efficiency of the device; </li><li>  the spin speed, the optimal value of which should be in the range from 400 to 1000 revolutions per minute (a larger indicator will lead to the drying of the laundry, it will be difficult to iron it). </li></ul><p>  In the passport of a household appliance, all these indicators are indicated in different letters.  But keep in mind that A indicates the highest class, while G indicates the lowest. </p><h2>  List of required programs </h2><p>  A good automatic washing machine has extensive functionality.  The number of programs she has can go up to sixteen.  However, among them there are the main ones installed in each model of such units.  This is washing linen and cotton, delicate items and wool, white and colored linen. </p><p>  There are also brands of automatic washing machines, the programs of which have other names.  However, it should be borne in mind that the essence of these functions does not differ from the main ones.  Such an expansion of the number of programs is a successful marketing move that can attract the largest possible number of buyers who are ready to give money for expensive equipment. </p>

    <p>  All existing programs in the machine can be set either using an electronic display, or using the electromechanical path.  <span>Inexpensive washing machines</span> have a second option.  These are budget models of units.  Existence of an electronic board significantly increases the cost of the car. </p><h2>  The need for drying </h2><p>  Complete removal of moisture from the washed laundry is an optional feature for a home helper.  At high spin speeds, all things placed in the washing machine become almost completely ready for ironing. </p><p>  It should be borne in mind that cheap washing machines do not dry clothes.  This feature makes the unit more expensive by 20-30 percent. </p><h2>  Engine selection </h2><p>  The quality of an automatic washing machine depends on its reliability.  And for this parameter, engine performance is of great importance.  After all, it can be attributed to the most important component parts of the unit. </p><p>  As the most reliable in operation, experts recognize asynchronous motors.  They are installed in those machines, the speed of which in spin mode is within 600. At a higher rotational speed of the drum, the models are equipped with a collector motor.  However, it is less durable due to abrasion of the brushes.  The average life of such an engine is only seven years.  And this despite the fact that its cost is one third of the price of the entire unit for washing. </p><h2>  Brand selection </h2><p>  Modern consumers often prefer the technology produced by the famous and popular brand.  However, it should be borne in mind that there are not such common brands of automatic washing machines that are of really high quality.  After all, the companies that produce them have achieved significant success in the production of high-quality devices. </p><p>  So, such brands as AEG and Miele can be attributed to the elite class.  You can also purchase a washing machine, the price of which is optimal for the family budget (within 350-400 cu), but the quality of the unit is very good.  This is a brand of technology from Bosch or Candy, Electrolux or Siemens, as well as Whirlpool. </p><p>  A wonderful option will be a washing machine, the price of which is low (250-300 cu), but the build quality is at a decent level.  These are units of brands such as Ariston and Ardo, Indesit and Beko, as well as Samsung and LG. </p><p>  Good brands of inexpensive cars - "Baby" and "Vyatka", "Atlant" and "Oka". </p><p>  By acquiring such necessary household equipment, you should find out where in your city the washing machines of the selected company are repaired.  If there are no such service centers, then any malfunctions of the unit will cause noticeable difficulties. </p><h2>  That the car served for a long time </h2><p>  Is it possible to operate the machine in such a way as to avoid its breakdown?  To increase the life of the irreplaceable assistant, you should carefully study the instructions.  In addition, hoses and other parts of the unit must be checked as often as possible. </p>

    <p>  Repair of washing machines will not be required for a long time, if you periodically call the wizard for diagnostics and inspection.

These washing machines have different characteristics, a set of programs and functionality.  In order to buy a specific model, it is advisable not only to familiarize yourself with the model range produced by the company, but also with user reviews. </p><h2>  Vyatka washing machines </h2><p>  The largest producer of household washing appliances in Russia is rightfully considered to be Vesta OJSC.  The enterprise got its name from Roman mythology.  In her ancient tales, Vesta was called the goddess of the hearth. </p><p>  The Vyatka washing machine (automatic) is produced at the production site, which is a confident leader among similar Russian enterprises.  It all started back in 1974. </p><p>  It was then that the Vesta Kirov plant acquired a patent and technology for the production of washing machines from the Italian brand Merloni Progetti.  The release of the first sample was carried out six years later.  It was a Vyatka-Automatic 12 washing machine.  The unit was equipped with twelve programmed operations and was an exact copy of Ariston, which at that time cost almost five hundred rubles, which was a huge sum for a simple Soviet man. </p><p>  Today OJSC ‚ÄúVesta‚Äù creates the most modern washing machines.  Moreover, the model range produced by the company was developed using modern technical developments and the wishes of potential customers. </p><p>  The Vyatka washing unit belongs to household appliances of an economy class.  Its price ranges from 8,000 to 10,000 rubles.  The automatic washing machine Zanussi has the same cost. </p><p>  Domestic domestic appliances ‚ÄúVyatka‚Äù are quite roomy.  Their drum holds up to 5 kg of dry laundry.  Buyers save their money not only when buying these wonderful domestic cars.  The unit also allows to reduce utility costs during its operation.  This is made possible due to its belonging to the energy-saving class A. </p><p>  Almost all currently produced models of Vyatka washing machines (automatic) are similar in their functionality.  Only some parameters and the number of available programs may vary. </p><p>  Buyers speak highly of the modern design of the cars produced by Vesta, as well as the opportunity to purchase universal devices of various sizes.  So, the Vyatka-Maria model has the largest dimensions, and the reduced depth is typical for Vyatka-Katyusha units. </p><p>  The entire line of household washing equipment of Vesta OJSC is made from imported components.  Moreover, the models are equipped with the function of half loading the laundry, as well as convenient additional rinsing and washing cycles.  The machines of the Vyatka brand have the ability to ‚Äúennoble‚Äù things.  It blues them, aromatizes, etc. In addition, this ‚Äúsmart‚Äù technique prevents the allergic effect that the chemical elements of washing powder can have on the human body. </p><p>  Vyatka cars are simple and accessible to operate.  They are equipped with an adjustable thermostat, and the number of revolutions that the drum makes during extraction (500-1000) allows the unit to easily cope with the task assigned to it. </p><p>  All products manufactured by Vesta OJSC undergo certification that meets all the requirements of the RF standards. </p><h2>  Atlant brand washing machines </h2><p>  Often, customers when choosing such a unit needed in the household prefer products of the Belarusian brand.  The fact is that the Atlant automatic washing machine attracts customers with its price.  However, this characteristic is not the only positive side of Atlant washing machines.  According to experts, the advantages of this technique are low water consumption.  In addition, the units of the Belarusian plant are characterized by low energy consumption (class A). </p><p>  It is also important that the Atlant cars respond remarkably to possible voltage surges in the network.  After restoring power, the appliance continues to wash without any problems.  Attracts buyers and ease of management of such machines.

This allows the Belarusian company to establish with confidence a significant warranty period equal to ten years. <br>  The entire model range of these washing machines is divided into units equipped with either a liquid crystal display or LED indicators.  The first of these two devices displays the number of revolutions during the spin cycle, the temperature of the water during washing, as well as the time of the entire process and the amount of electricity consumed.

    <p>  Cars with LED indicators work a little differently.  To start the washing process, you only need to turn the knob to the division where the selected program is indicated and press the button to turn it on.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The water temperature will be set automatically. </font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is worth mentioning that Atlant household appliances are manufactured using modern technologies and using innovative materials. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This allows the units to achieve the best results when washing and spinning the laundry placed in them. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Buyers respond positively to the large number of functions that these devices have. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This contributes to the effective washing of laundry, regardless of the characteristics and type of fabric. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Atlant washing machines are produced in various sizes, and their doors can be either white or silver.</font></font></p><p>  Have a good shopping! </p>
