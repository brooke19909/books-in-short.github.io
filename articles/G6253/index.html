This is very convenient, especially for creative natures: poets, artists chose a name that has special meaning, talking about something.  Sometimes the choice of a pseudonym is associated with political activity and helps to hide for a long time.  Especially often this was used by such famous people as V.I. Lenin, I.V. Stalin.  Many people are interested in why Lenin is Lenin? </p><h2>  Leader of the proletariat </h2><p>  Ulyanov Vladimir Ilyich for his <span>political life</span> used a lot of pseudonyms.  The future leader of the Russian proletariat led violent <span>political activity</span> and was a member of the Social Democratic Party.  Of course, he often had to hide, change his name.  One of his pseudonyms was Lenin.  This surname remained with him until the end of his life.  There are several versions of why Lenin took the pseudonym Lenin, and all of them seem plausible. </p><h2>  Lena river </h2><p>  Some historians say that Vladimir Ilyich took this surname by the name of the Lena River.  Legend says that in 1912, workers who staged a strike were shot on this river.  This event shocked V.I. Lenin, and in memory of the dead, he decided to take this pseudonym.  But the fact is that he began to sign with this name much earlier - back in 1901.  So, there was another reason or reason to take the name Lenin (pseudonym).  Why can't this be an imitation? </p>

    <h2>  Plekhanov - Volgin </h2><p>  One cannot but take into account the fact that comrades in the struggle communicated with each other, often imitating each other.  So, knowing that Plekhanov took the pseudonym Volgin for himself, Vladimir Ilyich decided to use a similar name - also from the name of the river.  And that was in 1901. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the same period, the well-known agronomist S. N. Lenin took part in public events.  The future leader of the proletariat often quoted this scientist and could well use his last name.  So, it turns out why Lenin is Lenin.  But no - there is another, more believable version. </p>

    <h2>  Friendly help </h2><p>  It turns out that there was another episode in the life of Lenin, which brought him to this surname.  Before all the events described above, in 1900, Vladimir Ilyich had to urgently leave the Russian Empire.  But this required a foreign passport.  Because of his political activities, Lenin was sure that he would not be allowed to go abroad.  I had to look for another opportunity to apply for a passport.  And at this time, Krupskaya unexpectedly met with her good school friend, who also sympathized with the democratic movement of the socialists.  It was <span>this friend who</span> stole the passport from her father - Lenin Nikolai Yegorovich - and provided him with the future leader of the proletariat.  It was enough to fake only the year of birth, and Vladimir Ilyich became Nikolai Lenin.  Since then, the leader has signed this name.  From history it becomes clear why Lenin is Lenin. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Companion of the leader of the proletariat </h2><p>  The history of the revolution gave birth to its heroes, leaders, and political figures.  The modern generation receives a different education than that in the USSR.  Many do not know the details of the life of Lenin and his associates.  Therefore, they ask the question: why is Lenin - Lenin, and Stalin - Stalin? </p>

    <p>  At the end of the 19th century, the excellent translator E. S. Stalinsky lived and worked.  He was engaged in journalism, was a publisher - editor.  He owns the best translation of Shota Rustaveli's work - The Knight in the Tiger Skin.  During this period, I. Dzhugashvili also wrote poetry and even published.  Of course, he heard about Stalin, read his translations.  From his youth he loved the Kavkaz newspaper.  And ‚ÄúThe Knight in the Tiger Skin‚Äù is one of Stalin's favorite works. </p><h2>  History events </h2><p>  So, reading Georgian literary magazines and newspapers, getting acquainted with the works of E. Stalin, led to the fact that I. Dzhugashvili had great respect for this man.  He also had a wonderful memory: after many years, being an ally of Lenin, Joseph Vissarionovich used the name of Stalin, reducing it.  That is why Lenin is Lenin and Stalin is Stalin.  These pseudonyms have become known throughout the world. </p>

    <p>  Of course, the pseudonyms of politicians are closely connected with the historical events of the period when the state was undergoing a turning point.  But often the name taken is so consistent with the person that many remember him only by a pseudonym and do not know the real name.  But one must study history so that no questions like this arise: why is Lenin - Lenin? </p><p>  Not everyone shares the convictions of revolutionaries, social democrats, and similar figures of the beginning of the last century.  But events have already happened, they must be remembered, studied and known by the leaders of the movement, including their names and pseudonyms. </p>
