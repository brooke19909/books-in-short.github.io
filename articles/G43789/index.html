    <p>  If tourists are more interested in Belarusian goods than foreign brands, then they will be pleased with their assortment by another Minsk megamarket - GUM, which is also located on Independence Avenue, only a few stops from TsUM.  GUM also has more exclusive brands. </p><p>  Also not far from the Central Department Store - on the streets of Bogdanovich, Khoruzhey, Kuibyshev (all this is not far away) there is a scattering of fashionable and small shops of clothes and shoes. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Tourists often choose the Orbita Hotel, having read reviews from its guests on the eve of their departure to Belarus.  And that really makes sense.  After all, this comfortable and inexpensive hotel complex provides its guests with cosiness, quality service, good food, and the attention of helpful staff.  The convenient location of this metropolitan hotel ‚ÄúOrbita‚Äù is also an important factor that attracts tourists to it. </p>
