Deposits, loans, reliability assessment</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  New technologies have penetrated almost all areas of our lives.  Buying clothes, ordering food from a restaurant, paying utility bills and much more today can be done using a smartphone or tablet. </p><p>  <span>Credit organizations</span> also did not stand aside.  Tinkoff Bank (network address - tinkoff.ru) offers its customers exclusively remote service.  This is the only commercial bank that does not have its own ATMs and branches. </p><h2>  In the right direction </h2><p>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating such a credit organization in Russia belongs to Oleg Yuryevich Tinkov, an entrepreneur with rich business experience.  He owns a developed network of household appliance stores, a music label, the production of frozen convenience foods, a brewery and a restaurant business - a Russian businessman has never let down his flair and ability. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tinkoff bank rating" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1174872.jpg" width="333"></div>

    <p>  In 2005, Tinkova became interested in the service model of the American organization Capital One, which specialized in the issue of bank cards.  Together with the consultants of the Boston Consulting Group, Oleg Yuryevich came to the conclusion that a remote bank can work in Russia. </p><h2>  Step by step </h2><p>  At the first stage, Tinkov received a banking license through the purchase of a small ‚ÄúHimmashbank‚Äù.  The main activity was decided to make lending.  Hence the name - ‚ÄúTinkoff Credit Systems‚Äù. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the second stage, the main task was to build a customer base.  Bank <span>card</span> partners <span>received</span> proposals for <span>issuing a credit card</span> - mobile operators, car dealers and insurance companies. </p><p>  The structure continued to evolve.  New investors came, the issuance of debit cards and the acceptance of deposits was arranged, and in 2010 it became possible to order a credit card via the Internet and courier delivery. </p><p>  In early 2015, a decision was made to change the name.  The head office of Tinkoff Bank is located in Moscow. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tinkoff bank address" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1174881.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Reliability Assessment </h2><p>  According to the latest information, Tinkoff is located on the 44th line of the rating for equity and on the 49th line in terms of assets among Russian banks. </p><p>  The rating of Tinkoff Bank directly depends on the assessment of its reliability.  This indicator is a combination of factors that affect the fulfillment of obligations.  The data of the largest agencies Moody's and Fitch Ratings say that in the long term the bank was rated B2 (significant higher vulnerability) and B + (significant highly speculative rating), respectively. </p><p>  To conduct a reliability assessment, the following indicators must be taken into account: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  - liquid assets; </p><p>  - the level of security of loans issued; </p><p>  - structure of own funds; </p><p>  - credit risks. </p><p>  Significant is information about falsification of reports, change of ownership and various rumors.  Given all of the above, over the past year, the rating of Tinkoff Bank cannot be called optimistic.  Various data indicate the emergence of negative trends, which in the future may affect its financial stability. </p><p>  Traditionally, Forbes portal has its own rating.  This time, the bank with remote servicing was in 51st place. </p><h2>  New Generation Bank </h2><p>  A stationary computer, tablet, laptop or smartphone - regardless of the type of device, customers always have access to Tinkoff Bank.  A personal account is the main way to manage your own accounts. </p><p>  <span>Payment of utility</span> bills and fines, transfers between accounts and other individuals, opening deposits, connecting additional services - just a few clicks, and a new generation of online banking will present a schedule of expenses and help you plan your budget. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tinkoff bank loans" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1174871.jpg" width="281"></div>

    <p>  Subscribing to taxes and penalties will allow you to always be aware of important information, and setting limits not only saves you money, but also protects you from fraud. </p><h2>  Credit cards </h2><p>  Plastic cards are still the leading activity of Tinkoff Bank.  Consumer loans require some effort from the client, but the Tinkoff Platinum credit card can be issued at any time on the official website. </p><p>  Today it is the most popular product, and more than four million Russians have already managed to evaluate it.  Without visiting the bank, guarantors and presenting certificates, ‚ÄúTinkoff Platinum‚Äù is issued. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tinkoff bank deposits" class="if" height="305" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1174869.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Benefits: </p><p>  - limit up to 300,000 rubles; </p><p>  - free recharge; </p><p>  - grace period up to 55 days. </p><p>  In addition, when paying for purchases on the card, 1% of the amount is returned in the form of bonus points, during a special campaign of the bank - up to 30%. </p><h2>  Partners </h2><p>  The rating of Tinkoff Bank did not suffer even during the 2008 crisis.  <span>Innovative ideas</span> were appreciated by partners who agreed to joint projects with the bank. </p><p>  Several types of co-branded debit and credit cards are available for customers: </p><ol><li>  ALL Airlines - a credit card for travelers with a limit of up to 700 thousand rubles and accrual of bonus miles. </li><li>  eBay, Lamoda and AliExpress are for online shopping enthusiasts. </li><li>  Mitsubishi will appeal to fans of Japanese cars. </li><li>  Gamers will love the Kanobu credit card with bonuses from Xbox Games, Origin, Steam and the PS Store. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tinkoff Bank office" class="if" height="308" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1174870.jpg" width="492"></div></li></ol><h2>  Deposits </h2><p>  Two years after the opening, Tinkoff Bank offered its customers a new service.  Deposits to individuals are also processed remotely.  You will find detailed information about <span>savings accounts</span> on the official website. </p><p>  To fill out an application, you only need a passport, and the whole procedure will take no more than ten minutes.  A debit card and a set of documents will be delivered at a convenient time by the courier. </p><p>  You can replenish the deposit in cash at points of partners, by bank transfer from an account or another card. </p><p>  If a client transfers wages to a Tinkoff Bank card, a personal account allows you to control not only current expenses, but also plan savings and partially replenish your open deposit. </p><h2>  Top apps </h2><p>  The high rating of Tinkoff Bank is largely due to IT specialists, developers and analysts.  The creation and implementation of software systems deals with the department, which employs 400 people. </p><p>  Thanks to joint efforts, Tinkoff Bank applications for smartphones based on iOS, Windows Phone and Android took first place in 2015 according to a study by the well-known analytical agency Markswebb Rank &amp; Report. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tinkoff bank address" class="if" height="317" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1174873.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In addition, three years ago, bank experts began developing specialized applications that allow you to make quick transfers from card to card or pay fines to the traffic police. </p><h2>  About the disadvantages </h2><p>  At first glance, Tinkoff Bank customers (address: 1st Volokolamskiy proezd, building 10, p. 1) should be satisfied with the availability of banking services.  The support service works around the clock without a break for weekends and holidays. </p><p>  Remotely, you can carry out all the necessary actions, which in the office of another commercial bank will take time to wait in line or collect documents. </p><p>  Experts note that the technical <span>structure of the bank is</span> built perfectly.  However, there are weaknesses too.  For example, due to the lack of a network of Tinkoff Bank offices, cash loans cannot be obtained - borrowed funds are available only on credit cards, the issuance and delivery of which also take some time. </p><p>  Reviews of regular customers note a repeated change in the terms of service unilaterally (a reduction in deposit rates, a decrease in the limit on credit cards and a lack of information on new fees). </p><p>  When registering a new product, the consumer in advance does not have the opportunity to get acquainted even with the contract. </p><p>  In general, remote service is designed for a certain age category.  The lack of additional offices for clients of the old school is unlikely to inspire confidence, and the qualifications of some support staff do not always meet expectations. </p>
