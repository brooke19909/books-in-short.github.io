In local hotels reasonable prices, good conditions, decent service.  The Lumos Deluxe Resort Hotel Spa, a hotel complex located near Alanya in the village of Kargichak, also fits this brief definition.  This is a great hotel that has one minor minus.  Namely - a distant location from the airport.  It takes about 2.5 hours to get to it.  But this is the only negative point.  But the pros can be described in more detail. </p>

    <h2>  Leisure </h2><p>  Most people who came to The Lumos Deluxe Resort Hotel Spa do one thing here - they go to the sea.  It is literally a stone's throw away!  And this is one of the main advantages of the hotel. </p><p>  But you can do other things.  There are two pools (both in the air, with water slides, and indoor), bicycles, everything for water sports, darts, table tennis, beach volleyball, a modern sports hall with exercise machines.  And this is just a small list of entertainment!  Here you can also do parachuting, kayaking, and try surfing.  There is also a small SPA center.  The most popular procedures there are visits to the Turkish bath, sauna, jacuzzi, salt room and massage rooms.  However, a full list of services is offered to guests upon arrival. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Naturally, the 5-star The Lumos Deluxe Resort Hotel Spa, like any other hotel, serves its guests on an all-inclusive basis.  There are several bars and great restaurants.  And the choice, of course, is huge. </p><p>  The main restaurant has everything - meat in variety, fish, all kinds of sweets and juicy, ripe fruits, ice cream, desserts, cheeses, sausages, drinks.  You can look into the institution "a la carte" - they serve a lot of all kinds of specialties, but grilled fish is especially tasty.  Waiters try, serve quickly, without making customers wait for a long time.  Business service, what else to say!  In general, you won‚Äôt be able to stay hungry here, as guests are surrounded by food and drinks everywhere - in the lobby, on the beach, by the pool and in the hotel itself. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

But for three guests, accommodation will cost about 80 thousand rubles. </p><p>  A weekly stay in a deluxe room for two people costs the same amount.  The difference between these apartments from the "standards" is the availability of their own Jacuzzi. </p><p>  But the most expensive option at <span>The Lumos Deluxe Resort Hotel Spa 5 *</span> (Kargicak) is a suite.  Its area is 55 square meters.  m., and the space is divided into two bedrooms.  The suite also has a jacuzzi, and it also has an additional bathroom.  All of the above is also inside.

    <h2>  Guests on vacation </h2><p>  So far, the hotel has managed to receive a not very large number of tourists.  That's because it is new - it was opened in the spring of 2016.  And this is another advantage of it - everything inside is modern, beautiful, clean!  Many therefore went here. </p><p>  And, as tourists who have already been here assure, the hotel really provides a business service.  Cleaning is daily, towels are changed every other day, as is bed linen.  The staff is pleasant, the administrators are smiling and welcoming, always ready to help with advice or suggest something.  And upon arrival, guests are greeted with fresh fruit and a bottle of quality wine.  So the beginning of the holiday can be celebrated immediately. </p><p>  And the beach here is excellent - clean, with comfortable sun loungers and umbrellas.  Enough space for everyone.  And the sea is clear.  Admission, however, is not for children, and not for those people who cannot swim.  Depth begins in a few steps, which many attribute to the pluses.  However, this is an individual moment. </p><p>  In general, it is fun and interesting.  Everyone will have a great time - whether it's an adult or a child.  Everyone here is entertained by a team of positive animators who organize interesting shows in which everyone can participate.  But everything is very unobtrusive, which cannot but rejoice. </p><p>  In general, if you want to relax on an all-inclusive basis in a decent Turkish hotel at a modest price, it is worth going here. </p>
