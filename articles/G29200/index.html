And if you are planning a summer trip to this all-Russian resort, it would not hurt you to decide on the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city.  Which one to choose - Adler, Host or Central?  Where are the best beaches?  In this article we will consider <span>the Sochi area</span> called Lazarevskoye.  The central beach of this resort town, or rather, the promenade next to it, is decorated with a large Ferris wheel.  So, the rest will not be boring!  And what else is there on the beach, which locals call "Azure", and visitors, by its location, simply "Central"?  We will talk about this in our article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lazarevskoe central beach address" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2159720.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Lazarevskoye, Central Beach: address </h2><p>  Finding the desired coast is very easy.  After all, he has a convenient landmark - the Ferris wheel.  It can be seen from afar.  You can also ask for directions to the Park of Culture and Rest.  The central beach "Cote d'Azur" is located right next to this green zone, which makes its visit additionally enjoyable.  City buses go to Lazarevskoye from Sochi.  But the only direct flight to the beach is route No. 155. The bus leaves from Sochi train station.  But this journey is long - two and a half hours.  It will be much faster to get to the Central beach of Lazarevsky by train.  And any trains that follow in the direction of Tuapse will suit you.  Travel time is an hour and a half.  You need to go out at the Lazarevskoye station.  From there you need to go another half a kilometer - and you are on the beach.  The address off this coast is simple: Sochi, <span>Lazarevskoye</span> district <span>, Culture and Leisure Park.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lazarevskoe central beach" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2160979.jpg"></div>

This is a pebble strip of medium size.  The beach has a width of 10-15 meters.  This narrow space is separated from the embankment by a high wall with a beautiful white balustrade.  Steps lead to the sea.  On the left side of the Central beach of Lazarevsky there is a pier from which sightseeing boats depart.  Sunset at sea here is more gentle than in other places in Sochi.  This makes the beach "Cote d'Azur" comfortable for bathing children.  Pebbles, according to reviews, are heterogeneous.  Near the shore, it is small as sand, and sanded by the sea.  Closer to the wall come across real cobblestones.  So, slippers-coral, in which you can swim, you definitely will not hurt.  The pluses of the beach include its location.  The inconvenience of Sochi is that railways and roads run very close to the coast.  In Lazarevsky they are located at a distance of three hundred meters from the coast.  So you will neither see nor hear the rumble of moving trains.  And the green zone of the park adds to the rest of the comfort. </p><h2>  Leisure infrastructure </h2><p>  Like many other coasts in Sochi, the central beach of Lazarevsky is free.  Nevertheless, it is thoroughly cleaned in the morning.  There are changing cabins near the wall.  There is a shower and toilet.  In one place the observation post of rescuers rises.  Approximately in the middle of the beach, in one flat strip, ‚Äúmushrooms‚Äù from the sun are dug into the ground, covered with palm straws.  Tourists say that thanks to them, the coast looks like a tropical island.  The recreation infrastructure here is well developed.  There are catamarans, and "bananas", and water scooters, and even parachuting.  From the pier of the beach you can go on a boat trip or a fascinating tour.  For a fee, you will be offered here sun loungers, sunbeds, umbrellas and even towels.  But no one will mind if you sit on your own mat.  In the evenings, parties and discos are often held on the beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sochi Lazarevskoe Central Beach" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2159734.jpg"></div>

The central beach is adjacent to a large park, which has a large number of attractions for children and adults.  The main one is the Ferris wheel.  If you go from the Voskhod movie theater through the park along the main alley, then on both sides of the road you will find many shopping stalls selling fast food, spa products and souvenirs.  There is also no shortage of cafes and restaurants where you can dine fully.  Nearby is the McDonald's.  And in several places on the beach there are webcams.  They allow tourists to see in real time the degree of fullness of the coast and decide whether to go to the "Cote d'Azur" or look for another place to stay.  The minuses of the Central Beach include its huge popularity, including among local people.  Tourists in the reviews say that in the peak season there is nowhere for the apple to fall. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lazarevskoe private sector central beach" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2159742.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Lazarevskoye, private sector </h2><p>  The central beach is separated from the city by the <span>green zone of the</span> park.  So to live in such a way that the sea splashes on the threshold, you will not succeed in Lazarevsky.  But it‚Äôs worth it to go quite a bit, and you begin to meet guest houses that accept spa guests.  The price range is quite wide - from 800 rubles to five thousand - depending on the amenities of the room.  We can recommend such mini-hotels that are located near the Central Beach: ‚ÄúAdmiral‚Äù, ‚ÄúHouse by the Sea‚Äù, ‚ÄúAgat Inn‚Äù, ‚ÄúOrion‚Äù, ‚ÄúAnastasia‚Äù and ‚ÄúOn River 2-A‚Äù. </p>
