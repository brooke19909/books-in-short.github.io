    <p>  We will try to answer all these questions in this article, taking into account the opinions of experts and reviews of the owners of both models of smartphones.  Let us examine each item of interest to us in order.  So, iPhone 6 and 6S - what's the difference? </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  In the case of the 6S model, the display screen is covered <span>with</span> Retina HD standard <span>glass</span> .  In principle, two fashionable and quite recognizable names that imply a high and high-quality resolution for a gadget - what else is needed for happiness? </p><p>  The resolution and size of the iPhone 6 and 6S are the same, all the same 1334 by 750 pixels with a diagonal of 4.7 inches.  Moreover, one square inch accommodates 326 pixels, which in comparison is similar to budget models on the Android platform. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In this regard, the venerable company loses a little to competitors: most Chinese gadgets, starting from 12-14 thousand rubles, are equipped with Full HD-screens, and this is an occasion to think and try to save. </p><p>  If you put an iPhone 6 and 6S next (resolution comparison), then it‚Äôs not difficult to see the difference in pixelation.  This is especially noticeable when surfing the Internet: the text is small, so dotted grains are visible. </p><h2>  Company tricks </h2><p>  Of course, HD-resolution is very good, but let's look at the aforementioned Chinese counterparts for 10-12 thousand rubles, which have a similar display.  Let's keep the price in mind and look at the official price list from Apple - about 70 thousand rubles for 6S!  This situation looks like some kind of pumping money by selling cheaper and, moreover, obsolete company gadgets.  Moreover, the brand did not even bother to additionally attract a team of marketers to explain simple things to the average user: iPhone 6 and 6S - what is the difference and what benefit will the consumer get from this.  Most likely, the company was counting on its credibility (and, in principle, did not fail) - they still love them and buy goods. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Nevertheless, in the plus 6th version of the iPhone, we can say that the ‚Äúusual‚Äù resolution consumes significantly less energy, which means that the battery life will be favorably different from 6S.  The gadget internals do not need to process such a large number of pixels, as is the case with the HD-screen, so the graphics capabilities of the system will work more efficiently. </p><h2>  Display specifications </h2><p>  Taking <span>iPhone 6 and 6S (</span> screen <span>comparison</span> ), we will see that the display in both cases occupies the same 65.71% of the gadget's front area.  It should be noted that in the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù segment the indicator is considered to be the norm of 75%, where the lateral parts of the perimeter are almost invisible, and this looks pretty fresh and interesting. </p>

    <p>  A review of the iPhone 6 and 6S showed that the contrast has not changed, and both versions have the same indicator of 1400 to 1. Saturation with brightness also remained at the same level - 500 cd / m2.  At the same time looking at images from two smartphones, you can notice an increased brightness of about 20% in the new model.  Perhaps that is why the picture looks more attractive and high-quality, although other parameters, such as color rendering and saturation, are identical to each other. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  We go further on design issues.  IPhone 6 and 6S - what is the difference and is it at all?  Putting both smartphones side by side, it‚Äôs impossible to trace any differences: the same 2.5D glass and Touch ID on the front side, the protruding camera eye, antenna strips in a large and somewhere even lurid style.  Maybe pink or the letter S on the back?  But was it worth it to present a new model? </p><p>  We open the specifications and still find some changes: the size of the iPhone 6 and 6S are different.  They differ by 2 and 1 mm in length and width, the thickness of the new gadget increased by 2 mm, and weight - by 20 grams (visually imperceptible at all). </p><p>  "Apple" designers continue with enviable persistence to ignore user reviews about the design.  It‚Äôs still scary to hold the new and old models in your hands, but all because the gadget‚Äôs body is very slippery and just soaked through with some unnecessary aerodynamics: it strives to slip out of hands onto a tiled floor or asphalt. </p><p>  Many specialized Apple forums are no longer joking, but they are seriously preparing future owners to add about 20 thousand rubles to the purchase amount in order to change the broken screen.  Of course, you can use a company or any other case, but then all the positive user experience, for which the brand is so valued, will be killed. </p><h2>  Assembly </h2><p>  Owners of the 6S model note that, unlike the past gadget, the hardware buttons are significantly improved: they no longer rattle, at the same time, the engineers removed backlashes and other minor design flaws. </p>

    <p>  Also, in addition to the new model, you can add a durable case made of high quality aluminum (sample 7000).  Now the device does not bend, and there are no more problems with the sensational ‚Äúbandgate‚Äù. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Which <span>iPhone is better</span> - 6 or 6S - in terms of technical power?  At this point, the new model outperforms its predecessor by about a third.  The filling of the S-series consists of the new Apple A9 processor, which works immediately in two technical processes: 14 and 16 nm. </p><p>  The chip itself is equipped with Samsung and TSMC.  Reviews of many users, along with the opinion of experts, note that TSMC-based models are slightly ahead of similar Samsungs in terms of battery life (about 20%).  The domestic market for "apple" gadgets is equipped exclusively with processors from TSMC, so we will not consider the issue of autonomy. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  The device has 2 GB of RAM on board, which is relatively small for such devices.  For applications and other software, an internal memory of 16 GB is provided, which is enough for photo and video materials, as well as music from Aityuns.  But ardent fans of high-quality video and photos should still buy a model with expanded memory (up to 128 GB), especially since out of town without high-speed Internet and a personal computer at hand, 16 gigabytes will be clearly not enough. </p>
