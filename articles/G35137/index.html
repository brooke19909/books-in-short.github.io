    <p>  So, vacation pay how to reflect in 6-personal income tax?  When reflecting vacation pay in the 2nd section of the declaration, it is important to remember the basic rule: income tax on paid vacation pay should be made no later than the final day of the month in which vacation pay was made. </p><p>  So, if vacation pay was paid, for example, on June 20 in 2017, then the deadline for paying income tax on them is June 30, 17 years (business day).  Therefore, no matter what date the tax was actually transferred, the date 6/30/17 is put down in the 6-personal income tax on page 120. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If the limiting day of tax transfer to the budget falls on the ‚Äúred‚Äù day of the calendar (holiday or day off), then the last business day of the next month is considered the last day of payment. </p><p>  For example, vacation pay was paid to an employee on April 28.  The last day of April (April 30) was on a day off (Sunday), and the working day (nearest) was May 3.  Line 120 records the date 03.05.2017. </p>
