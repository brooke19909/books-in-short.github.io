The city is located 120 kilometers from St. Petersburg.  Vyborg appeared long before Peter began the construction of a new capital.  The city was founded by the Swedes in the Middle Ages. </p><div class="photo" data-original="demo.arser.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Finland Station" class="if uuid-2669485" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2669485.jpg"></div><h2>  By train </h2><p>  The distance to Vyborg from St. Petersburg can be overcome in several ways.  The most budgetary - on the <span>electric train.</span>  <span>Trains</span> on the route St. Petersburg - Vyborg follow from Finland Station.  Ticket price - from 250 rubles. </p><p>  Traveling by rail from St. Petersburg to Vyborg will take about two hours.  Provided that go direct.  But there is another option - via Zelenogorsk. </p><p>  Usually those who fail to get a ticket for a direct train from St. Petersburg to Vyborg travel with transfers.  The train leaves from Finland Station at 23:30.  An hour later arrives in Zelenogorsk, where passengers will have to wait about five hours.  In Vyborg they will be only at seven in the morning.  As you can see, this is a rather inconvenient way. </p><p>  How to get from St. Petersburg to Vyborg as quickly as possible by rail?  Express trains leave from Finland Station.  The price of tickets is the same, but they travel only an hour and a half.  The express train leaves three times a day: 07:47, 18:15, 20:40. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  On a speed train </h2><p>  You can get from St. Petersburg to Vyborg by train, which follows from Moscow to Helsinki.  The journey takes two hours.  However, a ticket for such a train, of course, is much more expensive than a train ticket.  A trip in a compartment car will cost about two thousand rubles. </p><h2>  By bus </h2><p>  From the Northern capital to Vyborg, trains depart regularly, but not very often.  The bus can be reached any day of the week and at almost any time of the day. </p><p>  There are several route options.  Buses leave daily from Ozerki metro station.  Konechnaya - bus station or railway station of the city of Vyborg.  The latter option takes longer.  It takes two hours to get to the bus station.  To the train station - three. </p><p>  You can also get on a registered bus that delivers passengers to certain addresses in Vyborg.  But such a trip will certainly cost more.  A ticket for a regular bus departing from the North Station costs about 150 rubles. </p><h2>  By car </h2><p>  You can get from St. Petersburg to Vyborg by car.  However, it is worth remembering that on weekends congestion on the roads is not uncommon.  The northern capital with the medieval city is connected by the E18 highway. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nesiditsa.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vyborg castle" class="if uuid-2669482" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2669482.jpg"></div><h2>  Sights of Vyborg </h2><p>  This city has preserved a large number of buildings of the 14-16th centuries.  Some of them are in a deplorable state, however, Vyborg is one of the most popular cities in the Leningrad region. </p><p>  Attractions include a medieval Swedish fortress, Alvar Aalto library, Esplanade, and the Round Tower. </p>
