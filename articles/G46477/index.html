Sights of Kronstadt</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Not far from the Northern capital is the city, which was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1990 - Kronstadt.  It is located in the Gulf of Finland, on the <span>island of Kotlin.</span>  And one of its main attractions is <span>Petrovsky Park.</span>  Kronstadt is the birthplace of famous personalities.  An amazing historical atmosphere reigns here.  The article will discuss the monuments of this city, among which <span>Petrovsky Park is</span> worthy of special attention <span>.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1678893" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/1678893.jpg?1573669162"></div><h2>  Kronstadt </h2><p>  About fifty thousand people live on the territory of this settlement.  <span>The history of Kronstadt</span> begins in 1703, when Peter I laid the first stone on the island of Kotlin.  The emperor‚Äôs goal was to create a city that would contain all the port facilities and serve as an outpost of state defense. </p><p>  Kronstadt remembers many outstanding historical events.  In 1905, an uprising broke out with the participation of more than three thousand heated sailors.  In 1921, the so-called Kronstadt rebellion took place, as a result of which Tukhachevsky‚Äôs troops fired on the city for 24 hours.  And three months after the start of the Second World War, the Luftwaffe raid took place. </p><p>  For a long time the city was closed.  And only in 1996, an excursion to Kronstadt became available for both Russians and foreigners. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1680160" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/1680160.jpg?1573669162"></div><h2>  sights </h2><p>  What can you see in the famous city?  An excursion to Kronstadt usually includes visits to museums, among which tourists are most attracted to the Kronstadt Maritime Museum.  Three temples operate on the territory, which are of considerable interest from a historical point of view.  And of course, it is worth visiting the Summer Garden, Hospital Garden, Catherine Square and Petrovsky Park. </p><p>  Kronstadt is a city that can only be reached for a long time by water.  But in 1983 a ring road was built.  Not so long ago - a tunnel under the Gulf of Finland. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1680163" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/1680163.jpg?1573669162"></div><h2>  Routes </h2><p>  Today from St. Petersburg to get to the island is not difficult.  And not only in your own car, but also in public transport.  From the <span>metro station "Staraya Derevnya"</span> there is a bus number 101. The journey will take no more than fifty minutes.  Once already in this wonderful city, you can take one of the buses to the Petrovsky Park stop. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Kronstadt - a unique city, rich in attractions.  But to begin its inspection is worth it from this historical monument, created in the nineteenth century according to the project of a man, about which a few words should also be said. </p><h2>  F.F. Bellingshausen </h2><p>  In history, this man is known as the discoverer of Antarctica.  F.F. Bellingshausen graduated from the Naval Cadet Corps, located on the territory of Kronshtad.  Six years after entering this military educational institution, he was already promoted to midshipman.  Then Bellingshausen sailed around the world, and in 1819 led an Antarctic expedition.  This man made a significant contribution to the study of south polar territories.  He was buried in the Lutheran cemetery in Kronstadt.  However, the grave of Bellingshausen, unfortunately, has been lost.  In 1970, a monument was erected to the Russian navigator. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1678910" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/1678910.jpg?1573669162"></div><h2>  Petrovsky park </h2><p>  In 1839, Bellingshausen was appointed governor.  This active person was dissatisfied with the state of the central streets of Kronstadt.  He decided to do the beautification of the city, but did not find support from the emperor.  And the tireless perfectionist decided to invest his own funds in the transformation of the city. </p><p>  The Admiral (by then Bellingshausen already had this title) hired workers and ordered them to dig gutters.  Then proceeded to landscaping the central streets.  At the same time, he himself chose seedlings.  What is growing in Petrovsky Park in Kronstadt today?  The main tree of the fortified city is oak.  He is known to be a symbol of resilience and greatness.  Oaks are harmoniously combined with local historical monuments and save tourists from the summer heat. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1678916" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/1678916.jpg?1573669162"></div><h2>  Dutch style park </h2><p>  In the mid-nineteenth century, a small garden was landscaped.  But Bellingshausen thought this was not enough.  He decided to set up a park on the site of this garden, as well as the nearby streets.  And since the governor had a lot of life experience and saw a lot of things during his travels, he decided to create something original.  Something that previously was not in Russia.  He planned to create a park in the Dutch style.  And in the very center of it to erect a monument to Peter the Great.  Bellingshausen had only to implement this ambitious plan that he safely entrusted to one of the engineers famous at that time. </p><p>  The monument to the first Russian emperor was cast, was sculptor Peter von Klodt.  The hand of this master belongs to many sights that can be seen when visiting the Northern capital.  Among the works of Klodt are <span>monuments to Krylov,</span> Nicholas I, Vladimir Kiev.  Although it is worth saying that the sculpture, which can be seen in the center of Petrovsky Park, was only cast by a Russian artist with a foreign name.  The model of the monument itself was purchased from the French master Theodore Jacques. </p><p>  On engravings of the nineteenth century, you can see a giant sculpture towering above the young trees.  Today Petrovsky Park looks different.  Trees have grown over a century and a half.  The bronze emperor has not yet been buried in majestic oaks, but some of the trees have long outgrown it. </p><p>  The name of the park was changed by the Bolsheviks in 1917.  He became one of the symbols of the revolution.  And therefore it was named Freedom Park.  The former name of this attraction was returned in 1991. </p><h2>  Winter marina </h2><p>  What else is noteworthy Petrovsky Park?  The winter pier also belongs to it - a rather picturesque place, where at any time, not counting dank winter days, there are many tourists.  Here you can see the guns that once belonged to the ship "Emperor Paul I". </p>
