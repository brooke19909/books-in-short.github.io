    <p>  In fact, the Mountain Ring is one of the capes of the Borgustan Range.  At the highest point, it reaches 871 meters above sea level, which is about a hundred meters above the base.  The natural monument itself is almost entirely composed of sandstone.  Inside, it is all covered with a large number of caves and dungeons. </p><p>  Over the past years, under the influence of erosion and weathering, the most extreme cave belonging to the cape has turned into a through.  In shape, it began to resemble a huge ring, about 10 meters in diameter. </p><p>  Today, the Ring Mountain has become one of the main attractions of the resort of Kislovodsk. </p><h2>  On the pages of the classics </h2>

The ring-mountain is described in detail in the novel by Mikhail Yuryevich Lermontov "Hero of Our Time". </p><p>  Describing the surroundings of Kislovodsk, Lermontov writes that about three kilometers from the city there flows a small rivulet called Podkumok.  It passes through the Stavropol Territory and Karachay-Cherkessia, being the largest tributary <span>of the Kuma</span> River more significant in these places <span>.</span> </p><p>  In the gorge near Podkumka, the lyrical hero of the novel just finds a rock, which all locals call the Mountain Ring for their resemblance.  Many vacationers from Kislovodsk specially go on a small voyage to see this natural wonder with their own eyes. </p><p>  The mountain itself is a kind of gate that is created by nature.  They climb up a high hill.  And every evening the sun, setting off over the horizon, casts its last fiery rays on them.  Literally every day, numerous cavalcades of resort guests set off to watch this amazing sunset. </p><h2>  Legends </h2>

    <p>  Many stories and beliefs have been preserved to this day associated with this place, known as Mount Ring.  Legend has it that any warrior who gallops through it in his full armament gains an amazing ability, becoming invincible in battle. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As with any amazing natural phenomenon, many mysterious legends are associated with this place.  One of them refers to the Nart epic.  This is folk art that exists among Ossetians, Abkhazians, Karachais and Balkars.  Its basis is made up of epic stories about the adventures of hero heroes, who are called sledges. </p><p>  In this Nart legend, one of the most famous sleds, the hero of Aref, owes his numerous victories on the battlefield to the magical and powerful spells of Mount Ring.  It was thanks to her that he managed to accomplish such a huge number of feats. </p><p>  On this basis, there is another belief that is actively cultivated among tourists.  Almost all guides and local residents say that all visitors must always stand in the ring opening, at least not for long.  This will definitely bring you good luck and happiness. </p><h2>  Museum Object </h2>

    <p>  Interestingly, the natural monument to which this article is devoted is still a museum exhibit.  It is officially considered part of the collection of the museum-reserve of Mikhail Yuryevich Lermontov, which is under the auspices of the state.  It is known that Lermontov served in these places, lived for a long time and managed to love them.  The museum itself is based in the city of Pyatigorsk. </p><p>  Mount Ring, the photo of which is in this article, is certainly valuable also for the beautiful view that opens from its top.  From there, anyone can observe the vast panorama of Kislovodsk itself and its environs, as well as the Pyatigorye and the famous Dzhinalsky ridge.  Moreover, in fine weather, even Mount Elbrus is visible from here. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  In order to get acquainted with this attraction, you can come here by personal transport.  And you can use the public.  For example, take bus number 101 or number 104.  They depart from Kislovodsk. </p><p>  Just remember: the driver must be warned that the bus must be stopped near the Ring of the Mountain, otherwise you risk passing by.  From the bus stop you will need to walk a little.  But it's worth it. </p><p>  You can go to this natural attraction by bus from the central Kislovodsk bazaar.  Any transport that goes towards Uchkeken is suitable. </p><p>  Recently, tourists have often been warned that it is impossible to come close to the mountain itself.  A sudden rock collapse may begin.  But this does not stop anyone.  Sometimes it ends even with deaths.  Therefore, you should be as careful as possible.  It is worth remembering that most often collapses occur in the spring. </p>
