    <h2>  Roaming </h2><p>  Sometimes a call to the operator is required when traveling.  The thing is that in this case, one fact must be taken into account - the call will be paid.  Billing will take into account the tariff plan you have chosen earlier. </p><p>  How to call the operator <span>"Tele 2"?</span>  In order to get through to this company in roaming, use the combination 8 951 520 0611. With it, you can even contact ‚ÄúTele 2‚Äù at any time while traveling. <strong><br></strong> </p><h2>  Link to the region </h2><p>  Our today's mobile operator is distributed throughout the country.  Therefore, each city has its own call centers from Tele 2.  We can say that this is support services. <strong><br></strong> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <span>How to call the operator "Tele 2"?</span>  To do this, on the official page of the company, look at the phone number that relates to your region of residence.  He is in every city.  For example, in St. Petersburg you need to dial a combination of 812 989 00 22 for communication with the operator, and in Tula and the region - 4872 58 06 11. </p><p>  This method is not too loved by subscribers.  Indeed, to get through these numbers, as practice shows, is very problematic.  Basically, only in the daytime you can contact "Tele 2". </p><h2>  From all rooms </h2><p>  There is another option used by subscribers.  It is suitable for making calls <span>on "Tele 2"</span> from landlines.  If you want to call from another operator‚Äôs number, no problems. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to call the operator megaphone with body 2" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1319258.jpg"></div>

    <p>  As the next combination, which serves to communicate with the technical support of Tele 2, 8 800 555 0611 is used. Usually you can call at any time.  The call is free if you carry out the action from a landline phone. </p><h2>  Other communications </h2><p>  How to call the operator <span>"Tele 2",</span> we have already figured out.  But these are far from all ways to maintain contact with the company.  In addition to the phone, you have every right to use other methods.  For example, the Internet. </p><p>  The official page of the operator will help you here.  On it you will find a special feedback form.  By filling out it, you can get a free consultation from Tele 2 directly by email.  The only drawback here is the wait time.  Sometimes it takes several days to process the request.  For a quick consultation, the method is not very suitable. </p><p>  Or you can use the company's email.  Just write your question and send it to t2info@tele2.ru.  This method is perfect when you have several days to solve the problem.  As practice shows, e-mail is mainly used to write complaints or positive opinions about the work of "Tele 2". </p><h2>  To other operators </h2><p>  And how can I reach other operators?  This is also an important point.  If we are talking about a subscriber of another mobile operator, just dial your friend‚Äôs number on the phone.  If we are talking directly about the support service, you will have to try pretty hard to implement the idea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to call the pay operator with body 2" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1319257.jpg"></div>
