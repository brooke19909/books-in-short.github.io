    <h2>  Biography </h2><p>  The future astronaut was born in Tula on April 27, 1942.  In 1960, Valery graduated from school number 4 of his native city and went to the capital, where he entered the First Moscow Medical Institute.  In 1965 he received a medical degree.  Then he continued his studies, first in the clinics of the Institute of <span>Medical Parasitology</span> and Tropical Medicine, and then in graduate school at the Institute of <span>Medical</span> Biology of the USSR Ministry of Health.  He defended his thesis.  After 4 years, he was selected as the first cosmonaut of the IBMP.  However, Valery Polyakov could only become a member on the second attempt.  As it turned out, it was even more difficult to fulfill the dream and see the Earth from the porthole of a space station than the young scientist had expected. </p><h2>  First flight </h2><p>  Valery Polyakov was forced to wait for inclusion in the expedition for 8 years and completed his first space flight on August 29, 1988, for which he was awarded the Golden Star of the Hero of the USSR.  Together with him, the crew included V. Lyakhov and A. Ahad Momand.  The latter became the first astronaut in the history of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Was in orbit until April 27, 1989.  During the expedition, which lasted 240 days 23 hours, he worked with B. Titov and M. Manarov, <span>S. Krikalev</span> and A. Volkov and with the Frenchman J.-L.  Chretien. </p>

    <h2>  Second flight </h2><p>  Another expedition, which went to Valery Polyakov, began in January 1994 and lasted until March 22, 1995.  Thus, the astronaut spent more than 437 days in the Earth‚Äôs orbit, which at the moment is an absolute record of the duration of a person‚Äôs stay in space during one flight.  For the successful implementation of the project on returning to the land, Valery Vladimirovich received the title of Hero of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  During the expedition, more than six hundred experiments were carried out, including unique ones.  At the same time, Polyakov, along with other crew members, repeatedly fell into emergency situations.  For example, after a fire in one of the generators, the task arose to inform the Earth so as not to create unnecessary panic. </p><p>  According to Valery Polyakov himself, ship commander A. Viktorenko recalled him to a nearby module and they prayed together.  It turned out that faith helps not only on earth, but also in heaven.  The fire was extinguished, and fortunately everything turned out fine. </p><h2>  SFINCSS Experiment </h2><p>  Victor Polyakov is a specialist with a wide range of scientific interests.  In 2000, he took part in the SFINCSS experiment, which consisted of simulating a long space flight of an international crew in order to study the characteristics of interpersonal interaction of groups consisting of representatives of different nationalities. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition, Polyakov is the author of 50 scientific papers on space medicine, which are published even in foreign authoritative publications. </p>

    <h2>  About flying to other planets </h2><p>  Victor Polyakov believes that long-distance expeditions are possible.  He regrets that, due to his age, he will not be able to take part in such a project. </p><p>  As a living example of a long existence on board a spaceship, the scientist calls himself.  Indeed, during his time in space, he received 15 x-rays of radiation, which is comparable to the dose that "will go" to those who go to Mars. </p><p>  In addition, such a flight is hardly possible in the near future, until 2030, and by that time, according to the pilot-cosmonaut, scientists will certainly improve the protection of the ship, which will go on an interplanetary journey. </p><p>  According to Valery Vladimirovich, flying in space can be quite long.  The main thing is not to allow the body to adapt to zero gravity.  Therefore, the astronaut must "work hard" physically in order to return home as a healthy person. </p><p>  Polyakov‚Äôs opinion on this issue is considered the most authoritative in the world, since he proved the possibility of a long stay in zero gravity without losing muscle and skeleton functions from his own experience. </p>
