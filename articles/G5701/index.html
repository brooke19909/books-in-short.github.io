In fact, it‚Äôs not so difficult to guess what is required of us.  Nevertheless, not all citizens are aware of this list.  So, you have the right to refuse a deduction.  Not a pleasant outcome, is it?  Therefore, let's thoroughly study the full list of everything that is needed to receive money from the state when making a sale of real estate.  In our case, this is an apartment.  Or a house / land.  Proper preparation will make your process as easy as possible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="documents for deduction for an apartment" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1218003.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Identification </h2><p>  Making a <span>tax deduction</span> when buying an apartment is not so difficult.  Perhaps this process is known to many.  If you prepare for it correctly, then you will not be afraid of any problems.  They simply will not arise. </p><p>  The first document that is required to receive a tax deduction is your <span>ID.</span>  You can use any such document, but, as practice shows, it is best to present a passport.  And a copy of it.  It is applied to the rest of the list of required papers.  Not required to certify. </p><p>  Perhaps with this document no problems will arise.  After all, the passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation should always be with you.  This document is always necessary for any tax transactions.  Keep this in mind. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Statement </h2><p>  What's next?  Documents for deduction for an apartment do not make any sense without drawing up an appropriate application.  That is, you must file a written request with the tax authorities.  Without a statement, they will not deduct you. </p><p>  It is compiled easily and simply - just indicate your details and data, as well as the reason for the refund.  In our case, this is buying an apartment.  That's all.  After you have to sign a document, and then attach it to your passport and other papers. </p><p>  Pay attention to one important factor - in the text of the application bank details are also indicated, for which you will have to receive the funds.  If you miss this moment, you can wait for the refusal of the tax authorities to refund the money. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="registration of tax deduction when buying an apartment" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1218001.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Declarations </h2><p>  What else could come in handy?  Making a tax deduction when buying an apartment without fail includes such a clause as the preparation of a <span>tax return.</span>  Without it, neither taxes can be paid, nor a part of the money spent. </p><p>  The form that we need is 3-NDFL.  Making it does not cause trouble to citizens.  You can take advantage of a special program that will help draw up this declaration and fully prepare it for printing. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Only the original is served.  Copies of 3-NDFL are not accepted by the tax authorities.  If you need the exact same document "for yourself", just print it in two copies.  And that‚Äôs all.  Know that with copies of the tax return they simply will not even talk to you.  Such rules are currently established in Russia. </p><h2>  2-personal income tax </h2><p>  We move on.  Documents for deduction for an apartment - the question is not so problematic if you prepare for it well.  After all of the above papers are ready, you need to somehow confirm your income.  For this, there is another help.  It is called 2-PIT. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="deduction when buying an apartment documents" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1218002.jpg"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  If you work "for yourself", you will have to fill it out yourself.  This is done using the same applications where you drew up the 3-NDFL tax return.  No special problems arise during the course of work. </p><p>  Nevertheless, most often citizens work for someone.  And this technique saves them from unnecessary paperwork.  The 2-NDFL certificate must be issued by your employer.  Contact her in the accounting department of the company in which you work.  As a rule, no problems arise here. </p><p>  True, keep in mind - documents for deduction for an apartment, namely a 2-NDFL certificate, like a tax return, must be submitted in the original.  That is, no copy of it will be accepted from you.  So make sure that 2-NDFL was attached only in the original. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Contract </h2><p>  What else?  Now we proceed to more serious and important documents.  The thing is that all of the above papers - this is the so-called standard.  For any tax deduction, they are submitted to the tax authorities.  But further for each case there is a list of documents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="documents for deduction for an apartment" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1218004.jpg"></div>

    <p>  It is impossible to receive a tax deduction when buying an apartment / house / land, if you somehow do not documentally confirm the transaction.  How to do it right?  Need a sales contract in your name.  It is important that you are indicated as the buyer.  Otherwise, no deduction will be made. </p><p>  A certified copy is provided.  If you want, you can give the original, and leave yourself a second copy of the contract.  But remember - without it, deduction is impossible.  This moment also does not cause special problems for citizens.  Indeed, the sale without a contract cannot be considered successful at all. </p><h2>  Certificate </h2><p>  Do you need a deduction <span>when buying an apartment?</span>  <span>Documents,</span> no matter how strange it may sound, may not immediately be with you.  After all, some will have to get some time in various instances.  For example, we are talking about a certificate of ownership. </p><p>  You will not have it immediately after purchasing the property, but only after some time.  About a month after the transaction.  So do not rush into the tax deduction.  You will have enough time for its design. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tax deduction for an apartment tax refund" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1218005.jpg"></div>

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  The certificate of ownership can be presented both as the original and as a copy of the document.  It is best to use the second option.  After all, a duplicate of the certificate will also have to be received if you lose the original.  And so this document will always be with you.  Certified bodies must be accepted by the tax authorities. </p><h2>  Payments </h2><p>  Documents for deductions are varied.  But without fail, all citizens must somehow confirm their expenses.  Of course, paychecks and checks come to the rescue here.  It is advisable to present the originals thereof, and leave copies to yourself.  Or certify duplicates and attach to the tax return. </p><p>  Usually there are no problems with this point either.  Unless, make sure that your data is indicated in the payment document.  Only those who are indicated as payers are entitled to a deduction.  And no one else.  That is, it is impossible that different citizens are indicated in the payment and contract, as well as in the declaration.  It is illegal.  In this scenario, you will not be tax deductible on the apartment (reimbursement).  The tax will be full, and you will not be able to return the money. </p><h2>  Mortgage </h2><p>  In principle, these are all documents deductible for an apartment.  True, often such real estate is acquired in a mortgage.  Oddly enough, but even in this situation, you have the right to a refund of money spent on the purchase of housing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tax deduction when buying an apartment home land" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1218006.jpg"></div>

          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  It is enough to supplement the above list of documents with some papers.  There are no problems with them either.  In any case, this is exactly how many citizens assert, who have already faced a similar situation. </p><p>  What should be required of you?  Firstly, a mortgage agreement.  It is needed either in the original or in a certified copy.  The second option is in great demand among citizens.  The exception is if for some reason you have two original copies of the mortgage agreement. </p><p>  Secondly, you will be required to receive receipts confirming the fact of payment of interest on the mortgage.  Again, anyway, in what form you attach them - copies or originals.  The main thing is that it is you and not someone else that is indicated in the payment document.  This is how easy and simple it is to get a tax deduction for an apartment in a particular case. </p><h2>  Dates and order </h2><p>  What else do you need to know so that there are no problems with the return of money when buying a property?  For example, about the deadlines in which you must meet the collection of all documents.  As practice shows, if you immediately start processing the deduction, you can be ready in 1.5 months to visit the tax authorities.  The longest thing you can wait is to issue a certificate of ownership in your name. </p><p>  The statement with the declaration is considered approximately 2 months.  After this period, you will receive a response from the tax authorities with a refusal or approval of the deduction.  And, as practice shows, in a month or two you will receive the required funds in the account indicated in the application.  Thus, on average, the process of registration and receipt will be about six months.  But you can file a tax return before the end of the tax reporting period.  That is, until April 30 of each year.  In addition, according to modern laws, you have the right to receive deductions for the last 3 years.  So you can take your time. </p>

    <p>  Another point - if you are a pensioner, you will have to attach to all of the above documents also a pension certificate (a copy of it), as well as certificates that can confirm your benefits, if any.  Also not problematic, especially if you know the complete list of all necessary documents for deductions. </p>
