Description, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Arkhipo-Osipovka is a resort village that is part of the administrative structure of Gelendzhik.  It is located in a beautiful valley surrounded by mountains, between two rivers - Teshebs and Vulan.  One of the advantages of Arkhipo-Osipovka is that it is located on the federal highway.  That is why many Russians who prefer not to exhaust themselves with a long transfer passing through the winding mountain serpentines leading to other resorts spend their holidays in the hotels of Arhipka, as the people call this village. </p>
