    <p>  The hotel has several pools.  The central one is filled with fresh water; there is also an indoor one with thermal water.  In winter, a heated pool is available. </p><h2>  Rest for children </h2><p>  The administration of Hotel Odyssee Resort Thalasso 4 * (Zarzis) takes care of the rest of the children.  They have their own swimming pool, a team of animators with different entertainment programs for children of different ages. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Sport and animation </h2><p>  Hotel Odyssee Resort Thalasso (Djerba) has a team of animators of ten people.  Entertainment programs are held in French, Italian, German and English. </p><p>  Every day, guests of the hotel can take part in sports events, as well as do aerobics, archery, windsurfing, play mini-golf, table tennis, tennis, and kayaking. </p><h2>  A little bit about the resort ... </h2><p>  We already mentioned that Hotel Odyssee Resort Thalasso (Zarzis) is located in the town of Zarzis.  Among other <span>resort cities of Tunisia,</span> it is less familiar to Russian tourists.  Zarzis cuisine is one of the best in the country.  It is located in the southeast of the country and is a port of the southern Mediterranean.  Tours to these places are not so popular at present due to the proximity of the Libyan border. </p><p>  Zarzis has a long history; it was known even during the period of the Roman Empire.  Already in those days it was incredibly popular due to its favorable location on the coast.  There was active trade, the city was one of the largest ports in Tunisia. </p><p>  However, from the past glory there was not a trace left.  Zarzis is currently a small seaside town.  Locals grow olives there and make butter.  As for hotels, here you will not find fashionable complexes.  All local hotels are 3-4 star.  On the local beaches there is never a crowd of tourists, relax on them comfortably and calmly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel odyssee resort thalasso 4 zarzis" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1481378.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Since Zarzis is the southern resort of Tunisia, it is, accordingly, the warmest.  In the autumn, hot weather lasts longer than all other regions here.  Due to the fact that there is a desert nearby, rains in the city are a rarity, even in winter. </p><h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  Relaxing in the Hotel Odyssee Resort Thalasso 4 * (Zarzis), you can escape from the warm sea and devote some time to exploring local attractions.  Zarzis itself is unremarkable, an ordinary provincial town.  But those who are for the first time in Tunisia, it will be interesting to wander through the streets and see the life of the local population. </p><p>  In the city you can see the Jewish synagogue, a mosque with minarets, a city museum. </p><p>  Zarzis is a good place to visit the desert.  Local travel agencies vying offer interesting excursions: </p><ol><li>  Rides in jeeps and ATVs in the desert. </li><li>  Settlements of the Barbary nomads.  Tourists can see with their own eyes how people live, try the dishes of their cuisine. </li><li>  Excursions to the Sahara with an overnight stay in the open air and camel riding. </li><li>  Matmata is an extraordinary home for troglodytes. </li><li>  "Country of Ksars" - unusual ancient landscapes. </li><li>  Gabes is one of the small coastal towns with a spice market. </li><li>  Paintball club of the city. </li><li>  Numerous thalassotherapy procedures. </li><li>  On the island of Djerba, you can see many attractions and visit entertainment centers. </li></ol><h2>  Hotel Odyssee Resort Thalasso: reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, I want to discuss the reviews of tourists who visited it.  Hotel Odyssee Resort Thalasso 4 * (Tunisia) is a good place for a relaxing holiday.  If you want to relax away from the hustle and bustle of the city, and enjoy the sea and the sun, then this complex is suitable for you.  But lovers of noisy companies and parties until the morning should look for another place for themselves.  Most of the hotel guests are couples with children or European pensioners.  The public is very calm and pleasant in every way. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel odyssee resort thalasso jerba" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1481380.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  According to tourists, the complex begins to surprise its guests from the very first minute.  Buying a tour to a four-star hotel, tourists do not even expect how good it is.  Vacationers celebrate the large beautiful territory of the complex, on which the garden is located.  Around everything is buried in flowers and greenery.  It is noticeable that the plantations are looked after, especially given the heat.  The territory is cleaned daily; it is very pleasant to walk around it. </p><p>  It offers guests a fairly large selection of apartments at Hotel Odyssee Resort Thalasso.  The hotel rooms are spacious and beautiful.  The furniture is not entirely new, but solid and in good condition, large comfortable beds are especially convenient.  Plumbing in the apartments is in good condition.  Air conditioners are powerful and work properly, there are no problems with them.  Each room has a balcony or terrace.  If you live on the ground floor, then generally the pool is within easy reach. </p><p>  Maids clean the apartments every day in your absence, which is very convenient.  Towels and beds are changed regularly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel odyssee resort thalasso 4 zarzis" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1481385.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The food at the hotel is very good.  The main restaurant is large and spacious, there is never a queue, noise and fuss.  Even in Ramadan, the dishes are very varied.  The waiters work very promptly, serving tourists.  The main restaurant operates on an all-inclusive basis.  The assortment of the buffet is striking in variety: beef, lamb, turkey, chicken, seafood (shrimp, tuna), pasta, rice, potatoes, couscous, lasagna, cream soups, vegetables.  The desserts at the hotel deserve special attention.  They are cooked a lot and tasty.  The local cook knows a lot about this.  It is certainly worth tasting them all, even if you are not a fan of sweets. </p><p>  For breakfast, the restaurant serves delicious croissants, omelets, sausages, crepes, cheeses, natural yogurts, preserves, cereals.  A delicious pizza is prepared next to the pool.  Here you can also find cookies and snacks between lunch and dinner.  So there is simply no way to get hungry. </p><p>  The beach at the hotel is good, sandy.  There is a pontoon on which you can enter the water.  In general, the coast is quite shallow, if adults do not like it, then for the children here it is simply beautiful and safe.  Very often algae appear in the water, they try to remove them, however, they do not take them out of the beach, since this is prohibited due to the protection of sand erosion. </p><p>  In general, with children it is very good to relax here.  The coast is always clean, there are plenty of umbrellas and sunbeds. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel odyssee resort thalasso 4 tunisia" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1481387.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel has an animation team that entertains both adults and children.  The guys work just fine.  Tourists along with them can do water aerobics, yoga, tennis, archery.  There are many entertainments.  Children are especially pleased with the gaming programs.  In the evenings, discos are organized for them, after which the show for parents begins: fakirs, music, miss and mister of the hotel, etc. Although the hotel guests are multilingual, but there are no difficulties, you can understand each other with common efforts, so the entertainment programs are fun and interesting. </p><p>  The hotel has wonderful staff.  At the reception there are no problems with the settlement.  The service is fast and of high quality.  I would like to note that almost all employees of the complex have a minimal set of Russian phrases, so you can always explain.  The staff is pleasant and polite, trying to solve all conflict situations. </p><p>  The hotel has three pools, including a children's one.  All of them make a good impression, it is clear that they are clean.  Thermal is especially interesting.  However, it can not be more than fifteen minutes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel odyssee resort thalasso tunisia" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1481389.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  I would like to note that the hotel as a whole is very good and noticeably stands out among other complexes on the Arzis coast.  And the reason for this is a beautiful green area on the sand.  There are many diverse plants, palm trees, flowers.  It's nice to just walk along the paths and admire the exotic beauty. </p><p>  Knowledgeable tourists are advised not to be limited to beach vacations, but to pay attention to excursions and entertainment.  A very interesting ride on a jeep safari through the sands of the desert.  Vacationers highly recommend it.  In addition, in search of entertainment it is worth a trip to the island of Djerba.  There are a lot of attractions for tourists. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Hotel Odyssee Resort Thalasso (Tunisia) is a wonderful four-star hotel for a relaxing family vacation.  It can be safely recommended to vacationers with young children who are not fans of too active recreation.  Life in the complex is slow and measured, allowing you to fully relax and enjoy every minute of the long-awaited vacation. </p>
