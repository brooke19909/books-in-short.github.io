    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The <span>Enfida Airport,</span> where most tourists come from, is about thirty-five kilometers from Hotel Safa 3 (Tunisia).  The center of Hammamet - Medina is ten kilometers away.  But it is not so far to go to the shopping streets of Yasmin, about ten minutes.  You can get there, of course, by taxi, or by shuttle bus.  And at fifteen minutes on foot - the port of Marina, where you can go have fun.  To get from the airport by transfer - about forty minutes.  In the vicinity of the hotel are five-star luxury hotels.  And behind the hotel there is a supermarket where you can buy everything you miss on vacation.  Immediately after the neighboring Hotel Medina is an entertainment center where you can walk in the evening. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hammamet </h2><p>  This resort itself has long been a favorite place for swimming.  Wherever you look, for many kilometers stretches of pure <span>white sand</span> washed by a warm and gentle sea.  The tan in these places is smooth and beautiful, even with a minimum use of sunscreens. </p><p>  This resort is very good for children.  The entrance to the water is shallow and safe, and they simply do not want to crawl out of the sea. </p><p>  But not only tourists come to the beach to Safa 3. Tunisia, whose photos of sights are very attractive, is a country of great civilizations, succeeding each other.  They left their mark on modern life. </p><p>  Tunisia is a completely atypical Africa, and it is best seen in Hammamet.  If you want to get to know this country well, it is better to travel on it not in tourist buses, but on public transport, go to shops, watch the locals.  And then you will see that they are not much different from the inhabitants of the European Mediterranean. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Safa 3 Tunisia" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/650026.jpg" width="550"></div>
