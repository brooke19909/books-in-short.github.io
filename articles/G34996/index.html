Tips and job description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Music is an integral part of the life of the people.  Since ancient times in Russia, ordinary people accompanied any work with singing.  It helped to cope with physical labor, uplifted, distracted from the difficulties of life of that time. </p><p>  Ordinary people did not have many opportunities for playing music - just their own voice and simple wooden instruments made by their own hands. </p><p>  One of these musical assistants was a pipe.  In general, this is the general name of a whole group of folk wind instruments.  The Slavic peoples have the so-called flute - thin tubes with holes. </p><p>  Traditionally, a flute or snot (as it is also called) is considered a tool of shepherds, which she helped pass the time.  The sounds of the pipes are very soft and pleasant.  In addition, with her help it was easier to do the work - animals also responded to music. </p><p>  Today we will learn how to make a pipe - a kind of flute. </p><p>  So.  Although it is not very difficult to make a flute, folk craftsmen who can make the instrument make truly magical sounds are appreciated at all times. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.goodfon.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Shepherd with a flute." class="if uuid-2693252" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99336/2693252.jpg"></div><h2>  What does the tool consist of? </h2><p>  As already mentioned, a flute consists of a tube with playing holes and a whistle (this is the mouthpiece). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The shape of the tubes can be different, as well as the material from which it is created (pine, hazel, ash, maple). </p><p>  For the soft core of the instrument you can use bird cherry, willow or elderberry. </p><p>  Depending on the desire and imagination of craftsmen, the appearance of the instrument changes.  The master can also change the number of holes that affect the sound of notes.  The more sounds, the richer and more colorful the melody will be. </p><p>  It is interesting to note that there are double flutes, which have one common mouthpiece. </p><p>  Currently, nozzles are made of wood and plastic.  And how to make a pipe at home?  Let's look at a few ways you can create a musical instrument.  But first, we‚Äôll prepare everything you need. </p><h2>  Materials for the manufacture </h2><p>  What do we need?  It: </p><p>  - hand drill; </p><p>  - iron rod; </p><p>  - marker; </p><p>  - ruler; </p><p>  - source of fire; </p><p>  - knife; </p><p>  - glue; </p><p>  - sandpaper; </p><p>  - a hacksaw; </p><p>  - glue; </p><p>  - cautery on wood; </p><p>  - <span>file (file</span> with a small notch). </p><p>  And now the most important thing is the basis from which the tube will be made.  We will analyze two types of material. </p><h2>  Reeds </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.lilieswatergardens.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="reed for pipe" class="if uuid-2693661" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22293/2693661.jpg"></div><p>  Take the stem (it grows along the banks of rivers and in swamps) and, finally, we learn how to make a reed pipe. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Trim it to the required length: it can be changed according to your desire. </li><li>  To clean from the inside with sandpaper. </li><li>  Measure a couple of centimeters from the edge and cut a rectangle from above (this is the hole of the whistle). </li><li>  Form the corner of the whistle hole (45 degrees) with a needle file. </li><li>  Then we take a piece of wood and customize it to the diameter of the tube. </li><li>  As soon as the size is selected, you need to smear the tree with glue and insert into the stalk of reeds. </li><li>  Burn holes, focusing on the sound device.  Remember, the wider the hole, the higher the note. </li><li>  The last to burn a hole next to the whistle, on the bottom surface. </li></ol><p>  To configure the instrument, you can use a special device - a tuner, it will help to adjust the pitch of each note. </p><h2>  Bamboo </h2><div class="photo" data-original="greenwaymyanmar.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bamboo is an herbal plant." class="if uuid-2693249" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99336/2693249.jpg"></div><p>  To understand how to make a bamboo pipe, you need to evaluate how good this material is.  It is pleasant and firm to the touch. </p><p>  Unlike reeds, bamboo is not so easy to get, because it grows in Africa and East Asia.  But you can grow it at home, although, strictly speaking, it will not be the same plant.  In nature, bamboo is a grass that grows to extremely large sizes (up to 35 meters).  At home, you can grow a variety of dracaena, which is also suitable if its height allows you to make the tube of the desired length. </p><p>  If you are not the owner of such a plant, you can look for an old <span>bamboo fishing rod,</span> which in this case can find a second life in the form of a musical instrument. </p><p>  The bamboo stalk is as hollow inside as the reeds, but it already has partitions inside.  Due to this, it is not necessary to insert into the cavity. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pipe made of bamboo." class="if uuid-2693250" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99336/2693250.jpg"></div><p>  The diameter of the workpiece should be 2-3 cm. </p><ol><li>  Saw off the tube of the desired length.  At the same time, make sure that at one end there remains the same partition that will serve as the mouthpiece. </li><li>  Mark all required holes with a marker.  For comparison, in the previous version, we immediately burned them. </li><li>  The remaining partitions must be disposed of.  To do this, we heat an iron rod (that's what fire is for) on a gas burner or a bonfire.  Burn the plant carefully so as not to burn yourself. </li><li>  Drill holes with a hand drill, while the drill is also properly heated. </li></ol><p>  So we learned how to make a pipe at home.  When performing all these actions, you will have a high-quality musical instrument in your hands.  What it will be made of is up to you. </p><p>  Bamboo, like reeds, is an environmentally friendly and pleasant to use material, not subject to special pollution.  <span>The bamboo flute is</span> easy to peel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mrsjmusic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wooden musical instrument." class="if uuid-2693247" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99336/2693247.jpg"></div><h2>  The art of creating a tool </h2><p>  The job description proves that making a flute is not such an impossible task.  But how to make a flute not just a beautiful little thing, but a full-fledged instrument on which you can play beautiful music? </p><p>  The main thing - you need to carefully approach the creation of playing holes and a whistle - they are responsible for the purity of the sound.  At the same time, the pipe should not be heavy, but light, as well as the musical sounds to be extracted from it. </p><h2>  DIY do-it-yourself tool </h2><p>  We hope this article helped you figure out how to make a pipe from various materials. </p><p>  Now you yourself can find what to make this wonderful tool from: the main thing is that the subject is hollow and strong enough. </p><p>  A little patience and effort, and you will have a great tool in your hands.  And, most importantly, the question will no longer arise about how to make a flute in your own hands.  Now you can try to play on it and imagine yourself as a carefree shepherd in endless fields. </p>
