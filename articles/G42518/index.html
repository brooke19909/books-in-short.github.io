    <p>  And the prerequisites of this enmity date back to the beginning of the 20th century, when after the formation of the Soviet state, the autonomous Nagorno-Karabakh region, which was mostly inhabited by Armenians, was included in the Azerbaijan SSR.  Seventy years later, the Armenian population still prevailed here.  In 1988, it was about 75% against 23% of Azerbaijanis (2% were Russians and representatives of other nationalities).  For a fairly long period, the Armenians of this region regularly expressed complaints about discriminatory actions of the Azerbaijani authorities.  The issue of reunification of <span>Nagorno-Karabakh</span> with Armenia was also actively discussed here.  The collapse of the Soviet Union led to the fact that tension could no longer hold back.  Mutual hatred escalated more than ever, which led to the outbreak of the Nagorno-Karabakh war. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In 1988, the Council of Deputies of the Parliament of the Autonomous Nagorno-Karabakh Region held a referendum in which the vast majority of the population supported joining Armenia.  As a result of the vote, the Council of Deputies requested the governments of the USSR, Azerbaijan and the Armenian Republics to authorize this process.  Of course, this did not cause delight from the Azerbaijani side.  In both republics, clashes on the basis of ethnic strife began to occur more and more often.  The first killings and pogroms took place.  Before the collapse of the state, Soviet forces somehow restrained the onset of a large-scale conflict, but in 1991 these forces suddenly disappeared. </p><p>  <strong>Nagorno-Karabakh war</strong> </p><p>  After the failure of the <span>August putsch, the</span> further fate of the Soviets became completely clear.  And in the Caucasus, the situation escalated to the limit.  In September 1991, the Armenians arbitrarily proclaimed the independent Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, while forming a fully operational army with the help of the leadership of Armenia, as well as foreign diasporas and Russia.  Last but not least, this was due to good relations with Moscow.  At the same time, the new government in Baku took a course towards rapprochement with Turkey, which caused tension in relations with its own recent capital.  In May 1992, Armenian forces managed to break through the Azerbaijani corridor, fortified by enemy troops, and reach the borders of Armenia.  The Azerbaijani army, in turn, was able to occupy the northern territories of Nagorno-Karabakh. </p>

    <p>  However, in the spring of <span>1993, the</span> Armenian-Karabakh forces conducted a new operation, as a result of which they controlled not only the entire territory of yesterday‚Äôs autonomy, but also part of Azerbaijan.  The military defeats of the latter led to the fact that in mid-1993 the nationalist pro-Turkish president A. Elchibey was overthrown in Baku, and G. Aliyev, a prominent figure of the Soviet period, took his place.  The new <span>head of state</span> significantly improved relations with post-Soviet states and joined the CIS.  This facilitated mutual understanding with the Armenian side.  The fighting around the former autonomy continued until May 1994, after which the heroes of the Karabakh war laid down their arms.  An armistice was soon signed in Bishkek. </p><p>  <strong>Conflict result</strong> </p><p>  In the following years, a continuous dialogue took place with the mediation of France, Russia and the USA.  However, to this day it has not been completed.  While Armenia advocates the reunification of this enclave of the Armenian people with its main part, Azerbaijan insists on the principle of territorial integrity and inviolability of borders. </p>
