  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bid power is a primitive form of government</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sliding power is a type of power relationship characteristic of a primitive society.  Primitive society is considered as one of the least internally differentiated and earliest forms of human societies.  When designating it, such terms as simple society or savagery are also used.  The use of the concept of "primitive society" indicates an elementary or basic level of technological and social organizational complexity. </p><h2>  What is potestar power? </h2><p>  Sliding power is a type of society management, the basis of which is the authority of one of the members of the primitive community.  The concept itself comes from the noun potestus, which in Latin means "power", "power".  Also, the basis of this type is the use of rather gross coercion.  In violation of the established rules and customs of a member of the community, they were severely punished, they could even expel him from the community, which in fact was a death sentence. </p><div class="photo" data-original="manashsubhaditya.blogspot.com" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="stone age people" class="if uuid-2674295" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100241/2674295.jpg"></div><p>  Thus, strong-willed dominance determines the formation of extraordinary power.  This, in turn, allows us to consider the type of potestar relations as a reflection of the principle of hierarchy between people and their teams.  Moreover, their asymmetry is a characteristic factor contributing to the stabilization of societies.  The period of its occurrence refers to the early stages of the historical and evolutionary formation of man, and the determining factor is the difference in functions characteristic of the specific roles of individual members of groups and society.  An important role, in turn, is played by the psychological mechanisms of power and submission. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Community Management Model </h2><p>  Initially, the basis of management characteristic of the primitive communal system was natural self-government, a model corresponding to the stage of ontogenesis of people.  Existing social conditions determined the nature of vested power.  This can be considered as a power, the nature of which is defined as public, since it was completely controlled by the community, and implementation was carried out through the formation of self-government bodies. </p><div class="photo" data-original="globalwarmingplanet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ancient people in the cave" class="if uuid-2674416" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100241/2674416.jpg"></div><h2>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  The following features of potestar power are distinguished: </p><ul><li>  The supreme authority was controlled by the general meeting of community members; all members of the community had the right to vote, without gender differences. </li><li>  Lack of a professional managerial staff.  After the removal, the former leaders again occupied the position of ordinary residents, without receiving any privileges. </li><li>  The basis of the system of government was authority, observance of customs. </li><li>  The tribe respected the interests of all relatives, the killing of any of them entailed blood feud. </li></ul><h2>  Management process in a primitive society </h2><p>  Any power relations are a political institution, and bargaining power as one of the forms of this institution implied the presence of certain social institutions.  The solution to all the basic issues related to the life of the clan was under the jurisdiction of the general meeting.  All adult relatives took part in this process.  At the head of the tribe was an elder who was elected from the most respected relatives.  This place was not occupied constantly, and it was not hereditary.  The elder‚Äôs authority was based on his authority, he did not have any privileges, he took part in all affairs and occupations of the clan and received his share of the manufactured product. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.shorthistory.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="primitive community life" class="if uuid-2674377" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100241/2674377.jpg"></div><p>  Further development of society was associated with the need for good governance, which led to a more detailed differentiation.  Positions began to appear that could be held for life.  Equally important in strengthening the new system was the emergence of religious beliefs.  The execution of these functions was entrusted to the priest, the shaman, his activity was very significant, since primitive people were part of nature and were directly dependent on the forces of nature, the basis of their beliefs was the possibility of appeasing them for receiving blessings. </p><h2>  Elements of the social structure in case of a potash type of power relations </h2><p>  A potash type of power and relationship appeared simultaneously with the first social hierarchical groups.  The division of primitive society occurred as a result of the decomposition of its structures.  The process of stratification of society is based on the division of labor and the resulting social differentiation.  At the same time, the management functions and their execution were not just divided between community members, this process was consolidated.  In fact, powerful social relations passed to special social groups.  The following are considered as protest formations: </p><ul><li>  segment state; </li><li>  chiefdom; </li><li>  early state; </li><li>  tribal reign; </li><li>  parapolis. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="futurewarstories.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ancient people" class="if uuid-2674379" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100241/2674379.jpg"></div><p>  The elements of the social structure during the transition from the primitive communal system to class society expressed the special position of certain families, clans in a tribe, and the union of tribes.  They were a continuation or other manifestation of family-clan relations and, above all, relations between families and clans. </p><p>  Thus, bargaining power is a special type of <span>power relations</span> inherent in the primitive communal system and characterized by the dominance of authority and customs priorities. </p>
