    <p>  Family and marriage in modern society are not as valuable concepts as before.  But this does not mean that they are absolutely depreciated, or that their diminution as value is justified.  It is no secret to anyone that the number of divorces in urbanized cities is growing annually, and, based on this, it can be assumed that our civilization has reached the stage where marriage, in the view of many, is not a goal, but a means.  Since goals are a more stable concept, which is rarely subject to change, and means, on the contrary, are more convenient to change depending on the circumstances, the sad statistics emerge from here: one marriage can easily be replaced by another, the moral of ‚Äúthere are no irreplaceable people‚Äù is also in this category, and the fact that children are left to grow up without a father or mother is, unfortunately, the norm of our time. </p><p>  In order to clarify the situation and draw the right conclusions, we define the basic <span>functions of the family</span> in modern times. </p><p>  <strong>Family in modern society and reproductive function</strong> </p><p>  The essence of this function is procreation.  Today, in developed countries there is a <span>demographic problem.</span>  It is strong marriage that can solve it when children are born in a family with officially registered relationships.  However, not everyone is able to support a large number of children, which is why financial assistance programs for <span>large mothers</span> and fathers are being implemented.  Due to sharp changes in the labor market, in the production and economic spheres, a decrease in the income level of many citizens occurs, which becomes an obstacle to the implementation of full-fledged family relations.  Often, women must work along with men, which leads to a decrease in the birth rate and the breakdown of marriage.  Most often, family problems in modern society are caused precisely by the lack of the ability to have children (for financial reasons or because of health problems), or their reluctance, which is based on psychological fears. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>Early marriages,</span> in which the newlyweds themselves still need some support and protection as well as children, also impede the realization of the reproductive function of the family.  The problems faced by <span>modern youth</span> are already quite complicated, and when a young family is faced with additional ones, in the form of life and financial issues, this certainly provokes a divorce if people are not comfortable with the role of dependents or if it is for them just unacceptable. </p><p>  Also related to the problems of reproductive function is the issue of <span>illegitimate children,</span> many of whom are sent to their homes because their mothers are unable to support them themselves. </p><p>  <strong>Family in modern society and educational function</strong> </p><p>  A family in the ideal sense is associated with stability.  That is why it is (again, in the ideal version) the guarantor of ensuring good offspring, which grows in good conditions under the supervision and protection of parents.  With the advent of the state system, the legislative framework also includes a number of rights and obligations dedicated to marriage bonds, which ensure a decent life for children born in the family. </p><p>  If people constantly changed their marriage partners, then it would be much more difficult for children born in these relationships to grow stronger due to the lack of support from one of the parents.  Unfortunately, in modern society this phenomenon is increasingly common. </p><p>  The implementation of the educational function is complicated by the fact that in most modern families, partners are usually equal, but the woman has more responsibilities because of the need to earn money and at the same time raise children along with household activities. </p><p>  Even worse, when children are left to their own devices due to the constant employment of their parents. </p><p>  <strong>Family in modern society and restorative function</strong> </p><p>  Many experts are of the opinion that marriage is half the success of a career.  Since a person is a social creature, and he needs to share his experiences, ask for advice, it means that it is very important when there are those nearby who are ready to support in difficult times and with whom trust relationships are established. </p><p>  Family in modern society, fortunately, still fully performs this function in most cases.  Few people agree to marry someone whom he does not trust or does not need at all. </p><p>  And yet, there are several difficulties that families face in realizing this function.  They are connected with the general culture of <span>family relations,</span> which is more difficult to form, the more common low values ‚Äã‚Äãare in society, encouraging a constant change of partners, proclaiming money as the main value of life, which affects both women who are hit by feminism and men who fear that from them, the partner needs only this ‚Äúmain‚Äù value.  Surely in this case, humanity and developed morality are able to make a strong, close-knit group and a worthy unit of society out of a family without abandoned children and single mothers. </p>
