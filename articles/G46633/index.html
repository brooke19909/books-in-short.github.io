    <h2>  Negative hotel reviews </h2><p>  Despite the huge number of positive comments, Anapa, "Grand Hotel Valentina" is characterized by a number of negative points.  Guest reviews speak of the following features: </p><ul><li>  the presence of a <span>clothes dryer in the bathroom</span> is certainly a positive thing, but due to the fact that it is all rusted, your clothes run the risk of being damaged; </li><li>  the hotel has almost no territory (with the exception of the pool); </li><li>  get far to the beach; </li><li>  distresses the lack of a refrigerator in the room (and the size and temperature of the minibar do not allow long-term storage of products); </li><li>  Having forgotten valuable things in the room after leaving, be prepared for the fact that, most likely, they will not be returned to you; </li><li>  all hotel rooms are literally saturated with tobacco smoke; </li><li>  the security system works well. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  "Grand Hotel Valentina" is a status establishment in the central part of Anapa, which offers decent conditions for accommodation at a fairly high price.  This option is suitable for you if you like comfort, luxurious furnishings and quality service.  The location is quite controversial.  On the one hand, all infrastructure facilities are within walking distance.  On the other hand, it‚Äôs far to go to the sea. </p><p>  The soul of the hotel is its staff, who is always ready to help guests.  It is also worth noting the work of the restaurant.  Here, guests will always find a huge selection of delicious dishes, as well as a hearty breakfast.  If we talk about the shortcomings, the main problem is the persistent smell of tobacco in all areas of the hotel.  Also in the guest rooms are very lacking refrigerators and electric kettles. </p>
