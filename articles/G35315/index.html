    <h2>  Suburbs of South Pattaya </h2><p>  The hotel we are describing is located near Jomtien Beach.  In fact, this is a separate village, but reviews of the Bannammao Resort 3 * hotel (Pattaya) describe it as a resort area.  There is some kind of homespun truth in this, since the center of the resort has grown and many surrounding villages have already entered there.  This happened with the Jomtien Beach area.  Unlike the rest of Pattaya, this is a very family resort.  Here are wonderful conditions for families with children.  This area stretches along the <span>Gulf of Thailand.</span>  The resort infrastructure is located very close to the sea and beaches.  There are many green corners and almost bucolic places. </p><p>  Quiet, especially in the evenings.  There are no shows or loud discos.  But a lot of not very expensive hotels, hostels and guesthouses.  There is a night market, many small shops and lots of restaurants.  Therefore, those who choose to vacation in South Pattaya should think what they need - peace of mind or <span>nightlife.</span>  If you want to wander around Woking Street every night, then you have to go there by transport.  And if your goal is a serene pastime on the beach, then these places are just for you!  Some of the <span>sights of Pattaya</span> are located near Jomtien.  This is a floating market, a dinosaur park and a big Buddha. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  From Bangkok to the hotel Ban Nam Mao Resort 3 * (Thailand, Pattaya) you need to get three hours by bus or transfer.  Most public transport from the capital stops near the North Road.  From there, you can get to the hotel with a tuk-tuk for about forty baht.  There is a special bus from Bangkok that stops right on Beach Road.  It costs about one hundred and fifty baht.  Tourists who do not have a very large number of bags and suitcases can ride a motobike with a breeze. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews about hotel Bannammao Resort 3 Pattaya" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1497646.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Location and what's nearby </h2><p>  If you want to visit the center of Pattaya and plunge into its entertainment and nightlife, then get there in just ten minutes by transport.  A free bus runs from the Ban Nam Mao Resort 3 * to the city, which greatly facilitates the cares of guests and does not burden their wallet.  It delivers guests to South Pattaya.  Not very far from the hotel are some interesting sights.  The Big Buddha statue is on Khao Chi Chan Hill, only a quarter-hour drive from the hotel, and the Phoenix Golf Club is ten minutes away.  True, the hotel does not stand right on the beach, but, on the other hand, this determines its seclusion. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Not far from the Bannammao Resort hotel (Thailand, Pattaya) there is a Seven-Ileven chain store and several cafes with affordable prices.

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  One of the most popular destinations for hotel guests is the Blue Lagoon.  This is the beach of the former military base in the Ambassador area with crystal clear water of amazing color and paradise sand.  This was one of the first resorts to open in Pattaya.  Many tourists visiting the hotel prefer island tours.  From here you can go to Koh Samet, enjoy a kind of corner of paradise life.  Travelers praise the Princess Island, which is especially good for divers.  Near it is excellent clear water and a rich underwater world.  Well, just to swim, it is better to take a ferry to Koh Lan.  To do this, you need to get to the Big C store on a white tuk-tuk, then on blue to Woking Street, and there is a seaport nearby.  From there to Koh Lan carry thirty baht.  There is a beautiful clean beach, good water and small waves. </p><h2>  Bannammao Resort 3 * (Pattaya): prices </h2><p>  The cost of a hotel room starts at one thousand seven hundred rubles per night.  Eating at a hotel restaurant costs about fifty baht per meal.  It can be ordered directly to your room for the same money.  The hotel bar is not very expensive cocktails.  They cost sixty baht.  Hot drinks - thirty each.  Tourists are advised to take American dollars in large bills - fifty and one hundred each.  So it‚Äôs more profitable to change to baht. </p><p>  At the night market in the center, cheap food and clothing.  At the fruit market you can buy fresh pineapples for fifteen baht apiece.  Local exotic fruits, leather bags and clutches, cosmetics (creams, balms), rum are brought from Pattaya.  Massage on the beach costs about three hundred baht, and in the city center - two hundred. </p><p>  If you buy guided tours, tourists do not recommend taking them at the hotel.  Better to use local stalls.  You will pay one and a half to two times less, and you will ride on the same bus as those who gave more money.  A taxi to the "Blue Lagoon" carries for 400-500 baht, so it is more profitable to go to a military beach in company.  Tourists say that it is cheaper to travel with a local driver.  Entrance to this beach costs 100 baht, and a taxi driver will buy you tickets at a special discount for Thais. </p><p>  If you use tuk-tuk, never give a specific address, just press the button to exit to the right place.  Otherwise, the driver will consider that you hire him as a taxi and take it at exorbitant prices. </p><h2>  Ban Nam Mao Resort 3 *: reviews </h2><p>  Guests praise this hotel, naming its main advantages - silence, greenery around and the proximity of the sea.  The atmosphere in the hotel is very comfortable and homely.  When tourists are in the center and see how noisy and crowded there, they are doubly happy that they chose this hotel.  Many even call it amazing.  It is best to take either bungalows or rooms with pool views. </p><p>  The hotel is very suitable for relaxing in a calm and relaxing environment.  When tourists compare the Ban Nam Mao hotel with the Ambassador, they say that the latter is too crowded and looks like an anthill.  And here people go not for parties, but to a completely different Pattaya - quiet and comfortable.  Among the vacationers are decent Russians, British and Germans. </p><p>  Tourists also wrote that in Jomtien you can make a good shopping.  At the intersection of Sukhumvit and Tepprazit, there are several shopping centers, including Tesco Lotus, Home Work and Metro.  Prices there are calculated for local residents, so you can buy different products cheaper than in the center of Pattaya. </p>
