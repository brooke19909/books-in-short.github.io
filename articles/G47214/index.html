It is for the exceptional climatic conditions, a calm sea with a minimum of algae, and white sand of the beaches that Russian tourists love.  And what are the hotels there?  Tunisia in this regard is very different from Turkey with Egypt.  The tourism industry began to develop in this African country for a long time, to a greater extent under the influence of France.  The first hotels were opened in the middle of the twentieth century.  Most of the currently operating hotels were built in the 70-80s of the last century.  But since their main guests were and are citizens of the European Union, everything in them functions at the highest level.  The island of Djerba, despite being connected to the mainland by a bridge, is located in a certain cultural isolation from the rest of Tunisia.  In the local hotels, the all-inclusive food system is mainly practiced.  Such is the Club Calimera Yati Beach 4 * hotel we are describing.  What do tourists say about him?  Here we put together a small digest based on their feedback. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Club Calimera Yati Beach" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2078292.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Subtleties of rest on Djerba </h2><p>  This island is first mentioned by Homer.  If you believe the ancient author, Djerba was inhabited by "lotus eaters", lotofagi.  They fed the Odyssey team with this plant, which is why the sailors completely forgot about their homeland and did not want to return home.  The cunning king of Ithaca had a chance to drag them by force onto the ship and tie them to the mast and benches.  But vacationers want to stay on Djerba without any lotuses.  It has excellent beaches, excellent thalassotherapy centers and the best dates in all of North Africa.  Djerba hotels also have their own peculiarity.  Five-star complexes differ from the "fours" only in the pompous architecture of the buildings (in the style of oriental palaces) and the same swaggering public, but not in any way with amenities.  The decoration of rooms, meals and services in hotels with 4 * are identical to those found in the "fives".  But the public there is more smiling.  So why pay more?  Reviews mention that thalassotherapy centers are often located at five-star hotels.  But their services are available to everyone for a fixed fee. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Club Calimera Yati Beach 4" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2078287.jpg"></div>

On the other hand, the capital of the island - Houmt Souk - is also close to the hotel.  Therefore, vacationers with a shared transfer to the hotel "Club Kalimera Yati Beach" brought one of the first.  From the Jerba Zarsis airport - thirty kilometers.  Houmt Souk is 20 km or ten minutes by taxi.  The nearby city of Midoun (Midoun) is a great cheap shopping.  The second largest city on the island of Djerba is located immediately behind the resort area, it can be reached on foot or by taxi for three dinars (about 70 rubles).  Midoun impresses the traveler with its oriental flavor - mosques, bazaars.  There is a museum of Lal Khadriy and a crocodile farm "Animalia".  In the city itself there are many restaurants and other entertainment.  Club Calimera Yati Beach 4 * (Tunisia, Djerba) is located in the resort area along with other hotels.  But the coast there has not yet been fully developed.  Nearby there is a wild beach, where there are backpackers' tents and where locals like to relax. </p><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  We have already mentioned how the five and four star hotels on Djerba differ.  The three buildings of Club Calimera Yati Beach 4 * hotel are completely unlike palaces drowning in luxury.  These buildings are new, built in a modern, if not to say, super-modern style.  Their facades are glass, and the architecture is rational, but not without originality.  Each building has a patio.  Two- and three-story buildings are interconnected by passages.  The cases are lined with the letter ‚ÄúP‚Äù.  Between them are swimming pools: adult, children and with slides of the water park.  On the other hand is a bar.  Immediately after it begins a spacious sandy beach, laden with sunbeds and umbrellas.  The hotel area is very well maintained.  No matter where you look, date palm trees are everywhere, bougainvillea blooms, other Mediterranean vegetation.  According to tourists, walking along the malls at the hotel is a pleasure.  The whole territory is well equipped: everything is close to everything, no one feels ‚Äúout of the way‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Club Calimera Yati Beach 4 Djerba" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2078289.jpg"></div>

Mostly, these are double standards.  For direct sea views need to pay extra.  But this applies only to the "high season", and when the hotel is half full, you can get a "sea view" just as a bonus.  For families, there are three categories of rooms at once: a family room, a superior family and akomodations family.  Most reviews cover the decoration of standards.  This room has a furnished balcony.  And if you were settled on the first floor, then you become the happy owner of a small veranda.  The bathroom in the rooms is separate.  The bedroom has a bed with a comfortable mattress, air conditioning, a flat-screen TV with 20-22 inches, a minibar (a refrigerator), two wardrobes, a desk.  The bathroom has a built-in hairdryer, toiletries are replenished daily. </p><h2>  What do tourists say about the rooms? </h2><p>  Officially, check-in at Club Calimera Yati Beach Hotel starts at noon.  But those who arrived early in the morning are fed breakfast and given them room keys.  Reviews also mention that the rooms are equipped with everything necessary for a relaxing stay.  The decoration of the bedrooms is pleasant, the windows are large.  The rooms themselves are bright and very clean, although they cannot be called too spacious.  The TV has an HDMI input.  Thus, you can connect a netbook to it, if you have the appropriate cord.  But all rooms have wireless internet.  The TV shows satellite channels, but none of them are Russian.  Reviews warn: the sockets in the rooms have a long metal cord.  If you want to bring flat-plug appliances with you, grab onto the HM adapter.  They clean the rooms daily and very diligently.  There is no information about thefts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Club Calimera Yati Beach reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2078291.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Not all of the coast of Djerba is snow-white sand with brochures.  There are also rocky silted places with many algae.  But not where Club Calimera Yati Beach is located.  There is only a small soft sand with rare interspersed small pebbles.  Descent into the sea is very smooth.  A depth of one and a half meters is observed fifty steps from the coast.  According to the law of Tunisia, all beaches in the country are municipal.  That is, the hotel owns sun loungers and umbrellas (free of charge for customers) on the coast, but cannot ban entry for merchants, camel drivers and other public.  But the alien people behave with restraint; they are not suitable for hotel beds.  The sea itself is beautiful in color and very clean.  Low tides are small, algae are few.  For diving, tourists say, you need to swim to a depth - there are more fish there. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Club Calimera Yati Beach 4 Tunisia Djerba" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2078294.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Pools </h2><p>  The full name of the hotel is Club Calimera Yati Beach Aquapark 4 *.  This means that there are slides.  But the reviews inform us that these attractions cannot be compared with a real water park.  You can ride a couple of times, but for an adult they do not represent some exciting entertainment.  The hotel is more focused on a relaxing holiday.  And those who are looking for relaxation on Djerba will find it very easily.  The hotel has an adult and a children's pool in the open air and one more - indoor and heated.  The sun terrace around them is lined with sunbeds and umbrellas.  The slides of the water park descend into a special pool, and the screech of those who repent will not disturb the pleasant nap.  Reviews of freshwater pools report very little.  Most tourists prefer to spend time at sea.  Especially when the water temperature in it exceeds 30 degrees.  And there are more entertainments on the shore: riding on bananas, catamarans, jet skis, yachts, parachutes ... And the pools have muffled music, and that‚Äôs it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Club Calimera Yati Beach 4 Midoun Tunisia" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2078293.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The Club Calimera Yati Beach Hotel only practices All Inclusive.  This is not Turkish All Inclusive according to the widest assortment of dishes, but European - food quality, judging by the reviews, at the highest level.  The main restaurant serves three meals.  Strictly scheduled, but in buffet mode.  If someone overslept breakfast - it does not matter: from ten in the morning until six in the evening they are fed continuously at the pool bar.  Would you like to leave the beach for lunch?  And it is not necessary!  In a large tent between the shore and the pool, lunch is served for such vacationers.  There are no free a la carte restaurants at the Kalimera Yati Beach Waterpark Club Hotel.  But in the main catering establishment themed dinners are arranged.  This means that not only the national cuisine of a certain country prevails on the tables that day, but also the style of the restaurant‚Äôs decoration and entertainment will match them.  For example, at a Tunisian gala dinner you can enjoy the performance of the ensemble, whose members play folk instruments, and the waiters will be dressed in Barbary costumes.  From six in the evening until midnight, bars are served free of charge. </p><h2>  What do nutrition reviews say? </h2><p>  On this account, all tourists agreed: they feed excellently in Club Calimera Yati Beach 4 * (Djerba).  If you are a traditionalist, you will find the usual European food on the tables.  Want to try exotic?  You can also choose Tunisian or other national dishes.  Vegetarian or vegan?  A large selection of dishes in the preparation of which no animal was injured.  A medical diet (gluten-free, lactose-free, etc.) must be reported upon check-in.  Breakfast, according to reviews, has one sin: instant coffee is served.  But from the dishes at the morning meal you can choose what your heart desires.  Very tasty pastries, as well as desserts - both oriental and European.  Soups, several types of fish and meat are offered for lunch and dinner.  Tunisian wine, according to reviews, is not bad.  Drinking water should be taken in bottles in bars - tap water can only be washed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Club Calimera Yati Beach Aquapark" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2078290.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Club Calimera Yati Beach Entertainment Reviews </h2><p>  About 80 percent of all hotel guests are Germans.  The rest are Poles, Czechs, Slovaks and Ukrainians.  Animation is present in the hotel, but it is focused on the main audience, so that a person who does not know the language will not understand it.  But no one will forbid you to dance in a disco.  There is also a mini club.  Children overcome the language barrier easily, and the next day they have fun playing with German peers.  Club Calimera Yati Beach Aquapark provides many activities for children.  They ride camels and donkeys.  There is a playground and a children's pool.  The hotel also has a gift shop and currency exchange. </p>
