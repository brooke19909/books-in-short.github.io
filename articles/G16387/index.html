  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Broomstick knitting: description, patterns for beginners</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Crochet is one of the most popular types of needlework.  However, there are several directions in it.  Knitting using the broomstick technique is not as popular as many others, but the craftswomen should pay attention to it.  Products made in this technique are original.  In this case, knitting does not require special devices and a lot of time. </p><h2>  Features of the technique </h2><p>  Knitting using the broomstick technique appeared in Peru, for this reason it is often called Peruvian.  Here, not only women, but also men were engaged in this type of needlework.  When working, the craftsmen used mainly alpaca yarn.  This animal has soft hair, the number of natural shades of which reaches 50 pieces.  Today, when working with a thread, different technologies are used.  This is coloring in bright colors, and the addition of acrylic inclusions. </p><p>  This technique acquired its name thanks to an auxiliary tool - the broomstick, which the masters used when knitting.  Literally, its meaning is translated as "the handle of the broom." </p><p>  The main difference between this knitting is that it has elongated loops.  In the process of knitting, they are often combined into groups.  The result is a loose bulk fabric. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Broomstick knitting for beginners" class="if uuid-3075385" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58721/3075385.jpg"></div><h2>  What is required for knitting </h2><p>  Before you start to master Peruvian knitting brumstik, you should prepare all the necessary materials and tools.  The wizard will need: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  yarn; </li><li>  a suitable size hook; </li><li>  fork for peruvian knitting. <div class="photo" data-original="hallockville.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="broomstick knitting" class="if uuid-3075471" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58721/3075471.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  If you don‚Äôt have a fork at hand or if you didn‚Äôt find this tool in a specialized shop for needlewomen, you can replace it with another item, such as a clerical ruler.  Plastic products are best suited for this purpose.  When choosing, you should pay attention to the width of the ruler, since this indicator affects the height of the elongated loops.  There are also special thick knitting needles for knitting in the Peruvian technique. </p><h2>  Broomstick knitting for beginners </h2><p>  Work begins with a set of crocheted chains consisting of air loops.  Their number should correspond to the number of loops in the figure.  After that, act as follows. </p><ol><li>  The last air loop extends and is put on a fork or ruler. </li><li>  The hook is introduced into the next air loop and knit a crochet.  The resulting loop is pulled and put on a ruler. </li><li>  A similar work pattern is used to knit all the air loops from the chain. </li><li>  The knitting is turned over, a hook is introduced under the first 5 elongated loops and remove them from the ruler. </li><li>  Loops twist from right to left and tie them with 5 single crochet stitches. </li><li>  The hook is introduced into the next 5 loops located on the ruler, remove them again and twist from right to left.  After tying with 5 single crochet columns, they proceed to the next loops. </li><li>  When all the loops are removed from the ruler and tied, the canvas is turned over and the next row of elongated loops is drawn onto the ruler.  They do this according to the same scheme as the previous time. <div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="peruvian knitting broomstick" class="if uuid-3075390" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58721/3075390.jpg"></div></li></ol><h2>  Knitting patterns </h2><p>  In addition to the described classic knitting pattern using the broomstick technique, there are several more variations.  Their use in work allows us to diversify products and make them unique. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Fastening elongated loops.  This is the simplest and easiest embodiment of the technique, however, the appearance of the canvas will be slightly different from the classic.  In this case, the elongated loops are not grouped into 5 pieces, but are tied with single crochet (for each elongated loop there is 1 single crochet). </li><li>  Fastening in 3, 4, 5 loops.  The execution technique in this case is similar to the classic version.  Only the number of loops combined in a group changes. </li><li>  5-loop stitch pattern with single crochet  After the main drawing is completed, 2 RLS are followed, after which a number of elongated loops are again dialed. <div class="photo" data-original="kru4ok.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet master class" class="if uuid-3075450" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58721/3075450.jpg"></div></li></ol><h2>  Peruvian knitting from chains of air loops </h2><p>  There is knitting using the broomstick technique, which is made from chains of air loops.  This knitted fabric has a high density and is suitable for making warm winter clothes.  It can be sweaters, hats, scarves, plaids.  So that knitting does not look coarse and unnecessarily heavy, you should choose a thin thread. </p><p>  The work is performed according to the following scheme. </p><ol><li>  Knit a chain of air loops. </li><li>  1st row - strapping loops with single crochet. </li><li>  The second row begins to knit as follows: perform a chain of 16 air loops.  This number is responsible for the size of the elongated loops, so the number can be varied at your discretion. </li><li>  The chain is fixed on the loop of the 1st row.  Each loop should have one broomstick. </li><li>  After all the broomsticks of the 2nd row are knitted, they are grouped in 3, 4, 5 or 6 pieces and tied with crochets.  It should be borne in mind that the number of air loops should be a multiple of the number of loops in one group. </li></ol><h2>  Knitting needles pattern </h2><p>  Classic Peruvian crocheting is done using a hook.  However, needlewomen can use in work a similar knitting pattern with elongated loops on the knitting needles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vazanie-vsem.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="elongated loop pattern" class="if uuid-3075414" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58721/3075414.jpg"></div><ol><li>  On knitting needles gain loops.  Their number should be a multiple of 5 + 2 edge loops. </li><li>  1, 2, 3 and 4 row of knit facial stitch. </li><li>  The 5th row is knitted as follows: 1 loop - the front, then make a yarn (double rotation of the thread around the knitting needle).  After each facial loop make 1 yarn. </li><li>  When switching to the 6th row, 5 loops are transferred to the right knitting needle.  In this case, all the crochets need to be lowered.  After that, they are transferred to the left knitting needle and knit through 5 loops.  In the same way, repeat the action with all the remaining loops in the row. </li><li>  Row 7 is a repeat of row number 1. <div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to knit elongated loops" class="if uuid-3075443" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58721/3075443.jpg"></div></li></ol><h2>  Technique without accessories </h2><p>  In addition to the methods described above, there is another option how to knit elongated loops.  For him, additional devices are not required, however, knitting even loops in this case will be somewhat more difficult. </p><ol><li>  First prepare a chain of air loops.  Their number should equal the number of broomsticks + 4 loops for lifting. </li><li>  The hook is introduced into the 5th air loop and the thread is pulled through it to the level of the lifting 4 air loops. </li><li>  The resulting loops are not removed from the hook.  Pass the hook into the next air loop and stretch it. </li><li>  In this way, the number of loops that is required to form the broomstick group is hooked. </li><li>  Crochet the thread and pull it through all the elongated loops. </li><li>  The next step is to knit another single crochet.  This is followed by another 5 single crochet. </li><li>  According to the intended scheme, other broomsticks with a harness are knitted. <div class="photo" data-original="todoshop.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet master class" class="if uuid-3075452" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58721/3075452.jpg"></div></li></ol><p>  This crochet and knitting workshop can be used to make large items such as sweaters, shawls, scarves, hats, dresses, tunics, and more.  In addition, the Peruvian technique is great for finishing the bottom of the product.  Thanks to such an edge, the clothes get a finished elegant look. </p>
