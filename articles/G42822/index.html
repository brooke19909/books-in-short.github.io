  <section class="page js-page"><h1>African climate</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The formation of the <span>African climate</span> is influenced by various factors.  The mainland is located within seven zones.  Due to the fact that the equatorial line crosses Africa almost in half, <span>climatic zones</span> repeat from the equator to the borders of the continent.  It should be noted that the conditions under which the formation of weather occurs, south and north of the middle of the mainland have their own characteristics.  This is largely due to the fact that the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe northern part is twice as large as the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe southern region of the continent.  In addition, the southern subcontinent lies between the Indian and Atlantic oceans.  The neighborhood with Eurasia, from which the north and northeast of Africa is separated by warm intercontinental seas (Red and Mediterranean), is also of no small importance.  Two tropical, two subequatorial and <span>equatorial zones</span> are distinguished on the territory of the mainland <span>.</span>  In the subtropics are extreme North and extreme South Africa. </p><p>  The climate of the coast of the mainland is formed under the influence of sea currents.  The northwestern, eastern, southwestern regions are characterized by low humidity.  This is due to the influence of the Canary (cold) current.  The southeastern and western shores are more humidified.  Here, the climate of Africa is affected by <span>warm currents</span> (Mozambique and Guinea). </p><p>  The main part of the continent lies between the tropics, and therefore receives a lot of solar heat and warms up very well, especially in the vast northern territory.  The prevalence of high temperatures makes Africa's hottest climate on the planet. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Some elevation of the edges of the continent compared with the internal region contributes to the formation of the continent, which is characteristic of the mainland.  This is especially pronounced in the northern part, due to its size and proximity to Eurasia. </p><p>  Africa's climate is mainly formed under the influence of the trade winds and subtropical maxima of both hemispheres. </p><p>  In the Sahara (in <span>North Africa)</span> dry northwest and northeast winds prevail.  The southwest monsoon blows towards them, bringing humid air and rain to the territory of the Guinean coast and Sudan. </p><p>  The climate of Africa in the east, in the region of Ethiopia and Somalia is formed under the influence of the Indian monsoon. </p><p>  Almost all of southern Africa has a dry climate, especially in the interior.  The exception is the Cape region.  Here cyclonic activity is activated along the polar front. </p><p>  In the main part of the mainland, high temperatures are set under the influence of strong insolation (illumination) and depend on the height of the solstice.  <span>The average annual temperature</span> in a significant region of the continent exceeds 20 ¬∞ C.  Due to the fact that the northern part of Africa is more massive, it heats up more.  Here, the highest monthly temperature (35-40 ¬∞ C) and the maximum daily temperature recorded on the planet (up to 58 ¬∞ C) are recorded. </p><p>  The "continental" climate is manifested throughout Africa.  It is expressed mainly in significant daily temperature fluctuations.  So, for example, in the Sahara, amplitudes can reach fifty degrees. </p><p>  The climate in Africa is characterized by extremely uneven distribution of precipitation.  In the equatorial part, heavy rains regularly fall.  Maximum precipitation was noted on the slopes of the Cameroon massif. </p><p>  To the south and north of the equatorial strip, rainfall is associated with the influence of the monsoon.  Their total annual rates vary greatly depending on the topography and geographical location. </p><p>  Towards the extreme south and <span>extreme north of the</span> continent, as the subtropical zone approaches, the amount of rain increases. </p>
