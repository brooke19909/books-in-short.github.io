Of course, the center of events has always been and remains a tree.  If in previous years it was exclusively natural, cut down in the forest, and later - sometimes artificial (when the fashion for such trees began to spread rapidly), nowadays there is a third option.  This is a rental of live spruce in a pot, which is brought from the nursery and returned there after the holiday.  Such a modern and environmentally friendly option was enthusiastically welcomed by those who are not indifferent to the issue of deforestation. </p>

    <p>  But the choice of artificial Christmas trees in our time is striking in the variety and imagination of manufacturers.  What fluffy beauties you will not meet in smart showcases on New Year's Eve!  If the classic green spruce has already become boring to you, you can very well choose the option in a luxurious silver color or, for example, a graceful snow-white tree.  Some of them are already on sale with a full set of jewelry.  But, in our opinion, it‚Äôs much more interesting to do the decor of spruce on your own. </p><h2>  Decorate our tree </h2><p>  There are a lot of decorating options for spruce.  Children, as a rule, are delighted with toy animals and fairy tale heroes hanging on branches, and especially with sweets hanging on a string of tangerines and all that is so pleasant to discover among the branches and enjoy eating! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  "Advanced" adults, having seen enough of Western catalogs with options for Christmas decoration at home, often choose a strict and stylish decor with balls of the same shape and a single but refined color.  Sometimes a couple of flowers are chosen and the "interior" is already fully designed for them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="decoration of the apartment for the new year" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1074821.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The older generation has nothing nicer than to get old toys from the mezzanine - witnesses of an unforgettable youth.  These fragile glass figures with naive, in modern opinion, decor are especially warm and, of course, have every right to attend the celebration. </p><p>  It is considered fashionable and modern to hang cute handmade toys on the Christmas tree, both of their own manufacture and bought from handmade masters.  These cloth dolls, stars, horses, angels with a wonderful property bring comfort and peace to the house. </p><p>  <span>Decorating an apartment</span> for the New Year necessarily involves such an important element of decor as candles.  How without them!  A few large, in luxurious candlesticks of exquisite shape or a lot of small, "scattered" on the table - these "living lights" have an unusual, just the same magical appeal. </p>

    <h2>  Go to the bedroom </h2><p>  It's time to continue our efforts and think about how to decorate the whole apartment for the New Year, and not just the living room.  Let's go to the bedroom. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  ‚ÄúWhy decorate it?‚Äù You ask. ‚ÄúAfter all, you almost never have to sleep on New Year's Eve.‚Äù  But a holiday is a holiday!  Screaming luxury in the bedroom is not needed, it is better to give preference to delicate white-blue and silver shades. </p><p>  We propose to change the usual bedspread to ‚Äúwinter‚Äù - snow-white or blue, to throw silver pillows on the bed, and the usual bedroom will magically transform into a room from Snow White Castle! </p><p>  Lay out glass balls on the windowsills (or hang them on the windows) (we'll talk about decorating the windows), and in order to avoid the feeling of cold, take care of beautiful candles. </p>

    <h2>  How to decorate a nursery </h2><p>  It is especially important to know how to decorate the apartment for the New Year in order to please the children.  After all, they are waiting for the holiday more than anyone else - the kids still live in a fairy tale.  Therefore, it is so important not to disappoint them.  In the New Year's decoration of the children's room, the main thing is a sense of celebration and safety. </p><p>  A great idea is to put a separate small Christmas tree in the child‚Äôs room.  From his own tree the baby will be delighted!  Pursuing her decor, take away fragile glass toys.  Textile, plastic and small wooden decorations are the best option for a baby who should not accidentally get hurt or upset because of a broken ball.  In addition, such toys can always be removed from the tree and arrange a fabulous performance. </p><p>  Paper garlands hanging throughout the room, posters and Christmas-themed panels - with Santa Claus, bunnies, snowmen, favorite characters - will change the interior so cool!  They can be bought ready-made, since the choice is huge now.  And you can start creating drawings and posters yourself - if time allows. </p>

    <p>  Of course, the child must participate in this!  The opportunity to decorate an apartment for the <span>New Year with your own hands</span> immediately raises the crumbs in your own eyes.  Even if the baby is still very small, his drawings and other "works" should take their rightful place in the festive decoration of the nursery.  And how much joy the process of such creativity will bring! </p><p>  And yet - in such a case as decorating an apartment for the New Year, photos of the child himself and the situation of last year's holiday will also not be superfluous, and in the children's room they will be very welcome. </p><h2>  The kitchen can also be "dressed up" </h2><p>  This is especially important for the hostess - because during the holidays she will have to spend a lot of time in the kitchen.  And the mood should remain creative and upbeat.  Garlands hanging on the ceiling and decorative balls or amusing souvenirs laid out on shelves can create a suitable mood.  The main thing is that they do not interfere with the hostess. </p><p>  A small kitchen room is perfectly decorated with small spruce branches, cones, bright ribbons, small shiny balls of the same color.  From all this, you can collect decorative garlands and place on the walls. </p><p>  You can update the interior for the holiday by buying new kitchen potholders and towels: with snowmen, deer, Santa Claus.  Oranges will make wonderful fragrant decorations - just cut the peel in several places and stick sprigs of cloves or other spices.  And again, do not forget about the candles. </p>

    <h2>  Let's have a dining room </h2><p>  How to decorate an apartment in the New Year, which has a separate dining room?  It should also be decorated festively.  The center of the composition, of course, is the table at which the family will have to raise glasses with champagne.  Here, perhaps, the most important design element is elegant textiles <span>(tablecloth, napkins, new</span> curtains with New Year's themes: snowflakes, deers, etc.). </p><p>  To decorate the table, tiny fir-trees made of glass or fabric, vases with small shiny balls, gilded or silver-plated cones that can even be placed on the backs of chairs are wonderful. </p><p>  When choosing a napkin and tablecloth, pay attention to the ‚Äúclassics‚Äù of the New Year: red, golden, green and white.  Between beautifully folded napkins, you can arrange mini-surprises for each member of the family: Christmas trees, souvenirs, small greeting cards with short greetings tied to sweets. </p>

    <h2>  We make out the doors and the hallway </h2><p>  The custom to decorate the front door with a Christmas wreath came to us from the West and has seriously taken root.  In addition, it is customary to use all kinds of pendants and garlands to decorate doorways (in the hallway and not only).  But it is important to adhere to a sense of proportion.  Try to maintain the overall style and color scheme. </p><p>  To create a ‚ÄúNew Year's mood‚Äù from the threshold, a small Christmas tree or a bouquet can be planted on the curbstone in the hallway.  Or attach separate branches at the corners.  The hallway lighting will be quite appropriate: New Year's garlands or large silver snowflakes hanging in the opening on threads are perfect.  And the mirror can be easily painted with <span>frosty patterns</span> or depict a winter landscape on it. </p><h2>  New Year's window </h2><p>  What is the best way to <span>decorate windows?</span>  If possible - change the curtains to white with a silver pattern, and the "winter" mood is provided!  From above, window openings can be additionally decorated with garlands of silver snowflakes, placed candles on window sills and hung several bright ornaments in golden red tones. </p><p>  Complemented by a snowy landscape behind glass, your windows will look like a real work of art.  And if you add an electric garland to their decoration, then the New Year mood will be provided for you already at the approach to the house! </p>

    <p>  In addition, drawings on glasses are always in fashion.  Apply them with aerosol paints or regular watercolor on a stencil - paper figures glued to glass, which are then removed.  However, you can use the most ordinary thin brush. </p><h2>  How to decorate a one-room apartment for the New Year: decor options </h2><p>  But what if housing conditions do not allow you to create "on a grand scale"?  Suppose you have a cramped, just one-room apartment.  Is it possible to abandon the ideas of festive decor that are so dear to the heart? </p><p>  Nothing like this!  Now we will consider several ideas on how to decorate an apartment for the New Year, if there is only one room.  First of all, let's think about the right choice of a Christmas tree.  Due to the limited space, the purchase of large spruce, alas, will have to be abandoned.  What are the alternatives? </p><p>  There are usually three.  Or you bring a miniature tree fresh and smelling of pine needles from the Christmas tree bazaar, set it in the ‚Äúfestive‚Äù corner that was freed up in advance and arrange an elegant composition on its basis.  Of course, you can‚Äôt do a round dance, but in general, a corner can look very cute and stylish. </p>

    <p>  Or go the other way - get an artificial Christmas tree of the right size and to it - a fragrance with the smell of needles.  After the holiday, you can easily disassemble your structure, fold it more compactly and remove it on the mezzanine for a year - what is not an option for owners of small apartments?  In addition, you do not have to sweep the needles. </p><h2>  Other ideas <span>how to decorate an apartment</span> for the New Year with a lack of space </h2><p>  Finally, you can always arrange a Christmas tree bouquet, even a few, arranged in beautiful ceramic vases.  From these bouquets you can make small "Christmas trees" of any desired size, even the smallest ones, and the base - vases or jars of water - can be beautifully draped with cotton wool and decorated with sparkles.  Under such a Christmas tree, it is quite possible to place real gifts for children. </p><p>  If horizontal surfaces for the installation of Christmas tree bouquets are sorely lacking, the composition of Christmas tree branches in the form of a wreath can be hung somewhere in a conspicuous place (to save space - in the window opening). </p>

    <p>  Comfort in a small apartment will be created by tinsel, it does not take up much space and drapes beautifully anywhere: on chandeliers, curtains, mirrors.  But most of all, the same candles will create a romantic atmosphere, especially if you plan to celebrate the New Year only together. </p>
