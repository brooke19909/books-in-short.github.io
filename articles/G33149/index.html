Racing manufacturers fill all segments with brand new models.  Some devices go by the wayside and are not remembered at all.  And others can become popular due to one appearance.  That is how the Honor 8 audience won the love.  Customer reviews left the most flattering. </p><h2>  Where from? </h2><p>  Not all users know that this smartphone is the brainchild of China's largest company, Huawei.  The corporation has been operating since 1987 and is located in China. </p><p>  The company has been manufacturing various equipment for a long time and has already managed to become popular in the CIS region.  Among the products of the manufacturer there are not only smartphones, but also other products.  Huawei is working on the release of wireless equipment, core network devices, network devices.  Engaged in the production of applications and hardware, as well as terminals. </p><p>  But it was the phones that brought the company to the world market.  By 2015, she took third place in the production of smartphones worldwide.  The same situation persisted by the beginning of 2017. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  And so, among all the models, Honor 8 appeared.  Customer reviews immediately indicated all the advantages of the device.  We will talk about them further, but for now - general information about the model. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="honor 8 customer reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2014088.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The smartphone was announced in the summer of 2016.  Honor is a sub-brand of Huawei. The main advantage of the novelty is the appearance.  The whole body is made of mirrored glass.  The screen received 2.5-D technology.  The edges of the smartphone are framed by a metal frame.  All this looks so beautiful that I want to spit on subjectivity. </p><p>  Technically, the model was also savvy.  Despite the fact that customer reviews of Honor 8 are still more focused specifically on design, experienced users were able to appreciate the ‚Äústuffing‚Äù. </p><p>  Another ‚Äúfeature‚Äù of the device was a special camera.  She was previously seen in the Huawei P9, and now the dual lens has settled on the back cover of this device.  Here the camera is somewhat simpler, with limited functionality. </p><p>  The manufacturer decided to position the model as a flagship, which will appeal to fans of not only technically savvy devices, but also fans of an unusual design.  The cost at the time of release was a noticeable 30 thousand rubles for a model with 64 GB. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  This is the most beautiful smartphone.  Yes, the statement is loud, but if you see it live and can hold it in your hands, you will definitely agree with this statement.  Among Huawei devices, you definitely can‚Äôt find a prettier one.  Among other models, you can search for aesthetic competitors. </p><p>  The novelty has received some features of the <span>Samsung Galaxy S6 / S7.</span>  Here, rather, we are talking about a mirrored rear panel.  But in the Chinese version, it turned out even more interesting than in Korean.  It's all about the illusion that the mirror surface creates. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The most beautiful of all color variations is blue.  It conveys the blueness of the sky, and the depth of the sea, the green of the grass and at the same time a magical emerald.  It‚Äôs hard to believe that the designers planned to get such paints.  It seems that the technical "chameleon" turned out quite by accident. </p><p>  Continuing to talk about colors, it is worth mentioning that there is a variation of the classic white and black.  They were complemented by a gold and blue model.  Gold Honor 8 received different reviews from the owners.  Not everyone liked this shade. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="honor 8 owner reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2014092.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Materials </h2><p>  According to the manufacturer, the phone is made from environmentally friendly materials.  The developers followed the requirements of RoHS and REACH certificates: they abandoned harmful chemicals. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the coating is glass and glossy, prints and greasy spots are practically invisible on the body.  This was achieved due to the <span>oleophobic coating.</span>  Probably, for the first time this technology was shown in full glory.  Nevertheless, the finger still glides smoothly. </p><p>  The question arises: will the device slip out of the hands?  As practice has shown, no one has encountered a similar problem.  The only thing that had to be prevented was the sliding of the smartphone on the surface, especially when vibration was activated.  In this case, the phone strove to "run away" from the owners. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Another problem appeared: you can solve the slip with a cover, but you don‚Äôt want to cover such beauty.  But, as the practice and customer reviews of Huawei Honor 8 show, it is still desirable to secure the device, because the case is far from metal, and when dropped, cobwebs and terrifying cracks may appear. </p><p>  In general, continuing the thought of damage, it is important to immediately warn that you can not hide from them.  Unfortunately, the glass is scratched easily.  Unless, of course, you carry the phone all the time in your hands and put it only on a special pad.  In other cases, at least the slightest scratches will appear after a couple of weeks.  The front panel is less sensitive in terms of damage. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="honor 8 reviews review" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2014091.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The metal edging showed itself well.  Firstly, it is matte, which is very beautifully combined with glass.  Secondly, it is practically not subject to external defects. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Of course, the description of the device is unlikely to affect the customer reviews of Honor 8 64 GB.  But since we undertook to do a review, we need to sort things out. </p><p>  So, the phone weighs 153 grams.  Its height is 14 cm, width - 7 cm, and thickness - only 7 mm.  Due to the rounded corners and the special design of the edges (2,5-D) the smartphone fits comfortably in your hand.  Moreover, the dimensions are universal for both a large male hand and a sophisticated female. </p><p>  The main part of the front panel, as usual, is occupied by the screen.  The model was not declared as frameless, so even on the sides there is a thin border.  The frames above and below are decent.  A front camera, several sensors, an indicator of missed notifications and a speaker were placed above the display. </p><p>  Under the display, there was an empty space on which the device name was placed. </p><p>  The back panel is minimally occupied by different elements.  In the upper left corner, two lens eyes are visible, next to them is a laser light for autofocus and a double LED flash.  It can emit a warm and cold glow. </p><p>  At the top in the middle is a round ‚Äúwindow‚Äù of the fingerprint scanner.  It is slightly recessed into the body.  You can also hear about him a lot of customer reviews of Honor 8 32 GB.  The fact is that the developers made it a mechanical button, which can be variably customized. </p><h2>  Details </h2><p>  The ends are evenly occupied by various elements.  The bottom, as always, has a place to connect the charger and headset.  There is a speakerphone hidden right next to which a microphone is hiding. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="honor 8 customer reviews how to shoot video" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2014089.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The upper end took an additional microphone for noise reduction and an IR transmitter.  And this is in 2016!  In general, it is unlikely to be useful to anyone. </p><p>  The left side is occupied by a barely noticeable combined slot.  You can install two nano-SIMs here or use a memory card instead of one SIM card.  Although there were craftsmen who can push all three cards into this small container. </p><p>  The right end got two buttons.  They got a relief surface, a soft and confident move.  At the top is the volume button, below it is the power key. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The display description continues the review of Honor 8.  Reviews screen gathered positive.  Firstly, due to the small diagonal of 5.2 inches.  In 2016, it was a universal size.  Now there is a trend towards larger diagonals. </p><p>  Above the screen, the frame was 15 mm, under it - 16 mm.  On the sides there is a border of about 3 mm.  Protected the display with anti-reflective and oleophobic coating. </p><p>  Resolution with a diagonal of 5.2 inches was 1920 √ó 1080 pixels.  This is an excellent indicator that provides a clear rich picture.  The aspect ratio is 16: 9 at a density of 423 pixels per inch.  For the model, they chose the IPS matrix - a rather expensive solution. </p><p>  Overall, the screen quality is excellent.  Brightness and saturation are balanced.  No overexposure was noticed.  The only thing is that in some moments black is a bit overpriced.  Equipped the display with eye protection technology, which lowers UV radiation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="honor 8 customer reviews pics" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2014094.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Viewing angles are average.  It does not overexposure or darken the image with a negative and positive tilt.  But still, color changes are noticeable. </p><h2>  "Shell" </h2><p>  You can continue the review of Honor 8 with customer reviews of the software platform.  Many were pleased that they were among the first to receive the device on Android 6.0.  The proprietary ‚Äúshell‚Äù this time became EMUI 4.1.  She, of course, interrupted all the new items from the Google operating system. </p><p>  But the proprietary platform provided the user with a number of useful features.  For example, if you drag from left to right on the touch buttons, the display conditionally turns into a four-inch one.  This is necessary for those for whom the diagonal of 5.2 is still large and does not allow fully using the phone with one hand. </p><p>  If you swipe the screen from top to bottom, a search bar will open across the entire gadget system.  You can change the appearance of the touch buttons.  You can install one item that will manage several options from the desktop at once. </p><p>  We should also mention the ‚Äúwindow‚Äù on the back of the smartphone.  In addition to the fingerprint sensor, a mechanical button is built in.  Its manufacturer calls ‚Äúsmart‚Äù, because it can perform several functions. </p><p>  For example, a simple press sets the camera to start, double-clicks to open the browser, and press and hold to call mom. </p><h2>  Photo / Video </h2><p>  Honor 8 received a lot of reviews about the camera.  The manufacturer himself did not think for a long time and decided to introduce the well-known lenses from Huawei P9 into the new product.  In the last smartphone, the camera was a "chip", apparently, therefore, it was duplicated in the new model. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="honor 8 64gb customer reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2014087.jpg"></div>

    <p>  To begin with, these were one of the first attempts to introduce dual-chamber devices on the market.  This is now everyone is happy with the numerous "apple" and Chinese lenses.  Last year, it seemed a gimmick. </p><p>  The phone has two cameras that do not work on a stereo image or super blur.  It was decided to install two modules for more important things. </p><p>  Each lens works in a resolution of 12 megapixels with a matrix from Sony.  The aperture of both cameras is F2.2, the viewing angle is 27 mm.  The right eye is responsible for color shooting, the left - for the creation of monochrome pictures. </p><p>  This couple works according to the following principle.  The black-and-white module collects information about the amount of light.  The sensor can analyze the dynamic range.  Accordingly, sensitivity increases.  The second module remembers colors.  All this is combined, and good photos are obtained. </p><p>  "Honor 8" customer reviews in this regard collected the most positive.  Of course, there is information that the novelty was equipped with a different version of the modules, but the pictures did not deteriorate much. </p><p>  Daytime photos are unusually cool.  No need to use HDR: the camera does not hide the brightened areas and does not show non-detailed dimming.  There are no problems with colors and white balance. </p><p>  When the lighting diminishes, the photos are slightly worse.  Sharpness disappears and noise appears.  Although the colors are still bright and saturated. </p><p>  Many wondered how Honor 8 was making a video.  Customer reviews on this subject are different.  Someone liked the quality of the shooting and the fact that the videos are obtained in FullHD resolution.  Someone did not have the maximum frequency of 60 frames. </p><p>  In fact, the videos are recorded in medium quality.  But they differ in fast focusing and good sound. </p><h2>  Technical component </h2><p>  The manufacturer independently worked on the chipset.  HiSilicon Kirin 950 is manufactured according to the 16 nm process technology, works with 8 cores.  Half of them operate at a speed of 2.3 GHz, half at a speed of 1.8 GHz.  Responsible for the schedule is the Chinese representative of Mali-T880. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="honor 8 pro customer reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2014093.jpg"></div>

    <p>  There is a lot of RAM inside 4 GB - even a year later.  The internal memory can be 32 or 64 GB, depending on version.  In this case, you can supplement the storage with a memory card. </p><p>  The battery inside received a volume of 3000 mAh.  On average, moderate use discharges a smartphone in 18 hours.  If you use 4G, then the operating time is reduced by three times.  Continuous play will last 4 hours, and video viewing - 7 hours. </p><h2>  Modification </h2><p>  Not everyone knows, but another smartphone was launched on the market - Honor 8 Light.  Customer reviews on his account are average.  Of course, they could not expect more from him than from the average or even older version of the Honor 8 Pro, but I still wanted some general style. </p><p>  If you go back to appearance, then, at first glance, as if nothing had changed.  There is even an identical set of body colors.  Both models can be distinguished only by the fact that the younger one was deprived of the second ‚Äúeye‚Äù of the camera. </p><p>  But if we consider both phones in life, then Honor 8 Light loses noticeably.  Customer reviews of the deadly rink went through its design.  The manufacturer decided to save, so not only is plastic in front of us, it‚Äôs also very cheap.  This model was denied even in an oleophobic coating.  As a result, we face a cheap cheap smartphone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="honor 8 light customer reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2014090.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The only thing that pleased me was that, technically, he was not much spoiled.  There is still an eight-core processor, but somewhat weaker.  The same thing happened with the graphics: it was downgraded to Mali-T830.  But the RAM is 4 GB, and the 32 GB version will appeal to most users. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  In general, customer reviews of Honor 8 can make an overall impression of this model.  Subjectively, it turned out to be very cool.  Of course, the first thing that users note is appearance.  Many owners claim that they can attract the attention of passers-by with this device. </p><p>  It‚Äôs cool that the manufacturer managed to back it all up with a good ‚Äústuffing‚Äù, a good platform and a cool camera. </p><p>  Users noted good communication modules, system performance, high-speed charging and high-quality photos.  A positive assessment was given to clean sound in speakers and headphones.  I liked additional options that not everyone may need, but their presence will not hurt anyone. </p><p>  The complaints touched the fragile body.  When you hold a glass telephone, you begin to panic involuntarily and "coward over it."  For some buyers, the smartphone nevertheless strove to slip out of hands, which is also always frighteningly displayed in operation. </p><p>  Some did not have enough battery capacity, someone did not put all their files in 32 GB.  But all these are more subjective flaws that arise due to the inattention of potential buyers.  The rest of the Honor 8 is almost perfect.  Of course, if you want, you can find fault with something.  But is it worth it when you have such a beautiful gadget in front of you? </p>
