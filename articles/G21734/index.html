As a rule, few sympathized with the Jews, and even fewer who tried to help them.  The Jews themselves, who were trying to correct the situation during the Second World War, were completely few.  It was during this period that such a figure as the Duke of Yitzhak Aizik appeared. </p>

    <p>  To this day, Israelis still value his contribution to the development of Israel and the Jewish people as a single independent whole.  Duke Yitzhak, not fearing for his life, forced a ring covering the map of Japan, the USA, the USSR, Ireland and many other states, in order to save and remove the threats of his fellow tribesmen from under the fascist. </p><h2>  Origin </h2><p>  Duke Yitzhak (1888 - year of birth) - the son of Rabbi Yoel Herzog - was born in the Russian Empire in a city called Lomza, which later left Poland.  Ten years later, the family moved to England, as his father was appointed rabbi of Leeds.  At twenty, Yitzhak received a Jewish letter of honor.  Even in his early years, the young Yitzhak Aizik Herzog discovered various talents in himself.  The biography of the future rabbi is full of numerous trips to England and France, where he, along with the study of the Torah, graduated <span>from the University of</span> London and <span>Paris.</span>  After graduating from them, he perfectly mastered such sciences as mathematics, philosophy, and also the Semitic language. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Becoming a Rabbi </h2><p>  After studying theta, the permission for which the Duke Yitzhak received in 1914, he was appointed rabbi to the Irish city of Belfast.  From here began his ascent through the ranks in the religious world.  Already in 1919, Isaac became the rabbi of Dublin, and even later, in 1925, he was appointed rabbi of all independent Ireland. </p><p>  While in this post, Yitzhak Aizik receives a lot of knowledge by communicating with his fellow tribesmen.  In a short time he gains respect from both Jews and non-Jews.  His first prominent case is the lifting of the ban on slaughtering livestock by Jews, which has been so long held in the lands of Ireland. </p><h2>  British White Paper </h2><p>  During World War II, the British government introduced a decree later nicknamed the White Paper, which states (in short) a ban on finding more than 75,000 Jews in Palestine-controlled England for five years.  Further entry of Jews is possible only with the consent of the local population (Arabs). </p><p>  Thus, the White Paper is nothing more than a refusal to help the Jews, perceived by the Jewish people as the indifference of the British authorities to him.  In other words, the doors of salvation were closed, and the Jews were left in the Nazi massacre. </p><p>  Naturally, other countries supported England.  For example, the Turkish port refused to land Jewish refugees from the Struma ship, who managed to escape from the clutches of the fascist Holocaust.  After holding the ship for a long time in the port, the Turkish authorities ordered to tow it away, which promised death for all its passengers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The ship was very shabby and was not able to move in the waters, which contributed to its sinking.  Of the eight hundred, only two survived.  According to some reports, it is alleged that the Struma was sunk by a Russian submarine that mistook the ship for a fascist warship. </p><h2>  Yitzhak protest </h2><p>  With Churchill's presidency, the question of canceling the White Paper was raised at a meeting, but no one was willing to cancel this decree, with the exception of one less influential politician. </p><p>  However, not all Jews were left to wait for their demise.  Formations arose that fought against the English decree, such as Lehi.  Their plans included the expulsion of the British from Eretz-Israel in order to open the passage for Jews to Palestine.  But their actions were unsuccessful.  Although many historians claim that they were useless actions.  After all, with the departure of the British, the only thing that shone Eretz-Israel was the arrival of the Germans. </p>

    <p>  Duke Yitzhak took an active part in saving the Jewish people in this situation, starting with numerous conversations with state leaders, including receiving from Churchill and ending with breaking the White Paper in half at the entrance to Yeshurun ‚Äã‚ÄãSynagogue. </p><h2>  Helping the Jewish people with the Holocaust </h2><p>  There was not a single European anti-Hitler state that he would not visit in an attempt to save his people Isaac Isaac.  His biography also includes various trips to the United States and southern Africa.  He demanded that the American authorities begin the bombing of the "death camps", in the USSR he achieved a corridor for refugees in Japan and Eretz Israel.  Yitzhak visited Palestine, ignoring numerous dissuasions when the Nazi units were about to enter it.  At the end of the war, he traveled around Europe for a long time, helping Jews immigrate to Israel, collecting Jewish children in monasteries that covered them during the Holocaust. </p>
