The main one on Olympus was Zeus.  He dictated to people the general law and order.  And individual deities were responsible for specific areas of life. </p><h2>  Large family </h2><p>  First there was Chaos.  He gave birth to Gaia - the goddess of the Earth.  And deep in the bowels, <span>Tartarus</span> was born <span>.</span>  <span>This is a</span> terrible black abyss.  Then came all the revitalizing Love, then Day and Night, Light and Darkness.

    <p>  To them were added heroes, titans and other celestials worthy of respect and veneration. </p><p>  The ancient man felt as if at once in two parallel worlds.  On Earth, he lived, worked and raised children.  And from above one or another god was looking after him.  He was required to read, ask for help and give thanks.  Obedience is a must, otherwise the patron may be very angry. </p><p>  So the ancient Greek story, intertwined with mythology, is very interesting.  The culture of Hellas powerfully influenced the consciousness and life of the inhabitants of the Roman Empire.  And she, in turn, conveyed her attitudes and traditions to almost every people in Europe. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The most ancient gods are closely associated with pan-Indo-European religious beliefs.  And therefore there are parallels in the names.  So, for example, the Roman goddesses Selena and Venus among the Hellenes were, respectively, Aurora and Aphrodite.  Hellenic Ares, the patron saint of the military, was called Mars by the Romans.  The doctor Asclepius, respectively, became Aesculapius.  Zeus himself - Jupiter.  Etc. </p><h2>  Portrait did not </h2><p>  In ancient Greece, the young goddess of fire and hearth named Hestia is the eldest daughter of Kronos and Gaia.  Her father is the supreme deity (or titan), the son of the first god of Heaven (Uranus).  And mother is Earth (Gaia).  The famous Zeus is her brother.  Hades and Poseidon, too.  There are two sisters in this celestial - this is Demeter and Hera. </p><p>  The goddess of fire and the hearth of the Romans, who oversees the order in people's homes and the preservation of family warmth is called Vesta. </p>

The same beauty Aphrodite - naked and with an apple in her right hand - was seen by many.  White marble to her face!  The sculpture of Hera - the main goddess on Olympus, the progenitor of absolutely all other gods - is also impressive.  And the warrior Athena, daughter of Zeus, we represent.  Only here, the modest Hestia - in human form - had never been portrayed before.  But all felt it, and so - in the living flame of the hearth, then in the fire of the church, temple, home.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But later, statues still appeared in the cities, and quite rare ones.  Hestia's appearance corresponded to her character.  This is purity and chastity, the imprint of the most rigorous morality.  Most often, she sat or stood in a calm pose.  On the face - nothing frivolous, it is the most serious, strict.  Also, the girl was always fully dressed in a long dress. </p><p>  The circle became its symbol.  That is why all sources of heat in homes have its shape. </p><h2>  Empowerment </h2><p>  It so happened (and it is very natural) that the goddess of fire and the hearth became at the same time the patroness of the community of each city.  Only the Hestia were dedicated to their main buildings.  Inside stood an altar on which an <span>eternal flame</span> burned in honor of her <span>.</span>  And if someone from the townspeople left his native country in the colony, then he took the torch from here.  He carefully drove him all the way to kindle a hearth in his future home, in his new homeland. </p>

    <h2>  War of opinions </h2><p>  Do not think that on Olympus - silence and grace.  Oh, sometimes violent passions boil there!  So, our serious heroine Hestia, the goddess of the hearth, categorically did not accept the beauty Aphrodite, fundamentally did not approve of her behavior.  But the one with the enviable title ‚ÄúGoddess of Love and Beauty‚Äù was also responsible for fertility, spring, and life in general.  She had enough care.  She was busy about love and marriage, procreation.  She fed the babies.  Despite such a wide range of responsibilities, the beauty managed to flirt with the men of Olympus.  And her power was subordinated to all - and the eternal gods, and mere mortals.  To whom he wants, love will be sent to him, like happiness or suffering. </p>

    <p>  Only in any way she could not influence the "obstinate" and independent of Athena with Artemis and Hestia.  She was generally famous for her ruthlessness to those who did not recognize love or directly rejected it. </p><h2>  Good compensation </h2><p>  Hestia was a good girl.  But she was not going to marry anyone.  She rejected even Poseidon, the powerful <span>god of the seas.</span>  And he was an enviable groom.  When after the victory over the titans the gods on Olympus began to divide the world, he got a lot - the water element.  But other local gods were also related to it.  So, for example, Nereus, this good man and a very fair old man.  Here is a wonderful personification of a peaceful and calm deep sea.  This is exactly what promises sailors safe sailing.  Also, the Ocean is the patron of water.  But it washes the earth and creates the sources for rivers, directs sea currents.  Finally, Proteus is also a sea deity, a working shepherd of huge herds of seals.  But the brave Poseidon pushed everyone away from the tidbit.  This is how sometimes the Greek gods and goddesses live ... </p>

    <p>  Hestia also did not accept the hands of a universal favorite and a true handsome man, a real blond and the patron of the arts of Apollo.  She vowed to remain a virgin forever.  And then Zeus, her brother, granted her the exclusive right.  He placed his sister in the center of a large house.  There she could offer the best sacrifices. </p><p>  Since then, the goddess of fire and the hearth has become very revered.  With her began to identify all the important rituals - wedding, related to the birth of children and in general family. </p><h2>  Start a successful business </h2><p>  The Greeks still have the old saying "start with Hestia."  What does it mean?  Strict and majestic, very responsible, the goddess of fire and the hearth took sacrifices before the beginning of any of her rites.  Moreover, it makes no difference whether it is a private matter or a public one.  And with this help, the people‚Äôs initiative went well.  That is why the people of Greece have made such a saying. </p><p>  To her, this thoroughly strict, exacting and caring girl, Homer devoted his best hymns. </p><p>  <span>The ancient Greek goddess</span> Hestia was revered by people at the same high level as Hermes - the god of profit in trade, rationality, dexterity and even eloquence. </p><p>  By the way, she was his aunt.  And if the focus of the goddess was inside the dwelling, then the symbol of the god of commerce - the pillar - was placed in the doorway.  Hestia's fire gave light and warmth to the whole house.  And the sign of Hermes did not let evil pass through the threshold, and all sorts of troubles, misfortunes, guaranteed wealth to the owner. </p><p>  So these gods harmoniously complemented each other. </p>

    <h2>  Not subject to influence </h2><p>  When we distinguish the features of Hestia in a modern woman, you can be sure that the most controversial situations will not have the same negative effect on her as on other people.  Neither co-workers, nor relatives or friends have power over it either.  She remains with her personal opinion always.  She can‚Äôt be bought either by promises of an excellent career, nor by money, nor by power.  This character is flint.  Such a woman - a holistic personality, is not divided into parts. </p><h2>  Sacred fire family </h2><p>  Roman goddesses by their purpose, and by nature, "copy" the Greek.  So, Vesta is like a sister to Hestia.  She had many helpers.  So, in the temples for the sacred fire looked vestal girls.  They guarded peace, warmth, loyalty to the hearth.  And as if they were an image of this goddess.  They lived separately from everyone.  The Romans greatly respected them and ordered them to behave like Hestia.  That is, chastely and honestly. </p><p>  If one of the vestals lost his virginity, then the consequences for her were catastrophic.  The anger of the people was just terrible. </p><p>  Of all the inhabitants of Olympus, one Hestia was not included in all sorts of intrigues, conflicts.  And she did not possess such abilities.  Its scope is wisdom, rationality, judgment, calmness and justice. </p>
