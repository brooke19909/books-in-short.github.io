Getting here is quite simple, driving close to Sochi, inexpensive taxis will take guests from the bus station, railway for a fairly modest fee.  The road will take no more than half an hour.  The address of the White Nights sanatorium in Sochi (we will review the reviews about it) is L214, Uch-Dere. </p><p>  Friendly staff and luxurious views meet the guest on site.  The Black Sea coast in this area is especially valuable due to the climate, and due to the peculiarities of the landscape, flora and fauna.

Photos and reviews of the White Nights sanatorium (Sochi) show that people are happy with visiting the health resort, no matter what time of year they managed to come here. </p><p>  Studying the main advantages of the sanatorium, it is necessary to note a good location.  Despite the relative proximity to Sochi - a large city and transport hub - the health resort itself is limited from other human settlements by a natural "barrier".  Here you can not hear the hustle, bustle of the city or the highway.  Reviews of tourists about the resort "White Nights" in Sochi indicate that the territory of the hospital is very large, nothing prevents to enjoy a relaxing holiday.  In total, the health resort has ten hectares, but only three of them are used by man, the remaining seven are the Botanical Kuban Garden. </p><h2>  Unique beauty </h2><p>  Reviews and reviews about the sanatorium ‚ÄúWhite Nights‚Äù (Sochi) always pay special attention to the Kuban Garden.

    <p>  How to get there?  From the reviews of the White Nights sanatorium (Sochi), it is clear that there are no railways or highways directly through the health resort lands, but there is a tunnel leading to the bathing places.  However, getting here is not difficult.  If you do not want to spend money on a taxi, you can use the minibus or bus.  Regular transport links are established year-round. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Tasteful rest </h2><p>  Among other things, on the ten hectares owned by the health resort there is a magnificent beach, strewn with pure pebbles.

    <p>  The system of three meals a day is provided.  In the sanatorium, each meal is served as a buffet, offering visitors a wide selection of diet dishes.  In the presence of individual indications, you can count on dishes from the chef that satisfy the recommendations of doctors.  Fresh vegetables and fruits, original desserts are regularly served to the table.  The menu has over 40 items.  There is a bakery, so guests of the sanatorium can count on fresh fragrant pastries.  And all this in a fairly inexpensive three-star establishment, located in the bosom of fabulously beautiful nature. </p><h2>  Services and features </h2><p>  Spend your free time and treat yourself to local cuisine not only in the dining room of the sanatorium.

    <p>  Being 20 kilometers from the city is not a reason to feel isolated from civilization.  Being treated in a modern sanatorium, you can delight yourself with new fashionable hairstyles in a local beauty salon, spend time in a bath - Russian, Turkish or Finnish, maintain yourself in great shape in a fitness room, wellness center. </p><p>  For walks there is a well-kept park, you can withdraw money from the card at an ATM, and parking is available for those arriving by their own car.  An airport shuttle service is provided.  For those who come with children - children's menus and a playground. </p><h2>  Where to live? </h2><p>  Especially a lot of information in the reviews contains about the living conditions in the sanatorium.  Of course, not everyone is satisfied, because the hospital is three-star, and not five stars.  However, given the price tag, the proposal, as many recognize, is really advantageous. </p><p>  All rooms are decorated in accordance with the expectations of a modern person.  There are beds and tables, a TV and a fridge, a private bathroom in each room.  In addition, other minor benefits of civilization are provided, such as: fire alarm, radio, small furniture.  There are rooms for more demanding ones - suites decorated according to European standards.  These have showers.  There are balconies on floors 4 to 15, but balconies are not provided on floors 2-3 floors.  I must say that few people pay attention to this when booking, as can be seen from the dissatisfied reviews. </p><h2>  For people with advanced requirements </h2><p>  For those who expect the best from relaxation, the sanatorium has furnished comfortable accommodation.  Having booked this option, you can count on two rooms at your complete disposal. </p>
