The length of the steep coast is 30 km, the width is 5 km. </p><p>  The uniqueness of this lake lies in the existence in one body of water of both fresh and salt water.  In 1961, the <span>Black Sea</span> and Donuzlav were connected by a water channel, turning the latter into a gulf of water.  The composition of the water at the mouth of the reservoir is close to the salty sea.  But in the northern part of the reservoir there are many underground springs that desalinate the lake. </p><p>  Reed, cattail and reeds have grown in the northern part of Donuzlav.  In summer and spring it is impossible to stop looking at water lilies and egg capsules.  Migratory waterfowl <span>(coot,</span> crackling teal, water chicken, and rats) do not fly by, and local inhabitants choose a nesting place here.  Due to the many living birds, this territory has been declared a protected area. </p><p>  More recently, Lake Donuzlav, whose photo is in the article, has become available for tourists.  Earlier, a Soviet military base was located here, and later - a Ukrainian one. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Donuzlav lake" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1339689.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Fauna </h2><p>  Numerous crowds of people who are interested in fishing are sent to these places to meet their dreams.  You can catch sturgeon, flounder, mullet, red mullet and other representatives of the underwater world in sea water.  Typical representatives of fresh water from such a reservoir as Lake Donuzlav in the Crimea are bream, rudd, silver carp, carp, and pike perch.  In total, scientists count about 52 species of fish, 30 of which are sedentary, while others migrate.  There are also rare representatives of the "fish kingdom", listed in the Red Book. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The fauna of Lake Donuzlav is rich in crabs, shrimps, mussels, and raps.  Also, a population of the Black Sea oyster is still preserved here. </p><p>  Analyzing the fertility in the lake for the formation of farms for the cultivation of algae, fish, shellfish, scientists came to the conclusion that Donuzlav is the most promising reservoir of Crimea.  The affirmative results were obtained from studies on the artificial breeding of oysters of giant and Black Sea mussels.  With respect to flounder, the glosses and mullet Pilengas that inhabit Lake Donuzlav, the figure of the probable population of 1.5 thousand tons per year is announced. </p>

    <h2>  Fishing </h2><p>  From the beginning of summer to September, the attention of fishermen was riveted to catching carp.  The weight of fish when using high-quality gear reaches 30 kg!  It is best to catch it at dawn and in the evening.  The bait can be corn, boilies, potatoes.  Fishing on Lake Donuzlav will not leave anyone indifferent.  All that is necessary for fishing is allowed to be taken for temporary use at a local club.  The cost of fishing per day varies within 700 rubles. </p><p>  When fishing from the shore, it is necessary to acquire not a spinning rod, but a fishing rod.  If you want to feel like <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãfishing,</span> you should take a boat with you.  The cry of gulls, the iodine smell and the unbroken breeze - all this will remind of the sea. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Healing properties </h2><p>  Lake Donuzlav (vacationers' feedback on the water area and the surrounding area is only positive) has a lot of silt at the bottom, which has a healing effect.  The muds of Saki and <span>Moinak lakes</span> are very similar in their characteristics to this silt.  Its use is recommended for softening, toning and whitening the skin of the face and body, as well as eliminating wrinkles and blackheads. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fishing on the lake donuzlav" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1339691.jpg" width="600"></div>
