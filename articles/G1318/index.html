The capital of this tropical paradise is the main resort area, where there are countless casinos, restaurants, hotels and other establishments for recreation and entertainment.  These islands are not just a tropical corner, which is strewn with pink and white sand washed by the azure sea.  There are incredibly lush vegetation, a rich underwater world, as well as an indestructible life, day and night. </p><h2>  The most important resort </h2><p>  The Bahamas are islands that are divided into resorts of various categories, starting with the most densely populated by locals and tourists, ending with completely deserted and even untouched.  The main resort center here is New Providence, which is the capital of the state, the city of Nassau.  This recreation area is the noisiest.  All tourists here visit Cable Beach, which offers all kinds of water activities.  From here, they often go on excursions through underwater tunnels that mimic the ruins of Atlantis, and also rent equipment for diving, snorkeling or just a yacht for traveling.  Right next to the beach is a row of casinos where <span>game tables</span> are located on terraces with sea views.  But being in this resort, you can very quickly leave the Bahamas.  The capital is the starting point for a bunch of bridges that lead to the quiet and calm island of Paradise.  Here are hotels for lovers, golf courses and so on. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bahamas capital" class="if" height="220" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/622936.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is added to all dishes that are prepared here.  That is why the honeymoons spent here are often delayed.  And, in principle, I don‚Äôt want to leave this place.  The restaurants located here have long gone down in history and become legends.  For example, the institution Martinique, where they treat French cuisine.  It was mentioned in one of the first films of the ‚ÄúBondiad‚Äù and has since become legendary.  Brazilian cuisine can be enjoyed at Churrascaria Restaurant.  It serves lamb, pork, salads and refreshments.  Also, this institution is famous for its unique wines - more than 200 species are stored in their basement.  But Portofino Restaurant is a corner with real Bahamian cuisine.  It often hosts a buffet.  If you get on it, you can taste the real local seafood. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the main city of the bahamas" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/622934.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Residence </h2><p>  Living in one of the Nassau hotels will not be too cheap.  If you are counting on a budget vacation, then you should carefully search in advance for a two-star hotel, where the room will cost up to 2000 rubles per day.  Most of the hotels that are designed for the middle class are included in the three-star category, and the price of living in such rooms is about 3000-4000 rubles.  Expensive apartments and penthouses here are prohibitively expensive.  Still, this is the Bahamas, the capital, where there are many casinos for millionaires, and all that is required for the most expensive first-class vacation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bahamas Islands" class="if" height="220" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/622938.jpg" width="600"></div>

This significantly affects the price, which, in turn, is extremely beneficial for tourists.  In the city of Nassau, you can buy everything from shoes and clothes to home appliances and even cars.  The main thing is to take all this home with you.  There are no bans on the import and export of currency and goods, therefore you can not limit yourself to purchases.  In addition to imported items, local trinkets are very popular here.  They are made from straw or shells.  Thus, original souvenirs are obtained, which will become for you a memory of paradise vacation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cuba bahamas" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/622935.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Metropolitan Attractions </h2><p>  The Bahamas are small islands, but there are plenty of natural and architectural places of interest for travel enthusiasts.  Begin your tour with Parliament Square.  All the main houses of the state government are located on it.  It is especially beautiful here in the evening when the lights come on.  The next item is the Royal Gardens.  They were opened in honor of the British Queen Victoria and exist to this day.  In the gardens you will find lush tropical vegetation, green labyrinths, artificial ponds and waterfalls.  Nearby is the Royal Staircase, which was made slaves after the death of Queen Victoria.  Each of its steps means the year of life of the ruler.  And the main attraction of the capital is Paradise Island.  The most elite resort, where not only rich people gather, but also the rulers of Arab and European countries. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of the Bahamas" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/622937.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Big bahamas </h2><p>  The northernmost island of the archipelago is Big Bahama, which is not noisy like Nassau, but very diverse.  There are beaches for every taste, and here are some of them.  The most famous is Gold Rock.  It is surrounded by tall palm trees, vineyards and other plants.  The sand strip is very wide, because the beach is ideal for passive relaxation.  For lovers of extreme sports there is Tiger Beach.  The waters adjacent to it are inhabited by striped sharks, so swimming in the sea is not for the faint of heart.  There is also Paradise Bay.  It is surrounded by corals, among which there are not only white, but also black. </p><h2>  Andros </h2><p>  Diversity not only in entertainment, but also in the natural treasures - this is what the Bahamas are famous for.  The capital may seem too noisy for lovers of passive relaxation, because they most often go to Andros.  This island is lined with green tropical plants, there is a rich underwater life, round knocks above the earth reign silence and peace.  There are many abandoned buildings of past centuries, the style of which cannot be precisely determined.  And according to legend, red-eyed elves live here on the tops of pines.  Many claim that they themselves saw them. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Caribbean countries such as Cuba, Bahamas, the Dominican Republic and the Yucatan Peninsula are very similar in nature.  However, living conditions, prices and entertainment in each of these corners are fundamentally different.  For example, a vacation in Cuba will be very economical.  You can see the ‚Äúruins‚Äù of socialism, so to speak, plunge into history and swim in the sea.  But in the Bahamas, life is in full swing.  These are the islands of the future, fashionable resorts, expensive and very beautiful with lots of entertainment. </p>
