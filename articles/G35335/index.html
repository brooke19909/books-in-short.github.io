    <h2>  First steps in history </h2><p>  This invention of mankind has a very long history, the beginning of which is quite difficult to find.  But it is known that initially it was just matter, which lay on the seat.  After some time, she acquired a lining of warm fiber, ties, a bright pattern on the front.  As a result, she began to look like a real pillow for a chair. </p><p>  Over time, this decor element was modified, receiving more and more new details.  The ruffles, ribbons, lace and beads formed into real patterns on the pillow, making it a real work of art.  Yes, maybe now these decorations will seem superfluous and you, rather, choose some practical fabric with a simple pattern.  But still, this detail will remain an adornment of our home. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Home workshop </h2>

    <p>  What is the value of various needlework?  For the fact that you can do everything at home, using various waste items, including old sweaters, pillowcases and rugs.  Such materials will be just perfect for making pillows on chairs with your own hands. </p><h2>  Necessary materials </h2><p>  Sewing a pillow on a chair with your own hands will not be difficult even for novice seamstresses who work with uncertainty on a sewing machine.  To do this, you will need: </p><ul><li>  Fabric for pillows.  It is very important to consider where the chair on which the pillow is made is located.  If it is located in a cold room, then the best material will be a wear-resistant felt.  If most of the time the chair is on a bright balcony, then the non-burning matting will fit perfectly into such a set.  The length of the fabric is selected individually.  This figure only depends on the size of your chair. </li><li>  Filler.  Since the pillow performs not only a softening, but also a heating function, a good layer of foam rubber or some kind of cotton wool will be a great addition to the product.  But it should be borne in mind that over time, poor-quality filler can fall off. </li><li>  <span>Sewing supplies.</span>  It can be either a machine or a set of needles and threads. </li><li>  Buttons  If you want to make your pillow more original, then various buttons will help you fulfill your idea. </li><li>  Ties for pillows.  Their role can be performed by any ribbons, laces, ropes, home-made strips of fabric and chains.  The main thing is that they cope with their task and keep the product in the right place. </li><li>  Pattern.  Without it, it will be difficult to make a pillow on a chair with your own hands. </li></ul><p>  When everything is ready, you can begin to work. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Making patterns for pillows on chairs with your own hands </h2>

    <p>  First you need to make a pattern.  To do this, determine the type of product.  If you want a round pillow, then as your pattern you can take the usual circle.  If you still decide to make a product whose shape matches the shape of the seat, then you will have to work a little. </p><p>  To do this, attach a piece of thin paper or tracing paper to the surface of the chair.  Since this material is thin, outlines can easily be seen through it.  They will be a pattern.  Cut along the contour and get the desired workpiece. </p><p>  Since most people prefer to make pillows on chairs with their own hands, photo patterns in various variations can be found on the Internet or in various magazines. </p><h2>  Sewing stage </h2><p>  Do not be afraid of the name of this stage, since it does not imply any difficulties.  The whole process can be decomposed into small stages: </p>

    <ol><li>  To get started, take a paper pattern and apply it to the selected fabric folded in half.  Having circled the pattern with a bar of soap or a marker, we carefully cut out the blanks, remembering to leave a couple of centimeters for allowances and, if necessary, chipping layers of fabric with pins. </li><li>  Now we sew three of the four sides of our pillow.  Carefully hold the fabric or simply sweep the workpiece along the contour in advance to avoid wrinkles.  It is worth clarifying that the entire crosslinking process occurs on the wrong side of the material. </li><li>  Having turned out a pillow on the front side, we fill it with stuffing material. </li><li>  Sew the fourth side of the pillow, carefully hiding the inner lining and seams. </li><li>  Now we sew the ties to the pillow.  This can be done both from the top and bottom of the product.  This is most conveniently done manually, since the sewing machine is unlikely to be able to flash a thick lining complete with two layers of fabric.  From ribbons, you can form small bows that will perfectly decorate the finished interior element. </li></ol><p>  It should also be recalled that the length of the tape should be sufficient to reach the legs of the chair, make a turn there and tie a bow.  This method is considered very convenient, since its mobility ensures quick removal of the pillow at any time. </p>

    <h2>  Finishing touches </h2><p>  Now that our pillow is ready, you can safely put it on a chair and use it for its intended purpose.  To do this, simply put the product on the seat, fix it in the right position and tie the ribbons. </p><p>  This is undoubtedly a thing that you can spend time on.  In addition, it should be noted that handmade pillows for chairs are a great option for a housewarming gift or just for some holiday.  And most importantly, the soul and all the warmth that it will give to the owner for many years loyal to him service is invested in such a thing. </p>
