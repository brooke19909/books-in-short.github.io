    <p>  In Naberezhnye Chelny there are three administrative regions: Komsomolsky, Central and Avtozavodskaya.  The last two locals call the New City.  Naberezhnye Chelny is characterized by double addressing: houses have an address along the street and construction.  The postal code for Naberezhnye Chelny is 423800. </p><p>  Strange is the fact that, despite the territory of 171.03 km¬≤, numerous streets, avenues, boulevards, side streets and tracts, the city does not have a single official square.  The climate here is temperate continental.  The city has long frosty winters and warm summers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The population of Naberezhnye Chelny </h2><p>  The population of the city today is more than 500,000 people.  As for ethnic composition, there are Chuvashs, and Bashkirs, and Russians, and Ukrainians, and Tatars.  If we talk about the percentage, the majority of the local population are Russians and Tatars, 44.9% and 47.4%, respectively. </p><p>  Despite the fact that Naberezhnye Chelny is a multinational city, people live in it peacefully and are distinguished by a high level of tolerance.  Here it is impossible to see or hear that representatives of one nationality or religion clash with those who identify themselves with another ethnic group.  High in the city moral values ‚Äã‚Äãare valued.  A man left in trouble is not about Naberezhnye Chelny.  Which area is the home of the one who needs help is completely irrelevant to the locals. </p>

    <p>  The fact that the population of the city is steadily aging is upsetting.  Every year in the city there are more people of retirement age and fewer youth.  So, today about 60% of the population are of old age, and about 40% are young people. </p><h2>  How to get to Naberezhnye Chelny? </h2><p>  International flights, intercity buses, trains, vessels mooring at the river port - all these modes of transport deliver people to the city of Naberezhnye Chelny.

    <p>  For trips to nearby cities, locals and tourists prefer to use buses.  Although buses from Naberezhnye Chelny bus station leave for more distant cities of Russia, including <span>Chelyabinsk, Perm,</span> Ufa, Samara, etc. As mentioned above, there is a river port in Naberezhnye Chelny, where suburban and intercity ships arrive. </p><h2>  History of Naberezhnye Chelny </h2><p>  According to archaeological excavations, the first settlements on the territory of modern Naberezhnye Chelny were in the III millennium BC.  e.  According to some sources, there was a city in the XII and XIV centuries.  More accurate data are available on this settlement during the New Time period.  So, it is known that in 1626 there was the Chalninsky repair.  A little later, the village of Naberezhnye Chelny was founded, which later turned into a city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Its rapid development dates back to the 1960s.  At this time, the first plants were built here, the most famous of which is KamAZ, and the <span>Nizhnekamsk hydroelectric station.</span>  In 1982, the city began to be called Brezhnev, in honor of the then head of the USSR.  However, in 1988, it was returned to its former name - Naberezhnye Chelny.  (What area in those days was able to avoid such renaming?) And the old name, apparently, was more to the inhabitants. </p><p>  The post-Soviet period for Naberezhnye Chelny is characterized by a decline in industry, exacerbated by a major fire at the KamAZ engine plant.  A new wave of revitalization of production in the city occurred in the 2000s. </p>

    <p>  One of the most beautiful temples is the church of Cosmas and Damian.  Her building is one of the oldest in the city.  The temple was built in the middle of the 19th century by the merchants Stacheevs.  This architectural structure is a vivid representative of the Byzantine style.  In the 30s of the XX century the temple was closed, in 1992 it was transferred to the Kazan diocese. </p><p>  Looking at the sights of Naberezhnye Chelny, one can not ignore the Taube mosque, the completion of which falls on 1992.  The hall of the mosque has traditional tent coverings.  The southern facades of the temple are decorated with details and extracts from the Koran.  The minaret was erected in the Art Nouveau style. </p><h2>  Theaters of Naberezhnye Chelny </h2><p>  Guests of Naberezhnye Chelny who cannot imagine their travels without a cultural pastime should visit the State Tatar Drama Theater, which was founded in 1990.  Despite the fact that the theater is quite young, it has already managed to win many awards, among which diplomas received at competitions such as the International Festival of Turkic Peoples, the Karim Tinchurin Festival and the Zakama Region Festival.  His repertoire has 65 performances, and the hall is designed for 200 seats. </p><p>  If you travel with children, then most likely they will not be interested in the streets and houses of the city of Naberezhnye Chelny, but they will be happy to watch the performance at the State Puppet Theater.  Moreover, the choice of performances here is very large, and the performances are distinguished by a high level of troupe mastery. </p>

    <h2>  Monuments in Naberezhnye Chelny </h2><p>  It is already impossible to imagine the sights of Naberezhnye Chelny without monuments in honor of V. Vysotsky and Motherland.  The sculpture Motherland was opened for the thirtieth anniversary of the victory in the Second World War.  The creator of the monument used the myth of the Phoenix.  By his work, the author wanted to convey the feat of the Russian people. </p><p>  The monument in honor of V. Vysotsky looks like a fragment of a bell, guitar and strings above it.  It is worth noting that of all the monuments of this great personality in the Russian Federation, installed in Naberezhnye Chelny is the most ambitious and tallest (9 m).  It was opened in honor of the thirty years of visiting Vysotsky city.  The reason why this monument was erected on Gidrostroiteley Street is the Kama Hotel, which was located here earlier, where the artist lived during his two-week tour. </p><h2>  Museums and galleries of the city </h2><p>  Naberezhnye Chelny has its own unique history and culture, for a more detailed acquaintance with which it is worth visiting the museums and galleries of the city.  Perhaps, it is best to start with the Museum of History, the main exposition of which occupies two floors.  One of them presents an exhibition of radio equipment from the time of the USSR, the <span>history of KamAZ</span> and a corner of the Second World War.  And on the second - history, from ancient times to modern times.  Here you can see the reconstruction of historic buildings, the results of archaeological excavations, photographs, written documents, stuffed animals and much more. </p><p>  The art gallery is another noteworthy place that Naberezhnye Chelny can be proud of (which region is discussed above).  The art collection will pleasantly surprise you.  The art gallery was created in 1980 and today is a real repository of art values, works of decorative and applied, fine and folk art. </p><h2>  Naberezhnye Chelny Dolphinarium </h2><p>  Some people will find out in what area the city of Naberezhnye Chelny is located, just to visit the local dolphinarium.  It is a branch of Anapa and the only stationary dolphinarium in the Volga region.  The institution was opened in 2006 in the building of the Dolphin pool.  Today, the pool is filled with sea water, and the northern sea lion and 6 dolphins live in it.  Presentation at the same time can watch 350 people. </p><p>  It hosts a theatrical show featuring dolphins and a northern sea lion.  Children are invited to attend a performance with a special program during which they can not only see how sea animals do various tricks, but also learn a lot of interesting things about their life in the natural environment. </p>
