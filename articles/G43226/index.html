Each of them is unique in its own way, but not all can be called pristine.  There are few reservoirs where there have not yet been built camp sites or sanatoriums, therefore, probably, Lake Kalkan is so beloved by tourists who prefer life in a tent to any comfort, but with nature on you. </p><h2>  Lakes of Uchalinsky district </h2><p>  The Uchalinsky district of Bashkortostan can ‚Äúboast‚Äù five lakes, each of which is distinctive and has its own legend of origin.  For example, on <span>Aushkul Lake</span> there is an island in the form of a heart, which attracts lovers from different parts of the country. </p><p>  White and yellow water lilies, rare for Bashkiria, grow in the waters of Vorozheich, which indicates its purity.  According to local legend, these are mermaids who can‚Äôt tolerate sunlight, so every morning they turn into beautiful flowers. </p><p>  Lake Kalkan has an elongated shape with a peninsula that, from a bird's eye view, looks like a giant's hand holding a shield.  And how did the ancient Bashkirs understand this, since they gave the pond such a name? </p>

    <p>  On <span>Lake Urgun</span> there is a floating peat island, which is surprising in itself, and it is also the largest body of water in the Northern Trans-Urals. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>Uzunkul Lake</span> has waters of a rare turquoise color, and since tourists rarely get to it, rest on it can be considered truly wild. </p><p>  Each pond of the region is beautiful, but not everyone mined gold and gems, which Lake Kalkan (Bashkiria) is so rich in. </p><h2>  Description of Lake Kalkan </h2><p>  In Bashkir, ‚Äúkalkan‚Äù means ‚Äúshield‚Äù, and this is exactly how the expanse of a reservoir looks like, which exactly in the middle is cut by a narrow peninsula resembling a hand with a fist gripping it.  Lake Kalkan is famous for its clean but cold waters.  Numerous springs feed it, therefore, when they have been swimming in other reservoirs for a long time, warming up of the water surface here begins. </p><p>  The lake is small, elongated only 2 km in length along the meridian and slightly less than a kilometer in width.  The peninsula is also small, only 05 km <sup>2</sup> , but all covered with forest.  In general, the first thing tourists notice here is the air, which is saturated with the aroma of pine resin. </p>

    <p>  The north-facing half of Lake Kalkan is somewhat swampy, but the south from west to east is surrounded by hills, which themselves are sights.  It is here that the famous quarries where jasper was mined are located. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Jasper of Lake Kalkan </h2><p>  The western shore of the reservoir abuts <span>Mount Kalkan-tau,</span> on which there are still rocky outcrops in which jasper can be found.  It was extremely unique, therefore its appearance is known in the world as ‚ÄúKalkan jasper‚Äù. </p><p>  It was surprising that the gem deposit was located practically on the surface of the earth, since the Ural jasper belt, which was intensively developed in the 18-19 centuries, passed here.  Thanks to this deposit, Lake Kalkan became known far beyond Bashkiria. </p><p>  It's all about its properties: they were extremely good.  The stones were characterized by uniformity, solidity, strength and toughness.  From them it was possible to make vases of any size, caskets, jewelry.  For example, the most famous vase from Kalkan jasper (2 meters high and 1 m in diameter) was exhibited in 1867 at the world exhibition in Paris.  Today it stands in the Hermitage (‚ÄúMalachite Hall‚Äù) and still impresses visitors with its size. </p>

    <p>  So, having arrived on Lake Kalkan (tourist reviews highly recommend this), you must definitely climb the mountain of the same name, firstly, to enjoy the surroundings, and secondly, to look for a piece of jasper for your memory. </p><h2>  Active life on the lake </h2><p>  There are no camp sites on this reservoir, but this in no way prevents the Bashkirs from conducting various events here.  One of them is the bard song festival, named after the lake.  Songwriters come here not only from all over Bashkiria, but also from neighboring republics.  In 2016, the 29th rally was held, which indicates a continuing interest in the event. </p><p>  In addition to bards, singing groups participate in it, and those who were unable for some reason to submit a timely application are allowed to participate in the ‚Äúfree microphone‚Äù competition.  For three days, music and laughter sound on the shore of the lake, participants exchange impressions and participate in a gala concert at the end of the festival. </p><p>  The local district <span>festival, Sabantuy,</span> held in early June, is dedicated to the achievements of local producers. </p><p>  To do this, an exhibition is organized on the shore, after which competitions begin (both national sports games and football familiar to everyone).  Since the Bashkirs love horses, they can‚Äôt do without horse-riding and horse riding, and the concert of local musical groups ends the holiday. </p>

    <p>  This is such an active life that Lake Kalkan offers its guests in the summer. </p><h2>  Recreation and fishing </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the waters of the lake are quite cold, fishing is excellent here.  The underwater inhabitants here are the same as in other reservoirs of Bashkiria, and although their reserves are quite enough for commercial fishing, it is not conducted here, which is extremely pleasing to the fishermen. </p><p>  To get an excellent result, it is better to carry or rent a boat and explore Lake Kalkan.  Fishing (reviews of experienced fishermen say that there are many lured places here) can bring a catch of crucians, perches, grass carp, roach, pike perch, carp, bream and silver carp. </p>

    <p>  Since the influx of tourists to the pond is growing from year to year, a special parking lot for cars and tents with barbecue facilities, bonfire places and gazebos was built here.  Behind the parking lot are garbage cans, which become the subject of attacks of eternally hungry gulls, making noise in the morning better than any alarm clock. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Horseback trips await active people not only in the surrounding area, but also tours to Bolshoi <span>Iremel, a mountain</span> located 26 km from the lake.  Deciduous and pine forests, a dilapidated steam mill, a picturesque peninsula, all this is part of hiking or horseback riding. </p><p>  Those who are traveling to these parts for the first time are interested in how to get to Lake Kalkan.  It is located 10 km from the city of Uchaly, so first you need to take a direction to this city, and then continue to the village of Kalkanovo, near which take to the right towards the village of Rysaevo.  Drive past does not work, as the road goes along the shore of the lake. </p>
