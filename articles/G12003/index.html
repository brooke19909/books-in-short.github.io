It is interesting to note that from November 2000 to January 2003, Pugachev took part in the board of the Russian Union of Entrepreneurs and Industrialists.  This article will focus on the biography of Sergei Pugachev, a member of the Russian Academy of Engineering, Doctor of Technical Sciences, Honored Worker of the Republic of Tuva. </p><h2>  The beginning of the way </h2><div class="photo" data-original="news.rambler.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pugachev Sergey" class="if uuid-3104755" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44050/3104755.jpg"></div><p>  Sergey Viktorovich was born on February 4, 1963 in the city of Kostroma "in a simple Russian family."  It is worth noting that in an autobiography Sergei Pugachev emphasized that he was born into the family of a military man.  There is practically no public official information regarding the early stages of his biography.  Information about the higher education that Pugachev received varies. </p><h2>  What have you achieved? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.dw.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="interview with Pugachev" class="if uuid-3104975" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44050/3104975.jpg"></div><p>  A former member of the Federation Council of the Russian Federation, whom the media often called the friend of the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, is the owner of Mezhprombank, a politician, an international investor, and, of course, a public figure.  The biography of Sergei Pugachev tells that the activist was a doctor of technical sciences, a member of the Russian Academy of Engineering, as well as the author of three monographs and forty articles of a scientific plan. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Childhood and youth </h2><p>  Having considered the main achievements of Sergey Pugachev, it is advisable to learn about the childhood and youth of the famous Russian banker and businessman.  The future entrepreneur was born and spent his childhood in a family of hereditary military.  It is interesting to know that one Pugachev‚Äôs grandfather was an officer of the imperial army, and the second was the commander of the Red Army.  The father of little Sergei also chose a profession in the military sphere.  He served in the Airborne Forces, and also commanded an assault brigade. </p><h2>  Education </h2><p>  As it turned out, the information about the education received by Pugachev is different.  In accordance with some data, he is a graduate of the Leningrad state.  University.  Other sources of the media clearly describe that the entrepreneur graduated from a Moscow higher education institution. </p><h2>  Beginning of an entrepreneurial career </h2><p>  Sergei Pugachev in early 1990, at his own request, carried out labor activities in one of the branches of the USSR Stroybank.  It is worth noting that some media reject this information.  Around the same time, Pugachev made useful contacts in the future with Vladimir Putin (at that time he worked at the St. Petersburg City Hall) and Igor Sechin, who headed the apparatus of V.V. Putin. </p><h2>  Pugachev and Putin </h2><div class="photo" data-original="24smi.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pugachev and Putin" class="if uuid-3104970" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44050/3104970.jpg"></div><h2>  Pugachev and Putin </h2><p>  A year after meeting, in 1991, Pugachev began to develop his own business, known as the Northern Trade Bank.  So he became perhaps the first banking institution of a commercial type, opened in the Russian Federation.  At the same time, the entrepreneur worked at Mezhprombank.  He was chairman of the board of directors.  According to the media, it was in this banking structure that the personal money of Naina Yeltsin and Tatyana Dyachenko, the wife and daughter of B. Yeltsin, were stored. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A few more years passed.  Mezhprombank became the main authorized banking institution that was entrusted with managing the financial affairs of the President of the Russian Federation. </p><h2>  Personal life </h2><div class="photo" data-original="luk.com.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sergey Pugachev businessman husband prick" class="if uuid-3104764" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44050/3104764.jpg"></div><p>  Galina, the first wife of Sergei Pugachev, gave the businessman two sons - Alexander and Victor.  Guys were born in 1985 and 1983 respectively.  Growing up, Alexander took over as CEO of a French publication called France-Soir and the Swiss brand Peridot SA. </p><h2>  Alexandra Tolstaya </h2><p>  Alexandra Tolstaya is the next common-law wife of Sergei Pugachev.  In 2009, information began to circulate in the media regarding the entrepreneur‚Äôs new novel.  Accordingly, this time Tolstaya, a British citizen, liked the man.  Nevertheless, the couple never played a wedding due to the fact that Pugachev did not officially divorce his first wife.  He remained her legal husband. </p><p>  It is known that today Pugachev has four grandchildren. </p><h2>  Trial </h2><div class="photo" data-original="24smi.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wife Sergey Pugachev" class="if uuid-3104766" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44050/3104766.jpg"></div><p>  In 2017, Pugachev‚Äôs photos hit the pages of news-type publications.  The fact is that the situation with the banking institution Mezhprombank, known to many, has received some development.  On October 11, the London judicial authorities announced the decision that had been made the day before.  In accordance with the read documents, the entrepreneur was recognized as the beneficiary of New Zealand trusts.  In other words, the funds of Mezhprombank, which were withdrawn from the country and declared as trusts in the name of Pugachev, were recovered from his personal funds. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Then experts emphasized that this decision could be appealed by the entrepreneur.  In addition, New Zealand trusts, whose life was in doubt, could be challenged solely with the involvement of representatives of the New Zealand court.  Nevertheless, the Supreme Court confirmed the recovery from the businessman of an amount of 75.6 billion rubles.  It follows from the published determination of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation that the judicial authorities rejected the cassation appeal of the entrepreneur, who requested that the case be referred to the Judicial Collegium for Disputes of the Economic Plan for further proceedings. </p><h2>  Sergey Pugachev is the husband of Anna Ukolova.  A photo </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.kakprosto.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="biography of Sergey Pugachev" class="if uuid-3104762" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44050/3104762.jpg"></div><p>  Banker Pugachev has a namesake.  It's about the husband of the famous actress Anna Ukolova.  Their marriage can be called truly strong.  It is worth noting that Anna is a fairly strong person.  She was born under a happy star - this is how her image of the media is presented.  After graduating from school, the girl decided to leave the small village of urban type to conquer the capital.  She managed it the first time.  Anna immediately became a student at GITIS, received a scholarship, and studied excellently. </p><h2>  Actress Ukolova Anna </h2><div class="photo" data-original="24smi.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sergey Pugachev husband prick photo" class="if uuid-3104768" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44050/3104768.jpg"></div><p>  Businessman Sergei Pugachev, husband of Ukolova, was infinitely lucky.  The fact is that in his wife's piggy bank there are no stories about spending the night at the station, lack of money or the existence of evil people who met on her way.  Ukolova‚Äôs life is optimistic and charges surrounding people with it.  She enjoys every day.  Most likely, it was for this reason that she was so fond of the viewer.  It is worth noting that the actress has regularly played roles for over ten years. </p><h2>  Happy marriage </h2><p>  In the photo above - Sergey Pugachev and Anna Ukolova.  Husband and wife look happy and in love.  Watching how Anna‚Äôs career is developing successfully, many are interested in the question of whether her personal life is so successful.  The good news: Anna has been married for almost 16 years.  She and her husband raise a wonderful son.  Ukolova‚Äôs husband, businessman Sergei Pugachev, is confident that the woman loves him.  The fact is that she never set herself the goal of finding a wealthy husband and getting married as soon as possible.  Anna has always been independent and independent.  Naturally, she was sure that she would not remain in the old maids and marry, give birth to a child and meet old age with her family. </p><h2>  Meeting Ukolova with her husband Sergei Pugachev.  Photo of a couple </h2><p>  In her 24 years, the girl received the first quite serious role.  It was a series called The Law.  The girl wished to celebrate such a significant occasion with her friends in the capital's club.  During the celebration, a man joined the company, who soon began to actively look after the girl.  Anna did not attach particular importance to this fact, however, in parting, she left her phone number.  She was pleasantly surprised when a young man from a nightclub called her with an offer to meet. </p><h2>  Date took place </h2><p>  For a long time, Ukolova did not agree, but in the end she made a concession.  At the meeting, she only wanted to thank the young man for beautifully caring for her throughout the evening.  They agreed to meet at the metro station.  Of course, at the appointed time, Anna came to the metro station.  Everything would be standard, but the girl forgot what Sergey looks like: the club was too dark.  So, she could not make out his face.  Anna stood and gazed steadily into the faces of the guys passing by.  Realizing the futility of the lesson, the girl sat down on a bench.  A few minutes later, a pretty enough man joined her.  He asked who she was waiting for, and then introduced himself as Denis.  The girl replied that she was not expecting him at all, but a young man named Sergei. </p><h2>  The joke was a success! </h2><p>  As it turned out, the young man was joking, because he was exactly what Anna was expecting.  The girl and her future husband at first just talked, and a week later Ukolova realized that a feeling woke up between them.  The fact that she wants to spend her whole life with him became clear after a certain act of the guy.  Ukolova often recalls this episode from her own life. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  When the Christmas holidays were approaching, and the graduates did not have the money to celebrate, Anna suggested boiling potatoes and chopping pickles.  On the appointed day, a young man looked into her house with a chocolate cake, wine and a bouquet of beautiful roses.  Later it turned out: in order to buy all this, he had to ‚Äútax‚Äù the whole night.  It was then that the girl realized that with such a young man she would not be lost. </p><h2>  Life together </h2><p>  Some time has passed.  Sergey and Anna began to live together.  Despite the fact that she was 3 years older, this difference was never felt.  Quite the contrary.  The girl was amazed at Pugachev's judiciousness and wisdom.  Gradually, their life together entered a happy course.  Anna began to often receive offers from directors and participate in various projects, and Pugachev‚Äôs business gradually went uphill. </p><p>  Despite the wealth in the family, the couple never aspired to all sorts of excesses.  Even today, they live in a standard two-room apartment, and go to domestic resorts to relax.  As you can see in the photo above, Anna Ukolova and her husband Sergei Pugachev look like a very happy couple.  The woman notes that their views on life are similar in almost everything.  However, if the points of view diverge in some way, then they will certainly discuss this, thanks to which they find a solution that suits both sides. </p><p>  Sergei under no circumstances interferes in the work of his wife.  He is quite far from the world of art.  That is why it is not taken to give advice in which film or production to take part in it.  Decisions are made exclusively by Anna.  In addition, at first the couple agreed that they would not rush to have a baby.  Sergey and Anna decided that they would travel a lot, get to know each other as best as possible and organize their life. </p><p>  As soon as the husband and wife came to the conclusion that they were completely ready for replenishment in the family, Anna gave birth to a son.  They called the child an original and rare name Makar.  It is worth noting that the birth of a child only strengthened relations between spouses.  They became more reverent and attentive to each other.  Makar never restricted their activities and freedom.  Today Sergey and Anna also enjoy life and travel a lot.  However, this is already being done by the three of us. </p><p>  The representatives of one Russian publication, the famous actress once said that her life was exactly what she wanted.  And it was not about dreams, but about clear desires.  She planned to become an actress, to meet her husband, who would adore and love only her.  Anna wanted to give birth to a wonderful son.  She has the listed items for today.  Anna thanks fate for this. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, the article examined the biography of the famous banker Sergei Pugachev: his business, personal life, and also mentioned his wives: legal and civil.  Several photos of the businessman and a picture of his child were also presented.  In addition, the article was about the namesake of the banker - the husband of the famous Russian actress Anna Ukolova. </p>
