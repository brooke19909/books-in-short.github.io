Of course, I would like to live among futuristic skyscrapers, chic man-made islands for at least a week, walk around shopping malls, see various high-tech buildings and other attractions, as well as sunbathe and swim.  But Dubai is an expensive city.  What can he offer a budget traveler? </p><p>  It turns out that in this metropolis all categories of tourists can feel great.  There are not so many hotels with a room worth several thousand dollars a day.  A little away from the first strip of beaches are cheaper hotels - three and four stars.  In this article we will talk about one of them.  Meet the Dubai Comfort Inn.  Photos, description of rooms and infrastructure, as well as recent reviews of tourists can be found below. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="25.2653495" data-lng="55.316831800000045" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/0/8/8/0/10880.png"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  It would be naive to hope that the three-star hotel is on the first line.  Why do tourists in the reviews call the Comfort Inn Hotel Deira 3 * location especially successful? </p><p>  Consider the location in more detail.  As the name implies, the Comfort Inn Hotel (Dubai) is located in Deira.  And to be more precise, in its very center, on Al Rigga Road.  This hotel is located between three metro stations of different branches.  These are Salah Al Din, Union Square and Al Rigga.  Union Square Station is just a five-minute walk away.  The subway in Dubai is comfortable, trains run often.  So you can get to anywhere in the city quickly and easily. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Deira is a safe commercial area.  There are several shopping centers right next to the Comfort Inn.  You can choose Al Ghurair Center (300 meters) or opt for the Twin Towers (800 meters).  And just around the corner is the Nike brand store. </p><p>  From Dubai International Airport, the hotel can be reached by taxi in five minutes.  After all, the air harbor is only four kilometers away. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.makemytrip.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dubai, Comfort Inn Hotel" class="if uuid-2929781" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2929781.jpg"></div><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  The Comfort Inn in Dubai is a typical city hotel.  But he is not pinched by other houses on both sides.  So the hotel has its own, albeit insignificant, territory.  She is busy with parking, which is free for customers.  The nine-story building of the hotel was built in 1997 in a futuristic style.  From afar, ocher facades and blue glass of mirrored windows attract attention.  Naturally, the building has an elevator.  And those who are not too lazy to get to the very top will have a surprise - a pool with a rooftop jacuzzi.  The view from there is breathtaking. </p><p>  Tourists note that there is no high-tech style inside the building.  The interiors of the corridors are more likely to copy the decoration of rooms of the 19th century.  There you can see paintings and antique furniture.  According to reviews, the exterior of the hotel "pulls" on a solid four. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.expedia.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="UAE, Dubai, Comfort Inn Hotel" class="if uuid-2929796" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2929796.jpg"></div><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  The Comfort Inn Hotel (Dubai) has over one hundred guest rooms.  Basically, these are standard rooms - single, double and triple.  For large families there is a connection rooms - rooms with an adjacent door.  Standards differ from each other only in size and number of beds.  By the way, if you come alone, you can choose a room with a wide bed.  But there is another category of rooms - a suite.  Their filling is much better.  There is a bathtub and bidet, a set of branded cosmetic accessories, slippers and an electric kettle.  The plasma TVs in these rooms have a wide screen. </p><div class="photo" data-original="planetofhotels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Comfort Inn Hotel, Dubai, United Arab Emirates, reviews" class="if uuid-2929831" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2929831.jpg"></div><p>  Suites are located on the upper floors of the building, which provides a beautiful view from the window.  But tourists say that the standard rooms are quite good.  They include a minibar, noiseless air conditioning, and a flat-screen TV.  The rooms themselves are small, but very bright and comfortable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  All rooms open with electronic keys.  Wi-Fi works efficiently, ‚Äúpulls‚Äù in all rooms, regardless of the distance from the reception.  Tourists recommend that when checking in, ask the employees for an adapter, since the sockets in the UAE are not European. </p><div class="photo" data-original="planetofhotels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Comfort Inn Hotel, Dubai, photo of rooms" class="if uuid-2929806" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2929806.jpg"></div><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The Comfort Inn Hotel (Dubai) does not include meals.  But if you book a hotel through a travel agency, you can pay for breakfast or half board before arrival.  Tourists complain that only lunch is offered as a second meal.  This is not very convenient, especially for those who like a sightseeing vacation. </p><p>  If you have booked a hotel without meals, you can buy meals on site.  Breakfast costs 535 rubles, and lunch and dinner will cost more.  Moreover, during the evening meal in the hotel restaurant the waiter serves you an √† la carte menu.  But tourists claim that staying at a hotel will still be cheaper than anywhere else in the city.  The food at the hotel is delicious. </p><p>  Comfort Inn traditionally hosts tour groups from Russia.  It happens that a hotel is one hundred percent filled with vacationers from the Russian Federation.  To please them, the hotel administration hired a cook from Belarus, who prepares Slavic dishes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="planetofhotels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews for meals at the Comfort Inn" class="if uuid-2929836" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2929836.jpg"></div><h2>  Comfort Inn Hotel (Dubai, United Arab Emirates): food reviews </h2><p>  Tourists praise the hotel meals.  Breakfasts, however, are slightly monotonous, in a week you will have time to try everything.  To tourists from Russia were satisfied, in the morning they serve potatoes with meat or mushrooms, pasta, cereals.  So after such a breakfast you can stay full until the evening. </p><p>  Lunches are also served in buffet style.  These meals are more varied.  There are always two types of soup, many meat dishes, sweets, vegetables and fruits. </p><p>  In addition to the main restaurant, Alan, which feeds tourists who have paid for meals, the Comfort Inn 3 * Hotel (Dubai) has another - Lounge Cafe.  It is located on the ground floor.  There, according to reviews, the food is especially tasty.  And if you want a light snack, you can do it in the cafe on the roof, by the pool, or on the ground floor.  The lounge bar is open 24 hours a day. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The sun and the sea - that is why most tourists from Russia go to Dubai (UAE).  Hotel Comfort Inn is located far from the coast.  But for just five dirhams (90 rubles), round-trip you can get to the Al-Mamzar beach by hotel bus.  Flights are made several times in the morning (the same number back in the evening).  In order to catch the bus, you need to contact the reception desk and book a ride at the time you need. </p><p>  "Al Mamzar" - the beach is paid.  According to recent reviews, on Mondays and Wednesdays there is Women's Day, that is, men are not allowed (except for small boys).  Tourists recommend a free beach.  It is located 300 meters to the left of Al-Mamzar.  It is no worse there, there is a shadow from palm trees, just the coast is a bit narrower. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The beach where guests go" class="if uuid-2929876" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2929876.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotel amenities </h2><p>  According to reviews about the Comfort Inn Hotel (Dubai), you can refresh yourself and sunbathe without going to the beach.  On the roof of the hotel there is a swimming pool with an attached hot tub.  Both tanks are very clean, with clear and cool water (in the summer it heats up, like in a bath).  But, tourists complain, the pool is not suitable for swimming, due to its small size. </p><p>  Of the services mentioned in the reviews, laundry service, shoe shine.  In the hotel you can exchange money.  But tourists claim that the exchange rate is better in the office near the metro station. </p><p>  As proudly listed on the hotel's website, its employees speak six languages.  And one of them is Russian.  So even those who do not know English as part of the school curriculum should have no problems with settling. </p><p>  The hotel has a business center and conference room.  Reception is open 24 hours a day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hotelcomfortinn.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Comfort Inn Hotel, Dubai, recent reviews" class="if uuid-2929861" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2929861.jpg"></div><h2>  Comfort Inn Hotel Dubai </h2><p>  Travelers recently vacationing in the UAE claim that they now charge a tourist tax when checking in.  So be prepared to part with an extra 10 dirhams (179 rubles) per night in a hotel.  They clean the rooms to "excellent", regardless of whether you leave a tip or not.  The staff here are very friendly, helpful. </p><p>  Tourists leave a lot of praise for the work of Wi-Fi.  This is where advanced technology shows itself!  You can freely communicate with relatives and friends on Skype.  The hotel has a travel agency where you can book interesting excursions.  And next to the hotel there are a large number of cheap shops with souvenirs, date paste and other trifles.  On Mondays, a free shuttle service to one of Dubai's outlets is launched from the hotel.  And to the "Golden Market" can be reached on foot in 20 minutes. </p>
