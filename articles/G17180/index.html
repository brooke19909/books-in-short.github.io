It is located in two districts - Ivanovo and Perovo.  Part of this square is a monument and a magnificent example of landscape art of the eighteenth century.

    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Initially, this territory belonged to the Terletsky family of merchants.  The last representative of this kind transferred his lands to the public together with the Novogireevo settlement built by him.  Regular visitors to the park know that there are five ponds near the Serebryanka river - Terletsky pond Vostochny, Utiny, Zapadny, as well as Olkhovy and Kupalny.  On the old maps, only three of them are visible - Duck, East and West.  That was until the seventies of the twentieth century. </p><p>  Lower ponds located in the area of ​​the Black Stream appeared only in the second half of the last century.  At this time, by the decision of the Moscow authorities, <span>Terletsky Park</span> was separated from Izmaylovsky, and there they began to create a recreation area. </p><h2>  The formation of environmental balance </h2><p>  The last owner of the estate, A. I. Terletsky, was seriously engaged in hydrogeology issues.  When planning the town of Novogireevo, he thought not only about the convenience of the inhabitants of the village, but also about the ecology of the environment.  He dreamed that his ponds would be no worse than German ones. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Terletsky ponds how to get" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/452238.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Noticing the tendency of the ponds to swamp, Alexander Ivanovich began to form the ecological balance of the park.  At the beginning of the twentieth century, the property of cattail (many call it reeds, although this is not true) was observed to purify water.  Terletsky in Kuzminki dug out a cattail, where there were a lot of him, and planted him in ponds.  In addition, a network of canals designed for the treatment of rainwater was laid in the park.  The remains of this system can still be seen in the eastern part of the park. </p><p>  Thanks to the measures taken, by 1910 the water in the ponds was significantly cleared. </p><h2>  Description of the ponds </h2><p>  East Terletsky Pond is the largest of all park ponds.  It is well landscaped.  On the shores are organized several playgrounds, an excellent <span>football field, a</span> rescue station and a tennis court. </p><p>  The Western or “duck” Terletsky pond is the smallest in size, but very beautiful. </p><p>  Southeast and Southwest Terletsky pond is preferred by lovers of a relaxing coastal holiday.  Here you can lie down with a book on the beach, sunbathe and just chat with friends. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="restaurant terletsky ponds" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/452237.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Until 2007, the Northern Terletsky Pond was completely devastated.  Only after <span>restoration work is</span> it again flooded with water.  Each of the described reservoirs of the cascade, with the exception of the West, has small islands.  Despite the fact that visually the water in them is very clean, officially swimming in them is prohibited.  However, Muscovites and guests of the capital enjoy spending time here on hot summer days. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition, those who are interested in fishing gather here.  Terletsky ponds are not very suitable for professional fishing, but her lovers are happy to sit on the shore with a fishing rod.  And, I must say, they catch medium-sized crucian carp, small melting pot and rarely minnows. </p><p>  Those wishing to taste Caucasian, Russian and European cuisine can visit the restaurant on the territory of the forest park.  Terletsky Ponds - this is a great place for weddings, family celebrations, banquets.  The staff of the restaurant “Night Yard” located here will be happy to help you with this.
