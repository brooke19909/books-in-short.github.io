    <h2>  Manufacturer </h2><p>  Before buying a smartphone, buyers usually look at two indicators: price and quality.  These criteria, as a rule, are combined in a single indicator - the manufacturer.  Yes, it is precisely focusing on the company to which this or that gadget belongs that many correlate the cost of the product offered to it and its technical characteristics. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As mentioned above, there are a substantial number of smartphone manufacturers.  These are Russian, and Chinese, and Korean, and American, and even British companies.  Most, of course, trust Korea and the United States of America, which are represented by the two largest companies at the moment - Samsung and Apple, respectively.  The products of these giants in the field of mobile devices are most popular around the world.  Their quality is undeniable, but for most Russians to buy a more or less decent smartphone of these brands is a serious waste of money.  And as you know, many of them are not as many as we would like. </p><h2>  Chinese smartphones </h2><p>  Now the Russian market gravitates to <span>Chinese companies.</span>  They offer phones much cheaper, and many believe that this has a very negative effect on quality.  This is partly true, but this can not be said about all Chinese manufacturers.  For example, not so long ago, smartphones from the ARK company appeared in Russian stores and salons (English - ARK).  The company entered our market in 2013.  One can safely say that anyone can afford to buy an Ark phone.  Customer reviews allow us to safely say that this Chinese manufacturer differs from its competitors for the better both in price and quality.  Let's get acquainted with the products of this company closer.  What is an Ark phone?  Reviews, price, features, availability - everything will be considered by us further. </p><h2>  Brand Features </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" class="if" height="171" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12967/1149122.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  The ARK company is engaged in the production of not only smartphones, but also other gadgets, as well as accessories for them.  However, the most popular products are still phones.  The line of smartphones from "ARC" is a few devices that differ from each other in appearance, technical characteristics and price.  The most popular representatives of the ARC company are the Ark Benefit 12, Ark Benefit M5, and Ark Benefit M7 smartphones. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Reviews of the overwhelming number of device owners come down to the fact that these are excellent options for the ratio of price and quality, in which the quality clearly exceeds the price.  The last parameter, by the way, is very, very attractive: from 2 to 10 thousand rubles, depending on the model being purchased and the capabilities that it has.  You can buy such a smartphone in almost any digital equipment store or mobile phone shop. </p><h2>  Phone "Benefit M5 Arc": customer reviews and specifications </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="telephone ark benefit m5 reviews" class="if" height="323" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12967/1149117.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  The first model we will look at will be this particular phone.  We will not describe for a long time, let us get down to business immediately. </p><p>  The smartphone has an operating system Android 4.4, two slots for SIM cards and a 5-inch display like IPS.  There is a camera of 8 megapixels, a front camera is also available - there are already 1.3 megapixels.  The memory of the phone itself is 4 GB, but there is a slot for SD-cards, and RAM is 512 MB.  The battery has a capacity of 2000 mA / h, which will be enough for 7 hours of conversation or 4-5 hours of active work with the device when using the 3G Internet (unfortunately, there is no 4G support). </p><p>  Looking at these parameters, you might think that the phone will cost about 10-12 thousand rubles, since the characteristics are very decent.  But it was not there.  Its price is in the region from 5 to 6 thousand rubles, depending on the place of sale.  Of course, these parameters are worth it to buy the phone "Benefit M5 Arc."  Reviews about this device confirm these words: most users were satisfied and are not going to change the device.  Unless on a newer model from the "ARC". </p><h2>  Phone "Benefit 12": customer reviews and specifications </h2>

    <p>  Let's start with a warning: in the store, when you ask about whether there is a phone of such a model on sale, you may be told <span>that such a smartphone</span> does not exist.  The fact is that often in his name is written not "12", but "I2".  Keep this in mind. </p><p>  Now let's talk about the Ark phone itself.  Customer reviews give us confidence that the device is definitely worth buying.  Many say that it looks much more expensive than its price, which varies from 4.5 to 6 thousand rubles. </p><p>  And now about the characteristics.  The operating system is Android 4.4, two SIM cards and a 4.7-inch IPS display (for comparison, the resolution is the same as that of the Samsung Galaxy SIII).  The rear camera is 13 megapixels, the front camera is 5 megapixels.  Internal memory - 8 GB, RAM - 1 GB.  The battery has a capacity of 2000 mA / h, which is enough for the Internet and games for 3-4 hours.  The set is more than impressive, and it's just for the price.  Reviews about the phone "Benefit 12" not in vain give him such a high rating: there is, for what to buy. </p><h2>  "Arc Benefit M7" </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="telephone ark benefit m7 reviews" class="if" height="452" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12967/1149125.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  And, finally, the last device from the Benefit line from ARK that we will study is the Arc Benefit M7 phone. We will also review reviews about it. After all, this is the main indicator of quality. </p><p>  First, let's talk about the opinions of the happy owners of the device, because everyone will buy only that Ark phone, reviews of which will leave him a good impression.  Summarizing all the feedback from customers, perhaps one thing can be said: none of the owners of ‚ÄúBenefit M7 Arc‚Äù has ever seen a phone better.  The price is from 6 to 7 thousand rubles, the quality corresponds to the price of all 200%.  Why is he so loved? </p><p>  It's simple: the latest Android 5.1, a diagonal of 5.5 inches, support for 4G LTE, a battery of 2400 mA / h.  What else is needed for happiness, if such a modern, large smartphone can ‚Äúfly‚Äù on high-speed Internet, while discharging for a rather long and painful time?  In addition, the phone is equipped with a rear and <span>front cameras</span> of 8 and 2 megapixels, respectively, as well as built-in memory of 8 GB and 1 GB of RAM.  Perhaps this is the best solution that can be purchased for the money. </p><h2>  What else to expect from Ark? </h2>

    <p>  The Chinese company does not stand still, and obviously is not going to stop there.  Not so long ago, a new line of models appeared on the windows of salons and shops - Ark Impulse.  Phones cost an order of magnitude more expensive (of course, on the scale of other Ark representatives) - from 8 to 10 thousand rubles.  A completely new design, wide and colorful displays, 4G LTE and an impressive amount of memory - all this awaits you if you purchase a new Ark phone.  The responses of the first customers are mostly positive, and there is no doubt that they will be as popular as the models we reviewed. </p>
