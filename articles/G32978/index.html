    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Many tourists stay at he Three Corners Royal Star Beach Resort (Hurghada).  Reviews, in addition to positive impressions, also contain some comments: </p><ul><li>  reception staff may knowingly put you in a bad room to require a large surcharge for relocation; </li><li>  air conditioners are very old and practically do not cool the air in the room; </li><li>  very boring and sluggish animation (we can say that it is practically not in the hotel); </li><li>  even despite the presence of a safe with a combination lock, money and valuables constantly disappear from the rooms (therefore it is better to carry everything with you); </li><li>  the hotel area is very small, and therefore there is practically no place for walking; </li><li>  Despite the fact that the beach near the hotel is private, there are always many boats of local fishermen on it, and therefore swimming is very inconvenient; </li><li>  room cleaning is mediocre enough, but if you leave a tip, the situation can be significantly improved; </li><li>  the alcohol in the hotel is just disgusting (the only thing you can drink is local wine). </li></ul><p>  Hotel Three Corners Royal Star Beach Resort 4 * makes a pretty good impression.  Despite minor flaws, it provides guests with a sufficiently high-quality service and provides a high level of comfort.  It is important that the sea is located very close, and there is also a well-kept and clean pool.  The hotel also takes care of the nutrition of its guests.  All dishes are not only healthy and nutritious, but also very original and tasty. </p>
