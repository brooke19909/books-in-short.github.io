The island of Puerto Rico has long been popular with travelers who are attracted by snow-white beaches, pristine nature and more.  For several centuries, several cultures have been mixed here (African, Native American, Spanish, American), which gives the state a special flavor. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The secret of Puerto Rico's unique atmosphere lies in its history.  Initially, the island, which was discovered by H. Columbus, was owned by the Spaniards.  It is believed that they are to blame for the death of all Aboriginal people.  The colonialists brought to earth a huge number of diseases from which the Indians died.  Europeans used the island of Puerto Rico as a fortification and trading port. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.visittheusa.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Island that has not become 51 US states" class="if uuid-3087949" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3087949.jpg"></div><p>  At the beginning of the 19th century, when political and socio-economic problems in the world escalated, Europeans rushed here, fleeing difficulties.  In 1898, after the Spanish-American War, the land became owned by the United States.  And hundreds of thousands of Americans rushed to where the island of Puerto Rico is located to relax on local beaches. </p><h2>  Special State </h2><p>  Now this territory, which is limited by the US constitution, is under the control of the United States of America, and the highest official (governor) is elected by local residents.  Although Puerto Ricans have American citizenship, they cannot cast their ballots in the presidential election.  The state has its own system of self-government and the status of "unincorporated organized territory."  The Americans made the island of Puerto Rico a link between South and North America. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  States granted Puerto Rico autonomous status, but political party representatives have been fighting for long-awaited independence for decades.  True, an increasing number of islanders insist on joining the United States as 51 states. </p><p>  The country, located in the heart of the Caribbean, is divided into 78 municipalities, which are divided into regions, and those in turn are divided into sectors.  The first municipality was formed in 1521.  This is San Juan - the capital of the island. </p><h2>  Island on a world map </h2><p>  Tropical paradise, exuding amazing aromas of exotic flowers and admirable for "emerald" greens, is appreciated for cosmopolitanism and openness.  On the one hand, tourists feel like they came to the United States, on the other hand, they find themselves in the colorful Latin America.  Travelers planning to spend their holidays in an amazing place wonder where Puerto Rico is located.  According to tourists, it is not difficult to find on a world map. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="18.220833" data-lng="-66.590149" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="5"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/4/5/7/7/14577.png"></div><p>  The state of Central America, which is part of the Antilles archipelago, is located in the Caribbean Sea and consists of the main island of the same name and many small islands (Vieques, Desecheo, Mona, Culebra, etc.). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the west, its borders are adjacent to the Dominican Republic, and in the east - to the Virgin Islands.  Puerto Rico is a large state, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich is more than 9 thousand km <sup>2</sup> , and overcrowding is considered its main problem.  Recently, however, local residents abandon their homes and leave for the United States in search of a better life. </p><h2>  Puerto Rico in the Canary Islands </h2><p>  Tourists who dream of a memorable vacation in a paradise should be very careful.  The fact is that in the south of Gran Canaria, one of the largest islands of the Canary Archipelago, there is a tiny resort Puerto Rico, famous for the beach of the same name.  Very often, travelers confuse a small town in the Canary Islands with Puerto Rico, an island nation in the Caribbean. </p><h2>  Capital tropical paradise </h2><p>  The administrative center of Puerto Rico is the eponymous city founded by Europeans.  Located in the north of the state, it is one of the most ancient settlements of our planet.  The capital is perfectly preserved thanks to the efforts of the authorities, who achieved a ban on the construction of new structures. </p><p>  A major tourist center, the natural harbor of the Caribbean Sea, combines the past and the present. </p><h2>  UNESCO protected old town </h2><p>  The capital of the island with numerous shopping centers and cozy restaurants carefully preserves the real treasure - the historical center, whose cobbled streets are covered with blue cobblestones brought by the Spaniards.  Old San Juan resembles an open-air museum.  Its priceless exhibits are buildings with ancient architecture.  So, in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãPlaza del Sinto Centenario, you can admire the amazing examples of the colonial style, as if vacationers are transferred to past eras. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripsavvy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Old city" class="if uuid-3087917" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3087917.jpg"></div><p>  Here is one of the main attractions of the city - the powerful ramparts of La Muralia, left over from colonial times.  Once they protected the inhabitants from enemy attacks, but now they only remind of past greatness. </p><p>  Fort San Felipe del Morro, named after the King of Spain, is perfectly preserved in its original form.  Built in the 16th century, it is of historical and national value.  A six-tier citadel approximately 42 meters high is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. </p><p>  The old city is a starting point for many travelers, because it is from here that fascinating excursions begin.  Each building of the historical center has its own architectural features that attract tourists from all over the world.  Cute multi-colored houses and paving stones with a blue tint remind of the Spanish colonial era. </p><h2>  The famous beach "Flamenco" </h2><p>  The coastline of the island is replete with a variety of beaches, on which you can be completely alone, go surfing or snorkeling.  One of the most interesting excursions is a ferry ride to the island of Culebra, located 27 km from Puerto Rico.  The small coral island has gained fame thanks to its beaches, which are long stripes of white sand.  The most famous is Flamenco Beach, surrounded by emerald hills. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thebookingguru.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Flamenco - a beach on the island of Culebra" class="if uuid-3087919" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3087919.jpg"></div><p>  The legendary Flamenco beach on the island of Culebra (Puerto Rico) is considered one of the most beautiful in the world.  And many vacationers cannot even believe their eyes when they see it!  White soft sand, crystal clear water that changes color, coral reefs, tropical vegetation - all this makes an indelible impression. </p><h2>  Miraculous monuments </h2><p>  Amazing natural beauty beckons all ecotourism lovers.  El Yunque Rainforest is a biosphere reserve that delights in the diversity of flora and fauna represented here.  Beautiful waterfalls, mangroves, hundreds of species of ferns, lost trails delight vacationers, enchanted by the wondrous corner of natural origin. </p><div class="photo" data-original="uncover.travel" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Island Karst Caves" class="if uuid-3087921" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3087921.jpg"></div><p>  Also of great interest to tourists is the Camuy Caves cave system, which is one of the largest in the world.  It consists of 228 karst caves, although cavers claim that their number reaches 800. </p><p>  A large underground river flows nearby, and adoring tourists will be able to make rafting on it. </p><h2>  Glowing Bays </h2><p>  The unique natural attractions of Puerto Rico, whose photo invariably excites the imagination of Russian tourists, are three bays: La Parghera, Mosquito and Laguna Grande.  The best time to visit bioluminescent bays is the dark time of the day, when the water seems to light up with a pleasant bluish-green light, a sensation of something unreal appears.  This is due to the large concentration of luminous algae in the water. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sarahfunky.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Glowing beach" class="if uuid-3087933" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3087933.jpg"></div><p>  Romantics and couples in love come here to enjoy the unearthly beauty of the "neon" lights. </p><h2>  Where else to go? </h2><p>  Mona Island, located about 60 km from Puerto Rico, is a godsend for those who are tired of the bustle of the big city.  Tourists even called it "Jurassic Park" because thousands of bats live here and huge iguanas roam. </p><p>  It is believed that the island has the cleanest waters in the region, and their visibility reaches more than 50 m. Mona, surrounded by coral reefs and mysterious grottoes, has a unique ecosystem. </p><h2>  Rampant elements </h2><p>  Last fall, hurricane Maria hit the island, causing severe flooding and plunging Puerto Rico into the dark for a long time.  The historic center of the capital was greatly damaged, the streets of which were littered with stone fragments and fallen power lines. </p><p>  The restoration of the state is proceeding at a very slow pace, since the authorities that declared bankruptcy have no funds.  Its infrastructure is in very poor condition, and the United States does not consider the rescue of the controlled territory a priority. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cbsnews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rampant elements" class="if uuid-3087941" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3087941.jpg"></div><p>  A fairytale corner, affected by the elements, as never before needs tourists in order to recover faster, because tourism is the most important area of ‚Äã‚Äãactivity that brings revenue to the state.  Helping people is very easy, for example, to bring medical supplies or food.  And it is no coincidence that now many volunteers combining leisure and voluntary help rush to where the island of Puerto Rico is located. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Travelers admit that they are delighted with thoughtful service and excellent service.  It offers luxurious beaches, nightclubs, shopping and entertainment centers, water parks. </p><p>  Newlyweds, lovers of extreme sports, couples with small children come here.  Holidays in Puerto Rico are a great opportunity to combine beach activities with excellent shopping, and during fascinating excursions tourists get acquainted with the rich history of the island and its picturesque surroundings. </p><p>  Luxurious beaches with the most delicate sand, the gentle Caribbean sun and warm sea attract thousands of guests from different countries.  Surf lovers competing in the ability to catch high waves are also in a hurry here.  And beginners can test their strength in quiet bays.  Puerto Rico is a real paradise for divers, because the coastal waters of the picturesque island are recognized as the cleanest in the world. </p><p>  In addition, the residents of the state are very friendly towards tourists. </p><h2>  Crypto or crypto utopia? </h2><p>  It is curious that only a few months after the hurricane, American entrepreneurs began to migrate here, attracted by tax benefits.  If other countries tightened the regulation of the circulation of digital money, the authorities of Puerto Rico, who are looking for new ways to revive the economy, have provided businessmen with all the conditions for the development of cryptocurrency business.  Investors want to build a new city from scratch, create their own state in the state.  Only virtual money will go to the crypto market called Sol in circulation.  So far, entrepreneurs have concentrated in the Old Town, having bought numerous hotels and one of the museums. </p><p>  Locals fear that the island will turn into a platform for the rich, who conduct their experiment.  But will he succeed as a result?  Nobody knows that. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.expedia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The natural beauty of the island" class="if uuid-3087912" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3087912.jpg"></div><p>  Despite the natural disasters, the island of Puerto Rico (tourist reviews only confirm this) continues to be the most desirable vacation spot on our planet. </p>
