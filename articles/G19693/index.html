Princes from generation to generation traveled to the Horde to pay, exchange hostages and take shortcuts to reign.  The liberation of Russia from the Horde yoke occurred in 1480.  This date was a turning point in the history of our state. </p><h2>  Mongol-Tatar yoke </h2><p>  The occupation of the entire north-eastern region of Russian territory was beyond the power of the Golden Horde.  But these lands were needed by the invaders as a constant reliable source of tribute.  The Tatars did not have garrisons on Russian territory; they did not establish their permanent power.  But, despite the annual monetary offerings, the Tatar-Mongols did not at all guarantee the protection of the principalities.  The borders of Russia were constantly invaded by Swedish and Lithuanian troops.  Inside, the country was torn by contradictions and civil strife.  The invaders understood that a fragmented state would not be able to give them a worthy rebuff, so they thoroughly incited hatred between neighboring principalities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the liberation of Russia from the Horde yoke of centuries" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/838169.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Ivan Kalita </h2><p>  In 1327 there was the only rebellion of the people against the Horde yoke.  Russia with fear was expecting a new punitive raid.  At this moment, Ivan Kalita appears on the political horizon.  Unable to retreat in front of the Tatar-Mongols, he decides on the only right way, from his point of view, to lead the army of the Golden Horde to the old enemy of Moscow - the Principality of Tver. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the liberation of Russia from the Horde yoke" class="if" height="268" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/838170.jpg" width="400"></div>  For this, Kalita received a label from the Horde Khan and became a <span>Grand Duke.</span>  So the liberation of Russia from the Horde yoke did not take place.

Prince Ivan Kalita did much to strengthen the city and to ensure that hordes of Horde robbers no longer appear on Russian lands.  His policy was successfully continued by Simeon the Proud.  In 1346, he reached reconciliation with Tver and even married one of the daughters of the Tver Prince Vsevolod.  So gradually began the reconciliation of the Russian princes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the liberation of Russia from the Horde yoke year and century" class="if" height="391" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/838171.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The second memorable date in the liberation of Russia from the Horde yoke was 1362.  At this time, the khan gave a label to the great reign of the nephew of Simeon the Proud - Dmitry Ivanovich Donskoy.  In the same year, the name Mamai appeared in Russian chronicles.  No one could have admitted then that in many years they would have to meet, and this battle will be one of the greatest battles of the Middle Ages.  Donskoy brought closer the liberation of Russia from the Horde yoke.  Mamai defended the state, once created by Batu.  The question was as follows: will Dmitry Ivanovich have time to collect Russian lands around Moscow or will Mamai come with his army to strangle Moscow sedition. </p><h2>  Kulikovo battle </h2><p>  Donskoy was only 20 years old when the need was ripe to repulse the Golden Horde.  The Russian state developed trade and cultural relations with Western countries; this contributed to the development of military affairs and the growth of industry.  It took time to develop tactics and retrain the troops.  Do not forget that a strong centralized government demanded the liberation of Russia from the Horde yoke. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The year and century of the Battle of Kulikovo were carefully chosen.  The principality of Moscow already had economic and military levers of influence over the allies; therefore, the consolidation of the forces of the Russian army and the development of tactical methods were quite successful. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the year of the liberation of Russia from the Horde yoke" class="if" height="457" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/838190.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The Battle of Kulikovo took place on September 8, 1380.  For the first time, the Russian army was able to give a fitting rebuff.  The horde had a numerical advantage over the Don forces, but the right tactics bore fruit - the main forces of Mamaia were destroyed, and the khan had to retreat.  But, despite the fact that the liberation of Russia from the Horde yoke did not take place this time, the Battle of Kulikovo was the beginning of the revival of national identity.  And the Golden Horde continued to try to regain its influence and stop the unification of Russian lands. </p><h2>  Age of Ivan III </h2><p>  The period of the <span>reign of Ivan III</span> was the time of the strengthening of the Russian troops and state cordons.  The kingdom of Kazan was the first conquest of the king, after which he was able to subjugate Veliky Novgorod.  Such military activity troubled <span>Khan Akhmat,</span> and he began to prepare the invasion.  By 1480, everything was ready so that, finally, the liberation of Russia from the Horde yoke took place.  The year and century for this was not chosen by chance - Russia became a large political and economic center with its own, rather strong army. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the liberation of Russia from the Horde yoke occurred in" class="if" height="288" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/838173.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The news that Khan Akhmat was preparing for the battle came to Moscow in the early fall of 1480.  Grand Duke Ivan III set up his strongest regiments on the Oka River.  Khan Akhmat learned that he was being met, and turned to Kaluga to unite with his ally, Casimir.  Having correctly determined the direction of the Golden Horde troops, Ivan III intercepted the enemy on <span>the Ugra River.</span>  Akhmat threatened to launch an offensive when the river was covered with ice.  October 26 Ugra got up.  Akhmat also stood.  November 11, despite the fact that all the paths to the offensive were open, the khan turned back.  On this day, the liberation of Russia from the Horde yoke is celebrated. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The heroic struggle of the Russian people against the invaders ensured the collapse of the Tatar-Mongol expansion.  For 240 years, the Russian state covered Europe from the dark Asian horde, took upon itself the brunt of the foreign invasion and reflected the attacks of the invaders.  The year of the liberation of Russia from the Horde yoke allowed our state to take the path of its own development. </p>
