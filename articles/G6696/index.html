They are attracted by the nature of these places, the gentle sea, wide beaches and beautiful hotels with a high level of service.  In addition, many Russians are attracted by accessibility, because almost everyone can choose a tour that matches their capabilities, and hotel complexes, where guests are provided with a standard package of services.  Naturally, such a vacation will not be ruinous for the family budget. </p><p>  But there is a special category of travelers who chooses holidays only on the highest level.  These tourists book hotels with a class of at least five stars and are ready to test new hotel complexes that have not yet managed to gain a certain reputation among vacationers.  If you consider yourself in this category, then our article will be of interest to you.  After all, today we will consider the new hotel Veranda Resort Pattaya 5 *.  Perhaps this is where you will go to rest in the near future. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="veranda resort pattaya 5" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1794751.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Veranda Resort Pattaya 5 *: hotel description </h2><p>  If you are looking for something new in Thailand that will surprise and please you, then feel free to choose a new hotel complex.

    <h2>  Beach area </h2><p>  Like many other hotels in Thailand, Veranda Resort Pattaya 5 * (na Jomtien) does not have its own beach area.  You will have to go to the city beach along with all the other guests of Pattaya.  But nevertheless, you will notice some differences: the hotel staff daily clean the sand related to the hotel and carefully clean the coastal area.  As a result, you will rest on the white sand without unpleasant surprises in the form of wrappers from chips or cigarette butts.  In addition, the water in this place is surprisingly clean, so you will definitely enjoy swimming on the beach. </p><p>  We have already specified that the hotel is located on the first coastline, which greatly facilitates the road to the beach.  It will take you no more than five minutes, which is very important if you are relaxing in Pattaya with young children. </p>

    <h2>  The cost of living in a hotel </h2><p>  Here it is worth clarifying that this hotel complex, despite frequent promotions, will never be available to the general mass of vacationers.  It is designed for a special category of tourists who are ready to give a lot of money for comfort and excellent service. </p><p>  The minimum price per night at the hotel is equal to six thousand rubles.  This is very expensive for most Russians.  Especially if you add flight and transfer to this price.  As a result, the average cost of a tour for eleven to twelve days can approach two hundred thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Veranda Resort Pattaya 5 *: reviews </h2><p>  Almost every hotel in Thailand has a lot of reviews from Russians and tourists from other countries of the world.  Among them, you can find the positive, negative and neutral.  But when we talk about the hotel Veranda Resort Pattaya 5 *, then the situation is completely different. </p><p>  Since this hotel complex is relatively new, it is quite difficult to find real guest reviews about it.  It‚Äôs even more difficult to stumble upon the comments of our compatriots who visited this amazingly beautiful hotel.  Therefore, we had to work hard to collect reliable information for you. </p><p>  Just say that among the few reviews there is not a single negative.  And this is not surprising, because the hotel is new, beautiful and fully meets all quality standards.  What impressed Russians the most in the new Thai hotel? </p>

    <p>  First of all, almost all guests noted an unusual pool.  It is made in a very interesting manner, has sufficient depth and width.  Spent time near it gives tourists great pleasure. </p><p>  Many positive comments were called by the hotel staff.  They are very helpful, polite and ready to help guests at any time.  But there were some incidents - the majority of employees do not understand English well, and Russian, of course, is completely inaccessible to them.  Therefore, any order in a bar or restaurant causes a lot of excitement and is discussed collectively.  Of course, there are mistakes, but the waiters and bartenders are always smiling and ready to immediately change the dish or drink brought.  This greatly alleviates an awkward situation. </p><p>  A lot of enthusiasm is caused by the design of the hotel complex.  In beauty, it surpasses most five-star hotels in Pattaya. </p><p>  Many travelers tend to save on their travels, so they rarely book luxurious and unusual hotels.  Of course, such frugality is in many cases justified.  But sometimes you really want to forget about everything and spend your holidays in fabulous conditions, surrounding yourself with beautiful things.  Therefore, if you feel such a desire, then feel free to go to Thailand to spend time in the new Veranda Resort Pattaya 5 * hotel.  It is here that all dreams come true, in any case, so say the guests of this beautiful hotel complex in Pattaya. </p>
