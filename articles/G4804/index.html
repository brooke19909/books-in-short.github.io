  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The cause of death of Vysotsky</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The death of V. Vysotsky, about which a lot is known, remains a mystery to this day, since its circumstances are covered in fog and are known only from the words of various people interested in telling lies.  So, you can find a large number of witnesses who were in his apartment that day, who knew all the conversations, those who informed M. Vladi and his mother, and so on.  But in fact, no one knows what the true cause of Vysotsky‚Äôs death is. </p><p>  Rumors of the death of this ingenious man often arose long before the incident.  Some claimed that he had opened his veins, others - that he shot himself.  Gossip was born at lightning speed.  In fact, Vladimir was repeatedly in intensive care, survived several <span>clinical deaths, and</span> got into car accidents.  And when he was visiting Abdulov, he suddenly felt ill, but the ambulance did not want to take him, because the doctors were afraid that the actor would die on the way. </p><p>  The exact cause of Vysotsky‚Äôs death has not been established, as his relatives refused to perform an autopsy.  Some evidence suggests that he died from drugs and alcohol, while others claim that he died of self-suffocation, but the medical report says - acute heart failure. </p><p>  Many knew about the problem of the bard with drugs, as much as about alcohol addiction.  At one time, Vladimir Semyonovich was in hospitals with the goal of curing this ailment, he used many alternative methods, but he always broke down. </p><p>  On July 18, 1980, actor Vysotsky played his last role in the Taganka Theater.  Even then, his condition was poor.  Within a few days, it worsened, and the twenty-fourth of July was the last day of his life.  That day Vladimir was almost unconscious, he foresaw his demise. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The artist died at the height of the Olympic Games, which were held in the capital of Russia.  For this reason, the authorities tried to hide this fact from people.  And only ‚ÄúEvening Moscow‚Äù and ‚ÄúSoviet Russia‚Äù were written by small obituaries, which indicated the cause of Vysotsky‚Äôs death - a heart attack. </p><p>  About 40 thousand people escorted Vladimir Semyonovich to the last journey.  A few days after the funeral, people did not disperse. </p><p>  The documentary film of V. Mansky ‚ÄúV.  Vysotsky.  The death of the poet ‚Äù, which came out six years later.  It reveals the actor‚Äôs struggle with a disease that has progressed in the last months of his life.  According to the authors of the film, everyone is free to decide for himself what is the cause of Vysotsky‚Äôs death, however, <span>these judgments</span> cannot claim to be true.  They have the hope that an attempt to convey the truth to the viewer about the circumstances of the death will not shock them.  After all, the poet himself loved the truth and hated the lie. </p><p>  Mansky's film excited the public.  The question was whether such a truth about Vladimir Semenovich Vysotsky was necessary, whether she would discredit the bright image of the idol of millions of people?  However, the director replied that the documentary cannot be sissy, because each time it reveals the true circumstances of people's lives. </p><p>  On the monument, located at the <span>Vagankovsky cemetery, is</span> the date of birth of Vysotsky <strong> </strong>  - 01.25.1938 and the date of his death - 07.24.1980. </p><p>  The <span>Soviet poet,</span> author and performer of songs, actor and author of many works, the winner of the State Prize and the favorite of millions of people did not become.  According to the polls, V. Vysotsky takes the second place in the list of idols of the twentieth century after Yuri Gagarin. </p><p>  Thus, to date there is no accurate data on the causes of the death of the poet.  To date, many films are published that tell about the life and work of Vladimir Semenovich.  Why did he die, let everyone decide for himself. </p>
