Manufacturers from the Celestial Empire learned to make good quality gadgets.  Many devices have top-end features, but they are sold at an affordable price.  It is the optimal ratio of cost and functionality that is for many buyers the main selection criterion. </p><p>  This article will provide an overview of the ZTE Axon 7 mini.  This smartphone is a simplified version of the Chinese flagship ZTE Axon 7. Naturally, it has smaller dimensions and more modest characteristics.  The manufacturer positions the device as musical.  He is a typical representative of the middle segment and is sold in retail for approximately 20 thousand rubles.  So, let's see what exactly is the manufacturer going to surprise users with? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zte axon 7 mini specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2072995.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  Naturally, we will begin the <span>review of ZTE Axon 7</span> mini with features of its appearance.  Design differences with the "older" model are not visible.  The same silver frames on the front panel, rounded ‚Äúsides‚Äù.  But there are still differences, and they are in size.  The "younger" version received the following dimensions - 147.5x71x7.8 mm.  A thin compact device fits perfectly in the hand.  You can control it even on the go, however, it is worth considering that the rear metal surface is a little slippery, so it‚Äôs better to immediately put on the transparent cover that is offered in the kit. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Smartphone ZTE Axon 7 mini - a musical gadget, respectively, the manufacturer used high-quality speakers, which are located on the front panel at the top and bottom.  In an advertising slogan, it was stated that owners can enjoy concert sound.  To say that this statement is 100% true, probably no one will undertake, but the sound is really impressive. </p><p>  The presence of side screen frames slightly spoiled the overall impression.  They are quite wide, which visually increases the body.  But in fairness, we note that they are visible only when the screen is on. </p><p>  The assembly did not receive complaints.  The body is made soundly and efficiently.  When interacting with the device, a feeling of reliability arises.  There are no creaks, the panel does not bend. </p><p>  On the back side, according to the traditional pattern, there are a scanner, a camera lens and a flash.  There are some comments on the work of the fingerprint sensor - it does not work the first time.  Mechanical control keys are displayed on the right side.  According to most owners, their location is as convenient as possible.  On the opposite side there is a tray for "sims."  One of the slots is combined - you can install micro-SD flash drives in it.  The headset jack is on the top, and the bottom has a micro-USB port and a small microphone hole. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zte axon 7 mini review" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2072996.jpg"></div>

The display type is AMOLED, which is undoubtedly a virtue.  The picture is displayed in high resolution - Full HD.  Many users have noticed an <span>oleophobic coating</span> that prevents glass contamination.  By the way, the type of the latter is 2.5D.  The brightness range is sufficient, automatic adjustment works well.  The sensor is soft, clearly and quickly recognizes touch.  There is a working mode with gloves on, but you need to pay attention to the fact that the touchscreen becomes hypersensitive, which can lead to numerous erroneous clicks.  It‚Äôs comfortable to interact with the gadget on the street, but the color of the screen fades noticeably in the sun. </p><p>  The fact that the ZTE Axon 7 mini features are worthy of respect, you can see the resolution of the cameras.  The main one is a 16-megapixel matrix (f / 1.9).  It is equipped with an autofocus phase type.  For the flash, the developers used two LEDs that display light of different temperatures.  In video mode, video recording is in Full HD quality.  Users appreciated a large number of settings in the camera application.  Almost all parameters can be changed manually.  The only thing you have to get used to is shooting in the dark.  In order not to get a blurry frame, the phone will have to be held still for a while, usually a couple of seconds. </p><p>  At the heart of the selfie camera is a sensor of 8 megapixels (f / 2.2).  There were no special comments on it from users.  With the help of the "front camera" you can take both good pictures and communicate via video. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zte axon 7 mini reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2072997.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Hardware equipment </h2><p>  It's time to consider the platform features in the ZTE Axon 7 mini.  The Snapdragon 617 chipset is responsible for the device‚Äôs performance. The developers installed eight computing modules, half of which are accelerated to 1500 MHz, the rest to 1200 MHz.  Adreno 405 was chosen as the coprocessor. The performance characteristics are supplemented by three gigabytes of RAM, but about 1.5 GB will be available to the user.  The native memory in the phone is 32 GB, system files occupy approximately 12 GB. </p><p>  The gadget supports working with all wireless modules.  We are talking about Bluetooth 4.1, GLONASS / GPS, Wi-Fi, NFC. </p><p>  The sixth Android is the operating system.  There is a proprietary shell - MiFavor UI 4.0.  The system did not receive any special comments, but nevertheless, some "glitches" are present.  For example, if a password is set, then changing the wallpaper will not work, the background operation of applications automatically stops. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The ZTE Axon 7 mini battery specifications did not impress buyers.  The battery has a capacity of only 2705 mAh.  In order for the device to "live" until the evening, it is necessary to reduce the time of the active screen to 3 hours.  Such results cannot be called excellent, since even among the "state employees" you can already find models in which batteries of 3000 mAh or more are installed.  The manufacturer understood that the capacity of the built-in battery would not be enough for normal operation, therefore, provided the option Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0 (fast charge). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone zte axon 7 mini" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2072998.jpg"></div>
