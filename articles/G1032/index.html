    <h2>  How to terminate an agreement with Rostelecom: four simple steps </h2><ol><li>  We are preparing documents (a detailed list will be given below). </li><li>  We go to the office and write a statement.  The form will be provided by a service center specialist.  You can also fill it in advance by downloading a sample from the provider's official website.  Third-party web resources should be avoided, as they may not have the most up-to-date document layout. </li><li>  We carry out the return of equipment.  This item is relevant in cases where a TV set-top box, router or other equipment was leased.  If the subscriber uses his own set-top box, for example, or purchased (including by installments) it from Rostelecom, then go to the point below. </li><li>  We pay the invoice received.  The payment document will arrive in the first days of the next month.  For those who use communication services from the operator in question, he knows that charging for communication services provided, for example, in the current month, will be carried out in the first days of the next month. </li></ol><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="terminate the contract with Rostelecom on the phone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45312/2086218.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Who can terminate the contract? </h2><p>  Only the person whose data was used to conclude the contract can terminate the contract with Rostelecom on the phone (as well as on the Internet and TV).  Such cases are not excluded when: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  the subscriber does not have the opportunity to contact the provider‚Äôs salon in connection with employment / remoteness from the place of residence; </li><li>  the subscriber is dead. </li></ul><p>  In the first case, you can send documents by mail.  In order not to lose the originals of documents when sending, you should make copies of them.  It may take a long time to wait for a response with such an application, so resorting to it is not recommended.  It is safer to visit the office and make a statement in person. </p><p>  For those subscribers who are interested in how to terminate the contract with Rostelecom without contacting the company‚Äôs branch, the fact that you can send your relative or friend instead of yourself will be good news.  In this case, you first need to draw up a power of attorney (it can be a ‚Äúgeneral‚Äù power of attorney to perform any action or power of attorney to terminate the contract for communication services) with a notary. </p>

    <p>  If a subscriber who has concluded an agreement with Rostelecom has died, then his relatives also have the right to contact the provider‚Äôs service center and write a statement.

    <p>  How to terminate the contract with Rostelecom for the Internet or other service if the subscriber who has concluded the agreement has died? </p><p>  Relatives, having a death certificate in their hands, can contact the service salon and write a statement.  You will need to have an identity document with you.  If the contract includes ‚Äúequipment for rent‚Äù, then it will be necessary to return it.  The presence of other documents will be a ‚Äúplus". </p><p>  When contacting a trustee service center, you must have a full package of documentation plus a power of attorney for operations. </p><h2>  Where to go with the documents? </h2><p>  Not in any salon, over the entrance to which the Rostelecom sign flaunts, you should contact to perform such a complex procedure as the termination of the contract.  Where to terminate the contract with Rostelecom can be viewed on the provider's website or specified by the toll-free support line number.  Most often, such actions are performed in service centers.  At sales offices and information desks, this operation will be refused.  Rostelecom has <em>combined</em> salons in which it is possible to conclude an agreement, receive information on it, and also terminate it. </p>

    <h2>  Equipment return </h2><p>  Rostelecom provides its customers with the opportunity to use the company's equipment (rent it out) and redeem (immediately or in installments).  In the first case, when a TV set-top box or router is taken for temporary use, upon termination of the contract they will need to be returned.  Equipment operability will be carried out by a company specialist upon delivery of documentation and equipment. </p><p>  It is possible that the equipment is purchased by the client.  Payment for it can be made once (in full) or monthly (in installments). </p><p>  The type of equipment purchase is specified in the contract.  Therefore, it is recommended to carefully read its contents, so as not to get an unpleasant surprise later. </p><h2>  In which case the termination of the contract may be refused </h2><p>  Often, subscribers who want to stop using the services of the provider we are considering have to face a number of difficulties when closing their personal account.  Many complain that they are denied termination, citing debt.  Indeed, the only reason a service center specialist can refuse to accept an application is the presence of debt.  Debt is not considered the absence of payment for the previous period (after invoicing, cash flow is permissible until the 25th day of the month). </p>

    <h2>  Other nuances </h2><ul><li>  As mentioned earlier, it is possible to terminate the contract with Rostelecom on the home Internet only if there is no account debt.  Therefore, it is recommended to immediately extinguish it and only then go to the department to terminate the contract. </li><li>  In case of early termination of the contract, it is possible to recalculate for communication services for those users who connected to the provider during the period of the promotion.  The application of the recalculation mechanism in one case or another should be clarified by the company's specialists. </li><li>  After the termination of the contract, it will be necessary to pay the accrual for the previous period.  The invoice for payment will arrive in paper or electronic form at the beginning of next month. </li><li>  If you want to refuse one of the company's services and continue to use the second (with complex connection), you should also contact the communication salon and write a corresponding statement. </li></ul><h2>  How to find out about the presence of debt? </h2><p>  Before contacting the company‚Äôs office and writing an application to terminate the contract, you should make sure that there is no debt on your personal account.  You can do this by phone, calling the company‚Äôs hotline or look in your personal account (on the official website or in the mobile application).  Also, with a personal visit to the provider's office, you can find out if there is a debt.  Only after that it will be possible to get a form to fill out an application for termination of the contract.  By the way, in most branches of the company there are ATMs and special terminals for payment, using which you can not only pay the existing debt, but also make a monthly payment on a personal account for any of the services used under the contract. </p>
