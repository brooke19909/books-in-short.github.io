  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Which amplifier for the subwoofer to choose and whether it is needed at all</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  You bought a <span>subwoofer</span> or speaker, but you don‚Äôt know whether it is worth spending money on an amplifier for a subwoofer.  This question is not particularly difficult for professionals.  Let‚Äôs try and we will figure out what are the advantages of such amplifiers and what you need to pay attention to first of all during installation. </p><p>  Buy an inexpensive <span>passive subwoofer</span> and connect directly to the car radio, of course, you can.  After all, she has a super-sophisticated built-in amplifier and she "can" give out 50 watts per channel.  Let's immediately understand the disadvantages of this method.  Decide what you need from the subwoofer.  Do you want to feel sub-low frequencies or you need a loud bass speaker, which will not only increase the volume of low frequencies, but will also bring elements such as humming and wheezing to the playback.  Need a second one?  Feel free to choose the victim channel on the tape recorder and implement your subwoofer.  In order not to encounter complete disappointment from the purchase, you need an amplifier for the subwoofer. </p><p>  Surely you know that you can buy a subwoofer with a built-in amplifier.  Yes, such a miracle of engineering, of course, is.  Such "barrels" / "boxes" are called active.  As a rule, they are equipped with everything necessary, and this is a crossover, an equalizer, and a frequency filter.  Such speakers differ in cost from passive devices, at least twice.  They are easy to set up, deliver solid bass and live up to the bold expectations of most buyers.  But it is worth considering that <span>active subwoofers,</span> nevertheless, do not belong to high-end technology.  If you want to create a truly high-quality sound in the car, you will need a passive speaker and an intelligent master. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  About how to choose an amplifier for a subwoofer is best to find out from experts.  It is better, of course, to say not to pick up, but to ask people who know a lot about car audio.  The passive column requires very fine tuning, unlike the active counterpart.  And installing such a subwoofer is often more expensive than the price of the speaker itself.  Worst of all, if there are no specialists in your city.  In this case, it is not difficult to learn how to choose an amplifier for a subwoofer on the Internet.  Not bad is considered an amplifier company Revolt, JVC, KICKER. </p><p>  What can be distinguished from such tips? </p><p>  Amplifiers for cars there are 2 channels, 4 channels, 5 channels and monoblocks.  Having a fairly limited amount of money, it is not difficult to purchase an amplifier with access to two channels.  Best with bridge support.  The principle is based on the fact that you can send a signal from the left and right channel to the subwoofer simultaneously with a load of 4 ohms.  In such a simple way, a device designed to support stereo sound is transformed into an amplifier for a subwoofer.  The price of such a device starts at $ 150.  Such amplifiers are usually endowed with a frequency filter and all kinds of protection against overload and short circuit.  Devices with four or more channels operate on the same principle, simply if two channels are ‚Äúbridged‚Äù as a subwoofer, then you still have the option of connecting additional speakers to the sound amplification system. </p><p>  Monoblocks, in general, is another story.  These devices are usually designed for powerful acoustics.  Such an amplifier for a subwoofer most often has a rated power of 100W and supports a load of 1 ohm.  It is best to connect only one speaker to it, but support for two, well, a maximum of three speakers is not ruled out.  Such devices cost from $ 200 and are most often used by professionals not only as an amplifier for a subwoofer, but also for separate support of absolutely every channel of the speaker system.  In any case, only you will have to decide and I hope that this information will help you with this. </p>
