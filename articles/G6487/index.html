    <h2>  The history of the Dominican Republic </h2><p>  The words "Haiti", "Caribbean", "Dominican Republic", "Saona" give rise to the imagination of a resident of cold Russia fantasies about an incredible land with the ever-shining sun, serenity and pleasure.  However, the <span>Dominican Republic</span> had to see different times.  These lands were discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1492.  Prior to this, the indigenous Indian population lived here safely.  After Columbus, the Spaniards arrived in the country and occupied this territory, but soon the British and French appeared, who also claimed this paradise.  For several centuries, a fierce struggle between the European colonialists took place over the islands, and these or those forces periodically won. </p><p>  From the beginning of the 19th century, the liberation movement for the independence of Haiti from the invaders began.  The island was divided into two states: the <span>Republic of Haiti</span> and the Dominican Republic.  But this was not the end of the story.  In 1865, the Spaniards were finally expelled from the island.  The Dominican Republic was formed on the part that previously belonged to them.  But from this moment begins a long series of internal upheavals and the struggle for power. </p><p>  At the beginning of the 20th century, the republic became dependent on the United States due to the difficult economic situation.  Almost the entire 20th century, the island was shaken by military coups, the power of dictators, the intervention of American troops.  Only in 1965 the republic was able to defend its rights to independence.  Elections were held, but the difficulties did not end.  The country was going through times of political showdown and great economic difficulties. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  By the beginning of the 20th century, a democratic regime had been established in the Dominican Republic, peaceful times had come, and business, including tourism, began to develop.  Since 1945, the country has established diplomatic relations with Russia; since 2006, the flow of our tourists to the Dominican Republic has been steadily growing. </p>
