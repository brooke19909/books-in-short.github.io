    <p>  In the warm season, guests and guests of the Tsarskaya Derevnya Hotel (Sergiev Posad) can visit the summer terrace with soft chairs to drink tea with pancakes and jam, or the summer tent, which serves wonderful lemonade.  For a romantic dinner, it is best to choose a gazebo with panoramic views of the Lavra. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Guest opinion </h2><p>  Location, comfort and cleanliness - these criteria guide people when choosing hotels.  Sergiev Posad and the Tsar’s Village complex will not disappoint you. </p><p>  Guest reviews mark the original interior of the rooms.  In addition to the buildings, the hotel has a playground and parking.  Guests can visit the cozy bathhouse or sauna, book an excursion or just have a delicious dinner in one of the restaurants. </p><p>  Unfortunately, travelers still found some comments: </p><p>  - unpleasant odor in some rooms; </p><p>  - problems with plumbing; </p><p>  - too modest breakfast. </p><p>  In addition, movement around the hotel can be a problem for the youngest guests in prams due to the lack of ramps. </p><h2>  Boutique hotel </h2><p>  No less popular among tourists and local residents is the complex “Russian Yard” (Avenue of the Red Army, 134/2).  It includes the eponymous restaurant and boutique hotel, as well as the Cherry Orchard art cafe, the Summer Life restaurant, the Nothing Personal Club-Restaurant and the Russian Souvenir Fair. </p><p>  Only five rooms are available for booking: </p><ol><li>  “Chekhov” will introduce guests to the comfort of a manor life.  The windows overlook a quiet street where A.P. once stayed.  Chekhov.  The interior is made in soothing colors, and unusual details (retro phone, wall clock and gramophone) seem to be transferred to the past.  Guests can read the collected works of the great poet, listen to audio books or watch DVDs with screen versions of famous works. </li><li>  “Rachmaninov” meets the interior in blue tones and the atmosphere of lightness and magic.  Literature dedicated to the famous composer, as well as CDs and vinyl records will certainly disturb the strings of your soul. </li><li>  “Kuprin” is an unusual combination of sophisticated classics and oriental motifs, which delicately remind of the Tatar roots of the writer. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tsarist village sergiev posad" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1052880.jpg" width="400"></div></li><li>  “Prishvin” makes one recall the beauty of Russian nature.  There is a bedroom and a living area with a fireplace, hunting trophies on the walls and a panel that depicts a magnificent forest. </li><li>  And finally, the most luxurious room is Chaliapin.  Soft carpets, mirrors, crystal, cozy pillows, a fireplace and furniture in a classic style. </li></ol><p>  All rooms have blackout curtains, a safe, a work desk, an LCD TV, climate control and underfloor heating in the bathroom. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The boutique hotel “Russian Yard” has earned the highest guest ratings.  The thematic design of the number of rooms amazes even inveterate travelers.  High quality service and room facilities, according to reviews, are at a European level.  The cost of living upsets a little - at least 5,000 rubles on weekdays and 6,000 rubles on weekends. </p><p>  The only drawback that guests note is the popularity of the restaurant complex.  The location and delicious food attract a huge number of tourists.  If you dream of silence, then choose other hotels.  Sergiev Posad is incredibly popular among foreigners, and they are known to appreciate the traditional Russian flavor. </p><h2>  “Posadsky” </h2><p>  On the main square of the city, next to the administration building, is the Posadsky Hotel (171 Red Army Ave.). The main attraction can be reached on foot in about ten minutes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel posadsky" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1052877.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Hotel Posadsky offers travelers 70 rooms in the following categories: </p><p>  - standard DBL or TWN (from 2700 rubles); </p><p>  - two-room DBL or TWN (from 3100 rubles); </p><p>  - studio (from 3100 rubles); </p><p>  - TWN studio (from 3100 rubles); </p><p>  - junior suite (from 4100 rubles); </p><p>  - lux (from 5300 rubles). </p><p>  It includes a private bathroom with a hairdryer and amenities, air conditioning, a flat-screen TV and a small set of dishes.  The price includes a buffet, which is served in the morning.  In addition, the hotel has economy rooms for 8 and 10 people. </p><p>  Seminars, banquets, conferences and corporate events - the Posadsky Hotel can organize an event of any complexity.  Clients can only choose one of the halls: </p><ol><li>  “Small Posadsky” (area of ​​80 sq. M) is designed for 60 people. </li><li>  “Big Posadsky” (area of ​​200 sq. M) is designed for 180 people. </li></ol><p>  Additional services: </p><p>  - equipment installation; </p><p>  - interior design; </p><p>  - organization of coffee breaks, receptions or banquets. </p><h2>  Error handling </h2><p>  A few years ago, the Posadsky Hotel (Sergiev Posad) was at the top of the travelers rating.  However, today, according to reviews, almost the only advantage is location. </p><p>  Increasingly, guests notice poor-quality cleaning of rooms and linen that they have not changed after previous residents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel posadsky sergiev posad" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1052878.jpg" width="600"></div>  A lot of questions arise regarding the organization of food - there is dirty dishes, and breakfast is so modest that many people prefer urban cafes and restaurants.

    <p>  In general, travelers agree that the prices in this institution do not correspond to the level of service. </p><h2>  Lafer renaissance </h2><p>  You probably noticed that our review contains mainly city hotels.  Since ancient times, Sergiev Posad has been a center of attraction for pilgrims and tourists thanks to the Trinity-Sergius Lavra - a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  However, this does not mean that there is nothing remarkable outside the city. </p><p>  Only nature can be better than a magnificent architectural monument, which the Renaissance Hotel offers (Sergiev Posad, Smena, 35). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel renaissance sergiev posad" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1052879.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Leisure complex Lafer Renaissance Hotel &amp; Spa includes: </p><p>  - four residential buildings; </p><p>  - sauna and indoor pool; </p><p>  - Russian bath; </p><p>  - gourmet restaurant; </p><p>  - three conference rooms; </p><p>  - children's room. </p><p>  Travelers really like the area occupied by the Lafer Hotel.  Sergiev Posad is five kilometers away, so you are secured. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Lafer Sergiev Posad" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1052881.jpg" width="600"></div>  The complex operates only a year, and the number of rooms is in excellent condition.  Breakfast and lunch are included in the price.
