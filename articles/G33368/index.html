    <h2>  Bodice </h2><p>  To reduce the description of how the work is performed, the following notation is introduced: </p><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  single crochet </td><td>  stbn </td></tr><tr><td>  double crochet </td><td>  stsn </td></tr><tr><td>  double crochet </td><td>  st2SN </td></tr><tr><td>  connecting post </td><td>  SS </td></tr><tr><td>  with a crochet </td><td>  CH </td></tr><tr><td>  single crochet </td><td>  Bn </td></tr></tbody></table><ul><li>  In order to crochet a dress for a Barbie doll, you need to dial a chain of 27 loops.  In the first row, you need to connect stBN in each loop, except the first.  If the toy is larger, then you need to consider that this chain should be the size of her waist with an allowance for buttons. </li><li>  From the second to the fourth row, the work goes the same way: an air loop (it forms a rise that will be repeated in all other rows), stBN at each vertex of the previous row.  In the fifth, you need to add one column.  This addition should fall on the very last loop of the row. </li><li>  Sixth: BN column, two stBN at one vertex (hereinafter ‚Äúadding‚Äù), 3 stBN, one addition, then 3 stBN, adding again, continue the row with 3 stBN and adding, end row 7 with BN columns. </li><li>  Seventh: 8 column BN, addition, continue 13 stBN, again add, 8 stBN. </li><li>  The eighth row consists only of columns of BN. </li><li>  Ninth row: 8 stbn, addition, followed by 15 stbn, another addition and 8 stbn.  Tenth: stbn at each vertex of the previous row. </li><li>  Eleventh: 8 column BN, addition, tie 17 stBN, another addition, then 8 stBN.  The twelfth row fits in the same way as the tenth. </li><li>  Thirteenth: stBN, continue with addition and 13 stBN, do not knit one loop (hereinafter ‚Äúdecrease‚Äù), 10 stBN, decrease, stBN, decrease again, 10 stBN, decrease again, 13 stBN, make one addition. </li><li>  The fourteenth row of the bodice of the dress for the doll: 15 columns of BN and one decrease, 9 stbn, again decrease, stbn, another decrease, 9 stbn, decrease, complete the 15th stbn. </li><li>  Fifteenth: 14 stBN, decrease, tie 9 stBN, one decrease, 9 stBN, perform a decrease again, and then another 14 columns of BN. </li><li>  Sixteenth row: 7 columns of BN, 12 air, skip 6 loops, 20 stBN, 12 air, skip 6 loops, 7 columns of BN. </li><li>  Seventeenth: 7 SS, 12 stBN in the arch from air loops, 20 SS, again 12 stBN in the arch, 7 SS.  Fasten the thread.  Sew three buttons vertically on the bodice. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet doll dresses" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30158/1309588.jpg" width="375"></div></li></ul><p>  A knitted dress for a <span>doll (crochet) is</span> usually made fitted, so the bodice will almost always be the same.  But the rest of the elements will have significant differences.  So, for example, the sleeve can be made short or long, wide or narrow.  In the above description, a flashlight sleeve is provided. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Sleeve </h2><p>  The whole product will not be stitched, the elements are supposed to be knitted on those that are already available.  You need to continue crocheting a dress for the doll as follows: put the bodice with the wrong side facing you. </p><ul><li>  First row: on the bases of 12 columns knitted on an arch of air loops, tie: stBN, 2 half columns of CH, 6 stBN, 2 half columns of CH, column of BN.  The sleeve will go only along the upper part of the doll‚Äôs hand, that is, it will not be between the body and the hand. </li><li>  Second row: 5 air lines, from the first loop two times connect st2SN and the air loop, in the next 10 - st2SN and air loop, then again in the same loop perform st2CH and air two times. </li><li>  Third: lifting loop, BN column in each arch of the previous row.  Repeat the work for the second sleeve. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to crochet a dress for a doll" class="if" height="292" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30158/1309589.jpg" width="236"></div></li></ul><p>  If you want to tie a long sleeve, you need to repeat the first row several times.  And then, at the end, tie the pattern that was indicated for the second row of the short sleeve.  If you do not want to stitch the details, then here you will need to knit in a circle. </p><h2>  Collar </h2><p>  You can leave the dress for the doll without him.  But with a collar it will look more spectacular and elegant.  So, to tie the collar on the dress (crochet) for the Barbie doll, you need to dial a chain of 70 loops, the first of which will be used for lifting. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the first row, you need to tie 69 columns of BN.  The second must be connected with the same elements and in the same amount after one lifting loop.  Only the rear half loops of the vertices of the previous row are supposed to be captured.  In the same way, you need to tie another 9 rows. </p><p>  In the eleventh row, after one air loop, tie 29 BN columns, repeat four times: two stBN with one vertex and stBN, then another 28 stBN.  The last row will play the role of strapping.  It begins with a column of BN, then until the end of the row you need to repeat this pattern: 3 air, decrease and a column of BN. </p><p>  For the fastener, it is convenient to use a hook, which must be sewn to the ends of the penultimate row. </p><h2>  The fourth (largest) detail of the dress for the doll: skirt </h2><p>  This item of clothing may also vary.  It can be large and wide or narrow and short.  And someone will want to make the dress skirt long and narrowed.  Each time a new special dress for the doll (crochet) will be obtained.  The outline of the wide skirt is shown below.  First you need to put the bodice of the dress face to you and the waist up.  Then the work is supposed to be performed according to the plan indicated below.  Moreover, it must be taken into account that in each row or circle you need to do 4 loops for lifting. </p>

    <p>  Such a hem is supposed to be worn with a frame.  It can be made of dense cardboard rings connected by thick threads.  It should be ensured that the frame is not visible from under the hem.  This skirt can already be left in this form, but the girls want to make jewelry so that the dress for the doll becomes elegant.  For these purposes, you can use thin satin ribbons collected in bows.  Decoration can be crocheted lace or roses. </p><h2>  Hem trim </h2><p>  To make a crocheted dress for Barbie doll look solemn, a simple lace hem scheme will come in handy.  For its manufacture, it is supposed to put the dress with its face to itself and the hem up.  Then find the circle where the 16th row ended.  His left half-loops were not knitted.  On them will be a lace frill. </p><ul><li>  First circle: 4 aircrafts, in each 4th loop connect SS and st2SN. </li><li>  In the second, in each arch, connect the SS, and between them 7 air loops.  In order for the lace not to be too stretched, it is required to make additional arches from 7 air loops every two ordinary ones.  That is, in the next arch to connect not one SS, but two at a time. </li><li>  From 3 to 9 circle: knit the same chains of 7 air loops and SS on each top of the arches. </li><li>  10th circle: 2 aerial, in the first arch - st2 and air, in the next - stBN, air and seven times repeat st2, alternating with air, this alternation of work in these arches must be repeated until the end of the circle. </li><li>  The 11th circle of the frill of the hem of the dress: on all air loops, connect according to stBn, which should be alternated with one air loop. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dress for dolls crochet pattern" class="if" height="475" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30158/1309592.jpg" width="480"></div></li></ul><p>  The upper edge of the frill is also recommended to tie.  To do this, on each base arch of 4 air loops, connect stBN, 3 stSN and another stBN. </p><h2>  Dress Decoration: Rose </h2><p>  It is not enough just to know <span>how to knit a dress for a doll, you</span> will have to make crochets and decorations for it.  On a chain of 24 loops, knit in 6 of them stBN, then repeat until the end of the row - 3 air and stBN in the second loop.  It remains to fix the thread and curl the rose, stitching it from the wrong side. </p><h2>  In a set for a dress for a doll: hat </h2><p>  On a sliding loop, knit 6 SS.  Then, gradually adding loops, make a circle.  Its diameter should be about 3.5 cm. Followed by circles without adding.  They will form a hat top.  Its fields must again be matched with a large number of SS additions.  At the edge of the hat, knit an openwork pattern for a lace frill.  To make the hat look beautiful, it must be starched. </p>
