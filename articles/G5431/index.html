    <h2>  Where is the hotel situated </h2><p>  We can say that the hotel is located quite apart from the main attractions and infrastructure that Egypt is rich in.  Harmony Makadi Bay Hotel Resort 5 * is located 35 km from the airport terminal, 43 km from the center of Hurghada, and 255 km from the popular sightseeing route of Luxor.  Nevertheless, this is unlikely to spoil the mood of tourists, because a cozy quiet bay does not want to be left for the sake of noisy and crowded excursions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  Only two categories of rooms the Harmony Makadi Bay Hotel Resort 5 * hotel offers its guests a choice of.  Standard offers its guests a beautiful view of the garden and allows you to enjoy a quiet, relaxing holiday.  If you wish, you can check into a room with a double bed or single.  If you are staying in a room with a child, you have the right to an extra bed. </p><p>  The most popular among tourists are rooms with sea views, because there is nothing better than enjoying your captivating scenery and listening to the surf from your own cozy balcony or spacious terrace.  In all other respects, these apartments are practically no different from standard ones. </p>
