  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The main reasons for the formation of the old Russian state</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Kievan Rus was one of the largest and most powerful states of the Middle Ages.  The formation and development of the Old Russian state took shape under the influence of some geopolitical and spatial factors.  Firstly, the lands on which the formation of the new country took place were located at the junction of two different worlds: Muslim and Christian, settled and nomadic.  The main features of the formation of the Old Russian state are that during its formation, Kievan Rus acquired the features of both Western and Eastern statehood, since it was located on the <span>border between Asia and Europe.</span>  Secondly, the need of different tribes for rallying in the face of a common enemy allowed nations with different levels of development and different <span>cultural values</span> to unite <span>.</span>  By the way, Slavic statehood begins to emerge long before the formation of Kievan Rus, in the distant sixth century AD, with the unification of clan and tribal communities into one common and stronger community. </p><p>  Currently, many historians and sociologists continue to debate on the emergence of Russian statehood.  From the point of view of many of them, the reasons for the <span>formation of the Old Russian state</span> are as follows: </p><p>  - Economic development.  The joint activity of people encouraged them to search for new forms of existence.  Ancient Russia was an agricultural country.  The combined efforts of peoples who previously lived separately, allowed not only to feed their population, but also to produce goods for export.  Part of the urban population of the country were artisans and merchants, who also engaged in active trade with foreigners.  Each previously existing separately taken tribe could hardly provide itself with worthy food. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - Division of labor.  Prior to unification, each tribe was forced to independently fully support itself.  In a single state, people were gradually divided into separate castes or groups in which everyone played the role assigned to him.  So, farmers cultivated grain and vegetable crops necessary for food, merchants engaged in trade, the squad defended the civilian population and the territory of the country from enemy raids. </p><p>  - The interest of people in the <span>formation of a single state.</span>  Since its inception, the <span>state</span> has played the role of mediator in <span>conflict resolution.</span>  Initially, the role of the arbiter in such matters belonged to the prince or combatant.  The elders of the clan, during the separate residence of the tribes, were little suited for such a role and could hardly be judged impartially.  The resolution of disputes between individual clans through military action was too burdensome.  With the formation of the state, laws gradually appear that protect people in certain circumstances, punish those responsible, and the <span>judiciary</span> is born <span>.</span>  In addition, the reasons for the formation of the Old Russian state lie in the desire of people to protect themselves in the face of an external enemy.  In a single country, the role of defenders was played by people specially trained in military affairs, which means that there were much more chances to win. </p><p>  Also, the reasons for the formation of the Old Russian state can be traced in the gradual stratification of communities, the formation of inequality in terms of property, the emergence of classes.  The very formation of Russia is associated with the period of Oleg‚Äôs reign in Novgorod.  For the first time, the concept of the Old Russian state is found in The Tale of Bygone Years and is associated with <span>Prince Oleg‚Äôs</span> campaign in Kiev in 882.  The accession of Kiev to Novgorod was the next, but not the final stage of the unification of Russian lands.  However, this event is considered to be the key in the formation of a single country. </p><p>  It is possible that all the causes of the formation of the Old Russian state to modern scholars of history are unknown.  The only highly reliable source telling about the pre-Christian times of Russia is The Tale of Bygone Years.  Assumptions that its data are unreliable or not completely reliable cannot be ruled out. </p>
