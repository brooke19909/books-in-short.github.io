The meaning of combination and photo</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Those players who already have some experience in Texas Hold'em know what a set is, and they know how to behave in a game with such a hand.  But for beginners who are just mastering the game, this concept is still vague.  We will try to give a full description of the nuances relating to the set;  explain the concept of "set in poker."  Breaking into the game, a beginner must know the basic statistical probabilities in order to at least plan his actions.  So what is a set? </p><h2>  <span>What is</span> a poker <span>set?</span> </h2><p>  Let's get it right.  A set in poker or thrips are alternative names for such a combination as a triple.  That is, if a player has collected 3 cards of the same value, he already agrees to usually participate in the drawing of the bank. </p><p>  The remaining cards are not significant at the same time.  But sometimes these "extra" single cards decide the fate of the game.  They can play the role of kickers. </p><h2>  The difference between thrips and set </h2><p>  In Texas Hold'em, the alignment (or hand) called three is divided into 2 concepts: set and thrips.  It‚Äôs like two twins, each with its own ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù.  In fact, both of them are the same three, but the difference lies in how the combination is assembled. </p><p>  The first way to get it is called a set - a combination of 3 cards, 2 of which were already in the hands of the player.  These cards are called pocket cards.  The third card opens on the common table. </p>

    <p>  The second way to get a triple is 1 pocket card, and 2 paired, respectively, open for everyone.  Such a troika is considered to be thrips in professional Texas poker. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Here is an example of a Hold'em game where 4 people play.  According to the rules, 2 cards are pocket and 5 cards are on the flop.  Turn and river are not yet considered. </p>

Here you can clearly see the set in poker.  A photo will help to present in full all the information that has developed on the flop.  In this situation, player number 1 has a set of 3 jacks.  When you open pocket cards, you will find a set, a poker hand, which in this game brought the bank to this particular player.  Although the player has 3 pairs more.

    <h2>  Set Benefits </h2><p>  Recall that the three are higher in value than 1 pair or 2 pairs, and this alignment is already considered winning.  Even if a player has collected such a set in poker as 3 deuces, he has a chance for further competition.  But what is stronger: set or thrips?  To answer this question, we start from statistics.  The chance to collect a set is 10.78%;  and to collect thrips - only 1.35%.  That is, a set is a more likely combination, and because of this, a player with two cards in his hands is already stronger.  Buy a set on the flop - the probability of this, of course, is higher - 12%. </p><p>  Another nuance is a possible competition in the seniority of thrips.  After opening the cards, it may turn out that the triples are 2, since 1 card is common.  But the set in this regard is more powerful.  When a set is made in poker with only one card from the flop, the player can feel confident.  He is no longer with the lowest combination, but with the average. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Some players, having collected a set, pass on the flop, fearing that one of the players was able to collect a full house or street.  But the probability of a straight is low - 1.3%, and to collect a full house of 7 cards - the probability is very miserable.  With a pair on the table - 0, 74%, and if 3 on the table - 0.25%. </p><h2>  How to behave, collecting a set </h2><p>  Is it worth it to be careful or more aggressive if a set is already formed?  It is interesting for poker that it is absolutely impossible to predict who has which cards.  And each player chooses a game strategy for himself, only on the basis of his own two cards and his experience.  Quite often, players come across a set set.  The poker combination that has developed exactly in poker does not guarantee anything.  We can only predict the probability of an event, but not the event itself. </p><p>  Preflop, the first conclusions are made about the cards of opponents.  This is evident based on their reaction and rates.  Own bid should not be inflated ahead of time.  The flop decides everything.  It is best to make the main decision exactly on the flop regarding further play.  What to do with the set on hand? </p><p>  Raising bets makes sense only when a large set is on hand, starting with a lady.  And if the set is small, it‚Äôs enough to simply support the bet, that is, raise. </p><p>  Let's see what are the chances of getting a full house combination at different stages of the game that will beat thrips if the opponent already has a set on his hands: </p><ul><li><p>  on the turn, the probability is only 13%; </p></li><li>  on the river - 30%. </li></ul>

    <p>  In the case when you see that the flop has 3 cards of the same suit or even a weak three, then this situation is threatening for your combination. </p><p>  But when the flop is rather weak with different suited and ‚Äúdifferent-sized‚Äù cards, you can take a chance and raise the bet a little.  If you play the turn, then your chances are significantly reduced.  The turn increases the chances that one of the opponents will collect the best combination, for example, straight. </p><h2>  Set at the opponent </h2><p>  To calculate the opponent‚Äôs set, you need to be attentive to his behavior during the preflop and especially the flop.  If he actively increases the bet on the flop when there are 3 completely different cards on the table, and not very large ones, it is likely that he got the 3rd card for the set.  This is especially noticeable when he hesitates for a long time with a preflop bet. </p>

    <p>  Thrips is not so noticeable, and still less happy.  Since for the championship with a combination of thrips, you still need good large kickers. </p><h2>  The role of kickers </h2><p>  Cards that are not capable of creating any combination, but deciding the course of the game in controversial situations, are called kickers.  If you decide to play with a bad three, it is better to have good kickers in stock - a king or an ace. </p><p>  When 2 players collect the same set in poker, the highest card of the two then determines the winner.  If a situation arises when the same set is set in poker by two players, and the kickers are also equal, then the bank is divided into two participants.  But this almost never happens in practice. </p><p>  If you have thrips on hand and you open on the flop, then the probability of winning by kicker is 30 to 70. Each player must take these probabilities into account, and the decision must be made quickly. </p><p>  Is it worth bluffing with a three and a weak kicker?  Bluffing is suitable if there are 3 people in the game.  When the number of players is greater, any of them may have stronger cards.  And here bluff is powerless. </p>
