    <p>  Ferrari Enzo began with the production of ordinary cars designed for ordinary roads.  But, as he later admitted, this production allowed him to save up money for the realization of his real dream, the passion of his life.  He always wanted to create the fastest racing cars, choose a team for the competitions and win them. </p><p>  Enzo Ferrari, whose biography is one of the most striking success stories, was born in 1898.  In the fifties and sixties of the last century, informal races were popular in Italy - competitions between friends who drove their cars along empty roads.  Then there were still no speed limits, so each of the participants sought to overtake the others.  It was for these purposes that the <span>Italian</span> genius built his <span>miracle machines</span> .  His special flair and talent allowed him to overtake large automakers with unlimited possibilities.  After all, only six people worked at the Ferrari Enzo enterprise, who knew how to do absolutely everything. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The name Enzo gave his team an unusual - Scuderia Ferrari.  He compared his work with the stable, because in order for the horse to be able to win, careful care is necessary for it.  And the animal should eat well and be healthy, feel the love and care of the owner.  All this provides him with a whole team of professionals - grooms, riders, trainers, who must work harmoniously. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Enzo Ferrari Biography" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/309386.jpg" width="538"></div>

    <p>  At the time of <span>Enzo Ferrari,</span> whose photo is presented in this article, cars were assembled manually.  Therefore, in many respects the success of any enterprise depended on the experience of its employees.  The creator of the red car with the emblem in the form of a horse gathered around him the best experts who worked diligently on a common cause.  Enzo himself was distinguished by over-activity, inexhaustible energy, incredible hardworking, exactingness.  He always put work first.  These principles allowed him to achieve such heights. </p><p>  Ferrari Enzo always carefully selected employees, cherished team spirit.  They were sick with all their hearts for a common cause, together not only worked, but also had lunch and rest.  Often they slept in the workshop.  Therefore, when Scuderia Ferrari cars won, each member of the team felt like a hero.  But also, together, they experienced setbacks, sharing in everyone a <span>sense of guilt.</span>  They discussed their mistakes and measures that would allow them to eliminate all problems.  And each defeat made the team only stronger, bringing it closer to a real triumph. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Enzo Ferrari photo" class="if" height="422" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/309391.jpg" width="481"></div>

    <p>  When you look at a Ferrari car, you see an ideal, grace, a dream.  This is the perfection that can only be compared with a horse, which is the emblem of the brand.  I would like to take off my hat to its ingenious creator, who gave the world a sense of freedom, which has won more than five thousand races around the world.  And the world is grateful to him for creating a great cause, which continued after his death. </p>
