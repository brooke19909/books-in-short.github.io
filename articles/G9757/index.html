This is a peculiar, very beautiful city, where the most exciting bullfighting takes place and where you can hear and see the most passionate flamenco.  The city captivates with its medieval narrow streets, houses with snow-white walls and indispensable patios. </p><p>  Her story left its mark on Seville: during its existence for almost two and a half thousand years, it belonged to the Iberians, Romans, Goths, Arabs, until in the 13th century it passed into the hands of the Spanish kings. </p><p>  Each time, being attacked by different conquerors, the city of Seville was influenced by their culture, which affected the architecture of its structures.  Seville has the charm of antiquity. </p>

    <p>  It is known from history that it was originally a Moors fort - a fortress that was created to defend against the siege of enemies.  The construction was constantly reconstructed in order to improve and grew more and more.  It is known that the building was called Al-Muwarraq. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Until now, the exterior of the palace has been preserved, which was created on the ruins of an Arab fortress for King Pedro the First Cruel in 1364.  The king liked the <span>style of the Moorish</span> buildings, so the Seville Alcazar keeps traces of this style. </p><p>  Since then, this palace (more precisely, a complex of palaces, since subsequent rulers expanded and supplemented the layout and architecture of the structure) has been the seat of the Spanish kings for 700 years.  And today, some of the halls use it for ceremonial receptions. </p><h2>  Features of buildings </h2>

    <p>  In the guise of Alcazar, Gothic and Mudejar architecture are combined.  It captivates the eye of a tourist who inspects the amazingly beautiful palace rooms. <br>  To build Alcazar in Seville, King Pedro the First ordered the removal of the remains of the ruins of Arab buildings from Granada and Toledo, as well as the captive Muslims, who created this miracle of architecture.  Subsequent rulers made buildings, but not so grandiose: Queen Isabella the First and King <span>Charles the Fifth</span> erected new structures. </p>

    <p>  The next object of inspection will be the Hunting Courtyard (Patio del Monteria).  Here in the old days I was going to know - the retinue of the king, to accompany him on a hunt. <br>  The facade of the palace of King Pedro the First (Palasio Don Pedro), facing the courtyard, is an example of the Arab architectural style of Mudejar and, without a doubt, is recognized as a masterpiece.  This facade was erected by the best Moorish craftsmen from Granada, which was presented by the ruler Mohammed V to King Pedro the First as a sign of respect and gratitude for military assistance.  If you carefully look at the decorated walls with inscriptions, you can see not only the name of the architect and the year the facade was erected, but also an Arabic engraving on the entrance arch ‚ÄúThere is no winner except Allah.‚Äù </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Hall of Ambassadors (Salon del Embajadores) </h2><p>  It was the throne room of King Pedro the First.  It impresses with its wall decoration.  The bottom panel is decorated with tiles of amazing beauty, which is created by ornaments that converge into various geometric shapes, curls and patterns.  The walls above the panel are decorated with stucco with patterns and inscriptions in Arabic with a predominance of gold and red.  The ceiling of the hall is made of wood with skillfully executed starry sky - a symbol of the universe. </p><h2>  Maid of honor (Patio de las Donselleas) </h2><p>  This courtyard was the most famous and popular in the palace.  Its architecture is elegant and airy.  Thin columns are very beautiful, skillful carving of arcades, in the center there is a fountain.

    <p>  The Alcazar Gardens deserve special attention, they are located on terraces.  They reign calm, silence and tranquility, which contributes to relaxation and unhurried thought. </p><p>  This beautiful park is divided into separate gardens, each under its own name: Garden of Mercury, Big Garden, Garden of the Marquise de la Vega Inclan, Garden of the Cross, Garden of Troy, Orange Grove, Flower Garden, Garden of Poets, Labyrinth, etc. <br>  These gardens were created in ancient times by the Arabs, then they changed over time.

    <p>  Many types of plants grow in the gardens, about 170 or so. Some of them were brought from other countries and are therefore considered exotic for these places.  Everything is fascinating in the gardens: fountains, beautiful ponds, many sculptures and air saturated with the aroma of flowers and trees.  Peacocks pace the lawns. </p><p>  The Seville Alcazar for a long time leaves in memory the luxury and grace of the chambers and the sensation of the aroma of magnificent gardens. </p><h2>  Mysterious Seville </h2><p>  A tour to Spain from St. Petersburg costs about 70,000 rubles.  The price includes accommodation, flight and even several excursions.  But even if the tour does not involve a visit to Seville, you should definitely go there yourself.  Do not forget that legends are also associated with Seville, known to everyone who does not neglect reading books.  For example, local residents will show you the building of the university and tell you that once it housed a tobacco factory, where the beautiful Carmen worked, sung by Prosper Merime.  And on the banks of the Guadalquivir there is still the palace of Signor Miguel de Maniero, who is considered the prototype of the most famous lover in the world - Don Juan. </p><h2>  Tourist Memo </h2><p>  Reminder for those who come to Seville without a tour package: Alcazar Palace in Seville is located at Patio Banderas, s / n 41004, Sevilla, Espana. </p><p>  You can visit the complex of Alcazar palaces: </p><p>  In the period from October to March - from 9:30 to 18:00. <br>  In the period from April to September - from 9:39 to 20:00. <br>  Exit - an hour before the end of the working day of the Alcazar Palace (Seville).  Hours of the complex allow you to visit it with virtually no time limits. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  If you want to get to Alcazar from the railway station, you need to go out onto Avenida Kansas street, take bus number 28, get off at the last stop and walk to Alcazar. </p><p>  A simpler option is to book a tour to Spain from St. Petersburg, which includes a visit to Alcazar. </p>
