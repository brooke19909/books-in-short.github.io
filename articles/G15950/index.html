  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Scheme of movement of trains from Moscow stations</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  How many people daily get from Moscow to work and vice versa?  And how many representatives of our society go on a weekend out of town to the country?  You can be sure that any of these passengers have downloaded the phone (tablet) or printed a train flow diagram. </p><h2>  Demand for commuter trains </h2><p>  The popularity of this type of transport is explained by the fact that many residents of Moscow and the Moscow region can not afford a car, or do not want to stand for hours in traffic jams, especially since every year they only increase.  A few more obvious pluses of the electric train are its strict adherence to the schedule, flights run regularly, at short intervals. </p><p>  The traffic pattern in Moscow is no less than <span>the Moscow</span> metro (which is one of the ten largest metro in the world).  This fact is not at all surprising, because in our capital there are nine railway stations, and electric trains are constantly sent from each of them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dogbreedspicture.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The scheme of movement of trains" class="if uuid-2243634" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70335/2243634.jpg"></div><p>  Just in order to unload the passenger flow, the Ministry of Transport compiled separate routes and distributed them between stations, introduced the appropriate tariffs, and equipped it with all the necessary equipment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  South direction of electric trains </h2><p>  One of the most popular today is the Kursk direction.  The scheme of movement of trains from this station captures many cities of the Moscow region, and the daily passenger flow is approximately 140,000 people. </p><p>  The schedule here takes into account the tension of morning and evening rush hours, adding even more flights to these intervals.  Trains depart and arrive so often that any passenger can find the most convenient option for themselves.  The work of the station is in multitasking mode around the clock.  In less than ten minutes, a new flight appears at the station.  The only break at the Kursk station, which is fifteen minutes long, is the moment between the arrival of the last train on the current day and the departure of the first in the next hour of the day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.skyscrapercity.com" data-author=": Night City Dream, "><img itemprop="image" alt="train movement pattern" class="if uuid-2241711" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70335/2241711.jpg"></div><p>  This station is in demand not only for residents of the Moscow Region who come to the city on business from the region, but also for Muscovites who are more comfortable in getting to their office / factory / enterprise not by metro, but rather by a suburban train passing through many areas of Moscow. </p><h2>  The scheme of movement of trains </h2><p>  It often happens that it‚Äôs impossible to get on a train at one station, huge groups of people push each other into a carriage, which is called ‚Äúlike sprats in a bank,‚Äù and at another station it won‚Äôt stop.  This, to a greater extent, depends on the population of a particular town.  The most popular points among passengers on the Kursk direction electric trains are Kursky Station, Tsaritsyno, Tekstilshchiki, Podolsk.  Of course, at these stations the schedule is made taking into account such a high workload, and trains stop more often.  In addition to these stations, the train runs through Butovo, Scherbinka, Lvov, Stolbovaya, Chekhov, Serpukhov, Yasnogorsk, Tarusskaya.  Including express trains, you can easily get to Orel and Tula. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.rbth.com" data-author=":   /  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="The scheme of movement of trains" class="if uuid-2243345" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70335/2243345.jpg"></div><p>  Some stations, for example, Stolbovaya, Moscow Commodity Kurskaya, Kalanchevskaya, Tsaritsyno, Tekstilshchiki are interchange to the neighboring directions of Russian Railways or metro stations. </p><h2>  East direction of electric trains </h2><p>  Among residents of Moscow and Moscow Region, the movement pattern of the Kazan direction electric trains is no less popular.  The daily passenger flow is approximately equal to 330,000 people.  And at the Kazan station, which, of course, is the most popular point in this direction, 230 electric trains arrive and depart every day, 50 of which are Sputnik express trains, to Ramenskoye and Lyubertsy stations.  The second busiest here is a stop in Vykhino. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kazan station Moscow" class="if uuid-2243343" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70335/2243343.jpg"></div><p>  The traffic pattern of the Kazan direction, as well as the Kursk one, is characterized by a high intensity of flights arriving and departing from the terminal station every eight minutes.  From here you can get to the following cities near Moscow: Lyubertsy, Kurovskoye, Yegoryevsk, Shatura, Ramenskoye, Zhukovsky, Bronnitsy, Voskresensk, Lakes, Lukhovitsy, Kolomna, Cherusti.  By express train you can go to Ryazan. </p><h2>  Northeast direction of electric trains </h2><p>  Of course, considering this issue, one cannot fail to note the importance of the Yaroslavl station in the movement pattern of electric trains in Moscow and Moscow region.  It is located next to Kazan and Leningradsky, on Komsomolskaya Square, referred to as the "Square of three stations."  Here, the passenger flow is approximately 450,000 people per day!  This is many times more than on all other routes.  The maximum number of people moving in the Yaroslavl direction daily goes to the final stop of the route - Yaroslavl Station.  Ten ways which are given specifically for suburban trains.  Next in popularity are Mytishchi.  Next stop in the city of Pushkino.  The fourth place went to the Bolshevo platform, then there is a stop Podlipki-Dachny, Losinoostrovskaya, Perlovskaya. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Electric trains of Russia" class="if uuid-2243341" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70335/2243341.jpg"></div><p>  From the Yaroslavl station you can get to the cities of Alexandrov, Mytishchi, Pushkino, Sofrino, Khotkovo, Sergiev Posad, Krasnoarmeysk, Korolev, Ivanteyevka, Fryazino, Schelkovo, Monino. </p><p>  From the final stops, Kazan and Leningradsky stations, it‚Äôs convenient to go to the neighboring routes of Russian Railways, and from <span>the Moscow</span> Yaroslavskaya <span>platform</span> you will quickly find yourself at the Komsomolskaya station of the Moscow Metro. </p><h2>  And what about the suburban trains in St. Petersburg </h2><p>  There are not as many train stations in the northern capital of Russia as in Moscow.  There are only five of them: Moscow, Vitebsk, Finland and Baltic, Ladoga.  At the same time, the movement pattern of the electric trains of St. Petersburg, by its scale, practically does not differ from the Moscow one considered above. </p><div class="photo" data-original="triprussia.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian trains" class="if uuid-2243351" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70335/2243351.jpg"></div><p>  In total, the schedule of <span>suburban trains of</span> St. Petersburg totals 702 flights, 250 of them run daily, and the rest - according to the schedule.  The most popular queries on this topic in the Leningrad Region are the traffic patterns of the Finland Station and Moscow Train. </p><h2>  Finland Station in St. Petersburg </h2><p>  Located in the city center, at Lenin Square, house 6, is an important link in the life of the city, is part of the October Railway.  By the decision of the administration of the transport committee of St. Petersburg in 2010, Finland Station becomes the main transport hub, which includes all possible ground options for road and rail transport north-west. </p><p>  The passenger flow here is approximately 36,000 people per day.  At the moment, the station only receives and sends electric trains in the north-west and north-east directions: Vyborg, Irinovsk, Sosnovsk.  From here, regular flights can reach the following cities in the Leningrad Region: Zelenogorsk, Beloostrov, Vyborg (including the express train), Roshchino, Sovetskiy, Kirillovskoye, Sestroretsk, Kannelyarvi. </p><p>  The only express long-distance route is the Allegro Saint-Petersburg-Helsinki train. </p><h2>  The scheme of movement of trains of Moscow station </h2><p>  This station is located in the heart of St. Petersburg on Nevsky Prospekt (address: Vosstaniya Square, Building 2) and has its own unique history.  Being the exact double of the Leningradsky railway station in Moscow, it allows you to feel at home for Muscovites who have arrived here in the first few minutes.  Both buildings were designed by the court architects of Nicholas I - architects Ton and Zhelezevich.  Currently, the passenger terminal of the Moscow railway station is called <span>the St. Petersburg</span> Main <span>station</span> .  Sometimes, you can meet his old name - October. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Salon of an electric train" class="if uuid-2243317" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70335/2243317.jpg"></div><p>  Important directions of trains of this station are east, Moscow and south.
