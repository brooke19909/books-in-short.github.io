    <p>  We are constantly surrounded by many different radiation, which in one way or another have an effect on the body.  Scientists speak differently about the consequences of this phenomenon, although it is also worth noting the fact that manufacturers of household appliances and other electronics are constantly working to reduce the level of exposure. </p><p>  The greatest danger is radiation - radiation to some extent is not only dangerous, but also mysterious.  It is he who is credited with various properties for changing the characteristics of the body, most of which are negative.  The effect of radiation on the human body continues to be studied.  This is explained by the fact that various health problems or various deviations are attributed most often to <span>radioactive radiation.</span> </p><p>  The main danger is that it is invisible and can not be felt without special devices.  A person will not be able to feel that he is under irradiation until the effect of radiation on the human body begins to manifest itself fully. </p><p>  Features of exposure to humans </p><p>  It is conditionally possible to divide the effect of radiation on the human body into two types: </p><ul><li>  Somatic. </li><li>  Genetic. </li></ul><p>  In the first case, we are talking about direct bodily influence, i.e.  the effect of radiation on the human body is manifested in immediate changes and deviations.  However, radiation to one degree or another damages the <span>genetic apparatus,</span> which manifests itself in subsequent generations.  Some say that the second type of exposure is much more dangerous, and this causes a general deterioration in the health of the nation and society.  After all, each subsequent generation receives some genetic abnormalities, and they constantly accumulate like a snowball. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The manifestation of somatic effects </p><p>  At the very beginning, the <span>effect of radiation</span> on humans is manifested in the form of somatic effects.  There are several main types: </p><ul><li>  Radiation sickness. </li><li>  Leukemia. </li><li>  A variety of tumors. </li><li>  Local radiation injuries. </li></ul><p>  Radiation, acting on the cells of the human body, causes various chemical and physical processes.  The most dangerous in this case is beta radiation, since it has a strong penetrating property.  Alpha particles have a low density and very much destroy the mucous membrane.  As a result, the cells lose their integrity, ionization occurs, and this becomes the reason for the disruption of their normal functioning. </p><p>  Varieties of radiation sources in the environment </p><p>  A person receives most of the radiation naturally.  Avoid this completely impossible.  The sources include the sun, a variety of cosmic sources and so on, also on the surface of the Earth and in its crust there are many radioactive minerals. </p><p>  The effect of radiation on the human body occurs for three main reasons: </p><ul><li>  Inhalation of contaminated air. </li><li>  Eating contaminated food. </li><li>  Effects of radiation on open wounds. </li></ul><p>  Infection through inhalation of air containing radioactive isotopes is most dangerous, because as a result of ventilation of the lungs they quickly spread throughout the body.  However, in any of these cases, these substances enter the human blood after a few minutes.  If there was no more exposure, the concentration of hazardous substances is reduced after 15-20 days.  Although some types of isotopes live much longer. </p><p>  At the first stage, cell ionization occurs, which manifests itself in the form of <span>radiation sickness.</span>  Further, radiation provokes various chemical reactions involving proteins, various amino acids, water, etc. </p><p>  All this leads to extremely negative changes in the body, which depend on the duration and strength of exposure. </p>
