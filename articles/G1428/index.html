It is five kilometers from the village, which is the center of the resort, and twenty from the airport.  The coast along which it is located is called Ras Um El Sid.  This hotel is located in a very large area, which is difficult to get around even in a day.  It consists of one- and two-story houses scattered around a picturesque park, decorated in the style of an ‚Äúoriental fairy tale‚Äù.  All 250 rooms of the hotel are of one - standard - class.  The hotel is also called "Faraana Reef." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Faraana Sharm El Sheikh" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/295276.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Sharm El Sheikh, in the territory of which this hotel complex is located, is famous for its reefs with a huge variety of fantastically colored fish of the Red Sea.  And the beach of this hotel is interesting because lovers of snorkeling do not even need to buy excursions to various islands (although the local guides will lure you there).  Pontoon reefs are such that a few dozens of meters from the coast await you a whole underwater world of fairy tales.  It is not surprising that many foreign tourists prefer to go on vacation to the hotel "Club (or Reef) Faraana".  Sharm El Sheikh is far from always able to provide a shore so convenient for divers.  It may seem strange, but the entrance to the sea is very convenient for children - small, sand and no corals.  In addition, the bay is located so that there are virtually no winds - even in winter.  The only inconvenience is the shore is high, and you need to go down the stairs to the beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Faraana Sharm El Sheikh" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/295272.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Especially a lot of Italians are here - after all, the management of this hotel is also from a country where they sing ‚ÄúDolce Vita‚Äù.  The hotel is decorated in an oriental style - even with a hint of Ancient Egypt (the rooms are decorated in dark green tones, dull curtains create a pleasant twilight, and those rooms that look at the sea have huge terraces).  However, everything else - including animation - is exclusively Italian, with good dancers.  Many tourists from this country come here more than once.  Therefore, the kitchen here is appropriate.  The guests called it "Egyptian with an Italian bias."  A lot of pasta, pasta, the dishes themselves are very tasty, and the coffee is simply amazing. </p><p>  Club El Faraana (Sharm El Sheikh) has two restaurants.  One of them, located above the beach, specializes in grilling or barbecue.  You can only get here by appointment.  However, on the beach and by the pools (of which there are also two, and many admit that they are simply chic) ‚Äã‚Äãthere are bars where you can have a bite to eat or order a light lunch.  The hotel practices the all inclusive formula, and guests are mostly satisfied with the food.  A lot of fish, there is real crab meat, a variety of fruits, delicious desserts.  In short, a good, solid Egyptian Quartet is the Faraana Hotel, Sharm El Sheikh.  Therefore, not only Italian, but also our tourists come back here several times. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Egypt Sharm El Sheikh El Farahana" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/295273.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  The staff at this hotel is friendly, welcoming and not at all intrusive, which compares it favorably with many Egyptian resort hotels.  People come here just to relax - that is, indulge in sweet idleness.  Therefore, do not look for noisy parties, the opportunity to "anneal" and "come off to the fullest."  But the relaxation and homely, cozy atmosphere are practically provided for you.  Therefore, if you really need a good rest, and you want to really find out what a ‚Äúsweet life‚Äù is, then choose Egypt, Sharm El Sheikh, ‚ÄúEl Faraana Hotel‚Äù.  And that‚Äôs it. </p>
