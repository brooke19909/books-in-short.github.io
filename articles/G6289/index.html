    <h2>  Gadget </h2><p>  Quite the usual equipment for this gadget.  It is not unusual against the background of competitors.  Phone ‚ÄúVega Express‚Äù is sold with the following accessories: </p><ul><li>  2200 mAh <span>battery</span> . </li><li>  Modest entry-level headphones. </li><li>  Adapter cable for connecting to a computer (it is also used to charge the battery). </li><li>  Charger. </li></ul><p>  From the documentation, you can select a user manual, at the end of which there is also a warranty card.  But such accessories as a case, a protective film and a memory card will have to be purchased separately.  They do not come with a smartphone. </p><h2>  Gadget design </h2><p>  The impressive size of this smart phone.  Its length is 138.5 mm, its width is 71.9 mm, and its thickness is 10.7 mm.  His weight is 159 grams.  The diagonal of the display is 4.7 inches.  Despite the impressive dimensions, the smartphone itself fits perfectly in the hand, and managing it without the help of a second hand is not difficult.  Physical <span>control buttons are</span> displayed on the right edge of the device.  In turn, the wired ports are grouped on its upper side.  Touch control buttons, as expected, are located under the display.  The case of the gadget is made of plastic with a matte finish. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  CPU </h2><p>  A fairly efficient processor is installed in the ‚ÄúVega Express‚Äù.  Reviews regarding its performance once again convince.  To be more precise, we are talking about MT6582.  This is a quad-core solution, which in peak computing mode is able to operate at a clock frequency of 1.3 GHz.  Each of its modules is based on the most common A7 architecture.  Most everyday tasks on this silicon crystal will be solved without problems.  The only thing he certainly can not cope with is the most demanding toys of the latest generation, for example, Asphalt 7. </p><h2>  Graphics </h2><p>  The basis of the graphics subsystem in this smartphone is the MALI 400MP2 adapter.  Its performance is quite enough to solve most problems at the moment.  The display matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãmade using IPS technology, the resolution is 800 x 480, and the diagonal is 4.7 inches.  The density of points on its surface is far from the maximum, but still the quality of the picture is not satisfactory.  The only thing that causes a certain discontent in this case is the support of only two touches.  For some of the most demanding toys, this is clearly not enough.  The graphics subsystem of this smartphone will cope with everything else. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The main camera, very modest by today's standards, is installed in the ‚ÄúVega Express‚Äù phone.  Reviews of the inadequate quality of photos and videos obtained with its help are another confirmation of this.  It is based on a 5 megapixel sensor.  Also in the device are implemented such important options as autofocus and LED flash.  In daylight, photo quality is acceptable.  In turn, in the dark, achieving normal photo quality on this device is quite problematic.  The situation is the same with video recording.  With a good level of illumination, the <span>quality of the video is</span> not satisfactory, but this can not be said about the dark.  The situation is much better with the <span>front camera.</span>  She has a 2 megapixel sensor.  This allows you to make calls and get a fairly high-quality image in programs such as Skype. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  Very little installed RAM in the "Vega Express".  Reviews indicate its total volume of 512 MB, of which about 200 MB is allocated for the user's needs.  Of course, this is clearly not enough at the moment to run several applications at the same time.  But for 2-3 tasks this will be enough.  Only 4 GB is the capacity of the built-in drive.  Of these, about 2 GB is occupied by system software.  The rest is allocated to the user.  There is also a slot for installing an external drive, the maximum capacity of which can be 32 GB. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The capacity of the complete battery of this device is 2000 mA / h.  The diagonal of the screen of this gadget, as noted earlier, is 4.7 inches.  Also, a quad-core processor is integrated in the device, there are 2 slots for installing SIM cards.  As a result, you can stretch 4 days on one <span>battery charge</span> , but with the condition of maximum saving of battery life.  In reality, this indicator is 2-3 days with an average level of use of the device.  If you use it to the maximum, then this value will decrease to 12-14 hours. </p>

    <h2>  Software </h2><p>  The software basis of this smart phone is the OS from Google - Android.  In this case, we are talking about its slightly outdated modification - 4.2.  The usual set of utilities from Google is not in the boxed version of this smartphone.  They will have to be installed from the Play store.  Instead, there is a set of similar applications from Yandex.  The rest of the kit is familiar - standard programs (calculator, calendar, etc.) and social services.  In the latter case, we are talking about Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.  But their domestic counterparts will have to be installed from the previously mentioned Play-market. </p><h2>  Interface set </h2><p>  A good set of communications boasts a smartphone ‚ÄúVega Express‚Äù.  Testimonials indicate support for the most common <span>means of transmitting information.</span>  Among them are the following: </p><ul><li>  ZhPS / GLONASS module.  Navigation through two satellite systems is supported immediately.  This allows you to use your smartphone as a full-fledged navigator. </li><li>  Wi-Fi is the ideal solution for those cases when you need to download an impressive amount of data from the global web to your smartphone. </li><li>  Bluetooth is well suited for exchanging information with similar mobile devices in a small amount. </li><li>  MicroUSB port allows you to connect to a computer.  Also, using it, the battery is charged. </li><li>  The 3.5 mm jack allows you to output sound from this smartphone to an external speaker system. </li></ul><h2>  The opinion of the owners of this smart phone and experts </h2><p>  ‚ÄúVega Express‚Äù turned out to be a fairly balanced phone.  Its disadvantages are a small amount of RAM and a relatively weak camera.  But these disadvantages are leveled by the price, which today is about 5000 rubles.  Therefore, to date, he simply has no competitors.  This converges both experts and satisfied owners of the gadget. </p>

    <h2>  Total </h2><p>  An excellent entry-level smartphone is the ‚ÄúVega Express‚Äù.  Reviews about him once again convince.  It is difficult to find a device with a diagonal of 4.7 inches, a quad-core processor and a cost of about 5,000 rubles.  This is an ideal solution for those cases when you need an inexpensive, but productive and functional device. </p>
