Booking and other booking services indicate a great demand for this type of vacation.  This is due to the fact that this institution stands out from other Greek hotels.  This applies not only to the quality of services, but also to the relatively low price.  In addition, tourists note the fact that photographs of rooms presented in brochures and on booking services are fully true. </p><p>  Speaking about the location of the hotel, it is worth noting that it is quite remote.  To the nearest spa center walk at least 20 minutes (which is not very comfortable in the heat), and by bus or taxi it is quite expensive.  Nevertheless, if you like peace and quiet, then this option is ideal for you.  Here you can fully enjoy the sea.  And the developed infrastructure of the hotel itself completely compensates for its remoteness from urban civilization. </p><p>  Resort Dessole Mirabello Beach Village 5 * (Greece) offers you to stay in the rooms of the main multi-storey building or in a bungalow.  It is worth noting the classic restrained interior, as well as the predominance of natural decor elements.  The only drawback is the bathroom.  Due to poor ventilation and constant dampness, the decoration suffered, and therefore it is worth replacing the tile. </p><p>  Special attention at this hotel is given to food, which is carried out on an all-inclusive basis.  In the morning, at lunch, and also in the evening, guests are invited to the main dining room, which offers a huge selection of delicious dishes.  If you feel hungry throughout the day, you can grab a bite to eat with light snacks and enjoy a refreshing drink.  Ice cream lovers will appreciate the unlimited access to this delicacy in the hotel bars. </p><p>  The hotel has a developed infrastructure, which fully compensates for the distance from the resort center.  So, there are restaurants, shops and even their own Orthodox chapel.  Guests are given the opportunity to exchange currency without leaving the hotel.  In addition, you can pay for received services with a plastic card.  Despite the fact that the territory is quite small, there are a lot of beautiful places for walking. </p><p>  Thus, we can say that the resort Dessole Mirabello Beach Village 5 * is a universal vacation option for single travelers, groups of friends and large families.  All conditions are created here for those who want to fully enjoy the sea and stay away from the bustle of the city.  If you like bright entertainment, then you also will not have to be bored at this hotel. </p>
