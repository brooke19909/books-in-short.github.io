And next to them, new original buildings are being erected, which interpret the architectural and historical heritage of the past and the latest methods of construction of structures. </p><h2>  The historical center of Kazan </h2><p>  The capital of Tatarstan has a 1000-year history, which is embodied in various monuments of monumental art.  The architecture of the city of Kazan in the historical center is a combination of many styles and directions over several hundred years.  The construction of the center and the Old Tatar settlement was preserved very well: apartment buildings and old mansions of wealthy merchants adorn the streets.  Classicism, empire and its types, modern - all these areas relate to buildings of the 18-20 centuries, which harmoniously fit into the architectural palette of Kazan. </p>

Circus, Sports Palace, Conservatory, River Station, Tatar Academic Theater - and this is an incomplete list of buildings of this era. </p><p>  One of the brightest representatives of buildings built in Soviet times is the Kazan Circus, which is popularly called the "Flying Saucer".  It really resembles an alien ship with a diameter of 65 m. The building was built in 1967 instead of a burnt wooden circus on the Black Lake and became famous for its uniqueness: the building has no internal supports, but is a reinforced concrete monolith 23 m high (architects M. Khairullin and G. Pichuev).  In 1973, it was recognized as an architectural monument. </p>

The implementation of all urban development plans was led by the Department of Architecture and Urban Planning (Kazan). </p><p>  In recent decades, the city has been constantly updated.  Not all modern buildings are perceived unambiguously by residents and visitors.

    <p>  The style of this building is defined by experts as a Beaux Arts, which is a mixture of French Baroque and Renaissance.  Some elements of Empire and classicism are also included, and the central dome is a bit like Petit Palais in Paris.

    <p>  But, unfortunately, the temple recently suffered a sad fate: on April 10, 2017, a fire occurred in the building, in which most of it suffered.  The owners of the building, who inherited the building after the death of its builder, promise to eliminate the consequences of the fire. </p><h2>  Puppet Theater "Ekiyat" </h2><p>  One of the new representatives of Kazan architecture is the building of the Kazan Theater "Ekiyat", made in the style of a Disneyland fairytale castle.  Its appearance is as if copied from a magic book: figures of fairy-tale characters adorn the facade, and the scene is made in the form of a glass palace.  Evening lighting gives it an almost medieval look. </p><p>  The interiors are also made with fabulous taste: on the floors with chess coloring there are benches in the form of thrones, where little spectators like to play.  The theater was built in 2002 and has 2 auditoriums: for 250 and 100 seats.  A puppet theater is located right in the center of the city. </p>
