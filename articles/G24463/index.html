    <p>  <strong>Basic, he's classic</strong> </p><p>  This method is very simple not only in development, but also in further implementation.  It will require yarn, two knitting needles and the thumb and forefinger of the left hand. </p><p>  The process itself is as follows.  Unwinding a small piece of thread from the yarn, it is placed in the middle of the palm.  After that, the thread reaching for the skein is wrapped around the thumb so that it extends by the hand between the thumb and forefinger.  Next, the thread is pulled by the <span>index finger</span> and displayed on the palm segment.  The starting position for the loop set is ready. </p><p>  Taking the knitting needles tightly pressed to each other in the right hand, they are introduced from the inside into the loop at the thumb, after which they are looped at the index finger and brought out again through the loop at the thumb.  Forming a loop is quite simple: for this, the knitting needles are gently pulled towards themselves, and the thread, sliding, does it on its own.  To gain the required number of loops, the procedure should be repeated as much as necessary. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Ways to set loops for 2 knitting needles are very popular, because at the end of the process of their formation, one knitting needle is removed, and air loops are created on the remaining one, ready for knitting. </p><p>  <strong>Classic double start loop</strong> </p><p>  It should be noted that the methods for assembling loops on knitting needles do not differ too much from each other.  An example is this. </p><p>  The starting position is a loop over the index finger and <span>thumb of the</span> left hand.  Next, the knitting needles, clasped in the right hand, are pulled under the thread stretched between the fingers and pulled to the one located at the thumb, forming a loop into which the knitting needles are brought from below.  Then they should be introduced from the outside into the loop obtained at the index finger and, pulling towards yourself, tighten the resulting two loops.  Further, the set is carried out in the same way as in the classical method. </p><p>  <strong>Heritage of Italy</strong> </p><p>  The ways to set loops on knitting needles are diverse, and they serve to knit different elements. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="looping methods" class="if" height="209" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11457/235348.jpg" width="320"></div>  The Italian method is best for forming a 2 by 2 gum.

    <p>  It begins with a simple classic loop.  After that, they immediately begin to type in a pair.  So, for the front pair, you need to bring the knitting needles under the thread going to the thumb, and then under the thread going to the index finger, and tighten the movement ‚Äútowards you‚Äù.  Two loops should appear on the knitting needles at once.  Further (to form the wrong side), first the knitting needles are placed under the thread going to the index finger, and then under the thread directed to the thumb.  Once again, two strong loops form on themselves. </p><p>  <strong>Aerial english</strong> </p><p>  The ways of knitting stitches for knitting needles vary by country.  And the English needlewomen proposed their simple method, which, however, cannot be considered the main one.  It aims to add to the already ongoing knitting with knitting needles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting loops" class="if" height="444" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11457/235347.jpg" width="592"></div>

    <p>  So, in the place where you need to add a few loops, the required number of curls are applied to the knitting needle with simple circular movements, which are subsequently knitted.  It is worth noting that in this case, the loops are added to the work only on the knitting needle located in the right hand (working). </p><p>  That's how simple it is to carry out the formation of the initial row during the creation of a knitted masterpiece. </p>
