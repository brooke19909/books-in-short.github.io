Great personalities - historical figures?  Or are the people historical masses?  Probably both.  Some historical figures of Russia and the world, who have decided the fate of thousands and millions of people, will be described in the article. </p><h2>  History and Personality </h2><p>  The theme of the role of an individual outstanding person in history has been of concern to thinkers for several centuries, from the moment that historical philosophy began to develop.  The names of historical figures, such as Napoleon, Columbus, Washington, Macedonian, are known around the world. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Historical figures" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40448/1254598.jpg" width="600"></div>  These people, who went down in history as great politicians, scientists, geographers, made a huge contribution to the development of mankind.  They developed or completely broke the traditional notions of life.  On their example, the theoretical propositions that a <span>person, strong</span> and outstanding, are the driving force of history are illustrated.  There are even statements by philosophers that history is nothing more than a description of the life of great personalities.

    <h2>  Foreign prominent figures </h2><p>  The historical figures of Europe are primarily those people in whose hands power was concentrated.  These are individuals who sought to conquer the world.  One of the first world-famous conquerors was Julius Caesar.  Briefly describing his achievements, it is necessary to note his important role in expanding the borders of the Roman Empire (to Caesar of the <span>Roman Republic),</span> democratic reforms (for example, supporting old soldiers, bringing ordinary people to power), as well as managerial, military and writing abilities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Catherine II the Great" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40448/1254984.jpg" width="484"></div>

All of them left their heavy mark on history. </p><h2>  Prominent figures of Russia </h2><p>  Ivan the Terrible, Alexander Nevsky, Peter I, Catherine II the Great, Nicholas I - individuals who had a great influence on the development of Russia.  They were in power at crucial historical moments.  These and some other outstanding historical figures of Russia participated in the liberation wars, defended the interests of the country, and modernized the existing foundations. </p><h2>  Great figures of Kievan Rus </h2><p>  Alexander Nevsky was a fighter for the inviolability of Russian lands, a true Orthodox man, a brave warrior.  The Neva battle, in which Alexander proved himself to be a great strategist, is an important event in the history of the country.  She showed the strength and courage of the Russian people.  <span>Alexander Nevsky (the Battle of Neva is a</span> confirmation of this) managed to unite the Novgorod and Ladoga squads to repel the onslaught of the Swedes in 1240, thereby preventing the expansion of Catholicism. </p>

    <p>  The leaders of the Second Militia against Western intervention during the Troubles in Russia - Dmitry Pozharsky and Kuzma Minin - also played an important role in the history of the country.  They liberated Russia from foreigners, did not allow the destruction of the country and the overthrow of Orthodoxy. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Great figures of the Russian Empire </h2><p>  Outstanding political figures of Russia are Peter and Catherine.  Peter is best known as a reformer and conqueror.  Under him, the Russian Empire became one of the leading world powers.  The borders of the state expanded: there was access to the Baltic, Pacific Ocean, and the Caspian.  Peter's domestic policy is also fruitful.  He changed the army, created a navy.  Peter (and after him Catherine II the Great) paid great attention to the enlightenment of the country. </p><p>  Catherine contributed to the opening of educational institutions, research bases, cultural centers.  She continued Peter's policy of affirming Russia's position in the world.  However, it was difficult for ordinary people to live hard under the great rulers, when wars were fought, taxes increased, and enslavement intensified.  Returning to the question of who creates history, we can answer that these were outstanding personalities in power and disposing of the masses to achieve economic and political goals. </p><h2>  Famous historical figures of the XX century </h2><p>  The turning point in the history of many countries of the world, a difficult and at the same time stellar century, brought to the stage of world fame such politicians as Lenin, Thatcher, Churchill, Stalin, Roosevelt, Hitler and others. Lenin, who was called the leader, destroyed the whole empire and built the first state of socialism on the planet.  There is no single view of his personality and activity.  What is the damage caused by his activities?  Of course, some of his reforms and transformations have beneficially affected society and the country.  This is, first and foremost, the eradication of social division of society, the introduction of universal accessible education and medicine. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Joseph Stalin, for example, has long been considered the idol of the entire population of the Union.  Stalin, under whose rule the country won the Great Military Victory, was a tough man.  Only after the fall of the cult of personality did the archives compromising it begin to open.  Joseph Stalin conducted a harsh policy, did not take into account the opinions of other people, repressed them, carried out collectivizing people exhausting and five-year plans, but brought the country to the level of a superpower. </p><h2>  Prominent Russian generals </h2><p>  In the <span>history of Russia</span> there were many difficult moments - dangerous and bloody wars.  The fate of the country was many times in the hands of military commanders, their strategic skills and foresight.  Significant pages of history are associated with the military activities of A. V. Suvorov, M. I. Kutuzov, P. S. Nakhimov, A. A. Brusilov, G. K. Zhukov and other generals and heroes, to whom the population owes a peaceful sky, and the country - won prestige. </p><p>  <span>The greatest commander</span> is considered Suvorov A.V., who brilliantly conducted the Polish, Turkish, and, at the end of his life, the Italian campaign.  With his talent and a new vision of war, he conquered many European and Asian cities.  One of Suvorov‚Äôs most famous campaigns is considered to be the Swiss, where, faced with the irresponsibility of the Austrian army, adverse conditions and the difficult situation of the soldiers, he was able to win a great victory. </p>

    <p>  Kutuzov M.I. participated in many military operations, but army glory brought him worldwide fame during the Patriotic War with France.  After not entirely successful battles with the French army, Kutuzov retreated, but his goal was to exhaust the French and drive them to the west.  Kutuzov‚Äôs strategic plan was a success, and the empire won. </p><p>  The personality of G.K. Zhukov is one of the most controversial among iconic historical figures.  Like many strong personalities, they like to criticize Zhukov, give an assessment of his actions, and refute his merits.  Unconditionally, he is the greatest historical figure.  During the Great Patriotic War, he was sent to the places of the greatest enemy onslaught.  His battle methods, tough and decisive, worked.  The first victory in the war was won by troops near Yelnya, where Zhukov commanded.  It was the first marshal who owned the battle plan on the Kursk, according to which the troops should purposefully defend and retreat, and then suddenly attack.  This strategic plan worked - a victory was won that influenced the further course of the war.  It was obtained by the work of brilliant military leaders, the courage of officers and soldiers.  G. Zhukov was distinguished by unique strategies, attention to soldiers, special requirements for reconnaissance, and careful planning of battles. </p><h2>  Prominent Russian scientists </h2><p>  The most famous political figures of Russia are described above.  However, not only talented politicians and diplomats are rich in Russian land.  The people who made the country move forward in science are scientists.  The fruits of the intellectual works of Russian scientists are used in many countries of the world.  P.N. Yablochkov created an electric bulb, V.K. Zvorykin - an electron microscope, and also organized television broadcasting, S.P. Korolev designed the world's first ballistic missile, a spaceship and the first artificial Earth satellite. </p>

    <p>  A whole scientific direction was created by A.P. Vinogradov - this is the geochemistry of isotopes.  Worked for the good of the country I.V. Kurchatov, who built the first nuclear power plant.  His team created the atomic bomb. </p><p>  The works of prominent medical scientists can also be noted.  M. A. Novinsky became the founder of experimental oncology.  S. S. Yudin was the first to speak about the possibility of blood transfusion of people who had suddenly passed away.  S. S. Brukhonenko became the creator of the apparatus for cardiopulmonary bypass.  The outstanding Russian anatomist N. I. Pirogov first compiled an atlas on anatomy, the first in the country to apply anesthesia. </p><h2>  Great cultural figures </h2><p>  Culture develops along with humanity, therefore, undoubtedly, representatives of enlightenment are also creators of history.  Honor and respect are Russian artists, writers, poets, artists, directors and other cultural figures.  Of the artists it is necessary to note the geniuses of Russian iconography: Andrei Rublev, <span>Theophanes the Greek</span> and Dionysius.  The images in their works are magnificent and truthful.  Talented landscape painters were I.K. Aivazovsky, I.I. Shishkin, A.K. Savrasov.  <span>Great portrait painters:</span> S. S. Schukin, V. A. Tropinin, A. P. Bryullov, V. A. Serov and others. </p>
