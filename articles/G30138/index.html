    <p>  Sberbank investment gold coins are in demand for a reason.  The popularity of the asset is due to a set of parameters.  Gold currency units are a unique product that can not only be easily purchased, but also sold with ease.  Metal accounts in this aspect do not even compare.  Coins are easily stored, transported if necessary.  During the crisis, precious metals increase in price, therefore, the value of the coins themselves increases.  Coins can be confined to the category of eternal values, since the longer they are stored, the higher their value will be.  It is more profitable to invest in monetary units for a long period of time - at least 10-15 years. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  A bit of history </h2>

    <p>  Gold in the past has always been the most common means of settlement.  Ingots were used to pay for all sorts of goods and services.  Since 1983, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãminting gold coins in honor of an important event in royal families or in history has been actively supported by most people.  Despite the fact that the first coins made of ‚Äúsolar metal‚Äù did not belong to the category of means of payment, they were of high value and were considered commemorative tokens.  Modern gold coins of Sberbank have no artistic value, but they are recognized as an excellent tool for investment.  For the first time, <span>precious metal</span> for investment began to be used in the 20th century.  The first batch of banknotes made of gold was introduced on the territory of the USSR in the 1970s, then in honor of the Olympics, organized in the 80s.  The action was held only once, and people who were lucky enough to buy coins in 1978, today are more than wealthy. </p><h2>  Chasing coins today </h2>

The resumption of the issue of gold banknotes began during the perestroika period.  Banknotes were made not only of gold and silver, but also of palladium and platinum.  Today, only basic precious metals are used in coinage.  Sberbank gold coins are not the only thing that a financial institution offers today.  In bank directories you can find a huge number of foreign coins, which are not only more expensive, but also incredibly high quality.  In recent decades, Russian <span>mints: Moscow</span> and St. Petersburg have been involved in asset issuance. </p><h2>  The most bought coins in Sberbank </h2><p>  In the catalog of Sberbank you can find a large number of coins made of gold and silver, items made of palladium and platinum have not been produced since 1995.

    <p>  Sberbank of Russia issues two gold coins.  These are commemorative signs and investment.  The main difference between the two types of monetary units is not only the quality of coinage, but also is determined by the complexity of the work.  The take-off in many parameters determines not only the capabilities of the asset itself, but also the purpose of its acquisition.  The quality of coinage is much higher than investment.  Coins are more beautiful, have a bright characteristic shine.  Do not touch them with your fingers, as there may be greasy marks that are problematic to remove.  The gold <span>coin "George the Victorious"</span> (Sberbank) is not so sensitive to touch. </p><h2>  Commemorative Gold Assets </h2>

    <p>  Commemorative banknotes are quite complicated in execution.  They are released in very limited editions.  They are characterized by a unique reverse design and are often performed with a non-standard form.  There are rectangular, triangular items and coins in the shape of a heart.  The surface of banknotes is predominantly mirrored, there is a complex pattern and clear small details.  Coins are of great value not so much for investors as for numismatists.  When buying, it is customary to charge VAT.  The tax is not taken into account when Sberbank commemorative gold and <span>silver coins are</span> returned to the financial institution.  For capital accumulation, this category of products is unprofitable. </p><h2>  Investment coins </h2>

    <p>  Gold investment coins can easily provide material well-being for many years.  They are issued in wide runs and have a simple design.  The reverse design is not intricate.  The surface of the products can be either matte or shiny, the pattern may not be characterized by high accuracy.  Mechanical damage is allowed.  Gold investment coins of Sberbank of Russia are not taxed.  Coins with the status of ‚Äúinvestment‚Äù are a kind of analogue of gold options, bullion, futures, and anonymized metal accounts.  Coins are available for purchase not only in Sberbank, but also from individuals, in commercial financial institutions or in private companies.  When planning an asset purchase, you should expect its value to be close to the value of a precious metal in the world market.  Collaboration is better with trusted agencies, as fraud is very common. </p>
