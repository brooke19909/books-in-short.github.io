    <h2>  History of Bukhara Emirate </h2><p>  The founder of administrative education was Mohammed Rahimbiy.  After his death, power passed to his uncle Daniyalby.  However, he was a weak ruler, which caused discontent among the townspeople.  In 1784, an uprising began.  As a result, power passed to the son of Daniyalbiy Shahmurad.  The new ruler began by eliminating two influential and corrupt dignitaries - Nizamuddin-kazikalona and Davlat-kushbegi.  They were killed in front of the courtiers.  After that, Shahmurad handed over a letter to the citizens, according to which they were exempted from a number of taxes.  Instead, a fee was established to support the army in case of war.  In 1785, monetary reform began, encompassing the entire Bukhara emirate.  The coins were of two types: full silver and standardized gold.  Shahmurad began to personally lead the judicial department.  During the years of his reign, he returned the left bank of the Amu Darya with Merv and Balkh.  In 1786, Shahmurad suppressed unrest in the Kermine district, made successful trips to Khojent and Shakhrisabz.  In addition, the war with Timur Shah (the Afghan ruler) was successful.  Shahmurad managed to save the southern part of Turkestan, where Tajiks lived. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Feudal warfare </h2><p>  After receiving the throne, the emir Khaidar (the son of Shahmurad) began mass uprisings and feuds.  In 1800, unrest began among the Turkmen of Merva.  Soon a war broke out with Kokand, during which Haidar managed to save Uratyube.  The political system of the country during his reign was presented as a centralized monarchy, approaching absolutism.  Haidar's bureaucratic apparatus consisted of 4 thousand people.  Significantly increased the number of troops.  It totaled 12 thousand people. </p><h2>  Reign of Nasrullah </h2><p>  The son of Haidar received power almost unhindered - Mir Umar and Mir Hussein, his older brothers, were killed.  Supported by the clergy and the army, Nasrullah began a tough fight against fragmentation, trying to curb the nobility.  During the first month of his stay on the throne, he executed 50-100 people.  daily.  The new ruler sought to unite the regions of which the Bukhara emirate nominally consisted.  In the administration of the viloyats, they were engaged in rootless people who were completely indebted to him.  The conquest of the Kokand Khanate of the Bukhara Emirate and the Khiva Khanate had a negative effect on domestic politics and the life of the population.  The wars during the reign of Nasrullah were almost continuous.  The Khiva Khanate and the Bukhara Emirate fought for a number of border territories. </p><h2>  The offensive of the Red Army </h2><p>  As a result of hostilities, the Bukhara emirate joined Russia.  The year 1868 was a turning point in the existence of the territory.  At that time, the ruler was Muzaffar.  In March, he declared war on Russia.  However, his army was defeated on May 2 by a detachment of General Kaufman.  Later, the Russian army entered Samarkand.  But this was not the official accession of the Bukhara emirate to Russia.  The year 1873 was marked by the assignment of protectorate status to the territory controlled by the Red Army.  Dependence increased significantly during the reign of Abdulahad.  The last to possess power was Sayyid Alim Khan.  He was ruler until the Bolsheviks arrived in 1920, since the Bukhara emirate had already joined the Russian Federation as a result of the operation of the Red Army. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="accession of the Bukhara emirate to Russia year" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1243398.jpg" width="350"></div>

He possessed almost unlimited power.  Kushbegi was in charge of collecting taxes.  He was the chief vizier and managed the affairs of the country, corresponded with the local Beks, and also led the administrative apparatus.  Daily kushbegi personally reported to the ruler about the situation in the country.  The chief vizier appointed all officials except the highest. </p><h2>  The social structure of the Bukhara emirate </h2><p>  The ruling class was divided into officials of the clergy - ulam and the secular rank - amaldars.  The first included scientists - lawyers, theologians, teachers of madrassas and others.  Secular persons of the rank were transferred by the emir, and representatives of the spiritual class were elevated to one or another rank or rank.  The first was 15, the second - 4. The Beks were subordinated to sofas, kurbashi, yasaulbashi and rais.  Most of the population was represented by the <span>taxable estate.</span>  It was called fukara.  The ruling class was the land-feudal nobility.  It was called a sarkard or navkar under local rulers.  During the Bukhara sovereignty it was called amaldar or sipahi.  In addition to the two main classes, there was a third.  He was represented by people who were exempt from duties and taxes.  This social stratum was quite numerous.  It included imams, mullahs, mirza, mudarris and others.  In the upper reaches of the Panj, the population was divided into two classes: the ruling class and taxes.  The lower category of the former was navkar (chakar).  They were elected or appointed by the Shah or the world from people who had military or administrative skills.  The ruler ruled the country in accordance with Sharia rules and customary law.  Under him there were several dignitaries, each of whom was in charge of a specific branch of government. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Taxes and fees </h2><p>  Each year, the beks deposited a certain amount into the treasury and sent a set amount of gifts.  Among them were carpets, bathrobes, horses.  After that, each Bek became an independent ruler in his district.  At the lowest level in the administration were aksakals.  They performed police duties.  The beks did not receive any money from the emir and had to independently maintain their administration on the funds remaining from the taxes of the population after paying money to the treasury.  A number of taxes have been set for local residents.  In particular, they paid in kind a herage, which amounted to 1/10 of the harvest, money tanap from gardens and gardens, as well as zyak, which amounted to 2.5% of the price of goods.  Nomads were allowed to pay the latter in kind.  The tax for them was 1/40 of the livestock (except for cattle and horses). </p><h2>  Administrative territorial structure </h2><p>  The Bukhara emirate, the photo of the capital of which is presented in the article, was divided into beks.  In them, the heads of administrations were either relatives of the ruler of the country, or persons who enjoyed his special trust.  Beksty were divided into amlyakdarnosti, fogs, etc. The Bukhara emirate in the 19th century included autonomous shahs.  These, for example, included Darvaz, Karategin, who were independent and ruled by local rulers.  On the West.  Pamir there were 4 shahs.  Each of them was divided into administrative territories - a garden or a panja.  Each of them was headed by an aksakal.  The lowest administrative rank was arbab (headman).  As a rule, he was alone in the village. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="during the war of Russia against the Bukhara emirate" class="if" height="299" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1243399.jpg" width="448"></div>

    <h2>  Household </h2><p>  The main occupations of the population were cattle breeding and agriculture.  Most of the population consisted of settled people.  An agricultural community was formed from them.  There were many nomadic and semi-nomadic groups in the Bukhara emirate.  They also cultivated areas near their winter camps.  In most of the territory, the soil was fertile.  There were sandy loam forest and <span>loesslike clays.</span>  With good irrigation, this soil gives a large crop.  Summer is hot and dry throughout the country.  In this regard, it was necessary to arrange artificial irrigation systems.  This, in turn, involved the installation of complex and large structures.  If there was enough moisture, the agricultural community in the Bukhara emirate could cultivate the entire territory suitable for this.  In fact, less than 10% was processed.  Moreover, as a rule, such places were located near water sources.  All running water, except Vakhta, Surkhan, Amu-Darya and Kafirnigan, was used for irrigation in full.  On these rivers, the installation of irrigation facilities was required, which was unavailable to individuals, and even to entire villages.  Therefore, their waters for agriculture were used to a small extent. </p><h2>  The culture </h2><p>  On irrigated fields were cultivated: </p><ul><li>  Alfalfa. </li><li>  Cotton. </li><li>  Tobacco. </li><li>  Fig. </li><li>  Wheat. </li><li>  Legumes </li><li>  Millet. </li><li>  Barley. </li><li>  Linen. </li><li>  Sesame. </li><li>  Madder. </li><li>  Poppy. </li><li>  Hemp, etc. </li></ul><p>  Cotton was one of the most important agricultural products.  Its production reached 1.5 million pounds.  Of this volume, more than half was shipped to Russia.  Since some crops matured quickly due to high temperatures in the spring and summer, the fields were sometimes sown again with legumes and other plants.  Rice was cultivated only in areas rich in moisture. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="agricultural community in the Bukhara emirate" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1243400.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Gardens and gardens </h2><p>  They were a significant help to the local population.  Varieties of grapes, quince, walnuts, apricots, watermelons, plums, melons, and sometimes pears and apples were grown in gardens and orchards.  <span>Wine berry</span> and mulberry were also cultivated.  The latter provided in the mountainous regions cheap, and in some cases exceptional food in the form of ground and dried berries.  In addition, cabbage, carrots, onions, cucumbers, peppers, radishes, beets and other vegetables were grown in the gardens. </p><h2>  Cattle breeding </h2><p>  It was quite well developed, but not the same in different places.  In the plains and oases, where a predominantly settled population is present, cattle breeding was not widespread.  The animals were raised mainly by Uzbeks, Turkmens, Kyrgyz - nomadic peoples.  They settled on the western steppes.  Karakul sheep and camels were bred here.  Cattle breeding in the eastern mountainous areas was well developed.  In particular, pastures were located in the valleys of the Alai and Gissar ranges, in Darvaz and other areas.  The population raised sheep, horses, goats and other cattle.  Thanks to these territories, the Bukhara emirate was supplied with pack and slaughter animals.  The main markets were the cities of Karshi and Guzar.  Merchants from the flat territories flocked here.  In the past, the Bukhara emirate was famous for its thoroughbred and beautiful horses (karabairs, argamaks, etc.). </p><h2>  Industry </h2><p>  Bukhara Emirate is an agrarian country.  There were no large factories and plants.  All products were produced on simple machines or manually.  The first place in the industry was occupied by the cotton industry.  Local cotton was processed into calico, cheat and other materials.  They dressed almost everything except the representatives of the elites, the population.  Silk and semi-silk fabrics were a popular material.  Wool was used mainly by nomads.  Other developed industrial sectors include the manufacture of saddles, leathers, shoes, pottery and metal utensils, metalwork and cast iron products, harnesses, vegetable oils and dyeing. </p><h2>  Trade </h2><p>  The Bukhara emirate occupied a rather convenient geographical position.  This favorably affected foreign trade.  Merchants contacted the European part of Russia partially along the old caravan route through Orenburg and Kazalinsk.  The main means of communication was the railway through Astrakhan and Uzun-Ada.  Goods worth 12 million rubles were exported to Russia, while goods were imported - by 10. Zyakot is levied on imported products (2.5% of the cost).  5% was paid from exported goods if the trader was a citizen of Bukhara or another country, and 2.5% if he was Russian. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="annexation of the Bukhara emirate to Russia" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1243401.jpg" width="202"></div>

    <h2>  Flag </h2><p>  It depicted the state symbols of the Bukhara emirate.  The flag was a rectangular panel of light green color.  Along its shaft in Arabic letters the name of the emir is displayed in golden letters, and along the free edge is a shahada (evidence of belonging to faith in Allah).  Between these inscriptions was a crescent and a star (five-pointed).  They were above the "hand of Fatima" - a protective amulet.  The border of the flag was orange with a black ornament.  The shaft is painted green; a golden crescent moon was present at the top. </p><h2>  Marks of Excellence </h2><p>  For the first time, the orders of the Bukhara emirate were introduced after obtaining protectorate status.  This significant event provoked a number of significant changes in the internal life of the country.  In particular, a merit reward system has been introduced.  The first distinction was the "Order of Noble Bukhara."  It was established by Muzafar-en-Din in 1881.  By 1882, some officers of the local army possessed the order.  By 1893, it was divided into 8 degrees.  In the same year it was updated.  In accordance with the award, a ribbon and a badge were introduced.  Before one of the emir‚Äôs trips, a whole stock of orders was made.  During his journey, he gave out more than 150 stars.  At the same time, according to sources, their owners could become a variety of individuals - from carriers of the imperial family to journalists.  After a while, the ruler began to distribute the order to his subjects.  By the beginning of the 20th century, it was difficult to find an official, a bai, an officer in Bukhara, who would not have a star on his robe.  In addition, the award was often given to the Russians.  The order was also received by merchants who conducted trade with Bukhara.  To do this, it was enough to make a small offering to a certain official.  It is worth saying that the emir himself never called the order a star.  Although this definition was known to him.  The second order was established by Abdalahad in late 1890.  He looked like a star, had a ribbon and a sign.  It was called the ‚ÄúSign of the Crown of the State of Bukhara‚Äù.  In 1898, another award was established - a tribute to the memory of Alexander III.  It was called "Iskander Salis" ("The Sun of Alexander").  This order was awarded only to Russian high-ranking officials.  It was made of gold in the form of a star with 8 rays with an ornament.  In the center was a circle, inside of which 4 diamonds were placed, located in the shape of a triangle, which meant the letter "A".  In a small circle beneath it was the number III.  She was also surrounded by diamonds.  The orders of the Emirate of Bukhara were dated according to the Hijra (Muslim calendar).  Production was carried out according to special templates.  The mint was engaged in <span>coinage.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="state symbols of the Bukhara emirate" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1243402.jpg" width="246"></div>

    <h2>  Message paths </h2><p> In Bukhara emirate, wheeled roads were not very common.  At the same time, those that were available were mainly located in the northwestern and northern sides of the country.  Wheel communication was carried out on arbs.  They were carts on 2 high wheels with wide travel.  Arba was perfectly adapted to bad roads.  Movement and transportation of goods was carried out by caravan routes using camels.  For driving through the mountains, pack horses and donkeys were used.  The khanate was divided by the Hissar Range.  To the north-west and north of it, transportation and communication were carried out mainly on arbahs and partially on packs, and to the south - only in pack mode.  The latter is mainly due to the low cultural development of the area on the one hand and poor roads on the other.  Almost all the main routes began from Bukhara.  They served not only for internal communication, but also for communication with neighboring countries.  The shortest road to Amu-Darya goes to Kelif via Jam.  The message is carried out on arbs.  There is a ferry near Kelif.  Here the channel of the Amu Darya is not wide.  However, in this place there is great depth and high speed of the current.  Communication was also carried out by crossing the Shir-Oba and Chushka-Guzar.  These paths lead to Kabul, Mazar-e-Sheriff and Balkh.  In addition, you could cross the river on the ships of the flotilla.  It consisted of 2 steamboats and the same number of iron barges.  The latter raised to 10 thousand pounds of cargo.  The communication between Kerki, Chardzhuy and Petro-Aleksandrovsky, however, was unsatisfactory.  This was due to the large draft of steamboats, the changeable channel of Amu-Darya, its rapid course and other factors.  Used in transportation and kayuki.  These native boats raised 300-1000 pounds.  Down the river the movement was at the oars, and upward - at the oars.  At the same time, they traveled about 20 versts per day.  The Samarkand section, belonging to the Trans-Caspian railway, was almost completely located in the Bukhara emirate, which favorably influenced its trade relations with Persia and Russia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the conquest of the Kokand Khanate of the Bukhara Emirate of the Khiva Khanate" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1243403.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <h2>  Army </h2><p>  The emirate‚Äôs army included standing soldiers and a militia.  The latter was called out of necessity.  When declaring a ghazawat (holy war), all Muslims who can carry weapons were brought to the service.  The infantry was attended by 2 companies of the Emir Guard and 13 battalions.  In total, there were 14 thousand people.  The infantry were armed with smooth-bore and rifled trigger guns with bayonet-knives.  In addition, there were many flint and wick weapons.  The cavalry was attended by 20 regiments of galabatyry and 8 regiments of Hasabardar.  They were armed with falconets one for two and acted as equestrian shooters.  There were in total also about 14 thousand people.  The artillery was attended by 20 guns.  After the arrival of Soviet power in Bukhara, a powder and cannon foundry were organized there.  The soldiers were paid in part money, partly in kind in the form of a certain amount of wheat. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  Natives of the Bukhara Khanate became the founders of a number of settlements located on the territory of modern Omsk region.  Subsequently, they made up the bulk of the population of this area.  For example, the descendants of sheikhs, Islamic preachers from Central Asia in Siberia, founded Kazatovo. </p>
