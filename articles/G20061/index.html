    <h2>  Entertainment and sports </h2><p>  Swimming in the outdoor pool, classes in the fitness center, riding a rented bicycle - all this is provided by Golden City Rayong 3. Thailand is famous for its traditional massage throughout the world, so it is simply unacceptable that this hotel does not have such a service.  Not a single hotel guest is able to leave the hotel without feeling the healing effects of Thai massage.  Do not be an exception and you! </p><p>  Near the hotel (about 15 minutes drive) there is a luxurious beach.  You can get to it either on the local bus or on a rented scooter.  The huge advantage of the local beach is its cleanliness and low population. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews and photos of tourists </h2><p>  Over the period of its existence, the Golden City Rayong 3 hotel received both positive and negative reviews.  This is due, firstly, with the purpose of the trip, and secondly, with the personal preferences of each traveler. </p><p>  The hotel is most praised by people who arrive in Thailand for <span>business negotiations.</span>  It is noted for its silence, the convenience of equipped conference rooms, the cleanliness of rooms, a cozy area and friendly staff.  However, on the issue of nutrition, opinions differ: some hotel guests were completely satisfied with them, while others chose to eat in nearby restaurants. </p><p>  As for the tourists who arrived in Rayong on vacation, some of them were saddened by the small number of opportunities for fun and the lack of any entertainment program.  Although families with children consider this a positive feature.  No one bothers to sleep at night and enjoy a relaxing holiday during the day.  And if you want to have fun, you can always go to the beach, take a walk in the city or visit nearby attractions.  During walks, our compatriots who have already visited Rayong are advised to always carry a camera with them, since everything is unusual and unique for the ‚ÄúRussian eye‚Äù in Thailand.  Thanks to this, there are many opportunities for interesting photos. </p>
