And if you wish, you can always use the services of a diving school - experienced instructors will conduct several lessons and organize the first dive, choosing the most picturesque corner of the coast. </p><p>  Of course, the beach at Premier le Reve Hotel Spa 5 can hardly be called lively - it is more suitable for a relaxing holiday.  Those tourists who prefer noisy entertainment and extreme sports can always visit other places, of which there are a lot in Hurghada. </p><h2>  Children's rest at the hotel </h2><p>  Of course, the availability of conditions for an interesting children's vacation is a priority issue for parents going on a trip with their child.  Therefore, it is immediately worth noting that the Premier le Reve Hotel Spa offers only a few amenities.  In most cases, tourists with school-age children come here.  And upon request, an extra rollaway bed will be delivered to your room.  As for food, in hotel restaurants you are sure to find a sufficient number of dishes that your child will like. </p><p>  In addition, the hotel territory has a small shallow pool, designed for bathing children.  The guys can also have a good time on the beach, as the descent into the sea is safe here, and the coastal zone is very shallow.  As for services such as <span>babysitting, a</span> mini club, water slides and children's animation, here, unfortunately, they are not available. </p><h2>  Additional service on site </h2><p>  Of course, the Premier le Reve Hotel Spa 5 hotel complex offers its guests the most comfortable living conditions.  To begin with, it is worth noting that the hotel has laundry and dry cleaning services.  In addition, for tourists traveling by their own transport, there is a large secure parking.  If necessary, you can use the services of a car wash. </p><p>  As for medical care, next to the hotel complex there is a large medical center where you can get the help of a doctor for a relatively small fee. </p><p>  As mentioned above, there is Internet access throughout the hotel.  And in some rooms, the Internet is connected to a TV, which is convenient for travelers who do not have their own computer or other portable devices. </p><p>  The hotel also has a modern business center with a conference room and the necessary equipment.  From here you can even send a fax. </p><h2>  Entertainment for travelers </h2>

The animation here is unobtrusive - from time to time small performances are organized, performances by local groups, dance competitions, etc. And do not forget that Hurghada is not so far located with all its markets, shopping centers, historical sights and, of course , noisy parties and discos. </p><h2>  Excursion holidays in the city </h2><p>  What else can the Premier le Reve offer?  Hurghada is a great place not only for a beach, but also for sightseeing.

In addition, tourists have the opportunity to take a trip on a yacht and even go fishing.  And you can go on a real safari or spend the night under the stars in a colorful Berber village.  Diving enthusiasts can take part in a guided tour along the coast, during which they can dive and explore the exotic underwater world near the largest coral reefs. </p><p>  One of the most striking sights of Hurghada is the Palace of 1000 and one nights, which is a gigantic complex built in the traditional oriental style.  Here you will find exciting performances, stylized bars and restaurants, as well as museums and discos. </p><p>  What else can the Premier le Reve offer?  Egypt is the cradle of civilization.  This country is proud of its ancient history and traditions.  Therefore, if you are interested in archeology and ancient relics, then you should definitely visit some of the most significant places.  In particular, tourists are offered to make a one-day trip to the temple complex of Luxor and Karnak.  Moreover, you can visit the valley of Giza and see with your own eyes one of the wonders of the world - the Great Pyramids. </p><p>  Naturally, in the vicinity of the city there are other equally interesting historical sights.  In particular, you can visit the temple complex of Abydos, the Monastery of St. Paul, the ancient granite quarries, the Temple of the <span>goddess Hathor,</span> as well as the famous memorial temple Hatshepsut, which was built in the middle of the second millennium BC.  A cruise on the Nile River is very popular among travelers. </p><h2>  How much does a Premier le Reve 5 hotel (Hurghada) cost? </h2><p>  Naturally, potential hotel guests are primarily interested in the cost of living on its territory.  And it is worth noting that in this regard, the hotel compares favorably with its "neighbors", given the huge list of services offered.  Of course, the price will depend on many factors, including the date of booking and arrival, room category, financial policy of your chosen travel company, etc. </p><p>  So how much does it cost to stay in Premier le Reve?  On average, a day stay here will cost 3000-5000 rubles.  For example, a triple superior room (and three meals a day) costs 9500 thousand rubles.  But the deluxe category number will cost about 13-14 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews: Egypt, Premier hotel complex </h2>

And Russian tourists leave mostly good reviews about the Premier le Reve hotel complex. </p><p>  Here you will be greeted by hospitable employees, after which they will surely be treated with a welcome cocktail.  The rooms here are spacious and kept in excellent condition - the furniture and appliances are in good condition, and the maids do their job well.  The work of the cooks deserves special thanks as well - all restaurants serve excellent quality food.  The menu is always varied, especially when it comes to theme nights. </p><p>  The location of the hotel can be considered both an advantage and a disadvantage - it all depends on what kind of vacation you are counting on.  The district of Salkh-Hasheesh is calm and well-guarded, but on the other hand, you should not count on parties and discos for the morning. </p><p>  And of course, it is worth mentioning the hotel staff, who are an example of professionalism.  All employees, from cleaners to administrators, are always polite, kind and helpful.  Some of them speak Russian quite well, which can also be considered an advantage. </p><p>  Holidays on the Red Sea can turn into a real fairy tale, if you chose this particular hotel complex.  After all, there is everything you need for an interesting pastime. ,           . </p>
