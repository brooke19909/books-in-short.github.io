Such transfers from one natural person to another are usually carried out literally in two clicks, however, if a legal entity is involved in the process, the bank will need additional details to complete the transfer.  How to get the card details and in which cases they may be required, we will consider in this material. </p><div class="photo" data-original="akket.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get card details at an ATM" class="if uuid-2971272" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109573/2971272.jpg"></div><h2>  Map data </h2><p>  When a client receives a debit card at the bank, a certain amount of information will already be written on the plastic itself, but this is far from all that may be required for the transfer. </p><p>  Information on the map itself can be viewed freely at any time.  It contains the following data: </p><ul><li>  Name of card holder.  Present only on name cards. </li><li>  The number of the card itself on the front.  Please note that the card number is different from the account number to which the card is linked. </li><li>  Plastic validity: month and year until which the card can be used. </li><li>  Security codes are written on the back of a bank card. </li></ul><p>  But this is far from all that may be required to complete the transfer operation, so at some point the question may arise how to get the details of the Sberbank card. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Consider what information you need to find out separately. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sberkin.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Can I get the card details" class="if uuid-2971271" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109573/2971271.jpg"></div><h2>  Additional details </h2><p>  When trying to make a transfer of money to a card, especially when it comes to transfers from legal entities, you may need such an additional action as obtaining the details of the card in its entirety.  Not always the bank can request them, and not always in full.  Therefore, it will be optimal to find out all of them at once and provide the bank employee if necessary. </p><p>  What you need to get the card details and how they will be called: </p><ul><li>  Bank's name.  No unnecessary explanation is required here. </li><li>  TIN - a single number for one financial institution. </li><li>  BIK - code of a specific bank branch.  Each branch is given such an identifier, and it is also the same for all customers of a particular branch. </li><li>  The number and expiration date of the account to which the card is associated. </li><li>  In some cases, the bank may also ask for codes of the international SWIFT system, but this is done in rare cases and, as a rule, such codes are needed for transfers in foreign currency to individuals. </li></ul><p>  Extended account information is located at the end of the document issued at the conclusion of the contract with the bank.  There you can easily see them at any time, but the document itself can often be lost or just be out of the client‚Äôs access at a particular time.  Therefore, you need to provide people with additional ways to find out everything you need yourself. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What specifically may require full card details </h2><p>  As already mentioned, full details may be required if any legal entity transfers money to an individual.  This is the most common case.  Therefore, it is best to get information about the details of the account in full in advance.  If you often receive money from legal entities, you can print the necessary information on paper and provide the company that is going to transfer the money. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mobile-review.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get Sberbank card details through Sberbank" class="if uuid-2971268" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109573/2971268.jpg"></div><p>  However, sometimes full details of a bank card account may be required in bookkeeping at work or in another unexpected situation related to receiving money.  In order not to get into difficulty, you need to remember the basic ways to get the necessary data as quickly and conveniently as possible. </p><h2>  How to get card details through an ATM </h2><p>  Green bank ATMs in large cities are installed in large numbers, so you can use the device from virtually anywhere in the city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="life.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get sberbank card details" class="if uuid-2971267" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109573/2971267.jpg"></div><p>  You can get the details of a debit card as well as credit plastic from an ATM.  Therefore, this method can be called universal. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  First of all, insert the card into the ATM and enter your personal PIN code.  Then a personal account will become available in the menu, which may have slight differences in design in different ATMs, as their models change.  On some devices, access to the office will open when you click on the words "My accounts" or "My payments."  After going to your personal account, you need to find the "Details" item, which will contain all the necessary information about the details of the card located in the ATM.  The method is quite simple, but it requires not only an ATM, but also orientation in the menu of various device models. </p><h2>  How to get Sberbank card details through Sberbank Online </h2><p>  Sberbank Online is a remote card management system with which you can work with your accounts and money without leaving your home.  It is currently the fastest and most convenient way to get the details of a Sberbank card. </p><p>  Remember that this way you can only see the full details of the debit cards, in the case of credit, a different method is used. </p><p>  First of all, you need to log in to your account on the Sberbank Online website by entering the login information in a special form.  After the list of available cards appears, you need to click on the desired one and go to the information about it.  After that, a menu will drop out in which you need to find the item with the details for the transfer, where everything will be needed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="android4all.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get card details through an ATM" class="if uuid-2971269" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109573/2971269.jpg"></div><p>  This method is more convenient than others, because, for example, to get the details of a Sberbank card through an ATM, you need to go to the ATM and manipulate it already, while in the case of working with remote control you do not even need to leave the computer.  But for some people, the compulsory need to have Internet access can be an obstacle.  Therefore, the following method will be related to contacting Sberbank employees offline. </p><h2>  Information in the department </h2><p>  The longest time, but almost a win-win way is to visit the office of Sberbank, where the consultants will provide all the necessary information, and can also print them at the request of the client.  The minus, in addition to time, is that different departments may have different details, so during the request it is necessary to clearly and clearly tell the employee exactly what data is needed. </p><p>  Also, unlike all the above methods, when receiving information in the department, you must have an identification document with you.  When requesting the details of the card, they will definitely require it, therefore, it is absolutely necessary to bring along a passport or other document for identification. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vsluh.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Branch of Sberbank" class="if uuid-2971275" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109573/2971275.jpg"></div><h2>  On the bank website </h2><p>  Since the Internet is currently ubiquitous, the bank tried to collect all the important information in one place - on the official page.  If you enter your personal account and click "About Bank", you can get all the information about the organization, and if the information relates to the card, then they are located on the link "Account Verification". </p><h2>  Detailed information in the mobile application </h2><p>  Sberbank‚Äôs application works on all mobile device platforms, which is certainly convenient for account holders.  Of course, information on the details of the card can be found there too, just log in to your account, select the desired card by clicking and click "About card".  Further information will appear that can be saved if necessary. </p><p>  We have already considered the most popular methods for obtaining bank details, but is it possible to get card details in any other way?  There is another, rather unobvious and rarely used method. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ysia.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="get the details of a sberbank card through an ATM" class="if uuid-2971270" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109573/2971270.jpg"></div><h2>  Through a call to the call center operator </h2><p>  The official website of Sberbank contains a call center phone number where you can call and ask questions of interest.  It can also be used as a method for obtaining full card details. </p><p>  As a rule, this method is used by those who either do not have Sberbank Online connected or who are unable to install the application on the phone.  A call to the call center is an additional, third way to get the necessary data remotely without visiting a bank branch or looking for an ATM. </p><p>  In order to receive information from the operator, you need to prepare a passport and a code word that you were asked to come up with when concluding the contract.  Dial the number and follow the instructions of the autoinformer.  As a rule, to connect to the operator, press 0. </p><p>  When the operator connects, state your request and name the code word when asked.  Some other information may also be required to verify the identity of the caller.  But, as a rule, a code word is enough. </p><p>  Account data will be sent via SMS to the number associated with the card, but the account number will be dictated by the specialist verbally. </p>
