    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  The people who served these temples belonged to a special class in Egyptian society.  For example, during the time of Ramses they owned ten percent of the cultivated land and almost the same number of people.  Ancient Egypt, the priests of which were considered to be in royal service, did not have divisions for secular and ecclesiastical authority.  The posts were well paid.  Soon, the ancient Egyptian priests began to transfer their posts by inheritance. </p><h2>  Temple attendants </h2>

    <p>  Studying this country, experts came to the conclusion that this particular class played a major role in the process of formation and prosperity of the state, in the development of spiritual health and the preservation of historical and cultural values.  Ancient Egypt, whose priests were considered the guardians of sacred traditions, according to Herodotus, was the most God-fearing and religious in the Ancient World.  It was previously believed that the control of these clerics negatively affected the lives of ordinary people and the development of statehood.  In fact, the priests in ancient Egypt, as the guardians of sacred traditions, played a huge role in the history and culture of this ancient nation.  And this is evidenced by the fact that this civilization lasted longer than everyone else. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Who are the priests </h2><p>  In ancient Egypt, it was a special clan.  They possessed truly enormous power, were the legislators of etiquette.  Moreover, <span>Ancient Egypt,</span> whose priests were considered interpreters of divine will, lived by their rules.  And this concerned not only ordinary people.  Even the pharaohs unconditionally listened to their opinion. </p><h2>  Characteristics </h2>

Nevertheless, the priests of Ancient Egypt, whose photos of rock paintings are proof of this, dressed surprisingly simply.  They wore only aprons and <span>loincloths.</span>  In especially solemn occasions, these clergy are portrayed in white robes.  In many films telling about how Ancient Egypt existed and developed, priests are represented with their heads shaved to shine, so rubbed with oil so that the sun's rays are reflected from their skulls.  This appearance of temple attendants contrasted sharply with the robes of the local nobility, seeking luxury.

    <h2>  Role </h2><p>  Nevertheless, many still have no idea who the priests are in ancient Egypt.  This is a special caste of ministers to higher forces, which performed many functions in the country.  They had to monitor respect for the <span>Egyptian gods,</span> as well as the observance of rituals and rituals. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But their role in the life of the country was not limited to this.  What knowledge the Egyptian priests possessed still astonishes historians and many other scholars.  They were the bearers of the most versatile mental baggage that was passed down from generation to generation, dating back to ancient times.  All their knowledge and experience was kept as the strictest secret. </p><p>  Today, scientists make numerous discoveries by studying Ancient Egypt.  The priests knew how not only to heal, they trained children, raised the best breeds of cattle, received new varieties of plants.  They are even credited with the opportunity to correct human mores.  It was these servants of the gods who chose the most favorable time for sowing or harvesting, they determined the exact timing of the flood of the Nile. </p><p>  Moreover, when preparing their forecasts, the ancient Greek priests used data from temple libraries, which kept very detailed observations of many astronomical phenomena.  This is evidenced by numerous artifacts discovered during excavations. </p>

    <h2>  Knowledge </h2><p>  The study of ancient Egypt is carried out by many experts.  But no one can say that he knows this civilization to the end, and in particular, has a relatively complete idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis supreme caste. </p><p>  The question of what knowledge the Egyptian priests possessed is still an open question.  But one thing can be said for sure: the vast majority of scientists do not deny the version that humanity today uses their discoveries, their technologies. </p>

However, she was not "divinatory," but agrarian and medical.  Priests studied the influence of stars and other celestial bodies on the nature and well-being of people.

    <p>  But there is another opinion: our civilization owes the acquisition of the most intimate knowledge to representatives of extraterrestrial civilizations.  And this statement is connected precisely with such a state as Ancient Egypt, the priests of which measured the entire lifestyle of their people and their religious rituals in accordance with the laws by which the <span>star Sirius</span> moved <span>.</span> </p><p>  Surprisingly, that is the name of the main god of the Egyptians.  Osiris ... In this name one can clearly hear the admiration and admiration for Sirius. </p><h2>  Responsibilities </h2><p>  The priests, as many believe, did not set out to suppress the will of the Egyptians by religion.  They did not intimidate ordinary people with it.  Moreover, religion for this civilization was the key to social development and personal improvement. </p><p>  In ancient Egypt, priests were divided into separate groups that performed certain duties.  They were both keepers of sacred secrets and religious administrators.  To obtain even the lowest rank, it was necessary to study a lot, and this process was serious and difficult.  If, for example, we talk about the career of Bakenhons, the high priest during the reign of Ramses the Great, then his training began when the future clergyman was only four years old, and it ended by twenty years. </p><h2>  Magic </h2>

    <p>  This was considered their most powerful weapon.  They used magic in almost all areas of life.  For example, to cure a patient, an Egyptian priest first introduced him into a trance.  While forgetting the patient, he coded his consciousness to the necessary result: so that a speedy and complete recovery ensued. </p><p>  They used magic in all areas of life, however, in the medical and protective sphere, which is closely related to medicine, the trance culture of the <span>ancient Egyptians</span> reached its maximum development. </p><p>  Any use of drugs in ancient Egypt should have been accompanied by the patient entering this state, and then coding, carried out using spells and calls to the most authoritative gods. </p><h2>  Remote exposure </h2><p>  The priests possessed the ability, through trance, to adversely influence not only their opponents, but also the enemies of the state.  To do this, they used the secret mystical psychotechnology of various spells, for example, conjuring over the wax figures of enemies, as well as over their magical images.  For remote action, they themselves needed to go into a trance in order to be able to influence the consciousness and body of opponents. </p><p>  Some experts believe that it is the Egyptian priests who are the founders of the knowledge of mankind about such a thing as hypnosis. </p><h2>  Funeral magic </h2>

    <p>  It is known that these clergymen of the temples were primarily engaged in servicing the cults of the gods.  But not only.  The priests perfectly mastered the technique of ritual - funeral - magic, since there were a lot of necropolises and tombs in Ancient Egypt.  It is believed that they were able to influence with mystical secret spells and on "ka" - existence after death, they were able to mummify the dead.  The priests put in the sarcophagi beside them specially made for this case witchcraft items.  "Uhebti," as they were called, according to the Egyptians, guarded the "ka" of the deceased in the afterlife. </p><h2>  Customs and rituals </h2><p>  Many assume that in this way they showed their respect for the gods and never turned their backs on them.  Another custom, when the priests on the day of the Osiris uprising or on New Year's Day dressed in costumes and <span>masquerade masks,</span> and then went out into the city and walked the streets, are very reminiscent of today's carnivals.  The only difference is that they only happened on the new moon and were considered a special sacred rite, and for modern people it is a usual entertainment show. Nevertheless, among the priests the most powerful ‚Äúweapon‚Äù was their magic.  There was even a whole trance culture with amulets, potions, images and conspiracies, which protect, among other things, from various diseases: even from bites of insects and snakes, as well as scorpions and predators.  In addition, there were special customs among this caste that still amaze researchers.  For example, why the ancient Egyptian priests, leaving the temple, backed away. </p>
