The Detsky Mir retail outlets are widespread throughout Russia.  This is the largest store of toys and goods for children of different ages.  The organization has its own customer support program.  It allows you to accumulate bonus points and pay them for purchases.  In fact, everyone can get a map of the "Children's World".  It is necessary to activate it after the design of the plastic.  Otherwise, you won‚Äôt be able to use points.  Below we will talk about how to get and activate a Yo-Yo card.  How can I use this plastic?  Answers to the most common questions on the Detsky Mir bonus program are presented below! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kids world activate map" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2080282.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  What is the Children's World bonus card?  Activating it is not difficult.  But more on that later. </p><p>  First, it's worth figuring out what we're dealing with.  Yo-Yo cards are a kind of discount cards.  They allow you to pay accumulated bonuses for a variety of purchases in the "Children's World". </p><p>  The exception is: </p><ul><li>  service; </li><li>  store services (delivery and so on); </li><li>  Gift certificates. </li></ul><p>  All other purchases can be paid with bonuses of up to 100%.  But how to get and activate a new Children's World card? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Tariffs </h2><p>  To begin with, we will deal with the features of accumulating bonuses.  After all, the activation of plastic takes only a few minutes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="children‚Äôs world activate bonus card" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2080283.jpg"></div>

    <p>  So, when making purchases in the "Children's World", points will be awarded to the client on the bonus card.  How much exactly?  It is enough to focus on the following indicators: </p><ul><li>  5% - of the cost of products from the sections "clothing" and "shoes"; </li><li>  2% - for all other goods. </li></ul><p>  It is important to remember that 1 point = 1 ruble.  Thus, the client can actually pay some purchases with bonuses sooner or later. </p><p>  Validity of points is 1 year.  Bonus accrual day is not taken into account.  Therefore, you should not rush into spending.  But everyone should think about how to activate the "Children's World" card.  Otherwise, using plastic will fail. </p><h2>  About receipt </h2><p>  The first thing a client needs to do is get a card.  Without it, you can not think about activation. </p><p>  Today Yo-Yo bonus cards can be received: </p><ul><li>  by filling out an application on the site detmir.ru; </li><li>  after making a purchase at the store, at the cashier. </li></ul><p>  In fact, everything is extremely simple.  A minimum of information is required from a citizen to issue a card.  After filling out the questionnaire, the plastic will be given to the client. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Since March 29, 2017, customers began to draw up new-style Yo-Yo cards.  Owners of old plastic can simply contact the cashiers of the distribution network to exchange a ‚Äúdocument‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="activate the children's world map via the Internet" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2080284.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  About activation methods </h2><p>  There are several ways to activate the Detsky Mir bonus card.  It all depends on the personal preferences of the client. </p><p>  For example, today buyers are offered the following options for overcoming the situation: </p><ul><li>  activation via the Internet; </li><li>  personal appeal to the cashier. </li></ul><p>  There are no more methods.  Both new and old Yo-Yo cards work equally well with these tricks.  Below we will talk about them in more detail. </p><h2>  Cash desk help </h2><p>  Everyone can activate the Detsky Mir bonus card by contacting any company outlet.  This technique is suitable for those who do not want to work with an Internet request. </p><p>  What to do?  To activate, you will need: </p><ol><li>  Take a card and passport with you.  The second document is optional. </li><li>  Contact a cashier or an employee of Detsky Mir with a request for plastic activation. </li><li>  Give the card to the store employee. </li><li>  Wait a few minutes. </li><li>  Pick up a Yo-Yo card that is fully prepared for future use. </li></ol><p>  Detsky Mir employees themselves will register and activate the card in the database, after which the plastic can be used for its intended purpose.  It is allowed to accumulate bonuses even before completing the studied procedure. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="activate the map of the store children's world" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2080285.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Internet and getting started </h2><p>  Activating the Detsky Mir map online is easier than it sounds.  But not everyone understands how to do this.  Usually the process comes down to filling out a special questionnaire.  You can find it on the page with a description of the bonus program. </p><p>  How to activate the Children's World map via the Internet?  The instruction will look as follows: </p><ol><li>  Open the browser page detmir.ru/bonus-card-new/anketa-step1. </li><li>  Enter the bonus card number in the designated fields. </li><li>  Click on the "Fill in the form" button. </li><li>  Enter information about the card holder, about his children. </li><li>  Indicate passport data. </li><li>  Check the box next to "I agree with the terms of the program." </li><li>  Click on "Submit". </li></ol><p>  After the actions done, it remains only to wait.  As soon as the request passes the processing stage, you will no longer have to think about activating the Detsky Mir card.  It will happen automatically. </p><h2>  About using points </h2><p>  It will not be possible to immediately use the bonus plastic from the studied distribution network.  On the page of this offer it is recommended to check the card balance.  Otherwise, at the checkout when paying for purchases problems are not excluded. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="activate new baby world map" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2080286.jpg"></div>
      <br>

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

      <p></p>
    <p>  There are several types of points.  Namely: </p><ol><li>  Active.  These are bonuses that are currently active.  They can be used to pay for purchases, but only after the buyer managed to activate the Detsky Mir store card. </li><li>  Inactive  Points credited to the client‚Äôs account, but not yet ready for use.  They can be spent 2 weeks after the appearance of these.  Inactive points after 14 days automatically become active. </li><li>  Promotional.  Bonuses transferred to the client‚Äôs account after performing certain actions on shares.  It is recommended to specify more detailed information in the Detsky Mir chain of stores. </li></ol><p>  Accordingly, if there are only inactive bonuses on the card (this really happens), they will not work in any way.  Will have to wait.  And no activation of the Children's World card will help speed up the process. </p><h2>  Phones </h2><p>  Some people say that you can activate the "Children's World" card using your phone.  This is a rather unconventional approach to solving the problem.  And therefore, in practice, it is almost never found. </p><p>  How to act in such circumstances?  The client will need: </p><ol><li>  Call 8 (800) 250 00 00. </li><li>  Announce intention to activate bonus plastic Yo-Yo. </li><li>  Name the card number. </li><li>  Report cardholder information. </li><li>  Wait a while. </li></ol><p>  Call center employees will fill out an application for a bonus program participant themselves.  And after that, the plastic from Detsky Mir will be activated.  As we have already said, such a technique is almost never found in practice.  It is not very convenient, and the profile can easily be lost.  Therefore, it is recommended to give preference to more common activation methods. </p><h2>  Gift certificates </h2><p>  Detsky Mir offers its customers special gift cards.  This offer allows you to give certain amounts of money to friends and relatives for purchases in the distribution network. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="activate gift card baby world" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2080287.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  But in the "Children's World" a gift card will also need to be activated.  To do this, you can: </p><ol><li>  Wait 3 business days from the date of purchase of the usual certificate and 2 days after purchasing an electronic gift card.  Operations are carried out automatically. </li><li>  Open the link that came to the email with the certificate, indicate your phone number, and then click on "Activate".  A PIN will be sent to the mobile device, which is necessary to pay for the goods. </li></ol><p>  Activating the Detsky Mir map is, in fact, not difficult.  Most customers prefer to fill out forms via the Internet. </p>
