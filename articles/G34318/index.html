    <p>  The project provides for its own boiler house, so the residents of the complex will not be dependent on central support systems and planned shutdowns of the city's boiler houses. </p><h2>  Ecological situation </h2><p>  New buildings in Yekaterinburg are mainly located in the city.  But in the city there are many industrial enterprises creating not the most favorable industrial background.  Therefore, "Light" significantly wins among them.  He hid among the forest.  And right in front of the complex is the artificial Ramada Lake and the Lower Iset reservoir.  Therefore, apartments in Svetly are especially popular with those who want to breathe fresh air. </p><p>  The location among the Lesovodov Park of Russia surrounding on three sides is a competitive feature that Svetly is endowed with.  The residential complex (Yekaterinburg), like no other, boasts its offer to residents of the opportunity to breathe fresh air freely.  Rather, it will be a country house located in the most environmentally friendly <span>area of ​​Yekaterinburg.</span> </p><h2>  Apartments, decoration, cost </h2><p>  Svetly offers not very large families to move in, as the apartments are designed only in studios, one-room and two-room.  That is, a large family is unlikely to be able to choose spacious and large apartments.  They are simply not provided for by the project. </p><p>  But the studios are being built quite spacious, their minimum area is twenty-nine square meters.  The maximum reaches forty-nine meters.  Next come one-room (up to fifty-three meters) and two-room (up to seventy square meters). </p>

    <p>  All premises are being repaired by the turnkey developer, including non-residential (commercial).  Not all real estate in Yekaterinburg boasts such concern for its residents and tenants.  Finishing includes laying the laminate, gluing white wallpaper for painting, installing all the necessary plumbing, tiles on the loggias and in the bathrooms.  In addition, meters are installed for the consumption of heat, water and electricity.  All loggias are glazed with PVC windows. </p><p>  The minimum cost of the studio begins with the figure of one million seven hundred seventy thousand rubles.  That is, a little more than fifty thousand rubles per square meter of living space. </p><h2>  External infrastructure </h2><p>  Svetly, a residential complex (Yekaterinburg), was built at a distance of about eight kilometers from the center of Yekaterinburg.  But in order not to create additional inconvenience to its residents, the developer even provided for a minibus stop near the complex.  It offers residents of the complex the entire infrastructure of the city, which can be easily reached. </p><p>  Thus, the Svetly residential complex under construction is nothing but a new word in construction using modern technologies.  Its location in the forest area, next to the lake and the reservoir, will give life in the complex additional comfort and charm, will make its residents rush to return home after a hard day to breathe in a breath of not polluted air of the urban environment, but pure coolness. </p><p>  Among the residents of our capital, a trend has recently become fashionable to sell their existing apartments in the center or within the city and move to new buildings in the near Moscow suburbs.  Residents of Yekaterinburg are not far behind them.  Moreover, in terms of the degree and number of industrial enterprises, this city is largely superior to the capital.  This means that breathing in it is by no means easy. </p><p>  Moreover, the developer of Svetly tried to recreate all the necessary conditions for a comfortable life for his future residents.  Changing their previous apartments for housing in the complex, they will not even feel a significant difference, their conditions will not only not worsen, but will improve many times over.  This refers to the fact that they will live in the fresh air.  You won’t have to worry about child safety, since the complex is located far enough from the road, a random car will not fly into the yard. </p>
