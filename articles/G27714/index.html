Good reviews get rest in Bodrum.  This city is in full swing and attractive for people who like to spend their time actively and non-trivially.  And Bodrum hotels offer guests all the conditions for a pleasant stay.  If you are a lover of nightlife and all kinds of entertainment, then this Turkish city is your destiny.  Numerous cafes, restaurants and bars lure guests with jazz music that comes from open doors all night.  And at local discos you can dance until the morning.  <span>Turkish delicacies</span> are plentiful in local entertainment venues.  And during the day you can enjoy swimming in the clean, welcoming sea and basking in the comfortable beach.  For example, in Gumbet, a famous resort area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city, you can engage in all kinds of water sports.  And if you want to take a break from the fun and fuss, go to Turgutrais.  This is an area that is famous for its stunning olive groves and beautiful nature.  Here you can be in silence and enjoy the privacy.  When you decide which Bodrum hotels are most suitable for a good rest, you can also see the sights.  You can visit the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, Petronium Castle, the Museum of Underwater Archeology and many other interesting places.  Here weekly wonderful fairs are held in small villages where city guests are happy to buy souvenirs and crafts. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Bodrum hotels offer a service of different levels and prices, designed for any tourist.  But if you want to relax at the highest level, check out the description of some of the hotels that are considered the best in the city.  Topping the list is the five-star Baia Bodrum, which offers attractive high-tech facilities and excellent service.  It has its own beach and spa, which guests love to visit.  The most demanding and picky tourists, of course, will appreciate the elegant atmosphere of the rooms and their design in white, light colors.  This is a relatively young hotel.  It was built 7 years ago and consists of five buildings.  There are standard rooms, suites and rooms specially equipped for the disabled.  This hotel has three restaurants, five bars, three pools, a laundry room, parking, three meeting rooms and a TV lounge.  Children will be happy to play on the playground, in the mini club, take a swim in a special children's pool and ride a mini-slide. </p><p>  Russian tourists most meticulously study the hotels of Bodrum.  One of their favorite is Isis Hotel &amp; SPA 5 *.  Price and quality are very well combined.  On its territory there is a seven-story building and as many as twenty-four cottages two and three floors high.  The hotel began operating in 1994, and more recently, it was restored three years ago.  It also attracts pet lovers.  They can stay here with their pets absolutely free upon prior request.  The hotel has a rich infrastructure of entertainment, all kinds of services and opportunities for sports activities. </p><p>  Reviews of Bodrum hotels are mostly positive, although not always.  For example, some city guests complain about the lack of entertainment for children.  For example, the Kempinski Hotel Barbaros Bay 5 * is located in a picturesque bay, has a nightclub, a spa center, a Vietnamese restaurant, a huge number of various services and the highest level of service, well-known throughout the city.  But tourists note that in addition to the pool for children, there is no longer any entertainment provided. </p><p>  Therefore, before you decide which Bodrum hotels are suitable for you personally for a vacation, read the reviews of those people who have already been there. </p>
