River Station is one of its terminal stations, which is located in the northern part of the capital.  It got its name thanks to the Northern River Station, which is a few meters away and is now one of the busiest metro stops in the capital. </p><h2>  Station history </h2>

    <p>  At the moment, ‚ÄúRiver Station‚Äù ( <span>metro station, Moscow)</span> is the final destination of the Zamoskvoretskaya line.  Active construction of the next station is underway - Khovrino, which will later become a continuation of the branch.  The station at the station was repeatedly planned: first in 1938, then in 1947 and 1957.  Construction began only in the early 60s and was completed by the end of 1964.  Until 1975, the station was the northernmost of all in the Moscow metro. </p><p>  The station was repeatedly offered to rename, but each time the initiative did not find support from the population.  Since the 60s, the northern part of the green line (where the Rechnoy Vokzal station is located) has been one of the busiest, which is why it often organizes express trains from the terminal station to Voikovskaya. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What is nearby? </h2>

Nearby is the choir school.  Sveshnikov, which annually receives a large number of students eager to receive a prestigious musical education. </p><h2>  The appearance of the station </h2>

It was built during the time of N. S. Khrushchev, who demanded that his subordinates eliminate all the excesses that were present in construction and design at that time.  Thanks to this, the station has a very modest appearance.  All walls are decorated with white and light green ceramic tiles.  When creating the station, red marble with white spots and gray granite were also used. </p><p>  Paleontologists call the station unique: it is here that you can see a small number of fossils in the form of various shells.  In the middle of the hall there is a pair of benches, their number is small, since the station is final and passengers usually do not linger on it.  The vestibules were made using standard techniques: glass and reinforced concrete structures - the main materials. </p><h2>  Station design and its prospects </h2>

    <p>  You should definitely visit the city, whose metro is called the most beautiful on the planet.  This is Moscow.  The River Station, although not one of the most interesting stations, there is definitely something to see here.  Now the station consists of a pair of tracks used for sludge and turnover of metro trains, a pair of tracks for their sludge, as well as a cross exit.  The station has its own inspection point, so if the train came to the final one and broke down, it is likely that it will soon appear on the line again. </p><p>  In the early 10s of this century, it was decided to extend the Zamoskvoretskaya line.  The metro management has planned the construction of two stations: Belomorskaya and Khovrino.  As the project developed, the construction of the first station had to be abandoned, but the second is planned to be put into operation at the end of 2016.  When Rechnoy Vokzal becomes an intermediate stop, additional benches for passengers and other infrastructure will be installed here </p><h2>  How does the station work? </h2>
