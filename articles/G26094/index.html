This is a good opportunity to save.  Therefore, they have become so popular.  But not all of them are equally good.  To choose the right bulb, you need to know and take into account some points. </p><p>  By the way, among the advantages of these products are not only high profitability and a long service life, but also various design options and a different glow color.  All this allows you to use them as one of the elements of interior design. </p><h2>  Benefits in the details </h2><p>  220v <span>LED lamps have</span> replaced traditional incandescent analogues and demonstrate excellent characteristics for the average consumer.  Among their advantages are a lot of things.  This is a significantly lower energy consumption, higher quality, service life.  These products are also completely safe for humans and pets.  It is worth considering all these advantages in more detail. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Best way to save </h2><p>  What is the saving?

    <p>  Take, for example, an ordinary 65-watt incandescent bulb.  A luminescent element with the same capabilities (and this is the creation of a luminous flux of 600 Lm) has a power of 14 watts.  A diode light with the same characteristics will consume only 7 watts.  Here the result is obvious.  So, it is possible to save 10 times if you replace the old bulbs with these LED innovations.  In different cases, the level of profitability can be even more. </p><h2>  Lifetime </h2><p>  The best <span>LED lamps</span> can work from about 30 to 100 thousand hours.  An ordinary light bulb, even if it was made by a well-known brand, will work for only 4000 hours, and even then only in an ideal situation.  It follows that during the period the LED product shines, it will be necessary to purchase and replace about 40 pcs.  traditional counterparts.  If we take into account 1/25 price ratios only on the purchase of one LED part, then instead of 40, the savings will be as much as 15%.  This is a good number.  In addition to the amount of time, the time it takes to replace products is also saved. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Warranty </h2><p>  For these unique and economical lamps, there is also a manufacturer's warranty.  So, domestic brands on their products guarantee a service life of 2 to 3 years.  Foreign manufacturers prescribe 5 years of continuous operation.  If suddenly, for some reason, it burns out before the warranty period, the company undertakes to repair it or replace it for free. </p><p>  Considering that in most standard <span>apartments lighting is</span> used for about 6 hours during the day, even the most inexpensive of all existing with a stated period of 30,000 hours will work for about 13 years.  This is a serious time.  At the same time, the cost of such a unique acquisition will pay off in about 2.5 years.  It turns out that the rest of the time the light from the LED product will come out almost free. </p><p>  In addition to all this, there are other advantages: </p><ul><li>  Small size and weight of the product. </li><li>  High environmental friendliness and safety for health. </li><li>  High functionality. </li><li>  Resistance to various mechanical damages. </li><li>  Minimum heat transfer. </li><li>  Almost complete absence of ultraviolet radiation. </li><li>  Bright light without ripple. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="led lamp fixtures" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1172298.jpg" width="510"></div></li></ul><h2>  Important specifications </h2><p>  These lighting fixtures have recently become extremely popular.  Therefore, it is necessary to know what technical characteristics this or that lamp should have.  This will greatly facilitate the selection of these products for home use. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Power </h2><p>  This is probably the most important thing.  For domestic use, a lamp with a power of 1 to 25 watts is enough.  This indicator is the equivalent of 20-150 watts for the incandescent element. </p><p>  But on sale there are more powerful LED lamps.  Their technical characteristics, or rather power, can be up to 100 watts.  For home use, the capabilities of these products are redundant - they are used to organize street lighting. </p><h2>  Light flow </h2><p>  In order to find out how bright this or that product will be, you should usually pay attention to the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the light flux.  This parameter manufacturers characterize the brightness of the glow.  It is these data that must be remembered in order to choose a full-fledged replacement for a burnt out incandescent lamp. </p><p>  Many domestic manufacturers, as well as friends from the Middle Kingdom, indicate on the package which light bulb an LED can replace.  But this parameter is not always correct.  There are times when Chinese manufacturers doubled this figure.  For a luminous flux of 50 Lm, it is necessary to purchase a 1 W LED lamp.  For a flow of 600 Lm, an LED part of 7 W is required, which is equivalent to a 65 W incandescent lamp. </p>

    <h2>  Additional specifications </h2><p>  Among the important parameters, the divergence angle is distinguished.  Those of the bulbs in which this angle is 90 ¬∞ will be the most optimal solution as the main lighting.  If the angle of light scattering is 20-30 ¬∞, then the product is better to use for spot lighting. </p><p>  Do not forget about color temperature.  For example, 2700 K is a cozy and pleasant yellow color, somewhat reminiscent of Soviet lamps.  3500 K - a whiter and more bright glow, but still a little yellowish.  5000-6000 K are already neutral white <span>LED lamps.</span>  Anything larger than these numbers is for street lighting. </p><p>  Another is the service life.  This is worth a look, but professionals do not recommend fully trusting the indicator.  Often, everything that is sold on the markets of our country is made in China, and maybe the quality is much higher than before, but everywhere you can buy a defective product. </p><h2>  LED lamp bases </h2><p>  In the modern market of lighting devices, you can find products with 11 socles of various types.  The differences between them are in shape and size, as well as in contact planes.  Each base has its own standard number.  Just by looking at the lamp, you can understand where the device fits. </p><p>  E27 is the most common base for home use.  It is it that is used in most household chandeliers, and there are corresponding LED lamps for it.  Lamps, sconces, table lamps are also equipped with such a base.  An analogue of this socle is considered E14.  It is also intended for home use.  This is a candle lamp. </p><p>  In modern chandeliers and fixtures, products with socles are used, the marking of which begins with the letter G. There are a huge number of modifications of these parts.  When buying devices, it is very important to fully know the marking, even though the base is equipped with pin contact surfaces. </p><h2>  Manufacturers </h2><p>  As noted earlier, the bulk of all the lamps on our market are Chinese products.  But recently, a domestic manufacturer has also become active, which makes LED lamps, the technical characteristics of which even exceed the parameters of products from the Middle Kingdom.  Large enterprises are often located in the European part of the country.  These products are great for home use.  Internet publications devoted to information technology conducted tests of a domestic product and were very pleased with the results. </p><p>  Among the manufacturers of high-quality and reliable lamps are: </p><ul><li>  Feron </li><li>  Jazzway. </li><li>  Camelon </li><li>  Gauss. </li><li>  Navigator </li><li>  "Era". </li></ul><p>  The cost of light bulbs can vary greatly depending on the region and ranges from 200 to 1300 rubles.  There is no point in buying an inexpensive decision. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LED lamp with remote control" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1172300.jpg" width="283"></div>  Experts recommend purchasing products that are equipped with modern, durable diodes.
