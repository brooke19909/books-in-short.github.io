Before investing, you need to figure out which stocks are profitable to buy now. </p><h2>  Briefly on the case </h2><p>  In 2016, the stock market shows a medium-term correlation.  A critical <span>price level</span> has not been reached.  It‚Äôs too early to talk about changing trends.  The experience of past years shows that a long upward trend in the future will make many regret the missed opportunities.  So what stocks are profitable to buy now on the Russian market? </p>

    <h2>  An approach </h2><p>  For starters, it‚Äôs worth clarifying that investment and trading are two different things.  A private investor is concerned about preserving savings in 10-20 years.  He does not check stock quotes daily, but checks the annual reports of companies.  All these things are done by the trader.  Which receives a salary from the Central Bank market. </p><p>  Regardless of which stocks are profitable to buy now, when working in the market, you need to follow simple rules: </p><ul><li>  All funds must be distributed in equal shares between companies.  You should not invest in the assets of one corporation. </li><li>  Before the transaction, you need to carefully monitor the dynamics of bidding in order to identify the moment when the price will be minimal. </li><li>  You should familiarize yourself with the performance of the company, analyze the analytical and financial reporting. </li><li>  It is better to choose companies for investment from the list of the most promising and fastest growing. </li></ul>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Energetics </h2><p>  This is the most underrated market segment.  All doubters can see the asset structure of Enel Russia, EON Russia, and price increases for FGC UES.  In the near future, RusHydro will be added to the top three.  Depositary receipts of this company have already appeared on the London Stock Exchange. </p><p>  What stocks are profitable to buy now for a long time?  Oil holdings.  You can talk for a very long time about lowering oil prices.  But this <span>sector of the economy is</span> credited at low rates.  It is closely related to a foreign patent.  Today it is worth paying attention to the shares of Gazpromneft, which has come out of the negative influence of Gazprom and is now trading at a large discount to Bashneft, Tatneft, Lukoil and Surgutneftegaz.  It is worth saying a few words about the last player on the market.  The payment of super dividends depends on exchange rate fluctuations.  But the company directs the proceeds to the privatization of the largest domestic holdings.  Amid the weakening of the national currency, the acquisition of shares of the monopolist is becoming not only a source of dividends, but also an investment in business and protection against the fall of the ruble. </p>

    <h2>  Telecommunication </h2><p>  What other shares are now profitable to buy?  The telecommunications sector in the future is also able to please a private investor.  But it is better to <span>select securities</span> selectively, based on the data of financial statements and personal preferences, than to invest in the sector as a whole.  In this case, the following factors that adversely affect the price of assets should be taken into account: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  lack of foreign loans; </li><li>  increase in <span>capital expenditures</span> in foreign currency; </li><li>  against the background of the transition to wireless communication methods, roaming revenues are reduced; </li><li>  increased competition in the market. </li></ul><p>  But all these factors are temporary.  When deciding which stocks to buy right now, investor feedback needs to be considered.  After all, they invest in the long term.  This applies to both MTS, in whose assets there is a troubled bank, MegaFon and the unkillable Rostelecom. </p><h2>  Gold </h2><p>  The advantage of this indestructible asset is that in the long run, gold prices remain stably high.  And attractive price levels always provide an opportunity to increase your market presence. </p>

    <h2>  Banking segment </h2><p>  What stocks are profitable to buy now on the MICEX?  Clients of system banks may be interested in the possibility of investing in mutual funds of Alfa-Bank, Gazprombank, etc. The loss in profitability in the form of costs of the management company will be compensated by privileges from the services received, offers of the bank with an increased deposit rate for parallel purchase of shares . </p><p>  What stocks are now profitable to buy at Sberbank?  When working with the terminal, FinEx fund is available.  Despite the exotic nature of this tool and the company as a whole, in the long run, the investment will be able to bring about 20% of the profit. </p><h2>  Advice </h2><p>  Although 2015 was a very difficult year for the national economy, it is still worth investing in it.  According to analysts, the crisis period is ending.  Macroeconomic indicators have already reached the bottom; stabilization is observed in the market. </p><p>  Analysts recommend investing in securities of exporters, manufacturers who are focused on import substitution.  Investors have not yet adjusted to new trends.  Investment portfolios still dominate the assets of consumer companies.  They bring high profitability, but are not protected from falling demand. </p>

    <p>  By the end of this year, the ruble will begin to strengthen.  This will lead to higher oil prices.  The rate on exporters is appropriate in conditions of devaluation of the national currency.  Among the growing industries, experts highlight metallurgy, defense industry and construction.  Of the above, the most risky is metallurgy.  Commodity prices have remained low in recent months. </p><p>  In general, financiers advise to limit the presence on the market of Russian companies to a minimum.  Most likely, there are many who want to invest in the economy of their country.  But today the situation on the world market does not allow this to happen. </p><h2>  Expensive but affordable assets </h2><p>  Despite market uncertainty, more than half of the securities portfolio can be formed on the Russian stock exchange.  Dividend yield today will be lower than bank interest even for the largest companies.  But in the next 5-7 years, it will definitely grow.  To insure yourself against possible losses even more, you need to diversify your investment portfolio not only with gold, but also with shares from listing on foreign markets, for example, the New York Stock Exchange. </p><p>  Interestingly, for a long time, one share of Apple at a cost corresponded to the price of a tablet of the same company.  Apple is one of the most successful and second of the fastest growing (after Samsung) companies in the world.  Back in 2015, the price of one share was about $ 700.  Wanting to attract more investors, the company deliberately divided one share into 10 pieces.  The value of the package of current holders of the Central Bank has not changed, but the number of shares has increased 10 times.  The same was reflected in the price.  To buy one share out of 100 shares, it is enough to invest not 700 dollars, but only 700. </p><p>  What stocks are now profitable to buy on the NYSE?  The example of Apple was immediately followed by Google and Microsoft.  The cost of one Central Bank of the popular search engine in 2015 amounted to $ 650, and "windows" - about $ 800 apiece.  After splitting the shares of the Central Bank became available to more investors. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The NYSE and IIMB are represented by many more expensive and fast-growing companies.  You can invest in any of them.  The main thing is to understand that the market situation can change at any time.  Therefore, you should not count on constant and fast-growing profit. </p>
