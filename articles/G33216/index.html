It was not always successful, as, for example, in the case of the "Z" series.  Before the company failed to stop the release of these smartphones, new flagships appeared on the horizon.  The developers set off to justify themselves, they say, now in the pursuit of advanced technologies, they will not forget about the quality of the devices.  In general, each new flagship is aimed at comfortable use. </p><p>  Now the series includes four gadgets: <span>Xperia X, Xperia</span> XA Ultra, Xperia XA and Xperia X Performance.  We will do a review of the latter today. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Sony did not show themselves as a generous company, so everything is standard in the box.  In addition to the smartphone itself, there is documentation, a microUSB cable and non-speed charging.  The box itself is compact.  The large letter ‚ÄúX‚Äù flaunts on it, and the inscription ‚ÄúXperia‚Äù shimmers. </p><h2>  Meet by clothes </h2><p>  The company has turned out a beautiful smartphone Xperia X Performance.  A review of his appearance cannot upset.  It‚Äôs worth starting with color frills: classic white, ‚Äúgraphite black‚Äù, ‚Äúpink gold‚Äù and ‚Äúlime gold‚Äù are available for buyers.  The names of the colors absolutely correspond to their appearance.  They turned out to be very high quality and definitely original. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xperia x performance review" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1407632.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Perhaps the designers of this smartphone can put a monument.  His appearance is perfect.  Unlike its "brothers", the rear panel of the Xperia X Performance is metallic and matte.  The sides of the gadget are smoothed, so the body is very streamlined. </p><p>  The dimensions of the smart are large.  The battery did not become more powerful, but the thickness of 8.6 mm is a little striking.  Of course, under the back panel there is a powerful ‚Äúfilling‚Äù, but objectively, you could definitely get rid of one millimeter.  The screen occupies the entire front panel.  On the sides, the frame is very thin, but noticeable due to the protrusions of the case.  The space above and below the screen is 1.4 cm. </p><h2>  Elements on the body </h2><p>  The classic location is also occupied by the elements of the Sony Xperia X Performance.  A review of them is worth doing, as there are still a couple of comments, but more on that later.  So, above the screen there is a conversational speaker, a logo flaunts underneath, and on the sides of it is a front camera and an NFC sensor.  Under the display is another speaker, already external. </p><p>  Since this is a monopod, the rear panel is not removable.  On it in the upper left corner is the main camera, under it is a flash.  In the center, the Xperia inscription is classically placed.  On the left side is a combined slot for a SIM card and a memory card or two SIM cards.  The tray itself is attached to the plug, so it is removed all together.  After opening the slot, the smartphone turns off.  This must be borne in mind. </p>

    <p>  But from the opposite side there are three buttons: in the middle there is a proprietary power key with a fingerprint scanner, below the volume rocker, below it is a ‚Äúphoto release‚Äù.  The inconvenience just arises with volume control.  Its location is controversial, as a classic place on top is much more convenient to use. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At the top there is an additional microphone, near the headphone jack.  At the bottom there is a place for micro-USB and the main microphone. </p><h2>  Facilities </h2><p>  Using a smartphone is pleasant, as is looking at it.  It fits comfortably in the hand thanks to its rounded shapes.  Its dimensions are moderate, it is not heavy.  It is easy to operate the device with one hand.  But, as mentioned earlier, problems arise with the volume rocker.  Fans have long been accustomed to its location on top, in addition to the fact that the new location is unusual, also terribly uncomfortable. </p><p>  The power button with a <span>fingerprint scanner</span> works perfectly.  The smartphone quickly responds to commands and wakes up the system.  The camera‚Äôs shutter button is also located successfully.  It is especially convenient to use when shooting horizontally.  Then the finger itself begs to click on the button. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xperia x performance dual review" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1407633.jpg"></div>

    <p>  There is nothing to talk about assembly.  Sony has never had a problem with it, both with older models and with newfangled flagships.  It will not hold anything together, it will not play, even if you make an effort and press on the case. </p><h2>  Quality mapping </h2><p>  The beauty of appearance is complemented by other quality features from the Xperia X Performance.  The overview of the screen is not surprising, since the whole series is excellent.  The company did not ‚Äúpush‚Äù 4K resolution here, but for a five-inch display with a head, Full HD is enough.  The matrix of the IPS screen, so the colors are moderately saturated and rich.  The picture is bright and very detailed.  Viewing angles, of course, are maximum; neither color nor contrast is distorted when tilted. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The developers also prepared a special technology X-Reality for mobile.  Thanks to her, the display looks even clearer and more saturated.  Regarding brightness, you can configure it yourself or choose automatic mode.  The latter works well, but sometimes there are problems on a sunny day.  The brightness of the screen is good, but the "automation" for some reason does not increase it to a maximum in the afternoon in the sun. </p><p>  You also do not expect any problems from the sensor.  There was hope that Sony got rid of phantom clicks and they can not be found in the new series.  Multi-touch recognized up to 10 simultaneous touches. </p><h2>  "Sweets" for users </h2><p>  Making a review of the operating system for the Xperia X Performance, it is worth noting that there were no surprises here.  At the head of the system is Android 6.0 Marshmallow, not without its proprietary add-ons: the lock screen, where the current time and date are indicated, there is a microphone icon for voice search in Google, a camera icon that allows you to launch the application without unlocking, well, where without the fingerprint indicator finger. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony xperia x performance dual review" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1407631.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The status bar is typical of the Xperia X Performance Dual.  A review of the curtain showed nothing new.  The main screen is easily customizable to the taste of the user. </p><p>  The operating system can hardly be called "clean."  In addition to the standard "Google" software, there are many branded.  Some of them may be useful.  It‚Äôs also convenient that there is already a built-in antivirus, this application is really useful. </p><p>  If the owner does not like something in the external shell of the system, you can quickly change everything with the help of branded themes.  Otherwise, everything remained standard for smartphones from Sony Xperia. </p><h2>  Beast car </h2><p>  Well and to the most interesting in Xperia X Performance.  A review of technical specifications is always expected, and I want to see something incredibly cool.  So the new model boasts.  She was very efficient.  Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor with 64-bit system and four cores.  For graphics, developers installed Adreno 530. A promising hardware supplemented 3 GB of RAM. </p><p>  There is 32 GB built-in, of which, of course, not everything is available, but only 20. There is a combined slot where you can put microSD up to 200 GB. </p>

    <p>  This device is universal.  It is convenient for games, office programs and surfing the Internet.  With huge multitasking, not a single lag.  Not only does the gadget not slow down, rather, it ‚Äúflies‚Äù.  All third-party software through which the device passed the test, though not the most top-notch result, but sufficient for any business. </p><p>  There is no point in talking about games, since any of them is on the smartphone.  The only barely noticeable drawback is overheating.  If you sit for a long time at games and applications, the back panel heats up. </p><h2>  Other "goodies" </h2><p>  There are no complaints about the sound.  It is almost perfect.  But this is all only if you listen with headphones.  The external speaker is average, it has a small volume level and not enough bass.  For music and movies, it is better to use a headset. </p><p>  Like all brothers, this device received proprietary protection IP65 / IP68.  But in the instructions it is forbidden to throw the phone into the water.  All this protection is designed only for the gadget to work in the rain.  In principle, you can rinse your smartphone under the tap.  But it is worth closing all ports and covers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony xperia x performance smartphone review" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1407630.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Photo for memory </h2><p>  So we got to another important element in the Sony Xperia X Performance.  The camera review is worth starting with numbers.  The main one has a resolution of 23 megapixels, it works very quickly.  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãis observed both at application launch, and at focusing.  By the way, autofocus allows you to shoot objects even in motion, and the photos are very high quality. </p><p>  When the application starts, the shooting mode is standardly automatic.  In principle, excellent images are obtained with it.  But if you understand the manual settings, it is better to use them, such photos will become even better. </p><p>  The front camera received 13 megapixel resolution.  It‚Äôs obvious that selfies for Instagram will be more than successful. </p><h2>  Wireless settings </h2>

    <p>  There are no questions about the wireless interface at all.  The mobile network works well.  Wi-Fi gives the highest possible Internet connection speed.  The satellite navigation signal also works at lightning speed.  Naturally, support for LTE frequencies is available for owners. </p><h2>  Survivability </h2><p>  Making a review on the Sony Xperia X Performance smartphone, it is worth talking about autonomy.  The 2700 mAh battery works better than you would expect from it.  He will be able to play the video for almost 5 hours in a row.  It will turn out to play about 3 hours. </p><p>  Stamina and Ultra Stamina charge storage systems save energy costs.  With moderate work, the gadget lives about two days.  Such indicators are encouraging, given the size, resolution of the display and the functionality of the device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xperia x performance" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1407637.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Here's the Sony Xperia X Performance Dual.  A review of its characteristics showed that the device was more than perfect.  Now it‚Äôs easy to believe that the company has embarked on the ‚Äútrue path‚Äù and is really creating comfortable and powerful gadgets.  There are practically no complaints about the device.  All the little things that can be "hooked" are more about convenience.  They do not affect performance and overall performance, but are only small whims of users.  The new ‚Äúchild‚Äù Sony Xperia received a solid ‚Äúfive‚Äù in all the tests passed.  And the most important judge - the user - will certainly remain satisfied. </p>
