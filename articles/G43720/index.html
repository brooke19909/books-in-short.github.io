And put scissors nearby - with them we will cut the strings or floral tape.

    <p>  We will need a <span>floral ribbon</span> to decorate the stem of the plant.  In principle, you can do without it.  Instead of the above material, a spool of green thread will also work. </p><p>  A tube of glue (universal or PVA) will be needed. </p><p>  Since we are going to make tulips from beads, then, accordingly, we need this very beads.  You need to buy the same flat beads.  You can even take two-tone ones.  For example, red and orange.  Or blue and white.  Then the tips of the petals will be slightly different in tone, like in real flowers.  And for the leaves you need green "glass".  Be sure to get yellow beads and black bugles.  From them you will collect pestles with stamens. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  And of course, you can not do without wire.  You will need a coil of thin jewelry wire for weaving leaves and petals, as well as a more rigid base for the stem. </p><h2>  Create the petals </h2><p>  We start weaving tulips from beads by creating petals.  From the skein of thin wire we separate the wire cutters into two segments.  One is 20 centimeters long, and the other is 45. Twist them together. </p><p>  For a short period we lower 5 beads of a light shade and 6 darker ones.  On the other (long) end of the wire we put 4 light beads and 9 dark. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tulips from beads weaving pattern" class="if" height="218" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13542/349643.jpg" width="406"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Now gently twist a long section of wire through a short one, with strung beads.  After that, create the reverse row of 4 and 9 beads.  Again, lightly cling to the base of the short wire.  Repeat the operation several times.  As a result, we should get six rows on two sides of the central segment.  At the same time, do not forget to add the number of beads in each row.  Only then will we get almost real tulips from beads.  The weaving scheme for this technology involves the manufacture of three small internal petals and three external. </p><p>  For the outer petals we use beads of a dark shade.  At the base it is necessary to place 12 beads, on both sides we collect 4 more rows, gradually increasing the number of beads. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Stamens and Pestles </h2><p>  The petals of future flowers appeared on our hands.  Now we will create the cores that we put in our tulips from beads. </p><p>  The weaving pattern is very simple.  For stamens, you need to cut 3 pieces of wire of 20 centimeters.  We take in hand a piece, string on it two long glass tubes and one bead.  The bead is a pommel, we pass the wire back through a row of bugles.  We make two more stamens. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weaving tulips from beads" class="if" height="249" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13542/349642.jpg?1394279319445" width="476"></div>

      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Now in turn is a yellow pestle.  For him, we cut off a piece of 20 centimeters from the wire, put three beads on it, fitting them to the middle of the segment.  Gently twist the ends of the wire and pass them through three glass beads. </p><p>  Put together the <span>stamens and pestle.</span>  To the last in a circle we fasten the black antennae of the stamens. </p><h2>  Doing foliage </h2><p>  We already have elements of inflorescences.  But tulips from beads still have leaves.  Let's do at least one. </p>

You will need to cut two pieces of wire: smaller and larger.  Then you need to twist them together.  We collect green beads on the central rod.  We will start from 4 centimeters.  We finish the first rows neatly at the top of the main row.  But the subsequent ones should not reach the top.  Cling the wire to the fourth or fifth bead from the top of the previous row.  As a result, you get teeth.  Five rows must be strung on each side.

      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  In the final, we put a bead on the central wire, we pass the wire through the main rod.  The sheet is ready. </p><h2>  We collect flowers from beads </h2><p>  Tulips left to collect.  We pick up our core.  Three internal petals must be screwed to it.  In this case, the bright part is located below, at the base of the flower.  We position the external petals so that they overlap the joints of the internal petals. </p><p>  We straighten the remains of wires, for rigidity we enclose a piece of a more rigid wire.  It was the turn to use a floral ribbon or a green thread.  She needs to tightly wrap the stem.  And somewhere in the middle of the stem you will need to add a leaf.  At the tip of the stalk, fix the winding with glue so that it does not fray. </p><h2>  We embroider flowers </h2><p>  If you prefer not volumetric weaving, but beadwork, tulips can be depicted on a piece of canvas. </p>

It has everything you need for work: colored beads, threads, canvas, needles, a frame for the finished picture.  Sometimes such sets are accompanied by instructions demonstrating how embroidery from beads is created.

    <p>  For experienced craftswomen it will not be difficult to create their own sketch.  And already fill it with life.  Bead embroidery is similar to cross stitching.  You need to move in even rows, laying out a pattern from multi-colored beads.  For the picture, take even, identical in size and structure of beads.  Otherwise, the whole picture will ‚Äúlead‚Äù. </p><p>  Tulips from beads are collected in bouquets.  Three-dimensional <span>decorative panels</span> are created from them <span>.</span>  An interesting option is the creation of handmade jewelry.  Tiny tulips can act as pendants, earrings.  Their austere and graceful inflorescences can adorn loriates.  These are long bead cords.  Their ends are not connected, as in necklaces, but are free.  Loriates gently tie around the neck, like ties or scarves.  It‚Äôs at the ends of such decorations that spring tulips can bloom.  Bracelets and massive hryvnias with flowers embroidered with small beads look very unusual and elegant. </p>
