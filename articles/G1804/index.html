Who is it?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Middle Ages is associated with noble knights who are able to perform feats for the sake of a beautiful lady.  Stone <span>castles, feudal lords,</span> serfs and Catholic churches.  Iron and blood - this is a brief description of the Middle Ages.  In the Middle Ages, religion ruled.  Peasants worked on the lands of the feudal lords.  In everyday life, people lacked fine art and exploits.  Therefore, a culture of chivalry appeared. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knightly battle" class="if uuid-2527375" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90029/2527375.jpg"></div><p>  Knights are a privileged layer of society in the Middle Ages.  This concept applies to all feudal warriors.  They had their own code of conduct and honor, the basic principles of which are faith, honor and valor. </p><h2>  The history of chivalry in Europe </h2><p>  At the beginning of the 10th century, the states of Europe were fragmented and represented many small principalities, leading constant wars.  Each principality had its own system of self-government, tax collection, and assignment of duties.  The life of those filed in such states was difficult. </p><p>  The prototype of the knights were lightly armed riders who dominated the Holy Roman Empire.  Later they began to create religious orders, such as the Templars, hospitals and pilgrims to Jerusalem.  During this period, feudal land tenure began to spread, a layer of soldiers who defended the feudal lords formed.  The knights were lightly armed warriors, vassals of their master.  The main duty of the soldiers was to protect the honor of their lord and his land from the encroachments of other rulers.  In each country, knights performed different roles.  So, in England they defended kings.  The title itself was inherited.  In Germany, knights were higher in position than ordinary inhabitants, but they were non-equal citizens anyway.  Moreover, they had power over the villagers.  There was a law prohibiting the inhabitants of the city from having knightly weapons.  In France, there was a ceremony of initiation into knights. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.vocfm.co.za" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crusades to Jerusalem" class="if uuid-2525892" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90029/2525892.jpg"></div><p>  Over time, warriors became the highest class of society, and they got rid of <span>vassal dependence.</span>  With the onset of feudal fragmentation, they became like robbers.  They plundered rich houses, attacked the neighboring duchies.  After the invention of firearms, knights, as a military force, ceased to exist and became an aristocratic class. </p><h2>  Knights Wanderers </h2><p>  After the appearance of the estate of knights who defended their masters, wandering knights appeared.  They did not stay to live on their estates, but left to travel around the world in order to obtain immortal glory.  The white knight traveled to foreign countries, defended the poor, studied etiquette and met ladies and seniors.  They always followed a code of honor. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tokkoro.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Medieval castle" class="if uuid-2523863" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90029/2523863.jpg"></div><p>  Wandering knights were especially popular in France.  Many written testimonies of the French soldiers who visited the northern countries have survived.  Jacques de Laden, or Glorious Knight, took part in knightly fights.  It was honorably received by the royal courts of Scotland, Portugal and Argon.  After returning to their home country, the heroes reported to the seniors, told stories about their exploits.  Based on these stories, troubadours composed legends about the heroic deeds of glorious warriors.  It happened that at one court several wandering warriors gathered.  Then they united and went camping with a high purpose.  The dukes willingly invited wandering knights to castles to listen to tales of exploits.  So the owner of the castle, showing generosity to the wanderer, hoped that his merits would be told to the king.  Later, helmets began to be depicted on the gates - a sign of hospitality and a shelter for white knights. </p><h2>  Glyph of Honor </h2><p>  For the warrior, the main value was <span>weapons.</span>  <span>The knightly sword</span> carried good and justice to the harsh medieval world.  Swords consecrated on the altar and gave names.  And if necessary, on the battlefield, before him, one could pray and receive a blessing.  And the expression "break the sword" meant to be defeated by the enemy. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In legends, the knights were surrounded by a halo of romanticism and the struggle for justice.  But in the realities of medieval life, they turned out to be cruel warriors who played the role of servants for their feudal lords. </p><div class="photo" data-original="forhonor.wikia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knights Conquest" class="if uuid-2524519" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90029/2524519.jpg"></div><p>  In contrast to them, white knights appeared who did not stay for long in one country, but wandered around the world in search of feats and gaining fame </p>
