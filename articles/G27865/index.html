    <h2>  Birth and childhood </h2><p>  Klim Alexandrovich Zhukov is a historian in the future, was born on March 29, 1977 in the city of Leningrad (present-day St. Petersburg).  The ancestors of the male line of his father, <span>Alexander Zhukov</span> , came from the Orenburg Cossacks - the second oldest Cossack army in Russia.  But the ancestors of the grandmother on the paternal side from time immemorial lived in St. Petersburg, that is, they were local. </p><p>  Klim studied quite successfully at his hometown school.  The turning points associated with the collapse of the USSR occurred just when he was a teenager, which to a large extent affected the worldview of the future historian. </p><h2>  Study </h2><p>  Upon graduation, Klim Aleksandrovich in 1994 entered the Faculty of History of one of the most prestigious and sought-after universities in the Russian Federation - St. Petersburg State University.  SPbSU is the oldest institution of higher education in Russia.  It was opened in 1724 at the direction of Peter I, and was named the Academy of Sciences.  In 1819, the university was granted university status.  Such outstanding Russians as Mikhail Lomonosov, Pyotr Semyonov Tien-Shansky, Kliment Timiryazev, <span>Vasily Dokuchaev</span> and others studied and taught in it.  The university acquired its real name in 1991. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Naturally, an institution with such a glorious history and reputation made rather high demands on students, and released real high-class specialists from its walls. </p><p>  Five years after admission, Zhukov graduates from this educational institution with a degree in Medieval Studies (history of the Middle Ages).  The graduate thesis is dedicated to a <span>two-handed sword</span> in Italy and Germany of the XV ‚Äî XVII centuries.  From then on, we can say that Zhukov Klim is a historian. </p><p>  In the same year, he enters the graduate school of the Institute for the History of Material Cultures in a department that specializes in Slavic-Finnish mythology.  This time, the topic of the dissertation was devoted to Russian armor of the 13th-15th centuries, and the scientific adviser was the doctor of historical sciences, and Honored Scientist of the Russian Federation Anatoly Nikolaevich Kirpichnikov.  It was Kirpichnikov who at one time directed the excavations carried out by a group of archaeologists in Staraya Ladoga. </p><h2>  Work in the Hermitage </h2><p>  At the same time he entered graduate school, Zhukov got a job in the numismatics department of the Hermitage.  This is one of the largest cultural and historical museums of the Russian Federation.  It is located in St. Petersburg, and was founded back in 1852, as the Imperial Hermitage.  Here are collected the most valuable exhibits in the field of culture and history. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 2004, Zhukov transferred to the Arsenal weapons history department.  In 2005, he became an employee of the Museum-on-Line holding, which operates under the Hermitage.  At the same time, he teaches at the Russian Christian Institute in St. Petersburg, and lectures at the Student Society of the Hermitage. </p><p>  In 2008, Klim Zhukov left the Hermitage in order to devote himself completely to literature and cinema. </p><h2>  Participation in historical reconstruction projects </h2><p>  Zhukov Klim, a historian, gained wide public fame thanks to his participation in various popular science and reconstruction projects. </p><p>  He is the head of the Swordsman Reconstruction Club, and the Livonian Order interclub association.  He is one of the main organizers of the inter-club association of historical reconstruction "Grand Company", and the Association of medieval BI. </p>

    <p>  In addition, Klim Zhukov is an official expert of the Guildhall School of Music and Theater, located in the British capital, London. </p><h2>  Participation in Internet projects </h2><p>  He is also widely known on the Internet as a blogger, leads his pages on the portals Warspot (devoted to military history) and Red Tips. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Klim Zhukov is a regular participant in the broadcast on the Youtube channel "Intelligence Interrogation", which is conducted by blogger and translator Dmitry Puchkov, known to a wide audience as Goblin.  In this program, Zhukov acts as a historical expert with lectures that are posted not only directly on YouTube, but also on Dmitry Puchkov‚Äôs website, as well as on the federal portal History.  One of his most famous video lectures from this series is called ‚ÄúThe historian Klim Zhukov about the history of science‚Äù.  In it, he says in the words of <span>Yuri Lotman</span> that history consists of two parts: scientific and humanitarian.  The scientific part strictly operates with facts, and the humanitarian interprets them. </p>

    <p>  In 2016, he took part in a conference organized by the largest scientific and historical portal Anthropogenesis, where he made a presentation. </p><h2>  Scientific works </h2><p>  Quite a lot of works were published by the historian Klim Zhukov.  The bibliography of this scientist will be discussed below.  It is thanks to these works that he claims to be a man who contributes to modern Russian academic historical science. </p><p>  In 2005 - 2008, Zhukov published three books on uniforms and military armor of various times in Europe.  One of these books is about the Middle Ages, the other is about the Renaissance, and the attention of the third work is devoted to European cavalry.  He wrote the first two books in collaboration with experts such as D. S. Korovkin, A. M. Butyagin and D. P. Aleksinsky. </p><p>  Also, Klim Zhukov wrote several articles, mainly about armor and military archeology.  Among them are the article ‚ÄúOverseas Shells‚Äù (2005), as well as the preface to the publication of George Cameron Stone's book on armor (2008).  Since then, it has become clear that Klim Zhukov is a military historian, and not a representative of another branch of this science. </p><p>  Among other things, it was Klim Zhukov that Astrel Publishing House entrusted to the scientific editors of the translation of two books of the above famous American weapons specialist of the late XIX - first half of the XX century, George Cameron Stone.  These books were published in Russia in 2008 and 2010, respectively. </p><p>  The historian Klim Zhukov about science, including history, speaks of an important tool of cognition that is passed on to new generations from past generations. </p><h2>  Methodology </h2><p>  In the applied methodology, when writing scientific works, Klim Zhukov uses various historical concepts.  But he nevertheless makes the main emphasis on historical and dialectical materialism, which are based on the theory of Karl Marx. </p><p>  This position is also related to Zhukov‚Äôs political views, which we will discuss below. </p><h2>  Fantastic works </h2><p>  But not only Klim Zhukov is a historian.  He also owns several literary works in the genre of science fiction, which have been published since 2010. </p><p>  The first work of art by Klim Zhukov to be released was a science fiction novel co-authored with Ekaterina Antonenko ‚ÄúThe Soldier of the Emperor‚Äù.  This book was published as part of the Ultimate Weapon series by Eksmo in 2010.  But, despite the completely fantastic plot, this work had a historical setting. </p><p>  Since 2010, Zhukov‚Äôs creative union begins with authors working under the pseudonym Alexander Zorich.  These are the writers Yana Botsman and Dmitry Gordevsky.  Klim Zhukov got acquainted with the work of Alexander Zorich in 2006 by reading the trilogy ‚ÄúTomorrow will be war‚Äù.  After that, he truly imbued literary fiction and became a fan of the authors' talent. </p>

    <p>  Klim Zhukov together with them worked on a series of fantastic works ‚ÄúPilot‚Äù.  The action in it takes place in the same fictional universe as the events in the trilogy ‚ÄúTomorrow will be war‚Äù.  In 2011, the Astrel Publishing House published the first book of the cycle - The Dream Pilot.  In 2012 - the remaining three books: ‚ÄúThe Pilot Outlawed‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Special Purpose Pilot‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Pilot in War‚Äù. </p><p>  So far, the products of Klim Zhukov's literary work have been exhausted, but we will be waiting for new interesting fantastic works. </p><h2>  Historian or writer? </h2><p>  But do not forget that first of all Klim Zhukov is a historian.  Books on fantastic subjects that have come out of his pen are given back by historicism, although they have nothing to do with real historical events. </p><p>  But still, it seems that Klim Zhukov abandoned history for the career of a science fiction writer.  Indeed, since 2010, not a single of his scientific work has been published.  At the same time, it was in 2010 that he densely switched to literary activity.  His activity as a historian from this period consists only in participation in various reconstruction communities, which have only a tangential relationship to scientific history, as well as in lectures in programs such as "Intelligence Interrogation" by Dmitry Puchkov and in articles on the Internet. </p>

    <p>  At the same time, it should be noted that after 2012, not a single artistic work of Klim Zhukov was published.  So the literary career of this, of course, talented personality is also in question. </p><p>  But I want to believe that in the future he will be able to find the strength to fully realize all his talents.  Let's hope that the time will come when everyone will know that Zhukov Klim is a world-famous historian and an outstanding science fiction writer. </p><h2>  Political Views </h2><p>  Now let's look at what they promised earlier - the political views of Klim Zhukov. </p><p>  In his own words, Klim Zhukov, he adheres to the ideology of communism.  But at the same time, the historian is not a member of any party and in the near future is not going to join the Communist Party or another organization of communist orientation.  At the same time, it is periodically published on the Red Sovets portal, which serves as a tool for propagating socialist, communist and leftist ideas. </p><p>  It should be noted that similar views are shared by a friend of Klim Zhukov, a well-known blogger Dmitry Puchkov. </p><h2>  general characteristics </h2>

    <p>  So, we studied the biography of the historian and writer Klim Zhukov.  As you can see, this person is quite diverse.  He writes scientific works, fantastic works, participates in popular Internet projects, is one of the leaders of the historical reconstruction movement.  In each of these areas of activity, he has already received honor and respect as a specialist.  But at the same time, it should be noted that spraying into several areas at once, he has not yet been able to achieve, indeed, outstanding results in any of them.  But let's hope that the list of world-famous scientists in the future will nevertheless be replenished with such a person as historian Klim Zhukov.  The photo above shows that he is a rather purposeful person, and it is quite possible that if not now, then in the future he will be able to achieve outstanding results not only in one field of activity, but in all directions he took up. </p><p>  Good luck in all your endeavors to the Russian military historian and science fiction writer Klim Aleksandrovich Zhukov!  After all, his work really enriches culture and historical science. </p>
