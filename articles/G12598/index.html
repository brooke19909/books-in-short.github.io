Erected at the end of the 14th century, the building survived not only many events, but also several major reconstructions over its long history. </p><h2>  The beginning of the story </h2><p>  It is believed that the first description of the Old Town Hall in Munich dates from 1310.  It was built on the eastern side of the Marienplatz square, where at the same time there was already a tower that served as a defensive structure.  The gates of the tower were the main, through them products and various household goods were imported into the city.  According to historical documents, it was in this place that one of the main road arteries of the country was located.  It was along this road that merchants entered the city, drove cattle, and troops passed along with all military guns.  A few decades later, an extensive hall was added to the tower, then some outbuildings.  The city was expanding, and by the beginning of the 14th century the tower had lost its status as a defensive structure and turned into an ordinary tower at the Town Hall. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Medieval Town Hall View" class="if uuid-3140390" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/3140390.jpg"></div><p>  The history of the Town Hall in Munich is quite rich.  The building, in the form in which it appears to tourists now, was built over a period of ten years, from 1470 to 1480.  The work was supervised by the then-famous master J√∂rg von Halsbach.  Not far from the building was located a popular drinking house throughout the county.  After meetings in the Town Hall, all participants often moved there and it was there that they completed their negotiations. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Architectural changes </h2><p>  In 1460, lightning struck the building and caused serious damage.  The late Gothic style, which J√∂rg von Halsbach gave to the Old Town Hall in Munich, remained until about the middle of the 16th century.  Then it was reconstructed again, and Renaissance architects introduced changes in the Renaissance style.  In 1861, the building again underwent a major overhaul, now with the introduction of elements of the Neo-Gothic style.  By the way, the building received its name ‚ÄúOld Town Hall‚Äù during this period.  The name has survived to the present day.  Until 1874, the Munich City Council held meetings in the building.  In 1874, he moved to a new building next door, and simply the Town Hall turned into the Old Town Hall. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.muenchen.tv" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Marienplatz square" class="if uuid-3140238" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3140238.jpg"></div><h2>  Marienplatz Square </h2><p>  One of the main attractions for which tourists are willing to travel long distances is Marienplatz - the main square in Munich.  The old town hall is inextricably linked with it: when they talk about the square, they mean the Town Hall, and vice versa.  All hiking trails lead to the city center, to Marienplatz.  For its centuries-old existence, the area has changed several names.  Market Square is the first name, as the Wine Market, Egg, Hay, Fish, and Meat Market were located on this territory.  In addition, the market played the role of a temporary transfer point.  It was here that the Salt Road passed.  With the development of tillage and the spread of grain, the area after several decades received the name Grain. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.abendzeitung-muenchen.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Old Town Hall Hall" class="if uuid-3140247" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3140247.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get to the Town Hall </h2><p>  In Munich, the address of the Old Town Hall is: 15. Marienplatz Square 15. If you arrived in Munich on your own, you can get to the city center in three ways: taxi, train or shuttle bus.  Two lines of trains run through the central station. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="48.13664480000001" data-lng="11.57680700000003" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/5/5/5/3/15553.png"></div><p>  If you choose a shuttle bus, then keep in mind that on average, the journey will take about an hour.  Public transport is located at the main exit of the airport.  Buses arrive on a schedule with an interval of 20 minutes.  The ticket price is about eight euros. </p><p>  Taxis are easy to order at the airport terminal at special racks, you can use private cars or order transport on your own by downloading the application on your smartphone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.muenchen.de" data-author=": Katy Spicha, "><img itemprop="image" alt="View of the Old Town Hall" class="if uuid-3140260" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3140260.jpg"></div><h2>  Crystal night </h2><p>  An event has been associated with the Old Town Hall in Munich, which will forever leave a mark in the history of the development of mankind.  Everyone knows that during the Second World War, the Nazis brutally persecuted and destroyed Jews as a nation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  On the night of November 9-10, 1938, a wave of clearly coordinated pogroms swept across Nazi Germany.  Robberies were committed by military units and individual citizens who sympathized with them.  Only retail outlets and synagogues of the Jews were attacked.  In the shops and buildings, all the windows were smashed, the windows were smashed to smithereens. </p><p>  The reason for such a massive destruction was the attack of a young Polish Jew against a German diplomat who served in the German Embassy in France.  This attempt was perceived by Nazi leaders as an attempt on the Fuhrer himself.  This precedent was the starting point for the persecution and persecution of Jews.  And the halls of the Old Town Hall are the place where, according to historical documents, Hitler with his associates developed the details of this operation. </p><h2>  Old Town Hall and War </h2><p>  The Nazis certainly created a bad name for the Old Town Hall in Munich.  During the war, the tower was seriously damaged.  In 1944, the tower and the main building of the Town Hall were completely destroyed by bombs, which drove allied aircraft into the area. </p><p>  After the war, ten years later, the restoration of the Old Town Hall building began.  The well-known architect Erwin Schleich took up this matter.  Reconstruction began in 1953.  For five years, he managed to restore the Ballroom and several small rooms.  The second phase of construction began in 1971.  For four years, the craftsmen managed to restore the tower.  Two years later, the Council Hall was recreated.  When reconstructing the general appearance of the Old Town Hall, experts were guided by its appearance in the 15th century.  Therefore, the period of the Neo-Gothic restoration can be seen in the pictures in architectural reference books and art books. </p><h2>  Toy museum </h2><p>  In Munich, in the Old Town Hall on Marienplatz (the main square of the city), is located one of the most remarkable museums - the Toy Museum.  Four floors of the building are allocated for exhibits.  This is a significant part of it.  The collection is very extensive.  There are carousels, tin soldiers, animals, railways and trains.  Several types of dolls: porcelain, wooden, even straw exhibits of American and European production are found. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kimapa.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum Entrance" class="if uuid-3140254" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3140254.jpg"></div><p>  The Steiger family owns the collection.  The museum is open every day from 10.00 to 17.00, with the exception of national holidays.  The ticket will cost four euros.  On the ground floor, at the exit, a small souvenir shop has settled down, where sellers will be happy to help you choose a nice inexpensive present for your family and friends. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nerdindeutschland.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dolls at the Toy Museum" class="if uuid-3140256" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3140256.jpg"></div><h2>  Tourists from Germany </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the Old Town Hall in Munich belongs to Germany and the entire German people, there are tourists who come from other parts of the country on purpose.  Not only people interested in history and architecture seek to get acquainted with the national treasure, to see it live, and not from the press or books.  Munich is located in Bavaria - the most famous part of Germany, where the favorite Oktoberfest beer festival takes place.  People who come at this time of year are especially interested in the sights of the city, and, of course, with the Old Town Hall. </p><h2>  Tourists from all over the world </h2><p>  Almost everyone dreams of driving around Europe.  And Germany as a country with a developed infrastructure, rich history and culture occupies a leading position in popularity among tourists. </p><p>  The acquaintance of tourists with Munich begins directly from the city center and with its main attractions - Marienplatz Square, the New and Old Town Halls.  The latter at first glance is not particularly impressive for travelers.  Its faded, somewhat "shabby" appearance and simple, even austere architecture does not fit with its venerable age of seven hundred years.  Guided tours tell the story of the Old Town Hall from its inception at the beginning of the fourteenth century, the Middle Ages.  Therefore, tourists initially imagine the pathos Gothic structure, decorated with mythical creatures, huge and gloomy.  A deeper acquaintance softens the impression of the Town Hall. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.yourmunichtour.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum exposition" class="if uuid-3140283" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3140283.jpg"></div><p>  The interior, the Ballroom and the Museum of Toys delight tourists, especially those who travel with children.  After conducting tours of the building, most guests admit that they are shocked and surprised at what they saw.  The unique collection of American and European toys in the museum, the Hall of the Soviets and secondary, utility rooms, despite the multiple restoration, preserve the spirit of old Munich.  Those who have got acquainted with Munich and its sights plan to return here again and take away with them a photo of the Old Town Hall in Munich.  And, of course, lovely German souvenirs. </p>
