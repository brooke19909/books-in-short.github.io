The turquoise Caribbean Sea, a huge number of emerald palms, the white sand of beaches, mild climate - all this attracts tourists from all over the world.  Cancun is considered the most prestigious and most visited resort in Mexico.  Rest here involves not only a measured beach relaxation, but also the opportunity to see numerous historical monuments.  Tourists who come to Cancun must visit the ancient Mayan pyramids, go in for deep sea fishing, shopping, take anti-aging and wellness treatments in SPA centers, etc. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  At this amazing resort, warm weather reigns all year round.  Cancun from Spanish translates as "snakes", but do not be afraid: there are no poisonous reptiles on this sunny peninsula. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": Family Vacation Hub, " data-source="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/533817362059847933/?autologin=true"><img itemprop="image" alt="park rakret" class="if uuid-2253099" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2253099.jpg"></div><p>  The resort is famous for its comfortable hotels corresponding to the world level, entertainment facilities and, of course, archaeological sites.  It is here that many places of worship and eco-parks are located, for example, Shkaret Park.  Mexico, Cancun in particular, which hosts hundreds of thousands of tourists every year, invites travelers in a mild tropical climate to spend a vacation, engage in a variety of water sports and, of course, see such historical places that many of us have only read and watched films about.  And first of all it concerns Chichen Itza - the capital of the ancient Mayan civilization, about which more than one popular science film has been shot.  Cancun as a resort was founded in the sixties of the last century.  In 1967, Mexican analysts, deciding to surpass Acapulco, decided to create a world-class tourist center here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Holidays in Cancun </h2><p>  Today, the beaches of this resort are famous all over the world.  The city has built many upscale hotels, annually hosting a huge number of tourists.  But not only Cancun is famous for beach vacations.  There are a lot of attractions.  Therefore, those who combine a beach holiday with an informative one come here more often.  I must say that there are a lot of historical monuments.  And one of them is the eco-archaeological park Shkaret (Xcaret).  It is about him that will be discussed in this article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.differentworld.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.differentworld.com/features/xcaret/"><img itemprop="image" alt="River rafting" class="if uuid-2253102" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2253102.jpg"></div><p>  We will try to tell about the history of this amazing archaeological site, share reviews of those who have already visited this amazing place. </p><h2>  Park Shkaret </h2><p>  Mexico annually receives millions of tourists, many of whom come to Cancun.  And this is not surprising, because for vacationers there is everything: upscale hotels located on the seashore, well-developed infrastructure, and many places that are worth visiting.  One of the last is Shkaret Park (Mexico).  It is considered one of the most popular recreational attractions on the territory of the Riviera Maya - a hundred-kilometer coastal strip - stretching from Tulum to Cancun.  This part of the peninsula began to develop relatively recently.  The main contingent of tourists are tourists from Europe.  Xcaret <span>Eco-Theme Park</span> is a unique place.  Everything here is literally saturated with the culture of the ancient Mayan civilization.  Tourists can walk around the ruins left by the ancient Aboriginal settlement, take part in national games, watch a grandiose show, and admire nature. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  A place to visit </h2><p>  There is hardly a person who, having arrived in Cancun even for a short time, would not have seen Shkaret Park.  Mexico, as you know, is famous for its amazing sights.  After all, this country has a very ancient and interesting history.  However, Shkaret Park (Mexico) is the place where, to a certain extent, almost all the sights of this corner of the world are collected, where its most interesting amazing history and the versatility of life of local Aborigines is shown.  Before the arrival of the Spaniards, there was a center on its territory where Mayan Indians held their religious ceremonies. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="waterfall in the park" class="if uuid-2253106" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2253106.jpg"></div><p>  Today, a giant <span>ecological amusement</span> park Shkaret is built on this site.  Xcaret Park received its first visitors more than a quarter century ago.  Opened in 1990, it is constantly growing and developing.  To date, its saturation with various attractions and sizes have grown so much that getting around it in one day, judging by the reviews, is almost impossible. </p><p>  Sightseeing tours tell tourists not only about the missing Mayan civilization.  Shkaret Park (Mexico) is an opportunity to admire the amazing nature, to travel along the incredibly beautiful Paradise River with a visit to the deer reservation and the jaguar reserve, swimming with dolphins, tasting dishes of national cuisine and much more.  In total, on its territory adults and children can take advantage of four dozens of attractions - cultural, educational and simply extreme. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  History </h2><p>  Translated from the ancient Mayan language, the word "rakret" means "small bay."  Today Xcaret is the most popular unique national park not only in Cancun, but throughout Mexico - on the Caribbean coast of this country.  When in 1984, a local architect named Miguel Quintana Pali, acquired a plot of land in the Riviera Maya, his plans were only to build his own house.  However, in the process of preparing the site, he unexpectedly stumbled upon the amazing cenote craters and underground rivers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.differentworld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tortoise farm" class="if uuid-2253109" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2253109.jpg"></div><p>  These were the failures resulting from the collapse of the arches of the limestone caves located here. </p><p>  Pali, after consulting with specialists, decided to open a large park with friends.  Thus, on the territory of one of the ceremonial centers of the Mayan tribe, Xcaret arose.  Today, there is an eco-archaeological park with numerous monuments of the ancient culture of this amazing civilization.  Tropical nature, animals that live almost on the wild, beautiful beaches and vibrant evening performances, set on the theme of the history of Mexico, in which about two hundred people take part - all this is Shkaret.  There are many predators.  The most dangerous animals, such as cougars, jaguars, etc., live in enclosed enclosures behind a deep moat and a low stone fence. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  So what is this amazing ecological park?  It is almost impossible to answer this question in one word.  This is the <span>botanical garden, in</span> which there is a farm for growing orchids, as well as a huge variety of beautiful trees, shrubs and exotic flowers, and a zoo where you can see an incredible number of unique butterflies and reptiles, predators, birds and other representatives of the animal world. </p><div class="photo" data-original="everythingplayadelcarmen.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Maya Life Show" class="if uuid-2253114" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2253114.jpg"></div><p>  Shkaret is a huge theater, in different corners of which you can participate in various ceremonies, get acquainted with the dances of the Indians, and in the evenings watch vivid performances in the tent.  But first of all, tourists come to an amusement park, where there is a long (more than half a kilometer) underground river, along which travelers travel exclusively in life jackets.  Here visitors are given the opportunity to swim in the aquarium with coral fish or in a large pond with dolphins.  Fans of extreme sports will enjoy rafting in the park jungle or climbing a rotating platform with a panoramic view. </p><p>  In addition, you can visit the tortoise farm and the butterfly park, ride on the sand of the beach or go snorkeling, which you can rent.  That's why tourists come all day to Shkaret Park (Mexico).  The reviews of our compatriots indicate that the vast majority will forever remember visiting this unique place. </p><h2>  Show </h2><p>  Every year at Christmas in Shkaret you can see colorful processions and exciting events that are dedicated to the gardens.  These were mendicant monks who arrived on the continent simultaneously with the Spaniards.  ‚ÄúFlying people‚Äù is a famous attraction that offers visitors to the Shkaret Park (Mexico).  It presents the culture of ‚Äúvoladores‚Äù, ranked by UNESCO as an intangible heritage.  Four dancers suspended from a pole, like bangui jumpers, perform complicated acrobatic elements to the accompaniment of national music. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cancunassist.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rafting on the Paradise River" class="if uuid-2253117" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2253117.jpg"></div><p>  ‚ÄúField of Fine Arts‚Äù - this is the name of the most popular performance that tourists who see the Shkaret Park in Mexico can see.  The plot of the night show tells about the life of the country before and after its capture by the Spaniards. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Xcaret Park is a little over 70 kilometers from Cancun.  Five kilometers from it is another resort - Playa del Carmen.  The park is located on the federal highway leading from Cancun to Chetumal.  Geographically, it is part of the state of Quintana Roo. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="20.5809134" data-lng="-87.11969799999997" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/6/1/9/619.png"></div><p>  If you travel by taxi to Shkaret on your own from Cancun, then such a trip will cost about one hundred dollars (‚âà6000 rub.).  Many people prefer to get to it by public transport from the bus station or rent a car.  The journey from Cancun takes about an hour and a half.  Shkaret Park in Mexico is so popular that locals come here on a par with tourists, who are chosen by families in Xcaret for the weekend.  This entertainment facility operates year-round. </p><h2>  Advice </h2><p>  Experienced travelers who have already visited this wonderful park recommend taking a photo or video camera with them, a sunscreen, sunglasses, and a bathing suit.  Particular attention should be paid to shoes: they should be so comfortable that you can walk in them for a long time.  It should be borne in mind that in comparison with the city in Shkaret, food and drinks have fairly high prices, so you should take care of this in advance: take food with you. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sunwing.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Indians in a boat" class="if uuid-2253122" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2253122.jpg"></div><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  Automatic cameras are located throughout the park, on which tourists are shot against the backdrop of their favorite attractions.  Pictures can be taken at the exit.  Of course, they are quite expensive, but judging by the reviews, this does not stop anyone: after all, they do not go to Mexico every month.  Another interesting information for those who come to this North American country.  Many are interested in where to stay in Mexico at the Shkaret Park.  The hotel which is closest to this eco-monument is called Occidental at Xcaret Destination (5 *).  Guests of this hotel complex can receive Unlimited Xcaret Xperience - a special package of services with unlimited access to the park. </p><h2>  Impressions of tourists </h2><p>  I must say that quite a lot of Russians have already visited Shkaret Park in Mexico.  Reviews from tourists indicate that this is an amazing place.  A lot of pools and lagoons, excursions in the thick of the mangrove jungle, the opportunity to get closer to the culture of the ancient Mayans - this is not all that you can do in the park.  Many were surprised that, despite the huge number of visitors, there are no queues anywhere.  The park has an incredible atmosphere that makes you come back here more than once. </p>
