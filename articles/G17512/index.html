    <h2>  Calibration Features </h2><p>  Forums on the Internet are full of all sorts of calibration tips.  In general, there are only a few proven methods, they will help to complete the task.  As mentioned above, the biggest problem for many smartphones running Android OS is the battery.  Calibration can occur as follows: </p><ol><li>  On smartphones with Root access (2 methods). </li><li>  Without Root access (also 2 methods). </li></ol><p>  We will talk about each of them in detail later.  The calibration process itself is relevant only if the phone really runs out quickly (in less than 5 hours of average load) or a high battery charge is displayed (90-95%), and the cell phone turns off for no reason.  It is in such cases that it is worth thinking about calibration. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="android battery calibration without root" class="if" height="292" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41781/1206700.jpg" width="600"></div>

You can find out from several sources: from the Internet, in the passport of your device or directly on the battery, where the required number should be written.  Next, we observe the following algorithm of actions: </p><ol><li>  We go to the Play Market, where we search and install the program CurrentWidget: Battery Monitor, which will show the battery charge in milliamps. </li><li>  Tracking the charge level, we charge the smartphone to the mark that is provided by the manufacturer. </li><li>  When the desired charge is reached, turn off the phone and turn it on again.  A device reboot is required in order to determine what the true battery level is currently. </li><li>  Repeat 2-3 times if necessary. </li></ol><p>  After such simple manipulations, your smartphone should remember the required charge level by correctly displaying data on your Android.  The battery, the calibration of which was carried out more than once, will no longer be able to show high results of autonomy, so you will have to think about replacing it. </p><p>  Some phones have a ‚Äúdefault calibration‚Äù function.  In order to start it, go to the battery settings item (Menu - Settings - Battery), where we select "Calibration" from the drop-down list.  We start, wait 10-15 minutes and charge the device.  On this all your actions end. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="android samsung battery calibration" class="if" height="468" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41781/1206704.jpg" width="600"></div>

The algorithm is as follows: </p><ol><li>  In order to calibrate, we charge the battery to the maximum, after which we turn off the charger and the phone itself.  Then we connect the charging cable to the switched off device and continue charging until the LED indicator turns green, which will mean a full charge of the battery. </li><li>  We start the smartphone again and turn off the possibility of switching to "Sleep mode".  As a rule, this can be done in the display settings.  Perform this action is to ensure that the smartphone is discharged as quickly as possible. </li><li>  After waiting for the moment when the charge level drops to around 1-2%, we reconnect the charger so that Android can properly consume battery resources and observe the full cycle of work.  Do not forget to return the <span>"Sleep Mode" back.</span> </li></ol><p>  All this will improve the performance of your Android.  The battery (calibration of which was carried out earlier) will be able to hold a charge longer and will display data correctly. </p><h2>  Calibration with Root Access: Method 1 </h2><p>  If you have Root access (that is, superuser mode is enabled) to the files, do the following: </p><ol><li>  Install the Battery Calibration application so that the Android battery calibrates properly.  The program will show the exact <span>battery level,</span> and not the data that is displayed. </li><li>  We continue to charge the smartphone until the application shows the 100% mark.  When the battery has reached full capacity, click "Battery Calibration". </li><li>  Then we reboot the device and enjoy the tuned device for the Android OS. </li></ol><p>  This completes the first method with Root access. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="calibrate new android battery" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41781/1206703.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <h2>  Calibration with Root Access: Method 2 </h2><p>  So, do the following: </p><ol><li>  We go into Recovery mode and go to the "Advanced" section.  There we look for the Wipe battery stats menu item, which will delete all calibrations performed by the user earlier. </li><li>  Then we completely discharge the device until it turns off by itself. </li><li>  After that, we put the smartphone back on charge and, not including it, charge up to 100%. </li><li>  We start the device without disconnecting the power <span>cable,</span> and then carry out the calibration in the Battery Calibration program.  This step will further enhance the settings, making it clear to the OS what is required of it. </li></ol><p>  In general, the above methods are the main ways to calibrate the battery. </p><h2>  Calibrating the battery on an Android tablet </h2><p>  The tablet market today is very diverse, because a rather compact device sometimes replaces a stationary PC or laptop, which is very convenient for frequent trips.  Of course, most of all devices are running Android OS.  As in the case of smartphones, the devices are discharged very quickly, which is very unfortunate.  Calibrating the battery on tablets is no different from that on phones, because the operating principle of the OS itself does not change. </p><p>  Next, we present the algorithm proposed by Google to the developer of the Android OS.  The battery, the calibration of which will be performed in compliance with all instructions, will show the best autonomy and correct operation. </p><ol><li>  We charge the tablet to the maximum.  Even if we are informed that the process is over, we continue to charge the gadget.  The first item must be at least 8 hours.  Of course, the device itself must be turned on. </li><li>  Then we take out the charger from the outlet and turn off the tablet. </li><li>  Again, we begin to charge the device for an hour, after which we pull out the power cable and turn on the device.  We keep it in this state for a couple of minutes, after which we turn it off again and put it on charge again. </li><li>  After another hour, disconnect the charge and turn on the tablet, enjoying the fact that the Android battery has successfully calibrated. </li></ol><p>  Samsung, Asus, Lenovo and other market giants, as a rule, produce high-quality products that do not save on details.  So there should not be any special problems with calibration.  If all else fails, you should consider buying a new battery.  As a tip: do not use USB very often as a charger, as this can cool a tablet or smartphone. </p>

    <h2>  Myths and their refutation </h2><p>  Often we meet people who are advised to ‚Äúswing‚Äù or ‚Äútrain‚Äù the battery by completely discharging the battery.  Once the memory effect really worked, but it was relevant for nickel-metal hydride batteries, which are not found on the modern market.  Today, all devices are equipped with lithium batteries that do not have such a feature.  Moreover, deep charge-discharge cycles adversely affect the operation of such batteries. </p><p>  Advisers are very common that they say to delete the Android battery calibration file called batterystats.bin.  In fact, this will not help, because it only contains data that shows the level of energy consumption of certain applications. </p>
