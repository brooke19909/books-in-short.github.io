  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Action camera Dominant-S06: reviews, specs overview, instructions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  More and more people are trying to capture the best moments of their vacation on video.  Often they get quite expensive equipment for this, although such videos are unlikely to go anywhere beyond the family album.  However, even in this matter, you can save some money by buying the Dominant-S06 action camera.  Reviews about her speak in her favor.  Many emphasize the rather high quality, despite the fact that this camera is one of the most budget.  In order to understand why it is inexpensive, you should familiarize yourself with its main characteristics. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The first thing that catches your eye when opening the package is a variety of cases, mounts, clips, latches and other details designed to facilitate the use of the camera and make it as versatile as possible.  It is almost impossible to list them all, however, it is worth mentioning the basic elements that are supplied with the kit. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kiteforum.pro" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="action camera dominant s06 reviews" class="if uuid-2779645" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2779645.jpg"></div><p>  The main of them can rightfully be considered a waterproof box, which allows you to shoot underwater.  It is he who is often actively used on the beaches, because with its help you can remove many bright, memorable moments.  In addition, it is recommended to use it not only during diving, but also throughout your stay on the beach, as it protects the Dominant-S06 action camera from fine sand and dust, which could impair its performance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition to boxing, the kit has many mounts that allow you to mount the camera on a tripod, as well as stick to various surfaces.  It is worth noting that all this stuff is compatible with the world famous GoPro cameras.  Sometimes, given the cost of the original consumables for these cameras, you can seriously think about acquiring such an inexpensive model just for the sake of accessories. </p><p>  Also included is a battery for the camera, various straps and a carrying case.  Separately, it is worth noting the presence of the Russian-language instructions for the Dominant-S06 action camera, with which you can make the initial setup of the device, as well as deal with the full functionality. </p><h2>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  The basis of the camera is a 5-megapixel CMOS sensor, with which video is shot in two modes: 1920 * 1080 at 30 frames per second and 1280 * 720 at 60 frames per second.  Of course, with such characteristics an action camera Dominant-S06 can not shoot slow-motion videos, however, at its cost, to expect such heights would be unreasonable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="irecommend.ru" data-author=": NikSap7060, "><img itemprop="image" alt="action camera dominant s06" class="if uuid-2779647" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2779647.jpg"></div><p>  Enhances usability with a fairly bright 2-inch display located on the back.  With it, you can adjust the shooting angle, perform the required manipulations in the menu, or view already captured material.  Recording is made on a memory card with a capacity of 4 to 32 gigabytes.  Cards that are not in this range, the camera does not recognize. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Autonomy and remote control </h2><p>  The battery capacity is 900 mAh, which is enough to record several hours of video.  If you wish, you can buy additional batteries and replace them as they discharge.  It is most convenient to watch video through HDMI, connecting to a monitor or TV. </p><p>  We should also mention the presence of a Wi-Fi module.  It allows you to synchronize with a smartphone on which a proprietary application is installed, and use it as a control panel.  Quite a useful feature, especially if shooting with the Dominant-S06 action camera is done from a distance due to potential danger. </p><div class="photo" data-original="krsk.au.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="action camera dominant s06 specifications" class="if uuid-2779649" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2779649.jpg"></div><h2>  Video quality </h2><p>  Oddly enough, but the camera is capable of recording really good video, quite acceptable for home viewing.  At the same time, the only drawback is perhaps overly saturated colors.  When viewing the recordings, there is a feeling that the world around is unnaturally bright.  The rest of the videos are pretty good, the details are clearly visible. </p><p>  When shooting under water, it should be remembered that the box can be easily scratched, which subsequently can adversely affect the quality of the video being shot. </p><div class="photo" data-original="krsk.au.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="action camera dominant s06 instruction" class="if uuid-2779648" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2779648.jpg"></div><h2>  Model reviews </h2><p>  In order to see the real picture regarding the quality of the product, you should get acquainted with the opinion of those who have been using it for some time.  Among the reviews about the Dominant-S06 action camera, there are a lot of positive aspects, most often users mention the following pluses: </p><ul><li>  Rich equipment.  The set has nozzles and mounts for all occasions, and this is not an exaggeration.  The camera can really be fixed on any subject at the required angle to get the best angle. </li><li>  Low price.  The cost of the camera, given all the above, is small, and it is surprising that the manufacturer was able to make a device that performs its tasks without problems for such a small fee. </li><li>  The presence of a display.  The ability to see the direction of shooting and view the footage helps to take the best pictures and videos during the holidays.  Reviews of the Dominant-S06 action camera show that with the help of the display you can control the main indicators, for example, the remaining battery capacity. </li><li>  Possibility of remote control.  A Wi-Fi connection adds the number of scenes where the camera can be used.  For example, it is possible to remove the launch of fireworks near, without risking your health. </li><li>  Acceptable video quality.  The videos are, perhaps, too saturated, but at the same time they have sufficient clarity and detail of the image. </li></ul><p>  As can be seen from these excerpts from the reviews, users are actually happy with their purchase.  Of the minuses that some of them note in reviews of the Dominant-S06 action camera, we can highlight only the lack of the function to delete certain files from the device‚Äôs memory.  This can only be done using a computer or other device that has a memory card slot and file manager. </p><div class="photo" data-original="irecommend.ru" data-author=": NikSap7060, "><img itemprop="image" alt="size dominant s06" class="if uuid-2779654" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2779654.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  This review of the Dominant-S06 action camera showed that it is perfect for those who have long dreamed of an action camera, but cannot afford it.  It has a low price (about 3000-4000 rubles), but at the same time its functionality is completely enough to capture the main moments of life or vivid episodes of vacation.  The equipment is very rich, and a variety of mounts can be used as needed in the current situation.  The box that comes with the kit is actually waterproof and allows underwater shooting. </p>
