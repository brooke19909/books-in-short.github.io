    <p>  It is worth noting that the tourist guides somehow the city is undeservedly deprived of attention.  And by the way, the local nature is incredibly picturesque, and the climate is quite mild, as evidenced by the numerous reviews of tourists.  Ras al-Khaimah at first may seem dilapidated and dusty, but it is not so.  Resort hotels are able to offer wonderful relaxation and pristine beaches. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get to the resort? </h2><p>  According to tourists' reviews of Ras al-Khaimah, getting to the resort is not at all difficult.

    <p>  For centuries, pirates raided the land.  For this reason, these places on the Persian Gulf coast were called the Pirate Coast.  The history of the emirate is inextricably linked with another emirate called Sharjah.  Once Ras al-Khaimah was a very prosperous region, and therefore attracted the attention of other countries.  Since the year, the emirate came under British rule and became part of the UAE only in 1792. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Climate Ras Al Khaimah </h2><p>  According to tourists' reviews of Ras Al Khaimah (UAE), the resort's climate can be attributed to a tropical view.  It is very soft and comfortable.  Summer is the hottest time of the year.  At this time, the temperature can rise above +35 degrees.  But the weather is greatly influenced by the proximity of the mountains, which give coolness.  Therefore, the climate of the emirate is more mild.  The wonderful weather conditions attract many holidaymakers in Ras Al Khaimah.  Reviews of tourists about the resort let me recommend it for a good vacation. </p><h2>  Emirate nature </h2><p>  According to tourists, a vacation in Ras al-Khaimah allows you to fully enjoy the beautiful nature of the emirate.
