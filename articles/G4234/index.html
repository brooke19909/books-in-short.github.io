    <h2>  Features of rest in Antalya </h2><p>  This place is the most convenient for a beach holiday.  The holiday season in the best years here lasts up to 9 months.  At the same time, it is practically never very hot here.  In summer, the temperature on average keeps at around 24-25 degrees.  And sea water in the season warms up to 22-24 degrees.  For tourists there are various water activities.  Here diving, surfing, snorkeling are quite well developed.  You can ride on yachts and boats, catamarans, a banana, fly over the sea with a parachute, etc. For lovers of natural attractions, mountain trips are organized, to waterfalls lurking among the rocks, beautiful gorges, etc. But for little tourists, the best entertainment is a visit to Aqualand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fortuna 5 ai all regions reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/814074.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Antalya Hotels </h2><p>  On the coast of Turkey you will find a large, just a huge selection of hotels and guesthouses for every taste and budget.  Hotel buildings are striking in their architecture and size.  It seems that each of them can accommodate all the tourists who came to rest in Turkey.  There are many villas with excellent living conditions on the coast.  There are also two-, three-, four- and five-star hotels.  Tourists who decide to take a chance and go to Turkey using the Fortuna 5 * Ai All Regions system will relax in one of the best 5 * hotels.  By the way, unlike the Fortuna 3 * and 4 * systems, there is no risk here, because a five-star hotel simply cannot be bad, especially on the Turkish coast.  All of them operate on the system of "ultra all inclusive", rarely which is not on the first beach line, etc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fortuna 5 ai all regions 5 antalya" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/814072.jpg" width="599"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What is a Fortune system? </h2><p>  Those who have never heard of this <span>type of reservation,</span> probably can not understand what kind of risk is involved.  "Fortune" is one of the opportunities to relax in a particular resort, in a hotel of a certain category at discount prices.  But there is one thing but that is a moment of risk.  Tourists will learn about which hotel they will rest in only after arriving in the right country.  This means that this system can otherwise be called "roulette". </p><p>  Before arrival, tourists cannot make inquiries about the hotel, read reviews about it, etc. However, those who are going on vacation to Turkey using the Fortuna 5 * Ai All Regions system can be absolutely calm, because, as already noted , almost all hotels of this category on the Turkish coast are in perfect condition.  Perhaps some of them have slightly more services than others, but basically everything is equally good everywhere.  So, you can safely use the Fortuna 5 * Ai All Regions system. </p><p>  The reviews left by those who have already managed to use this booking system are in most cases positive.  And even if they have a bit of negativity, this is due to the location of the hotel.  There are also disadvantages regarding accommodation, but this can happen even if you came to Turkey or to any other country by an ordinary ticket.  The same goes for service. </p><h2>  Antalya 5 * hotels according to Fortuna system </h2><p>  Antalya is rich in five star hotels.  Nowhere else in another country can you find this: hundreds of deluxe hotels along the <span>Antalya coast.</span>  "Titanic Beach Lara" - a magnificent hotel, the building of which resembles the legendary "Titanic".  You can also get here, of course, if you are lucky with the Fortuna 5 * Ai All Regions 5 * system.  A photo of this hotel is presented first in our article. </p><p>  The Sherwood Breeze Hotel and Harrington Park Resort also look great.  Many of the five-star hotels belong to the global hotel chains: Radisson, Sheraton and others. Those hotels that were built over the past two years are luxury establishments.  And, of course, the participants of ‚ÄúFortune‚Äù are simply happy if upon arrival it turns out that it is in one of these that they will stay during their holidays in Turkey. </p><p>  All <span>5 * hotels are</span> serviced by the ultra all inclusive system.  This means that tourists can not only eat almost around the clock in the numerous restaurants of the hotel, but also try alcoholic beverages, as well as use all the services: spa, fitness, water activities, with the exception of those provided on the beach <span>by private individuals.</span>  All of the above hotels are designed for recreation for both adults and children.  Young parents are always provided with a nanny who is ready to sit with their children while they are having fun on the dance floor or tennis court. </p><p>  Those who still doubt the Fortuna 5 * Ai All Regions program, need to understand that this is the ideal vacation option at the highest level for those who want to save.  Choose and you won‚Äôt regret it.  The main thing is that tourists here will be comfortable and convenient. </p>
