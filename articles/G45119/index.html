  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to remove Google from the phone completely: instructions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Software from the famous Google search engine looks like an integral part of the Android mobile platform.  In fact, this is not so, and the company simply ‚Äúpinches‚Äù other competing products with its authority.  But not everyone is happy with this situation, and in particular the owners of budget smartphones with a mediocre set of chipsets. </p><p>  Surely, every owner of an inexpensive mobile gadget is familiar with a situation where a brand new device worked perfectly and quickly exactly until the moment when all the services from Google were not installed.  After all the updates, the budget device begins to not only terribly "slow down", but also to consume more energy.  Moreover, even with the lightest version of Google Apps, the situation remains almost the same. </p><p>  Finding a full replacement for such a voracious service is quite possible, but it‚Äôs much more difficult to get rid of the presence of software, that is, simply remove Google from your Android phone.  Search engine applications take root into the system to the maximum, and "picking" them out of there is an unpleasant and tedious task.  Nevertheless, some are ready to take this step. </p><p>  So, let's try to figure out how to remove Google from the phone and do it as painlessly as possible for both the user and the mobile gadget.  We give detailed instructions, consider possible problems that may arise, and analyze ways to solve them. </p><h2>  Account </h2><p>  The first step is to delete your Google account from your Android phone, that is, erase your account from the device.  This functionality can be found in the ‚ÄúAccounts‚Äù section in the platform settings.  After choosing an active account, you need to call the context menu (gear in the upper right corner or three vertical points) and click on ‚ÄúDelete account‚Äù. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to delete google account from phone" class="if uuid-3224989" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3224989.jpg"></div><p>  On other smartphones with some exotic firmware, the process is similar.  For example, to delete a Google account from a Samsung phone, you need to go to Settings - Accounts and select a search engine mailbox.  Then you need to click on "Options", and there will already be an item "Delete account". </p><p>  After this procedure, a manual audit of the installed search engine applications will be required.  If you delete your Google account from your phone, then getting rid of its programs will be noticeably easier, since they will not be linked. </p><h2>  Applications </h2><p>  To view installed programs you need to open the "Application Manager" in the settings menu.  From the list presented, you need to remove all the software where the name ‚ÄúGoogle‚Äù is found: ‚ÄúGoogle Photo‚Äù, ‚ÄúGoogle Fit‚Äù, etc. </p><p>  If the application stubbornly does not want to be erased, then you can disable it in the same window where detailed information about the software is presented. </p><h2>  Device reset </h2><p>  To completely remove Google from your phone, you must complete a complete reset of your mobile gadget after the above procedures.  You can find the functionality in the "Recovery and Reset" section in the platform settings. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to remove google from an android phone" class="if uuid-3224990" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3224990.jpg"></div><p>  At the very end of the section there is the item ‚ÄúReset Settings‚Äù.  By clicking on it, the system will warn you about the consequences: all data from the internal memory will be erased.  After consent, the cleaning process will begin.  This is an irrevocable procedure, so the smartphone life will have to start from scratch. </p><h2>  Third Party Solutions </h2><p>  Removing Google from your phone is only half the battle.  Now you need to find an intelligent replacement for the search engine services.  Of course, you can find and install all the applications you need manually, but this is too dreary, especially if you have many favorites among the software. </p><p>  On the Web you can find quite a lot of sensible analogues of Google Play.  They also allow you to install programs in one click and get updates on time.  Let's consider some of the most striking examples. </p><h2>  Amazon appstore </h2><p>  If you remove "Google" from the phone, then the Google Play service will also disappear, where a huge number of various applications and utilities are collected.  As an alternative to this software, many users prefer the Amazon Appstore. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.appsdrop.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to delete google account from android phone" class="if uuid-3224991" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3224991.jpg"></div><p>  The service also offers a huge database of software for all occasions.  The Amazon interface is somewhat similar to Google Play.  Here, in the same way, you can control the installation and removal of applications, as well as activate automatic updates. </p><p>  Separately, it is worth mentioning the daily App of the Day promotion, where for one day one of the most popular programs becomes completely free.  Google has no such shares. </p><h2>  Sunrise calendar </h2><p>  Instead of Google Calendar, you can use the equally effective Sunrise Calendar application.  Software competently approaches the organization and planning of events.  This solution has good functionality and excellent compatibility with other similar products: the same calendar from Google and Apple. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.droid-life.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to remove google account from samsung phone" class="if uuid-3224992" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3224992.jpg"></div><p>  The application has an attractive design and an intuitive interface.  All the tasks that you put on the shoulders of Google software are easily solved with the help of this calendar. </p><h2>  Replacing Google Drive </h2><p>  In this case, no problems should arise.  On the Internet, a lot of excellent cloud services.  Among others, Dropbox, Mega, OneDrive and Box are especially popular.  All of them are distinguished by wide functionality and flexibility of settings, as well as an abundance of tariff plans for advanced users. </p><p>  The cost of gigabytes for all of the above competitors can not be called unbearable, so the choice depends only on personal preferences, which, as a rule, rest against the design of the storage interface.  Because all the functionality is organized like a carbon copy. </p><h2>  HERE Maps </h2><p>  The Google Map Service is just that option, which is very difficult to replace.  The application is so thoughtfully and competently designed that competitors still have to go and go.  Despite this, if you will not be disappointed by the lack of photos of the area and reviews about this or that point, it is worth taking a look at the very efficient offer of HERE Maps. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pocketnow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="HERE Maps" class="if uuid-3224993" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3224993.jpg"></div><p>  This service offers no less detailed information about road junctions than the same Google plus plots routes very competently.  Moreover, with an eye to a personal car, public transport and walking.  All this is accompanied by voice prompts. </p><h2>  Replacing YouTube </h2><p>  There are a lot of adequate and quite worthy options.  Among other services, one can note such popular ones as Vimeo, RuTube, Yandex.Video, FireTube and Viral Popup.  All of them do an excellent job with the tasks and have all the functionality necessary for working with video content. </p>
