Of course, in addition to cost, a very important factor is the general condition of the hotel, the accommodation conditions offered here and the level of service.  To help create a more accurate idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa particular hotel will help to study the comments of its former guests.  Indeed, in their reviews, tourists try to share information about the advantages and disadvantages of a particular institution, based on their experience.  Today we have to find out what impressions Russian travelers had after staying at the three-star Deeden Pattaya Resort.  The reviews of our compatriots, we note right away, are mostly positive.  In general, tourists note that this hotel is consistent with both the declared category and the price of accommodation.  However, as in most hotels, it was not without drawbacks.  But we offer to understand everything in more detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="deeden pattaya resort 3 pics" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1267660.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Housing stock </h2><p>  In general, our compatriots were quite satisfied with the accommodation in this hotel.  According to them, the rooms here, of course, cannot be called luxurious, but they are quite spacious, neat, clean, with fresh cosmetic repairs.  Furniture and appliances are no longer new, but all in good and working condition.  True, sometimes something fails.  If you find a breakdown, immediately report it to the reception, and the hotel staff will immediately fix the problem.  Also, guests pay attention that the rooms in different buildings are slightly different.  So, some of them were renovated and furnished with new furniture.  Therefore, upon arrival, ask to move you to the best apartments.  As for complaints, many travelers in their reviews mention problems with hot water.  So, often guests had to take a cold shower.  However, most tourists were not particularly worried about this, because, according to them, after a day spent in the scorching sun, it is even pleasant to rinse with cool water.  As for Wi-Fi, it is completely free available throughout the hotel.  However, as guests note, he doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúcatch‚Äù well in every issue.  But in public areas there are no problems with the Internet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel deeden pattaya resort 3" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1267663.jpg" width="600"></div>

Here is a swimming pool and several wooden sunbeds.  There are also tables in the shade on the territory of the hotel where you can relax comfortably in the fresh air.  Also a big plus, according to most guests, is the fact that it is quite quiet here. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  This item is perhaps the most hotly discussed by tourists who visited the "Diden Pattaya Resort".  As already mentioned, the hotel is located on the very outskirts of the city at a sufficient distance from the center.  Therefore, you have to get to the main entertainment places either by tuk-tuk with transfers, or by taxi.  Walking turns pretty far.  However, this location of the hotel largely determines the cost of living in it.  After all, accommodation in the same hotel, but in the center of Pattaya, would cost an order of magnitude higher.  In addition, many experienced travelers are advised to rent a motorbike.  This will allow you not only to save on tuk-tuk and taxis, but also be able to go around all the surrounding beaches and visit the sights. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel deeden pattaya resort 3 reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1267665.jpg" width="600"></div>
