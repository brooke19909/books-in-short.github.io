    <h2>  basic information </h2><p>  Egypt is one of the most popular resorts among Russians.  Virtually every average Russian citizen can afford to fly there for a week or two.  And even 4 or 5 star hotels will not hit your pocket.  Here, for example, Sol Dahab Red Sea Resort.  A four-star hotel located in a picturesque place - right between the mountains of the Red Sea and the beautiful Gulf of Aqaba.  This building is visible from afar. </p><p>  The hotel is located at a distance of 81 km from Sharm El Sheikh Airport.  The district has its own name - Kenny Valley.  This is the coast of the Red Sea, which can easily surprise guests of the resort and hotel with a clean, spacious sandy beach.  From the nearest settlements, the aforementioned Sharm el-Sheikh can be noted (this place can be reached in about an hour if you go by car). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Briefly about the complex </h2><p>  Sol Dahab Red Sea Resort was built not so long ago - in 2007.  Its owner is Mr Gamal HASSAN.  It is interesting that this hotel is part of the chain of hotel complexes Mercure.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe territory on which the hotel is located is 18 thousand square meters!  The hotel is ranked among the average, as the number of rooms is 217. In total, the hotel has 2 floors.  But, I must say, in general, the building looks pretty impressive.  And this is his visual advantage. </p>
