Though out of the ear, but everyone has heard of this place.  <span>The resort town of Tuapse</span> is well-deservedly popular with many generations of tourists.  This place was especially in demand in the Soviet period of history, when traveling to more distant beach resorts was very problematic.  But even today, when the reach of the most remote resorts in the world is limited only by the amount on the bank account, the question of where Tuapse is located continues to be relevant.  This resort is quite competitive in the global tourism market both in terms of climatic factors and price parameters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is tuapse" class="if" height="373" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/296651.jpg" width="497"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Where is Tuapse and what is this city famous for?</strong> </p><p>  So what do we know about this city?  Tuapse is the center of a large resort area, and in addition, also a large seaport with a railway junction.  But the rational layout of transport communications does not prevent the reception of tourists.  Tourism is the main industry of the local economy.  A significant part of the local population is engaged in the service sector - receiving and servicing visitors.  Nature has ordered that tourists have reason to ask where Tuapse is located in order to come and spend the only vacation of the year here.  This city is very well located in a strip of mild subtropical climate.  The resort area stretches along the Black Sea coast at the very base of the <span>mountains of the Caucasus.</span>  In addition to natural and climatic factors, the tourist infrastructure, well developed along the entire coast, attracts these places.  And of course, one of the most attractive points is the economic aspect.  This is the subtropical beach resort closest to Central Russia.  And staying on it, and the road in both directions are much cheaper than a similar level of service and transit to other popular tourist destinations.  You can save significant money if you find out in time where Tuapse is located, what is the price level in the city for the most important services and how much it costs to travel there by rail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the tuapse map" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/296650.jpg" width="495"></div>

    <p>  <strong>How to get to Tuapse?</strong> </p><p>  If everything is clear with the direction of the summer vacation and the question of where Tuapse is located is clarified, the map will tell you how to get to this city in the best way.  Of course, you should use the services of the railway, laid along the entire Black Sea coast at the very beginning of the twentieth century.  This is the most comfortable and economical way to travel both to the resort and in the opposite direction. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the city of tuapse" class="if" height="276" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/296652.jpg" width="492"></div>  From the Kursk station of the capital in the direction of the Black Sea, many trains leave daily.  Tickets are best purchased in advance.  Of course, you can get to Tuapse by plane, by bus, and by car.  But all of these options have disadvantages.  It will be either more expensive, or longer, or associated with adventure when driving along mountain roads.  However, everyone has the right to make a choice independently.
