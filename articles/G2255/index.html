    <h2>  Bank Details </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the bank was created recently, it is gaining more and more popularity among residents of the country.  There are branches of the Russian Post even in the most remote corners of our state, which means that the card can be accessible to everyone.  The bank specializes in issuing both credit and debit cards, as well as deposits.  Naturally, there are many banking institutions that can offer similar services, but they cannot reach such a prevalence and ubiquity. </p><p>  So, what do you need to get a Post Bank credit card? </p><h2>  Types of cards and conditions for their receipt </h2><p>  Today, the bank provides several types of credit cards.  The conditions for obtaining are quite loyal and acceptable.  The most popular card options are: </p><p>  1. Credit card "Green World".  In cooperation with the company ‚ÄúPassion Global‚Äù, the banking structure provides assistance in the revival of Russian forests.  All commission money received on this type of card are sent to accomplish such a noble goal.  Use of the card is carried out in accordance with the conditions established by the bank: payment of purchases without a commission, a full package of options and bonuses provided for ‚ÄúVisa premium‚Äù is provided, annual interest on the loan will be 19.9%, the period of grace repayment of the borrowed funds is 60 days.  The credit limit is 500 thousand rubles, and after every third thousand spent one tree is planted. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="credit card bank mail reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59177/2128181.jpg"></div>

To draw up this type of card, you must fill out a special form on the company's website.  Credit card will be mailed.  The credit limit is 300 thousand rubles.  There is a discount program, a grace period of loan repayment of up to 120 days, assistance if necessary when you are outside the country, insurance, an annual interest rate of 27.9%, and a minimum monthly payment of five percent of the main debt.  Many bank credit card terms seem optimal. </p><p>  3. Card "Postal Express".  No interest is charged on this credit card.  It is issued in five minutes at any branch of Post Bank.  The client can choose from three limits - 5, 10 and 15 thousand rubles.  Depositing funds to the card is free.  It is supported by the Visa payment system.  Suitable for daily expenses, payment of bills and online purchases without commission. </p><p>  It also makes sense to get a credit card from Bank Post because when they are used in partner stores, customers are given bonus systems and discounts.  Cards can also be paid outside the country, and at a rather favorable rate for the client. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mail bank credit card conditions" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59177/2128182.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Full or partial repayment of debt is a necessary condition for fulfilling credit obligations.  The regular and complete fulfillment of all conditions creates a reputation, creates the image of a bona fide borrower and causes a tolerant attitude towards him in the future. </p><h2>  Deferment of payment </h2><p>  Using a credit card Bank Post also involves changing the date of repayment of the debt.  Deferral can be obtained from the 4th to the 28th.  This service does not provide for late payment interest.  Closing a credit card implies a personal appeal to a branch of a banking institution or to a sales desk in the branches of Russian Post.  It is impossible to close the card without a personal presence. </p><h2>  Features of use </h2><p>  So, it is not difficult to get a Post Bank credit card. </p><p>  Having received the money, the client must be ready to fulfill certain conditions of use and repayment of the money received: </p><p>  1. Debt payments must be paid monthly.  Not only the borrower can pay the loan, but also a third party. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="application for a credit card in a mail bank" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59177/2128185.jpg"></div>

    <p>  2. All amounts are monthly written in the schedule, which is prepared and issued to the client along with a package of documents for a credit card upon first contact with the bank. </p><p>  3. You can deposit amounts of any size, but at least 5% of the amount owed at the time of payment. </p><p>  4. Card account can be replenished with your own money.  This can be done by transfer or cash payment after the full repayment of debt to the bank. </p><h2>  Development prospects </h2><p>  Popularity and demand Post Bank continues to grow and will maintain this trend in the near future.  This is primarily due to the fact that the bank plans to open 15 thousand branches throughout the Russian Federation.  Given that you can get a credit card at the post office, the Bank Post's customer base will expand rapidly. </p><p>  In Russia, there are many banking organizations offering a similar range of services.  However, the newly created Post Bank seeks to occupy its niche and linger on the credit services market.  Its uniqueness consists, first of all, in that it is based on the basis of an existing, very widespread and universally known organization.  This service is convenient, first of all, for pensioners, who often use the services of post offices.  The bank plans to expand opportunities and create new options to make the service even more convenient and profitable.  But now its infrastructure is quite competitive and is reaching the level of other eminent and popular banking institutions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get a credit card mail bank" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59177/2128186.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Credit Card Bank Post - reviews </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the bank opened recently, heated discussions are already taking place on the Internet.  Particularly actively discussed are credit cards.  Customer opinions are diametrically opposed.  Someone praises the competent service and speed of action of employees.  Many have no problem using credit cards.  However, there are also negative reviews.  Summarizing them, we can draw the following conclusions. </p><p>  A credit card is convenient.  Cash is always at hand.  There is a <span>grace period</span> when you do not need to pay interest.  But on the other hand, it is a temptation.  Spending someone else‚Äôs is always easier than returning your own.  This must be considered before issuing a card. </p><p>  Also, from negative aspects, people allocate a high percentage for using credit funds.  The result is a very large overpayment.  Also, because the card is a revolving credit line, it is quite difficult to repay this loan.  First, a person makes a minimum payment, and then again spends money.  It turns out a vicious circle.  You need to have iron discipline to close debt. </p><p>  We examined how to open a credit card Post Bank.  This is not at all difficult to do. </p>
