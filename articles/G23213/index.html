In this "boot" state there is definitely where to swing: monuments of art, art galleries and even several states within the same country, which are San Marino and the Vatican. </p><p>  You can write endlessly about holidays in Italy, but the main thing that every tourist should know is the existence of two completely different types of recreation: combined tours to Italy and independent travel.  Of course, any traveler will find their advantages in each of the two types, but before you go on the road, you should carefully deal with this issue. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lavieenchina.wordpress.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://lavieenchina.wordpress.com/2013/07/08/walking-the-streets-of-rome/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Streets of the Eternal City" class="if uuid-2327518" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2327518.jpg"></div><h2>  Types of holidays in Italy </h2><p>  Among many tourists, combined tours to Italy are in great demand, since this is not only a complete overview of the state in the shortest possible time, but also a comfortable type of vacation.  Usually this option is great for a family, measured vacation.  Travelers only need to choose the desired route, and then the appropriate organizations, called travel agencies, take on all the work. </p><p>  The next type of vacation are full-fledged shopping tours.  Many tourists intend to participate in such events in order to go to the best boutiques in Milan and the entire Lombardy region under the strict guidance of a professional fashion guide. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="erasmusu.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://erasmusu.com/en/erasmus-milan/erasmus-experiences/erasmus-milan-2015-2016-561075"><img itemprop="image" alt="Fashionable capital of Italy" class="if uuid-2327516" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2327516.jpg"></div><p>  A no less interesting option is a combined tour to Italy with a rest on the sea.  Lovers are attracted to secluded beaches and tropical gardens, lovers of the underwater world - magnificent sea depths, and people of adulthood tend to soak up the rays of the warm sun on the sandy coast. </p><h2>  Visa </h2><p>  Immediately it is worth noting the fact that Italy is included in the list of Schengen countries, which means that to cross the border of this wonderful state, first of all, you need to get the appropriate permission to enter - a tourist visa.  For a vacation in Italy, it is enough to provide a visa to any country that is part of the European Union, but for an iron guarantee, it is best to contact the Italian consulate. </p><h2>  Sightseeing vacation </h2><p>  As we said earlier, before you go on a trip, you need to think through the entire route in advance, because this is how you can relax your body and soul.  Italy is famous for its cultural heritage, art monuments, art galleries and chic museums. </p><h2>  Eternal city and not only </h2><p>  Whatever type of vacation you are inclined to, whether it is a combined tour to Italy from a tour operator or an independent trip, the following cities must be visited: Rome, Florence, Milan, Venice, Pisa and Siena.  These cities can steal the heart of any traveler.  What is the history and greatness of Rome alone?  Or maybe Florence, where at every step you can find the work of Michelangelo? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikivoyage.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Italy map" class="if uuid-2327492" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2327492.jpg"></div><h2>  From south to north </h2><p>  For independent travel, the route is excellent: Bari - Naples - Rome - Florence - Genoa - Turin - Milan - Venice.  Thus, you can use the services of a low-cost airline and fly to the south of the country, and then leave Italy in the north via Marco Polo Airport. </p><p>  The city of Bari is very interesting from a religious point of view, because in this small town in the Apulia region there is the Basilica of St. Nicholas, where the relics of the saint are stored.  Then you can rent a car and go on a trip, subject to the availability of an international driving license.  In extreme cases, the option of "short dashes" on the buses of the company FlixBus has not been canceled. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youknowboat.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.youknowboat.com/escursione-in-barca-easy-going-capri-e-penisola-sorrentina/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Italy" class="if uuid-2327509" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2327509.jpg"></div><h2>  Beach Holidays in Italy </h2><p>  Italy is a southern country, so the swimming season here begins in May, and ends in late autumn.  In season, there is a sweltering heat, and the water warms up to the temperature of fresh milk.  The whole atmosphere in Italy is conducive to a magnificent beach holiday on the Ligurian Sea in the west, Tyrrhenian, Ionian, Mediterranean in the south, and the Adriatic in the east.  Impressive for such a relatively small state, isn't it? </p><p>  The most common resort among visitors is Rimini.  On the territory of this town you can find beaches for all categories of vacationers.  A few kilometers from the city is the famous dwarf state of San Marino, which offers beautiful views of the surroundings. </p><p>  An excellent option for a combined tour to Italy by sea is the island of Capri - a very interesting place and at the same time one of the most expensive resorts in Italy, if you do not take into account Portofino.  On the island you can find a unique landscape, clear sea and many secluded bays for a romantic evening. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.capri.net" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.capri.net/it/s/i-dintorni-di-capri"><img itemprop="image" alt="The beautiful resort of Capri" class="if uuid-2327501" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2327501.jpg"></div><p>  Sicily and Sardinia are no less popular destinations among tourists when organizing combined tours to Italy.  In Sicily, you can find beautiful architecture, island landscapes and feel the charm of provincial life in the south of the country. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Italy is a unique place on the planet where you can relax at any time of the year.  In summer, travelers are expected to have combined tours of Italy with excursions and relaxation at sea, and in the winter season you can head north towards the popular ski resorts.  Spring and autumn are a great time for shopping.  During this period, you can even ‚Äúsnatch‚Äù substantial discounts in many brand boutiques. </p><p>  You just have to decide on the type of vacation in this wonderful country, decide for yourself which cities or resorts are most preferable for visiting, and then hit the road. </p>
