The ancient, unusually beautiful, although small, town of Uglich also belongs to it.  Here are ancient monasteries, exclusive museums, wonderful parks.  The new chic four-star Volzhskaya Riviera hotel harmoniously blended into the unique look of the city.  Uglich can rightfully be proud of this object of the tourism business.  The hotel building seems to admire itself, reflected in the mirror of the calm waters of the great Volga.  The exterior of the Volga Riviera and the interior decoration can delight and satisfy the most demanding taste.  Let's take a short walk around this wonderful hotel and see what conditions of rest are here. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The Volzhskaya Riviera hotel was built in a very convenient location.  Uglich is a nice, cozy town, built on the banks of the Volga, 220 km from Moscow and just over 100 km from Yaroslavl.  There is a city from the V century and for a long time was the center of trade, spiritual and political life.  To this day, interesting historical monuments for tourists have been preserved here.  The Volga Riviera was built ten meters from the great Volga River and about one kilometer from the center of Uglich, where many museums, parks, monuments and other interesting objects are concentrated.  It is noteworthy that not on the road itself, but somewhat on the side is the beauty of the Volga Riviera (Uglich).  The hotel address is as follows: Uspenskaya street, building number 8. Nearby is the Uglich Legends Museum and the Church of the Icon of the Mother of God. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Volga rivieva Uglich" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1510553.jpg" width="527"></div>
