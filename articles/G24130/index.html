  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bank loans - installment life on favorable terms</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The credit system, which is becoming more and more perfect every year, has become a real salvation for many people.  With the advent of lending programs, many were given the opportunity to become owners of their own real estate, to solve the problem of acquiring a personal vehicle.  Depending on the preferred lending program, you can use the funds received at the bank to resolve financial issues, pay for services and goods.  A credit card has long since become a kind of lifesaver, which is ready to lend money with a grace period for loan repayment. </p><p>  State and commercial banks, actively operating in the country, are ready to offer various loan programs to the public and legal entities, which can be found here.  They will vary depending on the duration of the contract, the size of the interest rate and the features of the loan.  The most popular types of lending are as follows. </p><p>  Car loans.  For the convenience of customers, many banks have their own mini-branches in car dealerships, thereby allowing potential customers to save time filling out a loan application.  In this case, the loan and the client are accepted as soon as possible, which favorably affects the reputation of not only the car dealership, but also of the financial institution providing the loan.  If at first loans were issued mainly for the purchase of new vehicles, then today, using this program, you can become the owner of a used car. </p><p>  Consumer loan.  According to statistics, every third client who comes to the bank turns to his specialists with a request to choose the best option for consumer lending.  A loan of this type can be targeted and non-targeted, and depending on the conditions for obtaining the bank offered by it, the maximum amount and size of the interest rate may vary. </p><p>  Every year, financial institutions try to make adjustments to mortgage lending programs, thereby giving potential customers the opportunity to get a loan to buy real estate on the most affordable terms.  Mortgage lending is represented by at least three main programs: for the purchase of housing in a new building, in the secondary housing market, for apartments under construction. </p></div></article>
