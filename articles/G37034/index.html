In one thousand eight hundred and forty years, he submits documents for admission to the legal department of Moscow University.  Thus began the unusual and interesting life of a teacher.  Ushinsky, whose biography will be examined in more detail, devoted his entire destiny to teaching, considering this case the most important of all.

    <h2>  Mature years.  Yaroslavl </h2><p>  Six years after studying at the University, Ushinsky is offered a position <br>  professors in economics and finance at the Yaroslavl Demidov Law Lyceum.  With his entertaining lectures, he earned the full confidence and even admiration from the majority of students.  He devoted some time in his pedagogical activity to the advancement of natural science and historical knowledge, using for this purpose the position of editor of a local newspaper, which he had occupied for several months in the year one thousand eight hundred and forty-eight.  But Ushinsky was not limited to the issues of <span>pedagogical activity</span> and the post of editor, his biography is therefore replete with various events.  Engaged in teaching, Ushinsky could perfect the experience and knowledge gained during the training process.  Thanks to which he was able to improve many pedagogical methods used earlier.  But this ends the Yaroslavl period in the fate of Konstantin Ushinsky, whose biography was replenished with hostility and misunderstanding on the part of the authorities and the love of ordinary people.  He was soon suspected of sympathizing with revolutionary views and fired from his job. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

The main work in Ushinsky‚Äôs pedagogical activity was the book on pedagogy - ‚ÄúMan as a subject of education, the experience of pedagogical anthropology‚Äù, in which he tried to generalize and pass on the accumulated knowledge to subsequent generations.  This work ends the life of Ushinsky.
