Each of them is of particular interest to travelers who want to get to know better the country of centuries-old traditions. </p><h2>  A cozy place located near London </h2><p>  Surrey is a small county located in the southeast of the state, which includes 11 administrative districts consisting of dozens of cities.  It is no coincidence that its name translates as "southern ridge", because the picturesque hills of the North Downs mountain range divide the territory into two parts.  Surrey is only half an hour from London, and tourists often set off for a new experience in a quiet corner famous for pastoral landscapes. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="51.31475930000001" data-lng="-0.5599501000000373" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="8"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/9/6/5/7/9657.png"></div><h2>  Prosperous county </h2><p>  The rural suburbs and to this day retains vast arrays of pristine nature.  More than 70 percent of its territory is located in the so-called green belt of England, and this circumstance imposes certain restrictions on construction in the county of Surrey.  Nice thatched-roofed houses, old cottages, Georgian buildings, and modern, spacious residences with tennis courts and pools evoke a gamut of feelings among holidaymakers enjoying the romance of the English heartland. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.uniquehomestays.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="An oasis of peace" class="if uuid-2872719" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2872719.jpg"></div><p>  For several decades, a cozy corner has been at the top of the list of the best places to live in the country.  It is no coincidence that wealthy British buy real estate here, because the inhabitants of the green oasis, whose number has exceeded one million, are guaranteed a high quality of life and its safety. </p><p>  The county with the highest concentration of millionaires is one of the most prosperous.  The offices of world famous brands such as Canon, Toshiba, Toyota, Procter &amp; Gamble, Colgate, Palmolive are located here. </p><h2>  The capital and cities of Surrey </h2><p>  Now the county's capital is the borough of Kingston upon Thames (an administrative unit of the district level located in London), and earlier it was considered Guildford (Guildford) - an old town in the south of the country. </p><p>  We list all the cities of Surrey, which are part of 11 districts: </p><ul><li>  Sunbury-on-Thames. </li><li>  Shepperton. </li><li>  Ashford. </li><li>  Staines upon Thames. </li><li>  Adleston. </li><li>  Egam. </li><li>  Virginia Water. </li><li>  Chertsy. </li><li>  Frimley </li><li>  Cumberly. </li><li>  Woking. </li><li>  Weybridge. </li><li>  Molsey. </li><li>  Esher. </li><li>  Cobham. </li><li>  Walton-on-Thames. </li><li>  Guildford. </li><li>  Farnem. </li><li>  Godalming. </li><li>  Hazelmere. </li><li>  Spielthorne. </li><li>  Rannimid. </li><li>  Surrey Heath. </li><li>  Woking. </li><li>  Elmbridge. </li><li>  Guildford. </li><li>  Mol Valley. </li><li>  Ryegit and Banstead. </li><li>  Tandridge. </li><li>  Waverly. </li><li>  Epsom and Ewell. </li><li>  Letherhead. </li><li>  Dorking. </li><li>  Epsom. </li><li>  Banstead. </li><li>  Horley. </li><li>  Raigit. </li><li>  Redhill. </li><li>  Oxted. </li><li>  Caterham. </li></ul><h2>  Fairytale house that actually exists </h2><p>  Fans of Harry Potter books, unfortunately, will not find <span>Little Wing</span> on this list <span>,</span> whose photo excites the imagination of young romantics.  Readers remember that it was in this town that a handsome boy with glasses who lost his parents at an early age spent his childhood.  Admirers of the epic are familiar with the address: st.  Tisovaya, house number 4. In reality, the street is actually located in the town of the same name, only it is located in Berkshire, not Surrey, in the village of Bracknell. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="medium.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Harry Potter House" class="if uuid-2872638" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2872638.jpg"></div><p>  Now the picturesque house is for sale, but buyers are stopped by its price - about 620 thousand dollars.  Real estate agents intentionally did not hide the fact that the object is associated with the novel by D. Rowling, who invented the whole universe.  And interest in it has increased dramatically, which is likely to affect its value. </p><p>  In the house, which, according to the book, is located in the city of Little Winging, Surrey County, everyone can feel like a real magician, and adults can easily plunge into a fairy-tale world where good always conquers evil. </p><h2>  Picturesque park complex </h2><p>  What else to see for tourists who first visited a corner with a special atmosphere?  In the village of Big Buckham, located in the county, is one of its most beautiful sights - the Polesden Lacy estate, built at the beginning of the last century.  The estate and park complex of the same name, made in the style of classicism, is distinguished by the rigor of its architectural form.  The elegant-looking building and huge garden with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 5 square kilometers make a lasting impression on visitors, representing how the Duke and Duchess of York lived and walked here, as well as other members of the royal family. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Manor and garden" class="if uuid-2872666" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2872666.jpg"></div><p>  In summer, music festivals and theatrical performances are held in the lap of nature. </p><h2>  Marvelous park </h2><p>  Another beautiful garden can be found in Surrey, UK.  Luzley Park is a series of emerald "rooms" that are fenced off by hedges from yew.  A picturesque attraction that appeared around a luxurious mansion built in the 16th century, unfortunately, until recently could not please the eyes of tourists.  The declining park, divided into several parts, was restored only in the 90s of the XX century. </p><p>  Visitors to the Rose Garden are delighted to see wonderful flowers brought from different parts of the world.  And the greatest admiration is the metal gazebo with a huge pot, twined with dozens of species of the Queen of Flowers.  Plants blooming in various shades of a snow-white palette are planted in the White Garden, and rare species of plants can be admired in the decorative garden. </p><h2>  Ancient landmark </h2><p>  It is worth mentioning the village of West Clandon (Surrey, England), because it was here that a giant park with trimmed shrubs and trees is spread.  The surrounding modest mansion in the Palladian style, it is famous for its picturesque grotto, located in the shade of plants.  The project of a beautiful garden with hedges, a circular pool and statues was developed in 1781. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Clandon park" class="if uuid-2872673" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2872673.jpg"></div><p>  And the main highlight of Clandon Park is recognized as a unique prayer house belonging to the Maori tribe and brought from New Zealand.  Decorated with bizarre patterns, it is the only structure of its kind in England. </p><h2>  Abbey ruins </h2><p>  In Farnem, a small town in Surrey, centuries ago, the Cistercian Abbey of Waverley was located, which existed until the middle of the 16th century.  Founded in 1128, it was surrounded by canals of a local river.  After several floods, Henry VIII ordered the dissolution of the monastery, which received serious damage. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.english-heritage.org.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Abbey ruins" class="if uuid-2872684" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2872684.jpg"></div><p>  Now you can admire the mysterious ruins lying in the thick grass.  The ruins declared a conservation area are protected by the state.  They are definitely worth a look, because they not only look like sets for historical films, but really served as the location for the filming of numerous films. </p><h2>  Thorp Park </h2><p>  In one of the county's cities, in Chertsy, there is a park in which both adults and young visitors will find entertainment to their liking.  A variety of attractions, water slides, an artificial beach are of great interest to tourists having fun in full.  Even extreme sports enthusiasts will not be disappointed: here you can ride in a trailer at a speed of 130 kilometers per hour in a few seconds, and get out unharmed from the pavilion created based on the horror films ‚ÄúSaw‚Äù. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.getsurrey.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Thorpe Park - amusement park" class="if uuid-2872693" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2872693.jpg"></div><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  Surrey is considered one of the richest.  When reserves of black gold were discovered on its territory, local residents opposed oil production, wishing to preserve the pristine beauty of their beloved corner.  In addition, they were supported by well-known geologists, concerned about a series of small earthquakes.  They are afraid of abnormal seismic activity, which was the result of human activity. </p><p>  Interesting competitions are held in the county from year to year - men carry their beloved wives in their arms.  Even several types of techniques have been invented that allow you to run ahead of your competitors.  It is curious that the smile does not leave the face of English gentlemen, overcoming obstacles in any weather. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Grave of Berezovsky in Surrey" class="if uuid-2872704" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2872704.jpg"></div><p>  A disgraced politician who fled to England is buried at Brookwood Cemetery in Surrey.  B. Berezovsky, who committed suicide, lies in a grave that has no monument, no tombstone, no flowers. </p>
