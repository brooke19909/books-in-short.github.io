Unfortunately, the reality is that keeping in touch with dear elderly relatives in our busy time is really a big problem, and just giving them your old gadget is not the best idea.  Why?  What is a grandmother?  What kind of phone should an elderly person buy? </p><h2>  Why you need a special gadget </h2><p>  Some people think that giving the old one their old telephone is a reasonable idea.  But, unfortunately, this is not so and there are 4 reasons for this: </p><ol><li>  Functional.  Often in our old devices there are too many unnecessary functions for the elderly person, the purpose of which sometimes we ourselves do not know. </li><li>  The quality of the gadget.  Previously, phones with a small screen or small buttons were popular.  Older people do not have such outstanding vision that they can easily master such devices.  And they buy a new phone due to the fact that the old one is not working so well. </li><li>  Sound.  Often, older people have hearing impairments, and the gadgets that they are given to them no longer have such a powerful speaker. </li><li>  Aesthetics.  Of course, getting a phone is nice.  But much more joy will bring the idea that he is new.  And do not think that the elderly do not care much, because their age is just a figure in the passport. </li></ol><p>  Based on these aspects, the so-called grandmothers appeared in the world.  What is it? </p><h2>  Taking care of the elderly </h2><p>  Grandma‚Äôs phone is a special phone for the elderly.  It has a fairly large screen and buttons.  Moreover, such gadgets are usually designed to make calls, send messages and a limited number of functions (calendar, clock, calculator and so on). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Handling such phones is very simple.  They do not have unnecessary functions and are intuitive.  But how to choose the right model? </p><h2>  Phone Pickup Tips </h2><p>  Before settling on a particular phone model for older people, you need to know what criteria it must meet. </p><ol><li>  Functionality.  This concept means not only making calls, but also sending messages, viewing time and date.  Many older people would like to have a flashlight at their side, and possibly a source of music. </li><li>  Ergonomics  The phone should be comfortable in your hand.  It should not slip out or be too small / huge. </li><li>  Large keyboard.  It is not so easy for elderly people to get to the small buttons, so the latter should be massive, with clearly drawn characters. </li><li>  Quality display.  It is better that the screen is not only large, but also with high-quality color reproduction.  Some people prefer to buy black and white gadgets, as they have higher contrast. </li><li>  Sound is loud enough.  This applies not only to the main speaker, thanks to which a person hears a call.  The speaker should also be loud enough to hear what they say on the other side of the device. </li><li>  Battery.  It is important to choose a model that would have to be charged as rarely as possible, so that in a critical situation an elderly person always has a connection. </li><li>  SOS button.  The presence of this button is often the main difference from other devices.  It is useful if a person feels bad.  In order to dial a loved one, just click on the big button on the phone. </li><li>  Simple menu.  A mobile phone for the elderly does not have to be complicated.  It is just a means of communication and nothing more. </li></ol><p>  Of course, some modern elderly people are good at navigating the Internet and can overpower working with a smartphone.  But such units.  The vast majority of people do not like equipment, and if you need to get used to the donated phone for a long time, most likely no one will use it. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Below is a phone rating for seniors.  All options are selected taking into account the above basic requirements. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cellreviews.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="telephone for seniors" class="if uuid-2375243" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2375243.jpg"></div><h2>  Vertex C301 </h2><p>  A simple phone with a monochrome display, which has gained popularity thanks to fonts that are perfectly optimized for the needs of people with low vision. </p><p>  The battery here is pretty good - 900 mAh.  This volume should be enough for at least two weeks of battery life. </p><p>  The main drawback is the speaker.  Although it is capable of producing high volume, at maximum it starts to fonit, which is unpleasant for the ear. </p><h2>  Prestigio Wize E1 </h2><p>  Large in size, but small in weight and volume of the battery unit.  It can not be called a full-fledged grandmother, but it is often found in various tops because of its low price. </p><p>  This is a phone that got its place thanks to the color screen and nice design.  Why is he so severely condemned?  Judge for yourself: </p><ul><li>  Battery capacity 600 mAh. </li><li>  The SOS button is rather small. </li><li>  The device charges with an uncomfortable microUSB. </li></ul><p>  But the device has a flashlight, a slot for a memory card and two SIM cards.  There is also a radio that works without headphones.  So in general, the phone is not so bad, but there are devices much more powerful and modern. </p><h2>  KENEKSI T3 </h2><p>  This is one of the cheapest options.  This phone combines simplicity, low price and reasonable quality.  The device looks pretty rude, so it is more likely to suit men. </p><p>  The case is made of thick plastic.  The contrast buttons are divided and softly felt under the fingers. </p><p>  The phone has a camera, radio and player.  A 1000 mAh battery lasts for several weeks. </p><h2>  Sigma mobile Comfort 50 Light </h2><p>  Sigma is a well-established brand that specializes in the production of strong and secure devices.  And although this model is afraid of water and dust, it has its own unique design and capabilities. </p><p>  The phone looks really futuristic.  Its body is not symmetrical, but this does not prevent him from lying comfortably in his hand.  Bright details make the phone stylish and unique. </p><p>  The buttons on the phone are divided and quite large.  The letters and numbers are clear and easy to read. </p><div class="photo" data-original="brandzone.bz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sigma mobile Comfort 50 Light stylish and original" class="if uuid-2377581" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2377581.jpg"></div><p>  The time and name of the caller are always clearly visible on the contrast screen.  A bright diode at the top of the screen will not let you miss a call if the sound in the device is muted. </p><p>  At the top of the device is an interesting flashlight switch with a bizarre curved shape that gives quite powerful lighting.  The flashlight works even when the device is turned off. </p><p>  At the back there is a SOS button.  It is large enough to include a set of five pre-entered numbers, as well as a siren, you just need to pinch it.  Such a solution will protect against accidents. </p><p>  The battery capacity of this handsome man is 1100 mAh.  A charger is a glass or base into which the phone is easily inserted. </p><p>  The only drawback is not the most powerful conversational speaker. </p><h2>  The line of phones Just5 </h2><p>  These phones are manufactured by the Russian-Latvian brand, taking into account the needs of older people.  They produce highly targeted gadgets at affordable prices.  This brand has at least four models that are worth paying attention to. </p><p>  Just5 CP09 is a 75 gram baby with large letters and a small contrast screen.  The restrained design has nothing superfluous - a simple rectangular monoblock with bright orange backlight.  The phone was created exclusively for textual work, since a screen of 1.44 inches barely fits a few lines. </p><p>  This <span>phone with large buttons</span> for the elderly also has a flashlight and radio.  And on the back of the phone there is a large SOS button, which not only allows you to make a call to a pre-entered number, but also makes a sound like a siren. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mobiltelefon.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Just5 CP09 phone for seniors" class="if uuid-2375252" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2375252.jpg"></div><p>  Speaking of buttons, they are really huge.  Speaking in the language of numbers, 15 x 15 mm!  Moreover, the numbers are applied large enough and in a contrasting color, which will allow the user to never mistake the key. </p><p>  There is another interesting feature of the buttons.  In the bottom row are two keys with silhouettes.  When you click on one of them, a call is made to a pre-set number.  You can enter the number of the spouse or one of the children there. </p><p>  The battery of this baby, with a capacity of 1000 mAh, is enough for 140 hours of standby time.  The phone charges quickly enough. </p><h2>  Improved option </h2><p>  Just5 CP10 is another push-button phone for seniors.  It is heavier than its predecessor and has a larger screen - 1.77 inches. </p><p>  The device is not so angular.  The lines in it are smoother, and the SOS button is made in the form of a switch to avoid accidental clicks. </p><p>  This is a phone with large buttons for the elderly with a battery that lasts for 250 hours in standby time.  In it, as in the previous model, there is a radio and a flashlight. </p><p>  Unlike Just5 CP09, Just5 CP10 has more color options.  There are classic black and white.  But more popular are the brighter options - pink, blue, green, orange, blue and the so-called bestinspace - multi-colored.  The latter is a cell phone for the elderly with large multi-colored buttons in each row. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mcgrp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Just5 CP10 Senior Phone" class="if uuid-2375291" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2375291.jpg"></div><h2>  Just5 CP11 </h2><p>  This is the third version of a good push-button phone for an elderly person released by Just5.  It is even more modified, which does not make it worse. </p><p>  The phone size can be changed.  How?  By extending the screen.  When folded, you can see the date and time, as well as the name of the caller.  When the screen is extended, you can safely navigate the phonebook or menu. </p><p>  Such a solution interestingly outperforms the inconvenience of a small one in relation to the head of the device.  Since the speaker is located above the screen when the latter is pulled out, the sound source is at the ear itself, and the microphone is at the mouth. </p><p>  On the back of the cell phone for the elderly, in addition to the SOS button, there are two sliders.  One of them turns on the radio, and the other a flashlight. </p><p>  The buttons have a size of 14 x 11 mm, it is convenient to press them.  As in the previous model, there are two keys to call the most important numbers.  Due to the sides between the keys, they are much easier to use. </p><p>  The charger is what fundamentally distinguishes the Just5 CP11 from its predecessors.  It is made in the form of a glass into which you need to insert the phone.  You do not need to press anything, as well as aim at the grooves.  The glass itself is simply and easily connected to the network by cable.  This solution avoided breaking the charging sockets. </p><p>  Moreover, this phone with buttons for the elderly has a built-in thermometer.  Many people really like it. </p><h2>  Just5 brick </h2><p>  This unusual gadget was designed in tandem with ‚ÄúArtemy Lebedev Studio‚Äù.  It is slightly smaller than CP11 and less functional.  Brick got into the rating of phones for elderly people with a loud sound because of an interesting design and a separate antenna for a radio. </p><p>  The display in the device is monochrome.  What is funny, the phone has a game "Racing", made in color. </p><p>  All keys and switches are neat, comfortable and tangible.  Everything carries a semantic load. </p><p>  The battery capacity in the gadget is 1000 mAh.  A bright block of charger is difficult to lose. </p><p>  The phone is quite loud.  The design is bright.  A great option for a gift. </p><p>  In general, Just5 Brick looks like a small toy.  It does not seem to be a real phone.  Everything is so elegant and sweet.  Even the unlock button on the back resembles a sticker, not a full-fledged key. </p><p>  However, the phone does not have a SOS button.  Some argue that because of this, Just5 Brick cannot be considered a device for the elderly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ferra.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Just5 Brick phone for the elderly in an interesting performance" class="if uuid-2377431" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2377431.jpg"></div><h2>  Voxtel RX500 </h2><p>  This is a pretty interesting cell phone option for seniors.  It has an original design, although somewhat outdated.  Such a conclusion can be made on the basis that the device is inexpressive, which can not be said about the above models. </p><p>  The phone is really huge - 129.5 x 52.7 x 18 mm.  And this with a weight of only 100 grams.  But this cannot be considered an outright flaw.  There is a distance between the keys, and the phone itself lies perfectly in the hand. </p><p>  By the way, if we talk about the keys, there are three buttons marked "M".  There is a special insert at the back so that these numbers are not only in electronic media, but also on paper.  By clicking on these special buttons, you can immediately call the closest people. </p><p>  To unlock the keyboard, as in many older phones, you can use the slider on the side.  At first, it works quite tightly, but is developed over time. </p><p>  Some complain that the gadget has a small amount of battery.  This is especially aggravated by the incorrect operation of the charge indicator. </p><h2>  Fly ezzy </h2><p>  Another brand that has taken care of the needs of older people is Fly.  What is funny is that it is almost completely similar to Just5 CP10, but at a more loyal price. </p><p>  Its design is more streamlined and the dimensions are slightly smaller.  The SOS button on the back does not look catchy, unlike previous models, but in contrast. </p><p>  Lock, flashlight and radio are turned on using the sliders.  The SOS button is not a button at all, but a switch.  By the way, if you use it, then not only the siren will turn on, but also four pre-entered subscribers will receive a message about the activation of this key.  The keys are easy to read with or without backlight. </p><p>  This is a fairly loud phone for the elderly, in which you can insert two SIM cards.  True, as in any other model, one radio module does not allow you to use both cards at the same time. </p><h2>  ONEXT Care-Phone Line </h2><p>  This company from Hongkog quickly entered the world market thanks to constantly evolving technologies.  They did not just create phones for people with special needs.  In their line there is even a clamshell phone for the elderly.  The rating of the best includes three interesting models that will not leave you indifferent. </p><p>  Start with ONEXT Care-Phone 2. This phone has large buttons and an orange backlight.  But they love this model for two aspects: </p><ol><li>  Charger-glass.  The phone can be charged both from the cable and through the base. </li><li>  Alarm button.  By pressing it, a call is made to five numbers as soon as at least one of them answers, the siren goes silent, and the person on the other side of the phone hears everything that happens within a radius of 10 meters. </li></ol><p>  It is curious that ONEXT Care-Phone 2 is bought not only by the elderly, but also by children, because the phone does not have the ability to access the Internet and download something unnecessary or inappropriate. </p><p>  The battery capacity in the device is 900 mAh.  This is enough for 300 hours of standby time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mcgrp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ONEXT Care-Phone 2 is a simple phone for the elderly" class="if uuid-2377585" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2377585.jpg"></div><h2>  ONEXT Care-Phone 4 </h2><p>  This is a more modern model.  Such a light and simple mobile phone for the elderly with a rugged case is pleasing to the eye.  Large buttons have voice guidance when pressed, which will be a nice addition for those who have low vision. </p><p>  On top of the phone there is a separate eyelet for the cord.  Since older people often forget what and where they have it, they often hang keys or glasses around their necks.  Now this opportunity has appeared for the phone. </p><p>  Near the ear there is a SOS switch.  Five numbers can be entered in case of emergency.  Alternately, the phone will ring them three times and, if none of the contacts answer, the phone will send a short message to everyone. </p><h2>  Onext Care-Phone 6 </h2><p>  This is the same clamshell mentioned above.  In the hand the gadget lies conveniently both in the opened and folded form.  On the top cover there is a large SOS button, the diameter of which is already 16 mm. </p><p>  This is the only model of the above with a rather large screen - 2.4 inches.  Its only drawback is poor work in the sun.  Due to the fact that the screen is made using the TN technique, with direct sunlight, the image simply drowns in darkness. </p><p>  The phone has a camera.  Let it be only 0.1 megapixels, but the manufacturer considered it necessary to add it.  You can not only take pictures, but also shoot videos. </p><p>  Battery capacity 1000 mAh.  This volume is enough for 220 hours of battery life. </p><p>  The radio and player are able to work even with the lid closed.  The flashlight can be turned on at all with the phone turned off. </p><p>  It‚Äôs a pity that the phone does not have bluetooth.  And one more minus - the small volume of the phone book - only 100 numbers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="adorishop.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Onext Care-Phone 6 clamshell phone for seniors" class="if uuid-2377587" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2377587.jpg"></div><h2>  Alcatel One Touch 2004C </h2><p>  Although a simple phone for the elderly, it is stylish and modern.  It combines everything - a large and high-quality screen, large buttons and their sounding, a good camera, the SOS and media slider in the form of a player and radio. </p><p>  All this is hidden by an elegant case made of fairly high-quality plastic.  In tandem with a 1000 mAh battery and a nice price, this phone may well claim to be the best.  But there are several competitors who are strong in some ways, but clearly lose in something. </p><h2>  Astro B200 RX </h2><p>  This phone may be slightly smaller, but it has three indisputable advantages: </p><ol><li>  Moisture protection IP67.  Even if the phone falls into a bucket of water, nothing will happen to it. </li><li>  Charger in the form of a base. </li><li>  The battery capacity of 1300 mAh, which is enough for at least two weeks of battery life. </li></ol><p>  The phone comes in very bright color options.  This color approach will never lose the gadget. </p><p>  Astro B200 RX  ,     Alcatel One Touch 2004C.       . </p><p> , ,       . </p><div class="photo" data-original="palladium.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Astro B200 RX  " class="if uuid-2377588" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2377588.jpg"></div><h2> Philips Xenium X2301 </h2><p>     ,         ,    .   .     .            ? -  . </p><p> This relatively small device has a battery capacity of 1530 mAh.  That's as much as 850 hours of standby time.  Such a result is not found in any device adapted to the needs of the elderly. </p><p>  Moreover, this phone is suitable for more "advanced" older users.  It has: </p><ul><li>  The camera is 0.3 megapixels. </li><li>  Bluetooth. </li><li>  A slot for two SIM cards. </li><li>  MicroSD slot </li><li>  Radio. </li></ul><p>  Of course, some other grandmothers have a slot for a memory card.  But only with Philips Xenium X2301 is this combined with a relatively low price. </p><p>  To summarize, one cannot say that one of the phones is the best.  In order to determine what you need, analyze the needs of an elderly person for whom this device is purchased. </p>
