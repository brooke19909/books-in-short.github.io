    <p>  This is a cancer insurance program, which is offered to modern women by “PPF Life Insurance”.  Customer reviews suggest that payments on this policy are quite frequent, although with some problems in certain situations. </p><p>  Today, a woman has long been not perceived as a weak man, because she is an economic spouse, a business woman, a loving mother, a keeper of the hearth.

It is worth noting that this program does not include all kinds of risks for diseases that are less common for women, and if there is a need for surgical intervention, then the PPF Life Insurance company will also have to pay a second installment, which is enough important. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the case of cancer diagnosis, a qualified consultation of professional specialists from abroad can be provided.  Among other things, it is worth noting the fact that at the end of the program up to 75% of the total contributions are paid. </p><h2>  "Comfort" </h2>

    <p>  This policy is a fairly wide package of all kinds of insurance risks, which provides for the possibility of connecting a number of additional options to the main insurance programs, as well as the refund of a certain part of insurance premiums if the insured person survives until the end of the insurance period in PPF Life Insurance.  Reviews say that payments are made quite successfully both in the case of survival, and in the event of any insurance events. </p><p>  With the help of this policy, it is possible to foresee the most diverse financial consequences of the most serious diseases.  This policy has a large number of additional options, including the return of a certain part of the contributions made in case of survival, thanks to which you not only get extremely effective protection, but also ultimately return a certain part of the amount.  In this case, the total percentage of the return will directly depend on the term for completing this contract. </p><h2>  Features and Benefits </h2><p>  First of all, it is worth noting the fact that this is the maximum possible set of <span>insurance risks</span> in PPF Life Insurance.  The reviews indicate that a fairly large part of the originally deposited funds is returned if the insured person still survives until the end of the contract.  If any accident occurs or the insured person becomes ill with a certain deadly disease, the company provides effective financial support.  Thus, you get a set of insurance coverage with a guaranteed refund in the event that nothing happens. </p><h2>  "Opt" </h2><p>  Optim is a specialized program designed to help families accumulate large amounts of money.  Using this policy, you can increase your own savings, and by using additional protection against inflation, you will not expose <span>your own funds to</span> all kinds of financial fluctuations, and you will always keep their value at a certain level.  In contrast to the overwhelming majority of standard bank investment programs, General PPF Life Insurance offers a unified accumulation option with effective insurance coverage. </p><p>  If you don’t need some too wide range of risks, then in this case it is logical that you should not overpay for their presence, having to arrange all kinds of expensive insurance products with extended insurance coverage.  This policy combines accumulation and insurance protection, which is why it got the name from the word "optimally." </p><h2>  Features and Benefits </h2><p>  This project is aimed at the consistent accumulation of funds, and at the same time it is distinguished by a rather quick and simple design without the need for an assessment of the health of the insured person.  All accumulated funds are provided with full protection against inflation, which is provided through contributions and indexation of insurance amounts.  In addition, an option related to any accident insurance can also be connected.  In this case, also “PPF Life Insurance” will refund the installment partially after the insured person survives to the end of the policy. </p><h2>  "Capital" </h2>
