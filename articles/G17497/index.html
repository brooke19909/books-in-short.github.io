City in the center of the country</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Only on a cursory glance and very far away, Spain seems the same.  But it has so happened over the centuries that it consists of different and little similar historical territories.  They are different, but all together they are Spain.  Toledo is one of its most famous historical provinces.  Its capital is of the same name with the entire province for more than two thousand years.  Reliably age is difficult to determine, but in modern outlines the city was founded by the Roman commander Mark Fulvius a couple of centuries before the <span>birth of Christ.</span>  After this more than twenty centuries passed, a very eventful history, through which the country, now known as Spain, passed.  Toledo was always very close to the center of all historical disasters, numerous wars, the conquest of the country by the Moors, their expulsion from the Pyrenees and the subsequent reconquest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spain toledo" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/272032.jpg" width="496"></div>

    <p>  The city of Toledo, Spain.  Features and Attractions </p><p>  The capital of the province is located southwest of Madrid, near the center of the country.  The entire fireworks display of historical events was very clearly reflected in the appearance of the city that today appears to our eyes.  What is most surprising here is the visual authenticity of history, the degree of preservation of the historical center of the city - it has not changed much since the Middle Ages.  Perhaps this is not a unique case for a country like Spain.  Toledo surpasses many other, no less ancient and famous cities in terms of preservation of the medieval architectural urban environment.  But in terms of concentration in a relatively small area of <span>architectural monuments,</span> Toledo in the world has few competitors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Toledo city Spain" class="if" height="236" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/272031.jpg" width="496"></div>  As in other <span>Spanish cities,</span> here in many places manifestations of Islamic and Jewish spiritual traditions are noticeable.  But in general, Gothic style architecture dominates here, of which Spain is home.  Toledo has its brightest example, it is the main city <span>cathedral of</span> Santa Maria of the thirteenth century.  Of course, this is not the only Catholic church in the city, the old churches of San Roman and Santiago de Arrabal are no less significant.  An excellent example of Gothic <span>fortifications</span> is the Toledo Alcazar fortress.  The last battles in it thundered in the twentieth century, during the <span>Spanish Civil War.</span>  The most ancient monuments in the city are the ruins of the amphitheater of the Roman Empire and the well-preserved aqueduct of the same historical period.  The oldest monument of Jewish culture throughout Western Europe is the building of the twelfth-century synagogue, Santa Maria la Blanca.  Islamic culture is represented by the mosque del Cristo de la Luz. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="toledo spain" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/272030.jpg" width="496"></div>

    <p>  El Greco Museum.  Toledo, Spain </p><p>  One of <span>Toledo</span> 's main cultural <span>attractions</span> is the El Greco Museum.  Toledo had an undeniable influence on the work of this brilliant Spanish painter.  By the completeness of the collection, the collection of paintings by the master in the museum is second only to the famous Madrid Prado.  One could go to Toledo for the sake of the El Greco Museum alone. </p>
