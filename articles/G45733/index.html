Which bank to choose for IP?  It is better to choose the financial institution that is more likely to inspire confidence in the entrepreneur.  The inner feeling will tell you who you can deal with, and which bank you don‚Äôt want to contact.  Do not pay attention to the advice of acquaintances and colleagues, as well as choose an institution according to its proximity to the main office building. </p>
