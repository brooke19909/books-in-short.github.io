It is part of the Gorky Park - another famous place in the capital.  A boring garden is a striking corner of Moscow.  The city nobility has long settled here, the noble aristocrats flandered on the boardwalk.  The old man looks from everywhere: from the trunks of centuries-old trees, statues in the spirit of classicism, arbors and bridges, lawns, as if written off from the canvases of French and English artists.  And now the garden is a favorite place for recreation and entertainment for both Muscovites and guests of the capital.  The park has many beautiful corners, there are entertainment centers, gyms, and guided tours.  In the evenings, music sounds here, everything shines with lights.  The garden justifies its name - Neskuchny!

    <p>  The ring itself is more like a horseshoe in shape and rests on the embankment of the Moscow River.  And Tverskaya was always a place where people who walked loved to show themselves and others to see.  Restaurants and cafes invite you to sit at tables, taste delicious dishes, and <span>flowering linden trees are</span> fragrant and dizzy.  And you feel madly in love - in Moscow! </p><h2>  Ponds and Sparrow Hills </h2><p>  A walk along the Patriarch Ponds is a meeting with old Moscow, mysticism, and Bulgakov‚Äôs heroes.  In the evenings, the surroundings are illuminated by the soft light of lanterns.  Talk is heard in almost all languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the world.  On the panel screens you can see the latest news, concerts, sports.  Swans and ducks swim on the water, which you can feed, and go boating in the pond. </p>
