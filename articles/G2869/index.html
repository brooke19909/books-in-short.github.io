Especially when it comes to a new building.  Already here we have to study a huge amount of facts about the developer and about the project itself in order to make the right decision, which you will not have to regret about later.  This is precisely the purpose of this article.  In it we will introduce you to the developer "Aquamarine" and its interesting project - LCD "Fishing Fort", which has already attracted the attention of many people.  So what can you say about this company?  What are the features of this housing complex?  How is construction progressing? </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fishing fort" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42841/1606615.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  About the developer </h2><p>  For ten years now, Aquamarine has been operating in the Russian Federation.  "Fisherman's Fort" is one of the latest projects of this developer.  The main office of the enterprise is located in the city of St. Petersburg.  Construction until recently was not the main activity of the company, but now it is actively conquering this niche. </p><p>  The developer company does not have its own website, therefore, all available data about the enterprise in question can be found exclusively in the project declaration.  However, for projects implemented by Aquamarine, separate sites are created.  This happened in the case of the project "Fort fishing" (Nevsky district).  On the site you can find all the information about the object, photographs, surveys of the progress of construction, the cost and layout of apartments. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About the complex </h2><p>  The location of this housing quarter is Nevsky quarter of the city of St. Petersburg.  Settlement - Ust-Slavyansk.  Physical address: st.  Slavyanskaya, d. 3. Today, the commissioning of the complex is scheduled for the second quarter of this year. </p><p>  The building is planned to be built fourteen-story.  Construction technology - monolithic frame.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe territory is more than seven thousand square meters.  One hundred and four apartments are designed in the building, most of which offer magnificent views of the local landscapes.

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Real estate investors like a lot in this project.  The metro is relatively close, the location of the building is excellent.  The pace of construction at the beginning of the project really pleased.  Although the developer is little known, he has shown himself to be trustworthy. </p><p>  Many people like the proximity of the Neva.  Most apartments will be specific.  Moreover, no one and nothing will be able to block the residents of the river view.  At the appropriate time of the year, you can rent boats and jet skis.  Pleased with the presence of parks, a closed stadium. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Some items upset future residents.  Probably, first of all, it is worth talking about the fact that the deadline for the object was repeatedly postponed.  Therefore, now not every shareholder believes the information that the developer provides today. </p><p>  It seems to some that the metro is far away.  However, most of the potential residents do not agree with this.  Moreover, the metro station can be reached in a matter of minutes by public transport.  Some believe that housing prices are overstated.  Others are frustrated by the lack of two-bedroom apartments.  Someone is worried about traffic jams.  Whether you consider these facts as a sufficient obstacle to settle in the housing quarter in question or not is up to you. </p>

    <h2>  Apartments and prices </h2><p>  In the LCD "Rybatsky" will accommodate studios, one-room, as well as one-bedroom apartments.  In the studios and one-room bathroom combined.  Absolutely all apartments have a balcony.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe studios ranges from twenty-seven to thirty-five square meters, and their cost is from three million three hundred and fifty thousand rubles to four million five hundred and seventy one thousand one hundred and sixty rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  One-room apartments are presented in two options: thirty five and a half square meters and thirty seven and a half square meters at a price of four million seven hundred twenty thousand three hundred twenty rubles and four million eight hundred one thousand five hundred rubles, respectively. </p><p>  One-bedroom apartments are also not amazing variety.

Naturally, this has repeatedly caused waves of concern among equity holders.  Fortunately, the company timely informs its customers about the reasons for delays.  In particular, the latter were associated with difficulties in paperwork for the supply of electricity and natural gas, as well as in the actual wiring of all communications necessary for this.  The developer keeps his interest holders up to date.  According to the data available to date, Fort Fisherman's LCD will be commissioned in the second quarter of the current, 2017, year. </p>

    <h2>  Finish </h2><p>  Those who are preparing to purchase an apartment in St. Petersburg, in the housing complex under consideration, should take into account another important nuance: the housing will be commissioned without finishing.  This fact can be considered from two points of view.  On the one hand, the decoration is not imposed by the developer, and each family will be able to create an apartment of their dreams for themselves.  Indeed, all people have their own ideas about beauty and comfort.  And you can choose the materials for repair yourself.  So you will be completely confident in their quality.  On the other hand, this entails additional costs.  If you are ready to pay a certain amount for the repair after buying an apartment, then feel free to contact this developer.  If not, then maybe Fisherman's Fort is not an option for you.  In this case, you should pay attention to alternative projects. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Will there be problems with traffic?  <span>Residential complex</span> "Fort Rybatsky" is located near the public transport stop "Sovetsky Prospekt 23".  It can be reached by buses from the Rybatskoye metro station. </p><p>  If you prefer to use your own car, you must follow the instructions described.  When you are in the square near the Rybatskoe metro station, turn onto the Fourth Rybatskiy passage.  Drive along it to the intersection with Bugrova Street, from where you can go to Volodarsky Street.  You need to follow it to the intersection with the street of the Third Five-Year Plan and turn left on it.  Next, you need to drive to the road leading to Metallostroy, and follow along it to the Central passage.  On the passage you will need to move to Central Street, which will lead to the Petrozavodsk highway.  Following it, you will very soon see a turn to Sovetsky Prospekt.  He will lead to Slavyanskaya Street, along which you will have to drive only one hundred and ten meters to the final destination. </p>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The housing complex under consideration sheltered the Nevsky <span>district of St. Petersburg.</span>  The infrastructure of this territory is sufficiently developed for permanent residence. </p><p>  Literally in the next quarter there are two secondary schools and a children's clinic.  There you can find the Diana shopping center, as well as the Eureka and Pyaterochka supermarkets. </p><p>  The surroundings of the housing complex under consideration are famous for their historical landmark - the inn of F. N. Slepushkin.  Not far from this new building in St. Petersburg is a beautiful green area. </p><p>  The internal infrastructure of the complex will be represented by recreation areas for children and adults, playgrounds, underground, as well as guest ground parking.  A pleasant bonus will be an equipped descent to the river directly from the house. </p><p>  In transport terms, these new buildings in St. Petersburg are also well placed.  The complex is located just four minutes from the Ring Road.  To a stop where you can catch a minibus - just five minutes walk.  A ten minute bus ride is <span>Rybatskoye metro station.</span>  The area also has a train station.  Shlisselburgsky Avenue lies nearby. </p><h2>  Payment method </h2><p>  Anyone wishing to purchase property in the residential complex ‚ÄúFort Rybatsky‚Äù can conclude an equity agreement with the developer. </p><p>  What are the options for paying for real estate?  The first, but not the most common method, with which you can pay for apartments in St. Petersburg from the developer "Aquamarine", is a one-time full payment.  In this case, the actual value of the property is indicated on the official website of the developer. </p><p>  Another option is a mortgage.  It is drawn up with the help of the Sberbank of Russia institution.  What are the payment terms in this case?  As a rule, as a down payment you will need to pay one fifth of the total cost of the apartment.  The interest rate will be 11.9%. </p><p>  Some buyers can afford to buy an apartment in the Fisherman's Fort residential complex through maternity capital or subsidies. </p><p>  Everyone has the right to choose a suitable calculation option for him individually. </p><h2>  Documentation </h2><p>  Such legal documents on the project of the Fisherman's Fort residential complex are freely available on the Web: "Building Permit", <span>"Project Declaration",</span> "Changes to the Project Declaration".  Anyone can get acquainted with them, regardless of whether he is an interest holder or not.  This allows you to establish yourself in a certain way in confidence in the company or simply dispel some doubts that have arisen. </p><h2>  The opinion of experts </h2><p>  As often happens, new companies are rather skeptical.  This happened with Aquamarine, which had not previously built multi-story residential buildings.  Construction is a new field of activity.  Nevertheless, the company under consideration has proven itself quite well: the work was carried out at a brisk pace. </p><p>  The experts consider the project extremely interesting, taking into account the location of the building and its main characteristics. </p><p>  The housing complex under consideration was erected on the outskirts.  According to reviews, the neighborhood resembles the streets of a provincial town.  Almost all residents of the complex are provided with a magnificent view from the windows of the Neva and the coast.  Life in this area has a number of undeniable advantages: the peace of the world, the proximity of the river, where you can enjoy walking. </p><p>  This part of the district will be reconstructed soon.  This means that soon there will be significantly more important social facilities in the district.  The transport situation can also be considered satisfactory. </p><p>  The house itself looks modern and attractive.  Construction technology, special amenities - all this allows the building to be attributed to comfort class real estate.  Layouts of apartments are generally convenient and unusual.  Most of them have spacious niches in the hallways.  Each apartment has a balcony.  The only drawback is experts consider the insufficient area of ‚Äã‚Äãkitchens.  Not in all apartments it can be fully used as a dining room. </p><p>  It is important to consider that, analyzing the footage and layout of apartments, we can conclude that the property in this building is not suitable for everyone.  For example, families with children are advised to think about finding more affordable housing for themselves.  While those who live alone, as well as young families can move in without hesitation. </p><p>  The average price per square meter in this house is set by the developer at the level of 75 thousand rubles.  For this territory, the cost is optimal. </p>
