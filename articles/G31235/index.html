But some animals cause fear.  Chupacabra is an animal whose existence has not yet been proven.  Residents from all over the world claim to have seen her.  From our article you can find out who chupacabra is and what harm it does. </p><h2>  Who is chupacabra? </h2><p>  Chupacabra is a creature whose existence cannot be proved and explained by scientists from all over the world.  It is known that in most cases it was seen in rural areas.  There, chupacabra steals goats, chickens and other <span>farm animals.</span>  Surprisingly, the beast does not eat meat.  He hunts animals only to drink blood. </p><p>  It is not difficult to recognize the attack of the chupacabra.  As a rule, the beast silently attacks prey at night, and then drinks all its blood from it.  Chupacabra stacks the bodies of victims in a row or pile.  Despite the fact that the existence of the beast is not proven, the number of eyewitnesses increases every year.  Some scientists claim that this is not an unknown animal at all, but just a predator that was susceptible to genetic mutation due to external factors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="chupacabra is" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40665/1368870.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Cases of attack by an unknown beast.  What does chupacabra look like? </h2><p>  First found chupacabra in the 70s of the last century.  Then in Puerto Rico were found the bodies of farm animals without blood.  A similar incident has not been repeated for 10 years, so the mythical beast was quickly forgotten.  In the 90s, the attack of chupacabra repeated.  Similar cases began to occur in other parts of our planet.  Today, residents of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus know about chupacabra firsthand.  It is for this reason that people living in rural areas try not to go out at night.  Attacks were recorded not only on animals, but also on residents of villages and small towns. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It‚Äôs impossible to say exactly what a chupacabra looks like.  Eyewitnesses describe the beast in different ways.  Chupacabra is most likely a four-legged animal that looks very much like a dog.  It has a powerful jaw and large strong claws.  So eyewitnesses describe chupacabra most often. </p><h2>  Chupacabra Versions </h2><p>  Scientists and zoologists often argue about the origin of the beast.  According to their assumptions, chupacabra is the result of someone‚Äôs breeding work.  It is no secret that in the world there are a large number of centers in which illegal experiments and studies are conducted.  Perhaps the result of one of the experiments was chupacabra. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="chupacabra photo" class="if" height="344" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40665/1368871.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <p>  There is another version.  Six years ago, a case of an attack on domestic farm animals occurred in the United States.  Then scientists proved that this was done not by the mythical chupacabra, but by a wild dog that is sick with scabies.  With this disease, the dog loses its fur, smells unpleasant and has thickened skin.  The general background of the body is weakening, and the animal can not hunt wild animals.  It is for this reason that it attacks agricultural animals.  The version of scientists instantly caused a lot of controversy, because representatives of canids do not use blood.  They choose meat. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The most famous attacks </h2><p>  More than 10 years ago, Texas killed chupacabra.  There was no hair on the body of the mysterious animal.  It looked like a dog in size.  DNA tests were taken urgently.  The results showed that it was not chupacabra, but the most common coyote, which was sick with scabies.  In the same year, several more such animals were killed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chupacabra in Russia" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40665/1368872.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In 2005, the first chupacabra in Russia was spotted.  Eyewitnesses said that all the corpses of farm animals were bloodless.  In 2006 alone, Chupacabra killed more than 30 turkeys and 30 sheep.  At the same time, eyewitnesses reported an unknown beast that was seen not only in Russia, but also in Ukraine, Belarus and Poland.  His body resembled a kangaroo, but his head looked like a crocodile. </p><p>  In the summer of 2006, in a state of America, on the side of the road, a strange animal was found with powerful fangs.  Most likely, it was hit by a car.  The beast did not have wool.  Eyewitnesses believe that this is chupacabra.  A photo taken at the scene shocked all the locals.  Scientists suggest that this is a mixed breed dog.  Unfortunately, it was not possible to take materials for analysis.  This is due to the fact that the vultures ate the corpse before the arrival of specialists. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  8 years ago in Texas, a surveillance camera that is installed on the highway, recorded the movement of a strange creature.  It had no wool.  His head was narrow and elongated, and his hind legs were noticeably longer than the front.  It is believed that it was a hybrid of a wolf and a coyote. </p><h2>  Chupacabra in the Volga region </h2><p>  Last spring, two residents of a small village in the Saratov region traveled by car.  They saw a <span>strange creature</span> on the sidelines <span>.</span>  Its height was not more than a meter.  It stood on its hind legs and moved with the help of jumps.  The animal walked around the car for a while, and then disappeared into the forest.  Eyewitnesses had no doubt - this is chupacabra.  The photo taken during the incident aroused interest among local residents. </p><p>  The next morning, almost all the people who lived in the village went to inspect the territory.  They found a large number of three-fingered tracks that are not left by other animals living in the area.  Finding evidence, they recalled many cases when farm animals disappeared without a trace from their yards or were killed and bled. </p>

    <p>  Chupacabra was also aware of the existence in the neighboring village of Kochetovka.  It is known that there once the dogs chased an unknown creature, but could not catch it. </p><h2>  Assault on man </h2><p>  Chupacabra goes hunting only at night.  The animal is not afraid of people, but tries not to catch their eye.  For walks at night, it is recommended to take a powerful flashlight with you, because the beast does not tolerate bright light. <br>  The first time a person was affected by chupacabra was recorded in Mexico.  There, the beast seized its fangs in the hand of a local resident.  Fortunately, the chupacabra did not taste like blood.  A Mexican citizen escaped with only two shallow bites. </p><p>  There are known cases of attacks in Ukraine.  The first to suffer was an aged woman.  The next victim was a schoolgirl.  In the <span>Khmelnitsky region</span> , a case was recorded when a real chupacabra attacked a girl during the day.  She received many injuries and bites.  Girlfriend tried to drive away the beast with sticks.  The victim was hospitalized urgently.  She quickly recovered, but died six months later for an unknown reason. </p><p>  The information that there is a real chupacabra causes fear in residents of small towns and villages.  In 2011, in the <span>Sumy region of</span> Ukraine, an unknown animal attacked a high school student.  Eyewitnesses claim that the beast was huge, about two meters. </p><h2>  The beast in Bashkiria </h2><p>  This winter, more than 30 rabbits became victims of an unknown beast in Bashkiria.  Similar cases have been encountered before.  Locals believe that animals are attacked by chupacabra, however, there is no evidence for this point of view yet. </p><p>  An eyewitness claims that an unknown beast not only killed a larger number of rabbits, but also bit the fence rods.  In addition, the animal tore off the iron bars.  The victim notes that this is not the first case in the community.  In the yard in the snow were found footprints similar to dog.  The victim claims that she does not have a dog, such prints have never been in the yard. </p><p>  Chupacabra in Bashkiria often attacks other farm animals.  In February of this year, not only rabbits, but also sheep died from the attack of the beast.  Affected residents soon wrote a statement to the police asking them to fix the damage.  They claim that the local policeman came on the same day and drew up a protocol. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="found chupacabra" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40665/1368875.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It is known that this year, a video that a resident of Bashkiria shot on his DVR was of particular popularity.  He believes that on the video he captured the very chupacabra, which caused great damage to local residents. </p><h2>  The killed beast in Belarus </h2><p>  Today, almost everyone knows who chupacabra is.  Photos provided by eyewitnesses amaze almost everyone.  Today, chupacabra attacks have been reported all over the world.  It is worth noting that before the animal did harm only at night.  Now there are cases when chupacabra attacked in the daytime. </p><p>  Not everyone knows that chupacabra was caught in Belarus.  At one of the farms, workers discovered a strange animal.  For several months, it regularly killed livestock.  Farm workers claim that the animal was intimidating.  It had no wool.  As it turned out later, the killed chupacabra in Belarus is just a fiction.  Veterinarians examined the corpse of the animal and found that the farmers killed a raccoon dog, which had a skin disease. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="real chupacabra" class="if" height="453" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40665/1368879.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It is known that a corpse that was later investigated disappeared from a veterinary clinic.  There is information that a girl who believes in chupacabra stole it. </p><h2>  History of the origin of the name and animal </h2><p>  Many people know who chupacabra is.  You can find photos with this mysterious animal in our article.  The name "chupacabra" did not appear by chance.  The goats were the first to suffer from the beast.  The name is connected with them.  When literally deciphered, chupacabra is a "goat vampire." </p><p>  It is believed that chupacabra is the ancestor of a kangaroo that lives a secretive life.  There is another interesting version of the origin of the mysterious animal - space.  Some are sure that the beast came to us from another planet in the 90s of the last century. </p><h2>  Vampire dog </h2><p>  Recently, Belarus has been actively discussing the existence of chupacabra.  There is a known case when the inhabitants of a small village talked about the loss of animals to television reporters.  Local authorities promised to sort things out.  In the near future, night watch of the police was organized. </p><p>  Patrols gathered in the late afternoon.  A local resident said that cases with a strange killing of animals have been happening for several years.  Some eyewitnesses claim that there is no chupacabra.  In the village, a flock of vampire dogs attacks animals. </p><p>  Towards night, the patrol began looking for the best place to ambush.  The police claim that at eight o‚Äôclock in the evening there is no one else on the street.  They decided to stop near the garages in which many animals died last night.  According to local residents, the cause of death was precisely chupacabra.  The patrol guarded until the morning.  Law enforcement officers did not reveal anything suspicious. </p><h2>  The opinion of experts </h2><p>  After the incident in Belarus, experts immediately took the bodies of dead farm animals for examination.  After conducting a number of studies, experts found that the cause of death was the bite of a dog or marten.  They found that the beast had no pathologies and was not sick with rabies. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="killed chupacabra" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40665/1368890.jpg"></div>  Experts have learned the opinion of a psychologist.  He believes that residents of small towns lack information and events.  It is for this reason that one person comes up with a version, and the rest believe in it.  They need this in order to get any emotions.

    <h2>  Chupacabra: myth or reality? </h2><p>  Today there is no proven information that chupacabra exists.  Many experts claim that this is all fiction.  They associate a mysterious beast with an ordinary sick animal.  Under the descriptions of eyewitnesses, for example, a dog sick with scabies can come up. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that most often descriptions of eyewitnesses are completely different.  It is possible that the image of the chupacabra was invented.  Its existence is often denied by veterinarians.  As a rule, the corpse of a chupacabra brought for examination turns out to be a raccoon dog or coyote. </p><p>  Many residents of our country do not believe in the existence of chupacabra.  They argue that an animal cannot go unnoticed for many years. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Chupacabra is a mysterious beast that instills fear in residents of small towns and villages.  Its existence has not yet been proven.  However, cases of attack by the beast occur quite often.  Many materials brought for examination refute the existence of chupacabra.  Most often it is an animal with scabies.  Believe in chupacabra or not - you decide. </p>
