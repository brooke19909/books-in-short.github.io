He always wants to make himself known to the whole world.  But the worst thing is when the whole country wants to prove something to someone.  A vivid example of this is the situation at the end of World War II.  When the United States decided to demonstrate to everyone, and most importantly, the USSR, that they are a superpower.  The result of this demonstration was the dropping of nuclear bombs on two famous cities in Japan.  After the inhabitants fully felt the nuclear explosion, the whole world felt it.  Thus began the era of <span>"nuclear weapons."</span>  Undoubtedly, the most advanced technology belongs to the military.  And what has become very popular among the military will soon appear in peaceful use. </p>

    <p>  There are many examples: diapers (created for astronauts), sanitary pads (insoles for soldiers), mobile communications and GPS (military communications and navigation), and much more.  A nuclear explosion was not spared.  You will not believe it, but it is also used for peaceful purposes.  At the moment, people have blown up hundreds of such bombs of peaceful and military action.  The well-known scandalous photos of raking the WTC rubble in America, when two skyscrapers allegedly took shape exactly when they were bombarded by passenger aircraft.  The photo showed the effects of micronuclear explosions of charges.  But this is a flashy fact.  The legal and public use of nuclear charges has received the construction and mining industries. </p>

    <p>  According to the classification, a <span>nuclear explosion</span> can be divided by the strength of the charge and the location of the epicenter of the explosion.  In turn, the charge force is measured in "megatons" or "kilotons" in <span>TNT equivalent</span> and is divided according to predetermined limits.  By their location, explosions are: ground, underground, underwater, surface, air and space.  The process of a nuclear explosion is described as a decay reaction of the nuclei of radioactive elements, which proceeds without control.  The consequences of a nuclear explosion are huge - radiation, shock waves and radiation.  After a nuclear explosion, a bright flash immediately begins - light radiation (in the immediate vicinity - it can burn).  Next comes the <span>shock wave,</span> accompanied by tremendous pressure and tremors of the earth's surface. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  But on this the horrors that a nuclear explosion causes are only beginning.  X-ray and electromagnetic radiation are slightly behind (and more strongly behind at a large distance from the epicenter) behind the shock wave.  The closer you are to the center, the greater the saturation of the radiation.  Anything within the range of such an explosion receives penetrating radiation.  And that is not all ... After all of the above has already passed, radioactive contamination acts on the surviving organisms and surviving objects.  It, in turn, has the longest lasting effect - years and even tens of years.  Naturally, not a single living organism can exist normally in this territory. </p>

    <p>  But how then did the planet survive, you say, if large numbers of nuclear explosions were mentioned?  The fact is that the lion's share of them was relatively small in various environments (underground, underwater, in space).  If we are talking about the biggest nightmare of mankind, then this is a consequence of the powerful bombing with the help of nuclear weapons of several countries - nuclear winter.  Scientists from leading countries in this direction recreated this picture on powerful PCs.  The scenario is this: powerful mass explosions, in addition to radiation and a shock wave, which will destroy more than 70% <span>of the world's population,</span> will raise a huge amount of debris, dust and stones high into the sky.  This whole "flying matter" eclipses the sun for a couple of years. </p>
      <br>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Further, the consequences are predictable - the absence of sunlight will disrupt most of the natural processes, and, possibly, the surviving organisms will die out.  This is an artificial eclipse and is called a nuclear winter.  Perhaps this is precisely what served as a brake on the mass armament of the camp as a deadly weapon.  In any case, a series of disarmament was carried out and a protocol on nuclear limitation was adopted.  It is worth noting that nuclear explosions are of a natural nature.  These are considered explosions during the formation of galaxies and the disappearance of stars.  Such phenomena are called the Big Bang. </p>

    <p>  By the way, the concept of TBV (The Big Bang Theory) in the world is quite popular.  An example of this is the eponymous American comedy series.  Its name, it would seem, should be the corresponding topic.  But the director made a tricky move and tied this term to the characters - Rajesh Kutrapali, <span>Howard Volowitz,</span> Leonard Hofsteder and Sheldon Cooper.  They are young talented nerd scientists.  According to many viewers, if not for Sheldon, the Big Bang Theory would have been tedious.  This series somewhat humanized many concepts in the basic sciences and made the concept of the Big Bang less scary. </p>
