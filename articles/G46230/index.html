  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is characteristic of tax reporting by individual entrepreneurs under various taxation regimes?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Starting a business as an individual entrepreneur, each citizen should remember that the existence of such a status implies the fulfillment of certain obligations.  Of course, the first thing that comes to mind is <span>paying taxes,</span> which is quite natural.  Without a replenishment of the budget, not a single legal entity of business works.  However, there is another area directly arising from the previous obligation.  This is IP tax reporting. </p><p>  <strong>General reporting principles</strong> </p><p>  At present, <span>individual entrepreneurs</span> have the opportunity to choose various taxation regimes that differ significantly in reporting.  The following types have been approved by the state according to their complexity: general regime, followed by a <span>simplified taxation system,</span> followed by a <span>single tax on</span> <span>imputed income, a</span> single agricultural tax and, finally, the patent system.  In addition, the tax reporting of an <span>individual entrepreneur is</span> highly dependent on the availability of hired employees. </p><p>  Provide the final information to the tax office on the income of the entrepreneur is required only once a year.  The tax return, which is the crown of the IP reporting, must be submitted next year until April 30.  For staff, or rather, for insurance premiums paid for it, will have to report once a quarter.  Moreover, no matter what mode the entrepreneur chose. </p><p>  And, of course, <span>IP</span> tax <span>reporting is</span> impossible without careful accounting, so as not to recall what was sold there several months ago and at what price.  To do this, there is a "Book of accounting for income and expenses of the entrepreneur," where all the movements are recorded.  At the end of each quarter, an interim result is set, and at the end of the year, the final results. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  These are general accounting and reporting principles.  It should be said that the most common taxation regime for entrepreneurs now is the ‚Äúsimplified tax system‚Äù (STS).  On her example, we will describe the reporting of IP. </p><p>  <strong>What documents should be prepared?</strong> </p><p>  So, the submission of IP tax reports provides for the submission to the regulatory authorities of the following documents: </p><ul><li>  STS tax return - once a year to the tax office; </li><li>  individual information on yourself - once a year to the Pension Fund. </li></ul><p>  The presence of a staff of workers will add some more reports of individual entrepreneurs to this list: </p><ul><li>  2-personal income tax return for employees - once a year to the tax office; </li><li>  reporting on insurance contributions - once a quarter to the Social Insurance Fund and the Pension Fund; </li><li>  individual information on employees - once a year to the Pension Fund. </li></ul><p>  If the general regime is applied, then the IP tax reporting is supplemented by documents for more serious payments such as VAT. </p><p>  UTII and the <span>patent system of taxation</span> imply a very simple accounting.  Rather, it can be kept here for a year at all.  This will not have any effect on annual reporting.  However, the appearance of at least one registered employee will immediately require the submission of information to the FIU and the FSS </p><p>  <strong>How can I submit reports?</strong> </p><p>  IP tax reporting can be delivered to the inspection in three ways.  The first is the direct submission of documents to the tax office.  You can do it personally, you can through a representative.  The second way is mail.  Well, the third way is electronic submission using the Internet. </p><p>  The tax authorities have recently urged to use the third option.  Since information is much easier to process, tax authorities do not need to enter data from declarations into databases. </p><p>  An individual entrepreneur can prepare reports himself, if qualification allows, or he can use the services of specialists.  But in all cases, he must always comply with the deadlines for submitting documents.  Otherwise, sanctions are inevitable. </p>
