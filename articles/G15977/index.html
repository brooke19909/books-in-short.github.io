The service is not bad, but with local prices you can afford a lot more.  Therefore, we have compiled for you a list of inexpensive pensions in Gelendzhik with meals. </p><h2>  Pension Victoria </h2><p>  All experienced travelers know if you want to save money - you need to leave the city.  It is worth moving away from popular places, and you get excellent service, a clean beach and hospitable hosts for a much lower price.  One of the inexpensive guesthouses in Gelendzhik with meals in 2017 is Victoria.  It is located 15 km from the city itself, in the village of Kabardinka.  In addition to a clean pebble beach, you can find the <span>Tsemess Bay</span> , the most beautiful juniper and pine groves, as well as many mineral springs.  If you intend to improve your health, this place is perfect. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="inexpensive boarding house in gelendzhik with food" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/1995538.jpg" width="500"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  So that visitors to the boarding house do not get bored, they are offered several local activities.  For example, vacationers can use the billiard room, playground and gym.  If you want to relax, you can visit the pine bath.  The hosts can also help with a selection of excursions.  The place has its own beaches, where parties are held every evening.  So there will be something to do for both young and older people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Talk about food </h2><p>  And now the most important thing: how are things with food?  The price includes three meals a day.  It takes place according to the "buffet".  Therefore, be prepared for the fact that after a few days the menu may get bored.  Despite the fact that the resting place is not located in the city, it is not difficult to get to it.  If you get to Gelendzhik by plane, then directly from the airport there is a bus to Kabardinka.  He makes a stop called "Pension Victoria", so you definitely will not miss your exit. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cheap pensions in gelendzhik with food 2017" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/1995549.jpg" width="600"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Another option is to get to Anapa.  First you have to spend half an hour to get from the airport to Anapa itself, and then the bus will take you to Kabardinka.  The road will take about two and a half hours.  You can also fly to Krasnodar.  From there, in 4.5 hours you will reach the coveted village. </p><h2>  Pension "Gelendzhik" </h2><p>  You can spend your holidays in Gelendzhik in a boarding house with meals for 2900 rubles per day in a place called Gelendzhik.  It is located in the city itself, so you will not have to spend money on additional transport.  Moreover, the beach is only 30 meters away. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Not only the sea near the boarding house, but also the city center.  For example, the famous Lermontovskaya Square is located very close by.  Musical groups from all over Russia come here to entertain tourists, so in the summer you can often get to some kind of concert.  The boarding house is surrounded by just a huge number of cafes, bars, inexpensive eateries and clubs.  The city never sleeps, so if you decide to move to Gelendzhik, be prepared for loud noises at night. </p>

    <p>  In addition, you can visit the water park and the dolphinarium.  Children will be interested in a large amusement park, while adults can relax in mineral spas and improve their health. </p><p>  Cheap Gelendzhik boarding house with meals is central in the city, so the network of additional services is very developed here.  For example, going down to the first floor, you can find out all the information you need at the tour desk.  Nearby is also a hairdresser, a Chinese restaurant and a playground. </p><h2>  What about the beach? </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the boarding house does not have its own beach: you have to go to the city.  And there, as we all know, there are a lot of people.  Nevertheless, there is always the opportunity to rent a sunbed, and you can use the shower and locker rooms for free.  Another integral plus of the Gelendzhik beach is the sandy seabed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Separately, it is worth mentioning food.  Compared to the general price level in the city, accommodation in this pension is not cheap.  But there is the opportunity to eat 3 times a day for free: food is included in the room price.  You can get to the hotel from the airport by taxi or bus number 3 and number 14.  In general, the journey will take you about fifteen minutes. </p><h2>  "Gelendzhik Bay" </h2><p>  Pension in Gelendzhik inexpensively with meals can be found for a modest amount of 200 rubles.  Just get ready to take a walk: the hotel, although located in the center, is half a kilometer to the beach.  In general, this boarding house specializes in wellness: guests have access to many therapeutic procedures.  The building itself is surrounded by a park, so if you are tired of the gassed city air, feel free to choose this option.  If the prospect of a long trip to the beach doesn‚Äôt scare you, the rest of the location of the Gelendzhik Bay will suit you.  Nearby is an <span>water park, an amusement</span> park, many cafes, shops and bars, as well as a playground.  There is something to do for both adults and children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="guesthouse in gelendzhik inexpensively with food" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/1995540.jpg" width="600"></div>

For example, a business meeting can be held in one of the conference rooms, for a romantic dinner it is better to go to a local restaurant, and at night it is suggested to visit a bar or club.  And of course, all related benefits are attached: tourist office, pharmacy, bank and so on. </p><h2>  Is there a beach here? </h2><p>  As in the previous version, Gelendzhik Bay does not imply its own beach.  Have to use the city.  If the prospect of swimming next to a hundred other people does not appeal to you, you can go to a wild beach.  Meals here are also three meals a day like a buffet.  If you are going on an excursion and do not have time to have breakfast or lunch, you can take a <span>packed</span> lunch on the road for free.  The pension also offers several additional services, the cost of which is already included in the price of the room.  In particular, you can use the parking, gym and sports equipment for free. </p><h2>  "Janhot" </h2><p>  Another guesthouse in Gelendzhik is inexpensive with food - "Janhot".  It is located in the village of the same name, 15 kilometers from the city itself.  An integral advantage of such holiday homes is the beautiful nature around.  This place is famous for the fact that around it a unique relict forest has been preserved, one of the few in the world.  Therefore, throughout the rest you can enjoy the beautiful coniferous aroma. </p><p>  And in general, an inexpensive boarding house in Gelendzhik with food helps to restore health.  On the territory there is a sauna and a pool with the purest water that comes from underground sources. </p>

    <p>  Good news: the beach has its own boarding house.  The complex is located in the bay, where underwater currents periodically take out all the garbage from the beach.  Plus umbrellas and chaise lounges go free of charge.  The bad news: the beach is not sandy, but pebble, so do not forget the shales.  You will not have to pay for the pool, tennis courts and parking.  But massage and sauna are paid separately.  In addition, right there, in an inexpensive boarding house in Gelendzhik with meals, you can book an excursion.  Pleasure boats and yachts periodically depart from here, which can take you anywhere on the coast. </p><p>  But you can‚Äôt save on food: only breakfast is included in the room rate.  You will have to pay for lunch and dinner yourself.  Fortunately, there are several restaurants on site, so you don‚Äôt have to look for a place to eat.  Double apartments cost 3750 rubles.  However, the price of a room depends on the time of year: in off-season you can pay less. </p><h2>  "Friendly beach" </h2><p>  It‚Äôs hard not to miss the inexpensive boarding house in Gelendzhik with the food ‚ÄúFriendly Beach‚Äù: it is a tall building located near the sea.  Everything is at hand: local offices with tourist centers, water parks with dolphinariums, and restaurants with bars.  Plus a great chance to get a room with sea view.  The boarding house services can be listed indefinitely: in fact, you can spend your whole vacation well without leaving the building.  However, if you decide to glance at the beach, you won‚Äôt have to go long, as it is located just 50 meters from the hotel.  You don‚Äôt have to share it with the whole city: part of the coastline is assigned to the boarding house. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gelendzhik boarding house by the sea with meals" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/1995553.jpg" width="587"></div>

    <p>  However, there is also a fly in the ointment in this barrel of honey: the beach is pebble, so you will have to refuse beautiful photos on the yellow sand.  For free you can use ordinary sunbeds and awnings.  But for comfortable sun loungers and sun umbrellas you have to pay.  But they feed here as for slaughter.  Five meals a day: breakfast, lunch and dinner, plus two additional meals.  Everything runs through the buffet system. </p>
