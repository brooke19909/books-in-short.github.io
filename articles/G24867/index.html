For lovers of summer holidays there are beautiful white sand beaches, and for fans of history - the ruins of the great Carthage.  However, the main attraction of Tunisia for tourists, or rather the fair sex from different countries, lies in thalassotherapy - treatment by the sea.  At the same time, the prices for the procedures are low with a rather high quality.  Further in the article we will tell you about the benefits of a holiday on about.  Djerba - one of the most beautiful islands belonging to Tunisia, in the hotel "Centido Caesar Thalasso".  It is worth a visit.  By the way, about Djerba is mentioned in the ancient Greek legend about Odysseus. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sentido cesar thalasso" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1858058.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Lotus island </h2><p>  O. Djerba is the largest Mediterranean island off the coast of Africa.  Today it is connected to the mainland via a bridge (in the southeast).  It can also be reached by ferry.  It takes only 15 minutes to get to the road.  But in this short time, tourists feel like Odysseys.  According to legend, King Ithaki met in the Djerba with lototagi - "lotus eaters" who treated him and his companions with the fruits of this beautiful flower.  After that, they completely forgot where they were from and where they were going, they wanted to stay on the island.  Then Odysseus dragged them onto the ship by force and continued the journey.  All tourists who cross the threshold of the Sentido Cesar Thalasso Hotel are told the story at the earliest opportunity.  As a rule, many hotels on the island are often decorated with wonderful lotus flowers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sentido cesar thalasso 4" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1858057.jpg" width="600"></div>

Here you can relax in the winter.  By the way, exactly in this season the coast of the island is inhabited by flocks of pink flamingos that have arrived for the winter.  This is truly a fabulous sight worth seeing.  From January to March it is moderately warm, sunny, dry, rains are extremely rare.  However, the temperature of sea water is not so warm that you can swim comfortably.  The season begins in mid-spring.  Already in April, you can go to Tunisia for a beach holiday.  It is better to book a room at the Sentido Cesar Thalasso hotel in several months, since four-star hotels are the most demanded segment of the number market in this country. </p><p>  Tourists who gather in the country in the summer months are naturally interested in whether it will be too hot, Africa is all the same!  Of course, the summer here is real: hot, sunny, not rainy, but there is no that sticky and suffocating humidity, which happens in the equatorial or tropical climate.  The proximity to the Sahara desert gives the local climate dryness and is therefore easier to tolerate.  September and October are the most comfortable, velvet months for a beach holiday.  Keep this in mind when planning your trip to the Sentido Cesar Thalasso 4 * hotel (Tunisia / Djerba). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="about jerba" class="if" height="262" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1858056.jpg" width="350"></div>

Djerba-Zarsis is the name of the local airport, but there are no direct scheduled flights between it and Russian cities.  But this does not matter, because you can get here with a transfer, for example, in Munich (the cheapest option) or Paris.  The cost of such a ticket from Moscow to Djerba costs about $ 500, and from St. Petersburg - 580. Recently, charter flights have been made from both Russian capitals in the high season.  Such a flight will cost a little cheaper - $ 460, and time will be spent on an order of magnitude less - only 4.5 hours. </p><p>  Sentido Cesar Thalasso is not located in Jerba's capital, Houmt Souk, near which the airport is located, but in Midoun, the second largest city on the island.  The path to it is about half an hour.  So you can easily get there by taxi.  However, most of the tour operators offering tours to this hotel pay the transfer fee to the hotel in the total travel package. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sentido cesar thalasso 4 tunisia jerba" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1858055.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel Sentido Cesar Thalasso (Djerba / Medun): general description </h2><p>  This hotel is a four star hotel.  This is exactly the class of hotels that are most in demand in this country.  It is here that you can find a relatively high quality of service along with an affordable price.  Unlike five-star luxury hotels, which look like palaces from the Thousand and One Nights, hotels with 4 stars on their signs have a more modern look.  There is less pathos and stiffness. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  As already noted, it is located in the city-resort of Midoun.  By our standards, it is very difficult to call it a city, rather it is a village with a central part - the medina, where the market and other objects for trade are concentrated, as well as a mosque with a minaret, with residential areas for the local population and a strip of hotels for guests. </p><p>  Sentido Cesar Thalasso until May 2015 was called differently - Miramar Cesar Palace.  It was once founded as one of the hotel complexes owned by the Miramar Hotels Djerba hotel chain.  It is not located on the first beach line.  By the way, in the country a 30-meter strip of beach belongs to the state, and the beaches of hotels are located behind them. </p><p>  This hotel is actually considered one of the best not only in Midoun, but also on the whole island.  Those who managed to visit here are told that they met in it a combination of elegance with luxury.  The building is made in the Arab-Moorish style.  On a vast territory of 10 hectares there is a magnificent garden with subtropical vegetation.  Here you can truly enjoy the peace, breathe oxygen and the aromas of flowers in the evening.  Here you can not only rest comfortably, but also take a course of rehabilitation thalassotherapy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel sentido cesar thalasso" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43516/1858783.jpg" width="600"></div>
