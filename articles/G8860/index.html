    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  You are not immune from shortcomings and shortcomings while relaxing at the Okeanos Beach 3 * hotel (Cyprus, Ayia Napa).  Traveler reviews reveal the following shortcomings of this institution: </p><ul><li>  poor quality of the wireless Internet signal in the rooms; </li><li>  given the condition of the number of rooms, we can say that the cost of living is overstated; </li><li>  towels for the pool and the beach are not provided (you need to buy or take with you, since bathing is prohibited from the room); </li><li>  air conditioning blows cold air right on the head of the bed; </li><li>  towels are changed 2 times a week, or even less; </li><li>  a cosmetic set is provided only on the day of check-in, and then is not replenished; </li><li>  at the reception you can not rent an adapter for the outlet (they are only sold); </li><li>  there are a lot of stones on the beach (including when entering the sea), as well as a lot of dirt that comes from the port; </li><li>  loud music is constantly heard from the territory of a neighboring hotel; </li><li>  use of the safe is paid (in addition, it is not a code, but is closed with a primitive lock); </li><li>  the pool has few sunbeds; </li><li>  despite the availability of <span>places for smoking,</span> tobacco smoke is felt everywhere, and workers do not even try to fight it; </li><li>  on a double bed there are 2 mattresses, between which a large gap is formed; </li><li>  there are some complaints about the cleanliness of the rooms; </li><li>  many mosquitoes; </li><li>  on the beach there are no more than 10-15 sun loungers that are constantly occupied; </li><li>  coffee from a vending machine of very poor quality; </li><li>  drinks (including tea and coffee) are not included in the price of lunches and dinners, but are paid extra. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Okeanos Beach 3 * Hotel in Ayia Napa (Cyprus) is a great option both for lovers of sea holidays, and for those who want to get acquainted with the culture and attractions of Crete.  Immediately a few steps from the building is its own beach.  On the other hand is the main promenade, where there are many entertainment facilities.  And, of course, this place can be considered the starting point for exciting excursions.  Perhaps, it‚Äôs with a convenient location that you can associate somewhat higher prices for accommodation. </p><p>  As for living conditions, you will certainly be pleased with freshly renovated rooms and elegant decoration.  Of course, there are some complaints about cleanliness, but they are insignificant, because given the location of the hotel, you are unlikely to spend much time in the room.  As for nutrition, it will pleasantly surprise you.  Enjoy traditional Greek breakfasts with a huge selection of homemade dishes.  As for lunch and dinner, it is better to go to neighboring restaurants. </p>
