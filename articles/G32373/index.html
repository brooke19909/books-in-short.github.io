At the beginning and end of the tourist season, with advance booking or with a long stay (more than a week), you can get significant discounts in resort hotels in Spain.  So, at least, reviews say.  In this article we often turned for information to the experience of those tourists who managed to visit the 3 * Riviera Hotel.  So what should be expected from the Spanish "troika"?  Where is the resort of Santa Susanna located and what is famous for?  What can I see nearby?  We will try to answer all these questions in our article.  Photos of the area and rooms will help you make your own opinion about the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Riviera 3 * Spain, Santa Susanna" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1520355.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is the hotel situated </h2><p>  It should be said that in this country the traditional division of the entire coastline is accepted.  In this regard, there are <span>Costa Brava, Costa Verde, Costa Dorado</span> and others.  Where is the resort of Santa Susanna?  This old Catalan town is located on the Costa del Maresme.  It is north of Barcelona.  But still south of the Costa Brava.  In contrast to this coastline, teeming with cliffs and bays, Maresme is a flat landscape with vast sandy beaches.  Lush Mediterranean greenery and mountains visible in the distance complement the landscape.  Costa del Maresme is also the most budget holiday destination.  There are cheap hotels here, offering nonetheless a European level of service.  And the proximity to Barcelona makes it possible independent trips to the capital of Catalonia for ridiculous money.  Where in the midst of this splendor is Santa Susanna?  In the north, this resort borders on Malgrat de Mar, and in the south is adjacent to Pineda.  Sixty-five kilometers are separated <span>from Barcelona</span> International <span>Airport</span> , and 45 km from Girona's air harbor.  Hotel Riviera 3 * (Santa Susanna, Spain) has the most advantageous location: on the coast and in the center of the village.  The local population lives away from the sea, in the hills.  The entire coastline is built up with hotels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Riviera 3: reviews and prices" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1520361.jpg" width="600"></div>

Despite her considerable age, she does not at all look outdated and dilapidated.  Both buildings and the territory were repeatedly reconstructed.  The last major renovation, when the hotel was closing, was held in 2005.  Playa de Santa Susanna Municipal Beach is just a hundred meters from the Riviera Hotel - you just need to cross the road (preferably via an underpass).  The hotel consists of one seven-story building and a small extension, in which the restaurant is located.  From its outdoor terrace you can see the pool with the adjacent hot tub.  The tank is surrounded by sun loungers and umbrellas.  Reviews say that the small territory of the hotel, which is located in the very center of the town, is simply surrounded by greenery.  Sea view is far from all windows.  On three sides the hotel is surrounded by other hotels.  Many considered it a plus.  "Riviera" 3 * positions itself as a place for a quiet relaxing holiday.  For noisy entertainment you can go to the neighboring Alhambra Hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Riviera 3, reviews and prices spain santa susanna" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1519305.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel <span>Riviera 3 * ("Riviera" 3 *):</span> room description </h2><p>  This is a great hotel.  It has more than three hundred rooms.  Most guest rooms belong to the standard category.  But they are different.  There are rooms for one, two, three and four guests.  A higher (and therefore expensive) room category is deluxe.  They have the ability to accommodate an extra guest.  The televisions there are of the latest brand, with a LCD screen, and the bathrooms have a bidet and hairdryer.  All rooms from the second to the seventh floor have balconies.  Reviews of tourists recommend booking rooms on the highest tier - there are several elevators in the building, so there will be no problems.  Even in the ‚Äústandards‚Äù there is an individual air conditioning, a minibar (its charge is paid), a telephone with direct dialing.  The tourists described the furniture as new and comfortable.  They clean the rooms daily, and change the bed twice a week. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Hotel Riviera 3 * (Spain, Santa Susanna) can only pay for accommodation.  But, reviews warn, it is economically disadvantageous.  Eating three times a day in restaurants and cafes - maybe varied, but it can afford.  If you aim to learn Catalonia and not sit in Santa Susanna, then you can only pay for breakfast.  Most tourists preferred half board.  It is very convenient: have breakfast and dinner at the hotel, and at lunchtime have a snack somewhere in the city.  Very close to the hotel there is a Karefur supermarket, and a little further - McDonald's (there, tourists say, also free and fast wifi).  Only loungers, preferring not to leave the hotel, paid for the "full board" system.  But even with her drinks at lunches and dinners are paid.  All meals are served in the restaurant in buffet style.  Between them, service is carried out on a custom menu.  The hotel also has a bar.  It is very nice to sit in a relaxing atmosphere with a glass of your favorite drink. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Review of hotel Riviera 3 * Spain, Santa Susanna" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1519307.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What tourists say about food in a hotel </h2><p>  Not a single review of the Riviera 3 * hotel (Spain, Santa Susanna) can do without praising the skill of the cooks.  The food in the hotel is very tasty.  Tourists who happened to spend two weeks at the Riviera Hotel claim that during this period not a single meal was repeated.  It was already interesting: what will the cooks come up for dinner this time?  Culinary excellence was not limited to mastering the secrets of Catalan and Spanish cuisine.  Very often they delighted guests with the delights of other gastronomic traditions.  But the breakfasts were always the same.  The basic set of dishes that are usually eaten in the morning: scrambled eggs, scrambled eggs, cereal, sausages, fried bacon, yoghurts.  There have always been many vegetables and fruits.  And cakes, insanely delicious desserts, ice cream, mussels, meat and fish dishes, soups, grills and the like - it's all for dinner.  Drinks at afternoon and evening meals - for a fee.  But you could not finish the bottle.  They hung a tag with your number on it and put it in the refrigerator until tomorrow. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Beach and Pools </h2><p>  Hotel Riviera 3 * (Spain, Santa Susanna) is located on the second line.  But what does it mean?  In Santa Susanna, only campsites are located on the first line (actually on the sand of the beach), since railways and roads run along the entire coast.  Every two hundred meters underground tunnels are laid under them.  So, the hotel "Riviera" 3 * is located just in front of such a tunnel, which is very convenient.  Playa Santa Susanna is a wide and extended strip of golden sand.  The beach has a fresh shower, changing cabins, a first-aid post, lifeguards are on duty.  But the sun loungers and umbrellas there are paid.  Reviews of tourists warn: poor swimmers should be careful, and parents - vigilantly look after the children.  The bottom is not felt under your feet after six steps.  The coastline here is not indented, as on the Costa Brava, so any sea swell gives rise to high waves.  An alternative to unpredictable water elements can be a pool.  It is not very big, reviews complain, but clean and pleasant.  Next to it is a children's pool.  Their common area is surrounded by sun loungers and umbrellas, the use of which is absolutely free for hotel guests. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Riviera 3 riviera 3 description" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1519302.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Reviews of experienced tourists argue that the Spanish "troika" can well be compared with the Turkish "fours."  In addition, you can go to other hotels and attend their entertainment programs.  Here Riviera 3 * (Santa Susanna, Costa del Maresme, Spain), although it does not have its own children's animation (only an adult is present), offers its guests to go to the neighboring Alhambra hotel for a portion of fun at a mini-disco.  At the reception at the Riviera Hotel there is a Russian-speaking employee who will answer all your questions.  In the evenings, the bar hosts entertaining events, sometimes with the invitation of local pop stars.  You can play table tennis and billiards at the hotel.  The hotel also has a lounge for relaxation, with a large plasma TV and reading room. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Riviera 3 * Santa Susanna Costa del Maresme Spain" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1519309.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Conditions for children </h2><p>  Hotel Riviera 3 * (Spain, Santa Susanna) positions itself as a place for family vacations.  For her youngest guests, she provides free cots, high chairs for feeding in a restaurant, a shallow pool.  The hotel has the opportunity to use the paid services of a baby sitter or a professional nanny.  Dishes in the restaurant, including breakfast, fully meet the criteria for baby food.  They are not spicy, made from the freshest and highest quality products.  And baking, desserts and ice cream will not leave indifferent even the most capricious children. </p><h2>  Hotel Riviera 3 *: reviews and prices </h2><p>  Spain - Santa Susanna in particular - is a budget destination, compared, say, with Italy or Provence.  And at the beginning and end of the tourist season, hoteliers begin to offer such crazy discounts that you want to drop everything and go to the Mediterranean Sea.  You can find a room in the Riviera Hotel for two thousand eight hundred rubles per night!  Reviews of tourists assure that this is an excellent price for the quality of services that you receive.  Breakfast or half board can be paid on the spot.  Tour operators are not in vain sending their customers to this hotel.  Of course, group race is cheaper than individual. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Riviera Hotel 3 * Santa Susanna Kingdom of Spain" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1519310.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What to see nearby </h2><p>  Hotel Riviera 3 *, the reviews and prices of which we briefly described, are located away from the ancient village of Santa Susanna.  The locals preferred to stay away from the pirates hosting the Mediterranean, and therefore built a watch tower to protect their homes.  The village itself is located on the hills, which offer panoramic views of the sea surface.  Tourists recommend climbing into this ancient village (in the summer the resort train goes there).  A very interesting visit to the monastery of the sixteenth century Mare de Dew de Gracia.  This cloister is located on the border of Santa Susanna and Pineda.  The Costa del Mar is also called the Fruit Coast.  It harvests three crops a year.  And therefore, even in September, you can enjoy strawberries.  And in the town of Carretera de Maldrat (this is between Blanes and Malgrat) there is a huge water park ‚ÄúMarineland‚Äù. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  You should actively use the convenient location that Hotel Riviera (Santa Susanna) 3 * has.  Spain will be more affordable if you take the train to Barcelona.  This trip will cost three euros and will last an hour.  From the capital of Catalonia, trains of medium and long-distance railway lines depart.  You can, therefore, visit Girona, Tarragona, and other interesting Spanish cities. </p>
