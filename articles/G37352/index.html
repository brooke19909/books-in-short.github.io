  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why time is getting lost on the phone. Reasons and Solution</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Android is the most popular operating system for mobile phones.  Some people think that iOS is much better, perhaps, but the fact that Android is the most popular is undeniable. </p><p>  Many people choose it because it is multifunctional.  Someone just doesn't like Apple phones.  Someone prefers an Android phone because he has no way to buy Apple. </p><p>  You took an Android phone that works properly.  It would seem that everything is going well, you always set the alarm for a certain time, and it works.  But there were such situations that the alarm does not work.  When you look and try to understand the reason, you see that time is not going right. </p><p>  Why is time getting lost on the phone?  There are several different reasons.  How to solve this problem and set the correct time?  You can find the answer to this question by reading this article. </p><h2>  What is Android? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidpit.com" data-author=": Hans-Georg Kluge, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Picture for article" class="if uuid-2772181" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102789/2772181.jpg"></div><p>  To start the background.  What is Android?  This is an operating system that was created based on the Linux kernel.  It has a good connection, but does not have synchronization with NTP.  That is, time zones are not synchronized.  Hence the answer to the question "why is the time lost on the phone?" </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Previously, Android OS was intended only for mobile devices, namely smartphones.  Later, after the release of version 3.0, the developers updated the interface, which was ideally suited not only for smartphones, but also for tablets. </p><p>  The next version - Android 4.1, completely changed the receipt of data about time zones.  They returned to the "roots".  Old phones took time information from cell towers. </p><p>  Why are you losing time on your phone?  There may be a problem with the cellular connection. </p><p>  Android tablet owners are even worse.  These mobile devices cannot synchronize time without a special communication module. </p><h2>  Why is time getting lost on a phone with Android?  Solutions </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.greenbot.com" data-author=": Derek Walter, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Picture for android article" class="if uuid-2772183" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102789/2772183.jpg"></div><p>  All mobile devices have time synchronization with the mobile network.  Before you start debugging, you must disable it.  If your device can work in stationary mode, it is better to disable the time zone setting.  If this is not possible, then put it in automatic mode. </p><p>  As we already said, in the standard Android OS there is no synchronization with the NTP server.  So, we must install a third-party application that will perform this function.  A good option is ClockSync. </p><p>  As soon as you run this application, you will be shown a deviation from your time zone.  In most cases, this is a small error, just a couple of minutes.  In some situations, deviations can be for an hour, or maybe for a few. </p><p>  By downloading this application, you will no longer ask yourself why the time is constantly losing time on the phone </p><h2>  Setting synchronization using ClockSync </h2><p>  You need to configure automatic synchronization with NTP.  To increase the accuracy of synchronization, we recommend that you enable the following settings - "Only via Wi-Fi" and enable "High accuracy mode".  The most important thing is to enable the first option, since it is required due to the instability of mobile Internet. </p><p>  And to save the energy of the mobile phone, you should activate the function "When you turn it on." </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.wired.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.wired.com/story/hack-brief-patch-your-android-phone-to-block-an-evil-toast-attack/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Android picture" class="if uuid-2772185" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102789/2772185.jpg"></div><p>  So, now you won‚Äôt be tormented by the question: ‚ÄúWhy is time lost on the phone?‚Äù.  And even if he appears, which is unlikely, you know the answer and solution. </p>
