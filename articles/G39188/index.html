  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Do I need privatization of a dorm room?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For many people, since their student years, living in a dormitory is the most fun form of their existence.  But for those who spend all their time in the hostel, living and sharing all the accessories of the room with other neighbors is not an easy task.  The hostel speaks for itself - this is a place where there is a shared kitchen, toilet and shower.  Not many people will like such conditions, but if you need to live somewhere, and finances do not allow you to buy your own apartment, you can buy a room or take another direction - <strong>privatization of a dormitory room</strong> .  At present, the issue of privatizing rooms in <span>communal apartments</span> or in a dormitory is quite relevant.  In order to understand what <strong>privatization of a dormitory room is</strong> , you need to know all the secrets, pros and cons of privatization in general. </p><p>  Privatization is a gratuitous right to own an apartment, room or other housing.  After the housing is privatized, you can do anything with it, you can sell, give, or bequeath.  But many people who live in communal apartments or in a dormitory are wondering - why do you need <strong>privatization of dormitories</strong> ?  Are there any advantages or maybe a catch? </p><p>  In principle, a dormitory is a dwelling that is given for use to people working, serving or studying.  After completion of studies, service or work, a person automatically <span>loses the right</span> to live in a hostel.  There is a ban on such a thing as <strong>privatization of a dormitory room</strong> , since such housing belongs to a <span>specialized housing fund.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In other words, <strong>privatization of a dormitory room</strong> can only be carried out in cases where the dormitory itself has always been considered a place for public living.  These are such buildings in which people lived for a long time and legally. </p><p>  More recently, there was such a thing as <strong>privatization of a hostel through a court</strong> , in which case the court often denied people the exercise of property rights.  But now this position has changed, at the moment, the <strong>privatization of the hostel through the court</strong> is a complex process in which lawyers resort not only to the legislative bodies for help, but also to judicial practice.  In other words, we can say that the <strong>privatization of a dorm room is</strong> possible in the following case: </p><p>  - if the dorm room was presented to a person before the entry into force of the Housing Code of the Russian Federation.  In this case, the hostel should be on the balance of the serving city company.  That is, in fact, the dorm room is transferred to a person under a <span>social</span> contract of <span>employment.</span> </p><p>  But if the dwelling was presented after the introduction of the Housing Code of the Russian Federation, the privatization room is not subject to. </p><p>  To privatize a dormitory room, you must either conclude a special privatization agreement with the city administration, or, if there was a refusal from the administration, apply to the court for privatization.  To privatize housing, it is necessary to carry out several stages: </p><p>  - First you need to get all the technical documents for the room, which include - the plan of the room, an extract from the state unified register of the capital structure.  The procedure lasts about a month and a half. </p><p>  - then it is necessary to clarify the status of the hostel, where you need to get an extract from the register of municipal property of the city.  This stage will take longer - from 3 to 4 months. </p><p>  - after that, get a ticket to apply.  At this stage, the issue of consent to privatization is being decided, a person may be denied this appeal, but he may appeal to the court. </p><p>  One way or another, but the privatization of a dormitory room can also bring disadvantages - for the privatized room you will need to pay all the expensive <span>utilities,</span> as well as carry out <span>major repairs</span> yourself <span>.</span> </p>
