Therefore, many people preferred to use a more reliable way and bought what is in the store, albeit overpaying.  True, I had to choose only from a meager assortment. </p><p>  Laziness is the engine of progress, but not the only one.  Another engine is commerce.  And the Internet perfectly combines these two qualities, dividing them among its audience: users - laziness, and entrepreneurs - financial gain. </p><p>  Speaking of laziness, it is enough for a potential buyer to enter the query ‚Äúflashlight to buy‚Äù on the Internet, and thousands of search results will open in front of him with online stores offering the sale of flashlights of different brands, manufacturers, shapes and at different prices.  In this case, there is no need to travel around the city in search of some original model that you like and is suitable for the price.  For entrepreneurs, trading through an online store is advantageous with the opportunity to get more potential customers. </p><p>  With the right promotion of the resource at the request of "flashlight to buy", entrepreneurs save themselves from the need to rent premises in a crowded and accessible place for people, and they do not need a large staff.  And as a result, due to cost savings, entrepreneurs have the opportunity to put prices for goods on the Internet below the cost of flashlights in the city‚Äôs stores, and this pricing policy again attracts to online stores. </p><p>  Buying goods through an online store, you can get an exclusive flashlight by spending several hours sorting through all the possible models on the screen of your monitor. </p><p>  The advantage of buying a flashlight in an ordinary store is only a lower risk.  Having bought a product in a store, you bought it, and buying on the Internet is unlikely, but it may turn out to be a fiction, and if you pay money, you won‚Äôt get anything in return.  An outcome unfavorable to you is also possible in the form of loss of the parcel or delivery of goods with a significant delay and its damage during transportation. </p><p>  But in a regular store you can buy low-quality goods that will not last you long enough, so the most important thing in online shopping is the meaningful and correct choice of the store in which you are going <noindex>  <span>to buy a lamp</span> </noindex>  .  And since risk exists with any method of making a purchase, many people prefer to take risks in a comfortable chair with a cup of tea than to sit in a traffic jam in public transport, moving from store to store in search of happiness. </p></div></article>
