    <p>  When dealing with the question of how to use Sportmaster bonuses, you should pay attention to the specifics of using the cards themselves.  In case of loss of the latter, a new analogue of it may be issued.  A prerequisite is the provision of documents that can confirm the identity of the owner of the auction product.  Presentation of a passport and driver's license is allowed.  The presence of a receipt confirming the purchase in the store and which is the basis for previously accrued bonus points is appreciated.  When a card is lost, it is blocked.  All accumulated points are transferred to the new plastic.  If the data specified in the questionnaire do not match the information from the documents of the bearer, the club card is not restored.  The auction product is the property of the Sportmaster chain of stores.  Promotions, bonuses and special offers are designed only for regular customers, cardholders. </p><h2>  Additional charges </h2>

    <p>  A club card holder must not be under 18 years old.  You can find Sportmaster bonuses in any store and on the official website.  The management of the chain stores reserves the full right to unilaterally change the terms of the partnership.  Despite the fact that bonuses belong to the category of short-term ones, there are situations when it can take at least 3 months to add them to the card.  The program provides for a mobile version of plastic.  The prototype is available for download on the official website of the Sportmaster chain of stores.  You can check bonuses on a mobile type card in the same way as in the standard one.  The product is adapted for both accumulation and waste of points.  To activate the product, it is enough to send a short message with the text "K" to number 9753. You can clarify the number of bonuses through the help desk by phone 777-777-1 or by sending a request via text message with a card number to number 9753. The request can only be sent with the number that was indicated when registering the card in the application form. </p><h2>  Subtleties and nuances worthy of attention </h2>

    <p>  Despite the attractiveness of the program, there are several important points that are worth paying attention to.  In accordance with the terms of the promotion, bonuses are accrued only for purchases over 1000 rubles or more than 200 hryvnias.  If several rubles or hryvnias are not reached before this limit, no accruals are made.  The subsequent purchase will not be compared with the previous one and will not affect the calculation of points in any way.  The total amount of expenses may become the basis only for obtaining a card of a higher rank.  Having visited the Sportmaster store, it is not difficult to check bonuses, in fact, how to make a purchase with their help.  On the other hand, if the purchase is returned back to the store, on certain conditions only the money paid for the goods will be returned to the buyer‚Äôs hands.  Bonuses to the account are not returned, they burn out.  Please note that the promotion does not apply to discounted goods available in the Sportmaster store.  How many bonuses are awarded after purchasing items at a lower price, you should not check.  The program will be valid until January 1, 2016.  The exchange of accumulated cash bonuses is not provided. </p>
