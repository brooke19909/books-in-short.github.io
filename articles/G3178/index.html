    <h2>  From the history of recruitment </h2><p>  So what is recruitment in general?  The beginning of this terrible set, but necessary for troubled times, dates back to the 17th century.  Although then the essence of the recruit service was still out of the question.  The formation of simple soldiers and more honorable, dragoon troops at that time was carried out by ‚Äúaffluent people‚Äù gathered from all the estates.  In contrast to the regulated draws subsequently, pre-Petrine kits were not systemic, and the selection itself was most likely made by the method of community separation from one‚Äôs ranks of a person not so necessary to society. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By the way, the principle of ‚Äúblack sheep‚Äù did not leave its relevance much later, when in 1705 a new word sounded - ‚Äúrecruit‚Äù.  However, there was still some justice in the new reforms.  The community still in its place varied the royal decrees as desired, but the former courage of decisions was not observed.  At least 80% of men now had no family members per hundred recruits, and only a small number, for unknown reasons and bypassing the decree, invariably left behind numerous families.  But this justice came to an end in 1757, when the clause on the single situation went entirely to the will of the surrender. </p><h2>  General principles of the recruit convocation </h2><p>  Until 1736, recruitment in Russia met only a few, but unshakable principles: </p><ul><li>  all classes fell under it, regardless of class significance; </li><li>  of the noble sons, they called under recruitment by name, indicating a specific young man, which already excluded the possibility of substituting another person in his place.  But ordinary people, as at all times, depended entirely on the will of the community, playing recruitment tickets with such skill that under the "red hat" invariably fell horseless or troublemakers.  Or this question was simply raised at a general meeting; </li><li>  the service had no time limits - while the man was physically active and could carry out conscription, he was considered a soldier; </li><li>  no fixed rules regarding when to recruit and how many people from how many yards (estates, communities) to select, by default did not exist.  Each set created new conditions, according to which the composition of the army was completed. </li></ul><p>  Since 1736, the first privileges for noble offspring appeared - already at the family council a decision was made which of the brothers to serve and who should manage the vast economy.  And the new established service lives - 25 years, made it possible to return to civilian life still ‚Äúin the prime of life‚Äù.  Another 26 years the nobles had to endure ‚Äúfacilitated‚Äù conditions of conscription, as by decree of 1762 the burden of conscription completely fell on the shoulders of the inhabitants.  From the same year, gradual reckoning from the ministry of all privileged classes, as well as individuals, is noted. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="recruit service under Peter 1" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51870/1834997.jpg" width="600"></div>

But it was only a small spoonful of honey, as the same rules established new orders that read: </p><ul><li>  recruitment should now be carried out every year; </li><li>  for a thousand men subject to compulsory service in a simple year, take five people, in a year of increased need - from 7 to 10 people and more than that - in troubled years. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="essence of recruitment" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/1837053.jpg" width="450"></div></li></ul><h2>  How to fight corruption in the army </h2><p>  Guessing in advance the interest that local authorities would show in the nuances of the new decrees, Nicholas I thought about a certain controlling link in the representation of one person.  The choice fell on the chief of the gendarmerie corps of <span>Count Benckendorf,</span> whose name now has become almost a household word.  The count immediately responded to the appointment and showed rare efficiency, providing each recruiting presence with a staff officer. </p><p>  The supervisory authority, that is, the observer in the person of the officer, had the right to report all the violations noticed on the commissioned area directly to the king‚Äôs adjutant wing.  Thanks to such unexpected initiative, serving in the presence of recruits during the selection was not only unprofitable, but also dangerous. </p>

    <h2>  Army then, army now </h2><p>  What is recruitment then, and what does it have to do with the current situation?  At what stage did the Russian army switch to the regime of universal military service, ‚Äúobligation‚Äù, as they say now, and how much did this affect the quality of training of our troops? </p><p>  The year 1874 can be marked as the end of the era of recruitment.  For 169 years, the most powerful army in the world has existed, having managed in that time to form the influence that Russia has supported so far. </p><p>  The recruitment service under Peter 1 reached the greatest mass in 1725 - then 200 thousand soldiers were guarded the approaches to the state. </p><p>  Three times this amount, it was called up during the period when Napoleon‚Äôs troops entered our territory - from 1805 to 1812. </p><p>  The Crimean War has discovered completely unprecedented reserves - about one and a half million people from the start of the war and 300 thousand more soldiers - to its end.  What is the recruiting service of that period, it is not necessary to say - the numbers speak for themselves: the call was almost universal. </p><p>  Russia had to survive such a long-suffering in the Russo-Turkish war - and again it gathered under the bayonets more than one and a half million soldiers and officers. </p><p>  Now the number of Russian troops is equated to the period of the end of the 19th century, that is, it implies constant readiness in the person of a sufficiently powerful, millionth composition, and this in peacetime and with the well-known loyalty of the recruiting bodies, over which the damocles sword of Count Benckendorf does not hang. </p><p>  The real method of forming troops - the annual mandatory draft - is significantly different from the ‚Äúwill of chance‚Äù, recruiting conscription, and what, you see, is one year in the harsh modern army against the ‚Äúauthorized‚Äù 25 years of Peter's draft and seven-year service with the ‚Äúsoft‚Äù Nikolaev conscription? </p>
