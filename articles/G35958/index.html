  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why the sound does not work on the phone: possible causes and troubleshooting</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It is very unpleasant and painful when the mobile phone is silent, especially when you need to listen to some important voicemail messages or videos.  Many reasons can lead to such failures.  Here, a positive fact for the user is that most of the reasons can be eliminated on their own if you use the tools described below and pre-establish why the sound does not work on the phone. </p><h2>  Preset for everyone </h2><div class="photo" data-original="android.gadgethacks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Presets" class="if uuid-3245890" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/3245890.jpg"></div><p>  When the sound does not work on the phone, this creates a huge problem, because the user cannot use the device as it should. </p><p>  Here are some common steps to fix a sound problem: </p><ol><li>  Check the phone volume, press the increase / decrease buttons. </li><li>  Reboot the mobile phone, remove the headphones and clean the connector. </li><li>  Check the position of the vibration sound switch, for this go to settings&gt; click on sound&gt; volume.  By setting this option, you can adjust the volume of music, ringtones and notifications. </li><li>  If the setting is successful, use the device, if not, continue the recovery further and look for a reason explaining why the sound does not work on the phone. </li><li>  Update the firmware of the device, go to the setting.  Click on the ‚Äúabout phone‚Äù section, find ‚Äúsystem update / software update‚Äù and click on it, download the latest version for the phone. </li><li>  They check the music application and clear the cache, go to the settings, and then click on the clear data tab. </li><li>  If these actions also did not bring results, then install the SoundAbout application from Google Play for free. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="play.google.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sound Recovery App" class="if uuid-3245884" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/3245884.jpg"></div><h2>  Headphone Mode Failure </h2><p>  This is another reason why the sound does not work on the phone.  In this case, the headset gets stuck in headphone mode.  Even if the user has disabled them, the icon will not disappear.  And you cannot hear music or sound without them.  This problem is very common for Samsung / Motorola / LG cell phones. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Elimination Algorithm: </p><ol><li>  Increase the phone volume to make sure it is not in silent mode. </li><li>  Plug and unplug headphones several times. </li><li>  Clean the headphone jack by removing dust / debris from the jack.  Sometimes an existing obstruction on the connector can trick the phone into falsely sending a signal that the headset is connected. </li><li>  Turn the device off and on again. </li><li>  Restarting will help the device update and fix software errors. </li></ol><h2>  Install a custom application </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Application &quot;Earphone mode off&quot;." class="if uuid-3245888" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/3245888.jpg"></div><p>  Did the sound on your phone suddenly stop working while using the app, making a call or watching a video?  This is an unpleasant situation, however, because of this, you should not throw the device into the trash. </p><p>  If the above funds do not give a result, and the phone rings poorly, you can use the additional application "Earphone mode off".  Some mobile phones show that the headphones are connected, although in reality this is not so.  This application is the solution to such a problem.  If the headset is still showing, switch to speaker mode, sound will come from the output speaker. </p><h2>  Silent Android Speakers </h2><p>  Often the reason why the sound does not work on the phone are situations when the Android external / internal speaker stops working suddenly, in this case the device does not make a sound at all.  And also during calls to others, they hear nothing.  If there is no audibility in the headphones, then this is probably a hardware problem.  You need to check the external and internal speaker of Android using the device diagnostic tool. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Diagnostic algorithm - how to find out why there is no sound on the Samsung S4 phone: </p><ol><li>  Open the hardware kit and enter the key combination * # 7353 # to enter the Device Diagnostic Tool menu. </li><li>  For an external speaker, touch the Speaker icon.  If it works normally, then very loud music coming from the device will be heard. </li><li>  Click ‚ÄúSpeaker‚Äù again to mute the sound. </li><li>  For the internal speaker, press the Melody key.  If everything is in order with the speaker, music will come from it. </li><li>  If the device does not pass the test, then the problem is in the software. </li></ol><p>  In this case, you can use the following tips: </p><ol><li>  Reboot the phone in the usual way. </li><li>  Turn off Bluetooth, sometimes the <span>speaker does not work,</span> because the device is connected to this device. </li><li>  If everything is done correctly, then the sound will appear, if not, then the reason explaining why there is no sound on the phone may be a hardware problem, then you will have to send it for repair. </li></ol><h2>  Restore factory settings </h2><div class="photo" data-original="drfone.wondershare.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Factory settings" class="if uuid-3245876" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/3245876.jpg"></div><p>  Sometimes users complain that the Android phone turns off automatically during a call or switches to silent or active mode itself.  This case may be caused by some third-party applications or a full cache.  There are two ways to solve the problem due to which the sound on the phone is lost.  Consider them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Check for sound when the device is in safe mode: </p><ol><li>  In order to enter safe mode, you must first turn off the phone. </li><li>  Press and hold the power button again until the question appears whether it is necessary to enter safe mode. </li><li>  Click on "OK", after which the safe mode will load. </li><li>  After entering it, the sound mode is checked.  If there are no problems, this means that the problem with the speaker is caused by third-party applications, so you need to find the recently installed one and then uninstall it. </li><li>  Further it is recommended to clear the cache, for this enter the recovery mode on Android. </li><li>  Then use the volume down button to select the Wipe Cache Partition option from the menu and press the power button to confirm the action. </li><li>  Once the cleaning process is over, you need to select Reboot system now to reboot the device. </li></ol><p>  Typically, these two methods can effectively solve the problem due to which there is no sound when they call on the phone.  If it failed, you can use the factory reset Android.  Before doing this, back up important files on the phone, and then select "Settings"&gt; "Backup and reset"&gt; "Factory data reset"&gt; "Reset phone" to erase all settings on the device. </p><h2>  Bluetooth speaker does not make a sound </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidcentral.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bluetooth speaker does not make a sound" class="if uuid-3245875" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/3245875.jpg"></div><p>  Another common situation is that users do not hear sounds when connecting the device to the Bluetooth speaker.  Before approaching the serious steps to eliminate this type of malfunction, you need to check if the Bluetooth speaker / handset is working on another phone, if so, you need to reconnect the device, then go to Settings&gt; Bluetooth, double-click the icon ‚ÄúByte-headset‚Äù, ‚ÄúListen to music‚Äù. </p><p>  A crash can also occur if many similar devices are stored in the phone‚Äôs Bluetooth menu and the user forgets to ‚Äúdisconnect‚Äù these devices, especially if they are not used very often.  All unnecessary bluetooth applications must be closed forcibly.  This will not only clear the list of devices, but also help to remove and reconnect a device that is regularly used. </p><p>  Setting procedure: </p><ol><li>  In the Bluetooth menu, select the desired speaker from the list by clicking to the right of its name. </li><li>  Select the ‚ÄúClose device‚Äù function. </li><li>  Click ‚ÄúForget Device‚Äù again to confirm. </li><li>  Press the Bluetooth button on the speaker to start the pairing process again, and select it in the list of devices on the phone / tablet when it appears again. </li></ol><p>  Sound should now come from the Bluetooth speaker.  If not, you need to contact the service and ask them to fix the error. </p><h2>  Soaked apparatus </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidpit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Soaked Samsung Galaxy" class="if uuid-3245865" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/3245865.jpg"></div><p>  Sometimes sound problems arise due to the fact that water has entered the speaker of the phone.  You can remove this moisture by turning off the device, removing the battery and SIM card and placing them in a container of rice for 24 hours.  You can remove residual moisture by carefully blow-drying the hair dryer, making sure that it is at the lowest heating level and at a sufficient distance from the phone to prevent overheating.  Continue the operation for no more than a minute. </p><p>  Further, after there is confidence that the phone and its parts are completely dry, they reboot, perhaps this will fix some malfunctions that were the cause of the problem. </p><p>  Then make sure that the latest software update is installed on the device.  To do this, go to settings&gt; about device&gt; software update&gt; check for updates.  Download the latest update for your phone. </p><p>  If these actions do not bring the proper result, contact the supplier or the place of purchase, as this may be a hardware problem, and it will be necessary to repair or replace the device. </p><h2>  Inaudible iPad sound </h2><div class="photo" data-original="osxdaily.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sound problems" class="if uuid-3245862" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/3245862.jpg"></div><p>  If the sound is quiet on the phone, it may disappear from certain applications over time, even if the volume is turned on.  This device has a Soft Mute function that mutes the music and sounds of the application, but not the sound of Hulu or Netflix, which makes it difficult to diagnose. </p><p>  The procedure for setting the soft mute function on the iPad: </p><ol><li>  Press the "Home" button twice. </li><li>  Spend from left to right. </li><li>  Click the speaker icon in the far left position. </li><li>  Mute Off should appear below the play button. </li><li>  Listen to the sound of the application. </li><li>  This should fix the lack of sound in it, if there are problems with the speaker icon being displayed when moving from left to right, you can also turn off quiet sound by doing the following: go to "Settings" / "General" / "Use side switch for" and select "Turn off sound ‚Äù, then use the rocker. </li></ol><h2>  IPhone sound issues </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.besthdwallpaper.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="IPhone sound issue" class="if uuid-3245851" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/3245851.jpg"></div><p>  The problem of lack of sound in the iPhone is one of the most common, along with a broken camera. </p><p>  The most common types: </p><ol><li>  The phone is ringing badly. </li><li>  You can‚Äôt listen to music without headphones, the volume is gone. </li><li>  No sound is heard from the speaker. </li></ol><p>  The user does not need to rush to Apple Service.  Many problems can be solved independently: </p><ol><li>  The first reason why you cannot hear the sound coming from the device is because the volume could be set to the lowest level or the device was turned off.  Better to check it out first. </li><li>  The next factor to check is the wrong application, especially audio.  For example, the user does not hear sound only when watching a video through YouTube.  In this case, it may be an isolated problem in the video file or YouTube itself may fail. </li><li>  You can try using other video / audio applications on the device, and if other applications work, then the problem is only in YouTube. </li><li>  Installing the wrong updates and programs on the device can also cause a similar problem.  If the user began to hear the sound coming from the device after installing a new update, then it is the reason and should be removed. </li></ol><h2>  Simple recommendations </h2><p>  Reboot the device to try to fix the error.  Minor software crashes are often corrected by a reboot.  Phone Sound Settings: </p><ol><li>  They overload the device by holding both buttons until the screen turns off, and then returns again and displays the logo.  The smartphone will restart without affecting personal data. </li><li>  Go to the default setting.  This problem is a little more radical than the previous ones, since the personal settings of the smartphone will be lost.  To do this, go to "Settings", then "General" and "Reset all Settings".  This step will affect the safety of data, contacts or media files. </li><li>  Perform cleaning of external noise.  If the gadget is in a case or bumper, make sure that it does not block the speaker. </li><li>  Turn off Bluetooth, select ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù&gt; ‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù&gt; ‚ÄúBluetooth‚Äù to turn off the headset or simply turn it off on the lock screen. </li></ol><h2>  Restoring an early image </h2><div class="photo" data-original="recover-data-on-ios.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Restore factory firmware" class="if uuid-3245856" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/3245856.jpg"></div><p>  It‚Äôs good when the user has a backup copy of the image of a working system - for any problem, you can return to it.  Note that all images, media, and contacts added after installing the backup will be deleted. </p><p>  Go to Settings&gt; iCloud.  Select Storage &amp; Backup and the backup you want to restore.  In addition, you can restore a copy of iPhone through iTunes. </p><p>  There are several strange but effective methods for resolving sound malfunction: </p><ol><li>  You need to squeeze the lower right corner of the device above the speaker, holding for about 20 seconds.  The connector may be loosened, so this action will fix it. </li><li>  Find and open an application with music or sound effects.  Adjust the volume using the volume buttons or the slider in the Control Center on the lock screen. </li><li>  Restart by holding the "Sleep" and "Home" buttons simultaneously for 10-15 seconds, until the logo appears, not paying attention to the red slider - release the buttons.  The operation is equivalent to rebooting the computer. </li></ol><p>  This is the main list of problems due to which the sound on the phone does not work, what to do in this case is explained to the user in detail.  If none of the above steps helped to fix the problem with the speaker, you need to contact a service center, maybe there is a problem with the equipment, for example, you need to replace the speaker. </p>
