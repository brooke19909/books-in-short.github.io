And all this is because purposefully this fish is caught only by the most experienced fishermen who are well aware of his habits, his habitat and "trails". </p><p>  Tench is distributed mainly in lakes, as well as in rivers and reservoirs with a silty bottom.  Sometimes this fish can reach sizes exceeding thirty centimeters.  Catching tench is especially good before spawning - having a clumsy thick body, which is covered with small scales and a thick mucous layer, it is very well caught on cloudy days. </p><p>  After spawning, and this is approximately the beginning of June, tench begins to feed very intensively, and as the water warms up, especially in coastal thickets, its nibble increases.  In early spring and until mid-summer, this fish is fed with balls of algae, a feed mixture of plant origin. </p><p>  Fishing for tench should begin in the early morning, especially in winter, but better - in the evening dawn just before <span>sunset.</span>  There is an opinion that a place for this type of fishing needs to be artificially prepared in advance: tear out the vegetation existing there, create artificial paths, sprinkle yellowish sand on the bottom.  However, according to some, it is easier to drive this lake fish from a favorite place than to arrange a trap for it.  On reservoirs there are a lot of natural gaps and backwaters, which are chosen by her. </p><p>  Do not agree with those fishermen who claim that only with a boat the catch increases.  Fishing can be carried out both from a boat and from the shore.  However, since this is a rather shy fish, the boat can frighten it, discouraging its desire to feed, as a result of which the ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù place can quickly become empty.  An adult is very fond of feasting on small mollusks, bottom crustaceans and various worms, insect larvae.  She digs for a long time in the bottom silt, blowing up bubbles like a diver.  And it is precisely this fact that indicates the presence of a tench in a given place. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Float fishing is an ideal type of fishing if it is fishing for tench.  It is very difficult to catch it with other tackles, because the bait should be above the silt for two to three centimeters, which can only be achieved with a float.  The best floats suitable for this type of fishing are lightweight in the shape of a cone or from various feathers.  The main thing to remember is that when fishing, tench <span>never surrenders,</span> it always stubbornly resists, very often goes deeper into the thickets, poking its nose into silt.  In this case, it is impossible to <span>force events</span> , it is better to wait out by pulling the fishing line until the moment when the fish starts moving again. </p><p>  When catching a tench, a strong and sharp hook is needed so that the hook strongly bites into the mouth or lips of the fish.  Sometimes it goes to the bottom with a nozzle in the mouth and drowns the float.  In such cases, hooking is almost always very successful.  Moreover, young individuals grab the nozzle at its tip.  drive along the water surface for a long time and only then drag it under water.  In these cases, premature hooking can help the fish get off the hook. </p><p>  When choosing bait, many molt anglers prefer worms, while at the same time they attach a whole bunch of medium-sized rain or dung beetles to the hook.  Maggot is also quite good, and not a store one, but a natural one, which has an attractive smell for fish. </p><p>  Fishing in the winter is very interesting: after all, few people know that it can be caught immediately from under the ice.  And it‚Äôs very impressive size.  And this is done like this: up to eight fishing rods are put in a circle in a half meter, a nod or a float serves as an indicator.  Typically, fishermen do not sit next to such fishing rods, as the bites are controlled using additionally drilled holes.  And there is no fear that you can be late with hooking, sometimes even very late, it rewards the angler with an excellent large tench. </p>
