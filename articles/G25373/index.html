Yekaterinburg is a fairly large metropolis, but, unfortunately, there are not so many establishments that offer really tasty food.  That is why such places in the city are very popular.  And one of them is precisely the "Lawn". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lawn Restaurant Yekaterinburg" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1664524.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  A restaurant </h2><p>  Yekaterinburg has changed very much in recent years.  Multistory complexes have grown everywhere.  One of them is Clever Park.  The complex was built in a picturesque area of ​​the city, on the banks <span>of the Iset River,</span> in a green park.  And it is on its roof that the "Lawn" restaurant is arranged.  Yekaterinburg from its panoramic windows is perfectly visible.  That is why the institution has become a favorite destination for tourists. </p><p>  Gazon is both a rooftop restaurant and bar.  A spacious hall, a hookah card, delicious food - what else is needed for a pleasant pastime.  A lot of natural material was used in the design of the restaurant, whose interior the administration positions as “industrial”.  Depending on the format of the event that is being held here, the configuration of the main hall changes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The Lawn Restaurant (Yekaterinburg) opened just two years ago - in August 2015.

    <p>  The features of this amazing object are the ability to transform the space, changing it for different purposes, a fairly large bar area, a spacious summer terrace.  In addition, the "Lawn" restaurant (Yekaterinburg) has a clearing with an artificially made lawn where visitors can have picnics and have a barbecue, just admire the stars or spend hours looking at the stunningly beautiful panoramas of the city.  Judging by the reviews, customers here feel themselves in the lap of nature, as if on a green forest lawn. </p><p>  The restaurant has a large underground car park, free Wi-Fi.  In the evenings, live music is played here.  The best day to visit the Lawn is Friday, when after a busy week, people manage to relax, drink excellent wine under a hookah and see the city from a bird's eye view. </p><h2>  Roof, sky and wine </h2><p>  This is exactly the slogan of this institution located on the twenty-third floor of BC “Clover Park”, on the very approaches to the city park.  Restaurant "Lawn" (Yekaterinburg) offers European dishes.  He works twelve hours.  The institution opens at noon, and closes at midnight.  On Saturdays and Sundays, it is open until four in the morning. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Restaurant Lawn Ekaterinburg menu" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1664526.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Since Lawn is owned by a woman whom residents of Yekaterinburg owe the opening of one of the best city bars - Moskva Bar, one can imagine what quality services this restaurant offers.  The price segment in which the institution operates is medium.  Hookah lovers will appreciate the various offers from experts.  Connoisseurs call them the best in the city.  Despite its comparatively “young” age, this restaurant is already well known in the city.  Lawn (Yekaterinburg), whose menu is not only European but also original, is considered a great place to celebrate any significant event, be it a birthday, wedding or corporate party.  It is especially nice to visit this place in late spring or summer, as you can sit on a cozy terrace. </p><h2>  Visitors reviews </h2><p>  Many people praised the restaurant’s kitchen.  Here on the menu you can find many original dishes from the chef.  Eclairs with cabbage, a rack of <span>lamb, a</span> warm salad instead of bread, a salad with salmon - everything is originally served on the table.  Business lunches are available at affordable prices on weekdays.  Drinks are the special pride of the establishment.  This is evidenced by almost all those who visited the lawn restaurant (Yekaterinburg).  Reviews of branded teas, especially Australian and sea-buckthorn teas, indicate that they can withstand even the most stringent criticisms.  Their original pleasant taste is very different from the classic varieties.  No less exquisite, judging by the reviews, is the restaurant's wine list. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Restaurant Lawn Yekaterinburg reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1664525.jpg" width="600"></div>
