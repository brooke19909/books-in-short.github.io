In terms of price and technical characteristics, such devices had a lot of declared advantages compared to phones of those times, since for just $ 50 it was easy to purchase some kind of mobile phone with a touch color screen that supports multiple SIM cards at the same time, and also has a built-in TV tuner (which often was their main advantage). </p><p>  In fact, everything happened in a completely different way, that is, the phones could support the battery charge for an extremely short time, the screens were very resistive and extremely sensitive to pressing, and the general operation of the interface was far from the best, not to mention the quality of the translation.  All this looked extremely sad against the background of the fact that, if repair was necessary, almost no workshop even thought of taking such a phone for repair.  At that time, many people were sworn to buy Chinese mobile phones. </p><h2>  What changed? </h2>

    <p>  After the Android operating system appeared, as well as much cheaper mobile processors and screens, the situation has changed significantly.  The typical device development scheme, as well as the availability of a ready-made operating system, made it possible to significantly reduce overall costs and subsequently direct them to increase the quality of manufactured smartphones while maintaining a fairly low cost. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Especially the situation changed after the release of the DooGee Valencia DG800, which is characterized by very good technical characteristics both in the description and in practice, noted by the predominant majority of users of this smartphone. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  In the standard set of the device there is an additional white back panel, battery, screen film, charger, cable for connecting to a computer, headset, as well as instructions made exclusively in English.  Immediately it is worth saying that the headset for the DooGee Valencia DG800 comes in very poor quality, so many users recommend immediately buy something new for themselves.  At the same time, charging and cable for connecting to a computer demonstrate good performance and the same appearance.  On the USB lanyard there is a specialized clasp that allows you to carry the cable quite comfortably, without fear that it will get tangled. </p><p>  The additional back cover is made quite interesting, but more about it will be discussed in the sequel. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2>

    <p>  Despite the fact that the device was manufactured by the Chinese brand and is also in a budget price category, the DooGee Valencia DG800 is quite attractive and in many ways even unique in design.  If necessary, the user can always choose for himself the most optimal option among the six available colors. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A screen with a diagonal of 4.5 inches is quite standard today, but at the same time, the DooGee Valencia DG800 smartphone is quite modest in size, which makes it extremely easy to hold it in your hand.  Given the small thickness of the case of this device, it can easily be carried even in a jeans pocket, without experiencing any discomfort. </p><h2>  Housing </h2><p>  The front panel is made of plastic, but it should be noted right away that you should not be afraid of scratches on the DooGee Valencia DG800 case, since two protective films are supplied in the standard kit.  Around the front panel there is a barely noticeable silver edging that protects the screen from scratches in the event that the device will lay the screen down. </p><p>  Under the screen there are functional silver touch buttons, but, unfortunately, there is no backlight.  At the same time, the manufacturers of DooGee Valencia DG800 provided for indentation from the side and bottom edges so that during the operation of this device it was possible to completely exclude any accidental operation of certain functions or making calls. </p><p>  Above the screen you can see the front camera, the earpiece, as well as the light and proximity sensor. </p><h2>  Back touch </h2>

    <p>  In addition to the standard cover, a specialized Back Touch panel is also included.  Such a product is made of white plastic and is equipped with a small rectangular touch area.  If you touch this area, you get the same effect as when you touch the touch screen, as a result of which you can use it to surf web pages or perform any other actions.  Such devices work quite simply, but reviews of the DooGee DG800 Valencia suggest that few people have found any practical use of this feature. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Screen and its characteristics </h2><p>  As mentioned above, the screen diagonal is 4.5 inches, and its resolution is 540x960 pixels.  Such a high definition screen is simply ideal for such a diagonal, and it is unlikely that anyone can see individual pixels with the naked eye.  Color reproduction is distinguished by a fairly high veracity, and in terms of quality of execution, this screen is practically not inferior to the flagship models from the famous brands of its time.  Even if you look at the screen at the maximum possible viewing angles, the colors will not fade or change their hue. </p><p>  Due to the sufficiently high brightness level, this smartphone can be used even if it will be exposed to direct sunlight, but many users say that the DooGee Valencia DG800 phone has a too high threshold for minimum brightness.  If any external lighting is completely absent, too long use of this smartphone begins to cause some discomfort. </p><h2>  Touchscreen </h2>
      <br>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Also, a surface review by DooGee DG800 Valencia showed that there is no <span>oleophobic coating</span> on the front panel <span>,</span> as a result of which fingerprints accumulate quite actively on the screen.  At the same time, the multi-touch is quite sensitive, that is, it quickly and clearly responds to touch, although it provides for the possibility of no more than two simultaneous clicks.  The sensor, which provides automatic brightness control, has a fairly smooth operation. </p><h2>  System </h2><p>  The operation of this device is based on the use of the Android operating system.  In fact, the system in this case uses the standard one, that is, there is a traditional interface, keyboard, and any applications initially display the design from Google.  The only noticeable change in appearance is the stock set of standard icons, as a result of which they were all stylized as MIUI. </p><p>  In addition to standard applications, the developers of this smartphone have added the only Assistive touch program, with which you can configure gestures to enable certain applications.  However, it is worth noting that many users have noticed the insignificant practicality of using this application. </p><h2>  Firmware </h2>

      <p></p>
    <p>  The use of standard firmware is considered by many to be a good solution, since even in such a version the operating system works very stably and has a large number of features.  Practice says that the introduction of any of its own modifications and inventions, especially from little-known manufacturers, rarely ends successfully. </p><p>  The firmware provides for the possibility of updating through OTA, which is a rather rare occurrence among Chinese smartphones.  Thus, if the next firmware update is released, you just need to go somewhere on the Internet via Wi-Fi and press the only button that starts the fully automatic update of this device. </p><h2>  Sensor Settings </h2><p>  In the settings you can find Back Touch, where the basic parameters of the button located at the back of the screen are set.  You can adjust the parameters of the following items: </p><ul><li>  Click  If the camera application is in an active state, a standard press allows you to take a photo. </li><li>  Long press.  If the camera application is running, then in the case of a long press, the switch from the front camera to the main one or vice versa will occur. </li><li>  Double click.  Opens a specific application or ends the current conversation. </li><li>  Double Click to open application.  In this column, you can select the application that opens if you double-click on the back button. </li></ul><h2>  Battery </h2>

    <p>  Again, unlike the vast majority of modern Chinese smartphones, the developers decided to use only one battery, while two are standardly equipped.  During the tests, it was determined that while constantly surfing the Internet, the DooGee DG800 Valencia battery lasts for five and a half hours.  It is worth noting that this is a fairly modest result, since the claimed capacity of this battery is 2000 mAh, so through additional studies it was determined that the actual capacity reaches only 1500 mAh.  The difference between this device and similar models with a capacity of 2000 mAh can be felt even in weight. </p><p>  However, in any case, such a result is quite optimal for a modern budget-class device (given that on the DooGee Valencia DG800 the price is on average 5500 rubles), since even in case of active use of the device‚Äôs charge it will be enough for one day. </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  The cameras of this device deserve special attention.  The standard camera has a very solid 13 megapixels for its segment and is characterized by fairly high-quality photography, but the front camera is more surprising, which, with its 8 megapixels, also has good photo quality.  You just need to open the case with the DooGee DG800 Valencia, take out the device and take a few shots in order to verify the high quality of the camera from one side and the other. </p>
