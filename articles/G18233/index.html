    <h2>  Idea selection </h2><p>  It can be that formidable goat, which butts all the children who do not listen to mom and do not want to eat porridge.  Another option is the kind mommy from the well-known fairy tale ‚ÄúSeven Little Kids‚Äù.  Or an ironic image that will amuse not only the child, but also those around him.  Or maybe a glamorous goat with chic long eyelashes, white curls, false nails and a crown on his head.  There are just a huge number of ideas, and perhaps the child will be able to tell how exactly the costume imagines.  By the way, creating a costume can be an excellent option for co-creation, where the baby can show his creative abilities. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Image Details </h2><p>  To make a goat costume with your own hands, you should first consider all the elements of the outfit, from the horns to the hooves.

    <h2>  How to choose the basis for the costume </h2><p>  To sew a beautiful goat costume with your own hands, you need to choose the right fabric.  For this purpose, velor, velvet or thin fur with curled small pile is ideal.  It is best to give preference to well-stretching materials.  Even novice craftswomen will cope with them, since when landing on a figure, all the flaws of the cut are a little hidden due to stretching the fabric.  It should also be noted that a special needle for knitted fabrics will be necessary for the sewing machine.  Without it, it is unlikely to be able to lay even lines without gaps and holes on the fabric.  Another plus of knitwear is that it does not need to be swept, it is enough just to shake off the cut well so that the pile damaged by the cut will fall off.  It is easy to sew such fabric not only on the machine, but also manually. </p><p>  The basis of the costume may consist of a dress, skirt or panties with a blouse.  Fitting leggings with a wide elastic band at the waist and a short skirt-bundle will look great.  For the top, it is not necessary to sew a blouse on your own, you can pick up a white T-shirt or turtleneck over which a cape will be worn. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="make a goat costume with your own hands" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/636548.jpg" width="386"></div>

The easiest way is to loop around the child‚Äôs clothes and get patterns of leggings, trousers or dresses. </p><p>  In order to make a skirt, it is necessary to cut a strip of fabric, connect the edges to the top, sew on an elastic band or make a drawstring for the elastic band.  If a tutu skirt is planned, then you will need 6-7 meters of tulle, which is cut into strips of 10-15 cm and tied to a dense elastic band as long as the child‚Äôs waist. </p><p>  The cloak is also cut out in the form of a rectangular cloth.  Its edges can be tucked up or treated with an <span>oblique inlay,</span> on top the cloak cloth is turned inside out by about 1.5 cm and a seam is laid, a satin ribbon 3-5 cm wide is inserted into the hole so that the child does not accidentally pull the tie from the drawstring, at the edges of the main fabric you can attach soft buboes.  To do this, circles with a diameter of about 10 cm are cut out of the fabric, along the edge the part is stitched and pulled together, filling the bubo with synthetic winterizer.
