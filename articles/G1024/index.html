This applies to any device based on Android.  A special protocol called <span>root-rights (root</span> access - root access or administrator access) is responsible for providing access to closed files.  Google (the company developing Android), equipping all devices that came off the assembly line with its operating system, initially limit the capabilities of the end user by disabling root rights on Android. </p><p>  It is sad, but in addition to this, the device manufacturers also do not give the opportunity to return it under warranty, if the user has root-rights on their device.  Many do not imagine life without full access to the functionality of their device and get root-rights through flashing or special programs.  But what if the need arose to restore a special protocol? </p><p>  Regardless of the reason for its restoration (warranty case, transfer to other hands, etc.), this can be done by the same programs or applications by which these rights were obtained.  If you do not have information about this, then the methods described below will help in solving the problem of how to disable root-rights on Android. </p><p>  If there are doubts about the availability of root rights as such, you can use the special application from the Google Play Market - Root Checker. </p>

    <h2>  Removing administrator rights through the Android application </h2><p>  This method will also help to understand the question of how to disable root-rights on "Android 6.0" and higher.  If there are any root-rights management applications on the device (Superuser, SuperSU), then you can delete the root using them through the settings of this application, or simply by deleting this application (this will automatically delete the root-rights). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In addition to SuperSU, you can use various applications from the Google Play Market, one of which is Universal Unroot (paid).  Running this application will automatically destroy the root-rights without the possibility of their restoration.  Further, the device will reboot and access to root rights will be limited. </p><p>  There are also free applications that can get rid of the root.  Their list can be found at the end of the article. </p><h2>  Removing root rights through a computer </h2><p>  It is advisable to know which computer program received special functions to disable root-rights on Android through the computer.  Like most programs of this kind, they have the opportunity to restore the restriction on access to root rights again.  If information about this is not available, then you can use any of the computer programs listed at the end of the article. </p>

    <p>  To disable the root using the program, just connect the device to the computer and run the corresponding program.  Further, through the program options, disable administrator rights. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Another way to remove administrator rights through a computer is to flash the device.  To do this, you can use, for example, the official firmware from the website of the manufacturer of the gadget.  But, unfortunately, this method requires some knowledge and more time than the rest. </p><h2>  Manual removal of root rights </h2><p>  You can remove administrator rights manually.  This is a must in case you need to hand over the device for repair under warranty.  As noted above, the warranty on devices with root rights is automatically removed.  Therefore, in this case, you need to try to get rid of all possible traces of the presence and installation of access to special rights.  The service center employees will first of all check the built-in SD card of the device for the presence of files in it, indicating the receipt of root rights. </p><p>  The only way out is to install special applications that have access to the system files of the gadget, on which root-rights must be disabled.  As on Android 5.1, 6.0 and higher, older versions of this operating system have the same folders containing root-rights files.  One such application is Root Browser, which can also be downloaded directly through the Google Play Market. </p><p>  You need to download, install and open this application.  Next, using its interface, find the system folder on the built-in system memory card of the device.  It will have bin and / or xbin sections.  Inside the bin and xbin folders there must be busybox and / or su files. </p>

After that, you need to find SuperUser.apk or SuperSu.apk files in the App folder located in the same System section.

    <p>  In the System folder, you may find the su section, which also needs to be detected and, if any, deleted.  It happens that busybox and su files are in other sections of the system.  In any case, the target is these files, and they will need to be found by going over different folders. </p><p>  In addition to Root Browser, there are other applications that will help with the manual removal of root-rights files.  Their list is presented at the end of the article. </p><h2>  How to temporarily disable root-rights on the "Android"? </h2><p>  In many situations, temporarily disabling root rights is a very convenient solution.  Independent developers created the Temp Root Remover application.  It does not apply to the Google Play Market, so it will need to be searched on third-party resources, for example, w3bsit3-dns.com. </p>

    <p>  Temp Root Remover saves you special rights by renaming the above su file in the bin and xbin folders.  Using the application options, you can rename the su file at any time, and after the need arises, restore root-rights and return it to its original name.  However, you can not restart the device. </p><p>  Temp Root Remover does not solve the problem of completely cleaning the system from traces of the presence of root rights.  Therefore, you can‚Äôt use it before submitting the gadget to the service. </p><h2>  Removing root rights on Samsung Galaxy </h2><p>  Separately, it is worth mentioning about the removal of administrator rights to Samsung Galaxy devices.  The fact is that the developers implemented a special KNOX counter in these devices, designed to track hacks and various changes in the Android system.  You can reset KNOX readings after removing root rights, but only if they were received by one of the latest methods and applications that require the presence of a KNOX counter on the device. </p><p>  First of all, you need to download to your computer an archive with official firmware for the Samsung device, which will undergo root-rights disconnection on Android.  Whatever the device (phone, tablet), in any case, this archive should contain a file with the extension .tar.md5.  He needs to be found.  Next, install drivers on your computer to connect Samsung devices to it.  Find them on developer.samsung.com.  After that, you will need the Odin3 program.  It will also need to be found, downloaded and installed. </p><p>  The next step is to initialize the download mode with the gadget, in which you can install new firmware on it.  To enter this mode, you need to hold down the volume down, turn off and return (home) buttons on the device at the same time.  Further, as soon as the gadget is in the firmware reception mode, connect it with a USB cable to the PC and open the Odin3 program.  Find the PDA option through the program interface and select the file with the extension .tar.md5 obtained from the downloaded archive with firmware.  Next, select the F. Reset Time and Auto Reboot options, deselect the remaining options and press Start.  After a few minutes, the program will save Samsung from root-rights and the device will reboot. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable root rights to android through klmpyuter" class="if" height="446" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60193/2009902.jpg" width="600"></div>
