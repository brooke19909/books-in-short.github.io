Tourism infrastructure is developed there much better than in the rest of the PRC.  Many high-class hotels, entertainment and excursions will be a pleasant addition to a vacation on beautiful well-groomed beaches by the warm South China Sea.  Where to stay to spend a vacation on about.  Hainan?  Yuhai International Resort Apartment SPA - a five-star hotel - became the topic of this article.  By the way, most recently it was renamed to Azur Resort 5 *.  What conditions await holidaymakers in this hotel?  Where is it?  What is nearby?  Our article will tell about all this.  We were based not only on information provided by the hotelier himself.

    <h2>  Hainan Island  The nuances of relaxation </h2><p>  Previously, this island, whose name can be translated as "In the South of the Sea", was exiled to the emperor of the Celestial Empire who fell into disgrace.  Now it is called "Chinese Hawaii."  The island also has a middle name.  Due to the large number of thermal mineral springs, Hainan is called the "Health Resort of China."  This is the second largest (only Taiwan surpasses it) the island of China.  But Hainan is the only one in the country lying in tropical latitudes.  Therefore, as an application to beaches and the sea, tourists get access to bananas, lychees and other exotic fruits, which the region is rich in.  <span>You can relax in Hainan,</span> where the Yuhai International Resort Apartment SPA (China) is located, in any season.  Three hundred days a year are clear, the average air temperature is +24, and the sea +26 degrees.  But the ideal time to visit Hainan is spring and autumn.  In the summer months it is too hot, and in the winter there are those same 65 cloudy days. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Sanya.  Resort Features </h2><p>  If Hainan is the most chic island in China, then Sanya is the most prestigious holiday destination on it.  The resort is located at the southernmost tip.  All that China has achieved in modern architecture and hi-tech can be seen in Sanya.  This resort meets all needs: shopaholics - because of the abundance of shops and fashion boutiques;  parents with children - due to the gentle entrance to the sea protected from storms;  divers - because of the wealth of the underwater world off the coast;  youth - because of the huge selection of entertainment.  As for hotels, most of them belong to a high category of service.  Among them is Azur Resort 5 * (formerly Yuhai International Resort Apartment SPA).  But you can also find budget hotels in Sanya. </p><p>  The resort has many shopping centers where they sell clothes and shoes of famous brands.  But there is a place for craftsmen and craftsmen.  The main souvenirs that are brought from Sanya are pearl jewelry.  This industry was developed here even before Hainan turned into a resort island.  For shopping, it is not necessary to sacrifice the beach: shops and markets are open until ten in the evening. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yuhai International Resort Apartment Spa 5" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1796083.jpg" width="600"></div>

A charter flight will bring such tourists to Sanya-Phoenix Airport, and from there they will bring a bus directly to the hotel entrance.  And how to get to the hotel for independent travelers?  Have to fly with transfers (Muscovites and residents of Siberia with one, Petersburgers - with two).  There is an opportunity to get to the city of Guangzhou by plane, and from there take the ‚Äúslipping bass‚Äù or train to the capital of Hainan, Haikou.  From there, every twenty minutes in the daytime there are buses to Sanya.  If you trust air transport more, it is most reasonable to fly with a transfer in Wuhan, with South China Airlines.  Their ships land at Phoenix (Sanya) Airport.  To the hotel from there about ten minutes by taxi. </p><h2>  Hotels nearby </h2><p>  Sanya is a rapidly developing resort.  Something is constantly being built and built there.  If you read the reviews about the Yuhai International Resort Apartment SPA hotel for 2014-15, then guests often complained about the noise coming from outside the hotel.  It was built by the neighbors of the modern Azur Resort 5 *.  But today they are already functioning and are not causing any concern.  It happens that inconvenience creates a nearby hotel.  But near "Azur Resort 5 *" all the hotels are of high class.  These are Ocean Sonic Resort 5 *, LaCosta Seaside 5 *, Jinghai Hotel &amp; Resort 5 * and Longyue Seaview 4 *. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Now about the area in which the hotel "Yuhai International Resort Apartment 5 *" is located.  Sanya is divided into three resort areas: Sanyavan, Dadonghai and Yalongwan.  Our hotel is located in the first district.  Sanyavan is the longest zone.  It is located near Phoenix Airport and is closest to the Sanya City shopping and business center.  The hotel is located on the second strip of the beach.  To the sea - a hundred meters.  A highway runs along the coast of Sanyavan, so even front-line hotels are located behind it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yuhai International Resort Apartment reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1796087.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The territory of the hotel complex </h2><p>  Even in those days when the modern "Azur Resort 5 *" was called Yuhai International Resort Apartment SPA 4 * (2007), it had a significant area of ‚Äã‚Äã23 thousand square meters.  This territory is carefully arranged and landscaped.  And now it is a magnificent tropical garden.  The hotel complex consists of a multi-storey residential building, to which the two-level building adjoins the end, where the reception and some rooms are located.  In the center of the park there is a spacious swimming pool in the shape of a lagoon, with a small artificial island in the middle and a grotto on one side.  A beautiful belvedere is built upstairs. </p><p>  Gardeners have worked in such a way that something blooms on the lawns and flowerbeds.  Whatever review you have about a hotel, there will always be a few laudable words about its territory.  The hotel building is built in a modern style.  It has a patio, where the doors of all rooms go.  On the territory there are several ponds in which goldfish swim.  Paths are laid in the garden, fountains beat everywhere, benches are installed.  An on-site spa is located on its own thermal water well. </p><h2>  Where do guests stay? </h2><p>  The room fund "Azur Resort 5 *" consists of apartments.  This is apparent from the former name of the hotel - Yuhai International Resort Apartment SPA 5 *.  Photos left by guests are sure to show a swing bench on the spacious balcony of the room.  Otherwise, the area and equipment of guest rooms vary depending on the category.  Vacationers are offered a choice: single, double and triple standards, superior, deluxe and suites.  Based on this, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe rooms varies from forty to 450 square meters.  All are decorated in bright tropical style.  Staying in them immediately instills a <span>joyful mood.</span>  Reviews report that on the ground floor all rooms are bunk.  Guest rooms are divided not only by category, but also by view from the window.  The guests assure that it is not worth overpaying for Ocean View, as a piece of the sea is visible, and even then from the upper floors.  It is best to choose a view of the pool or garden.  On the other side of the hotel is a busy street.  But, reviews notice, if you did not like the view from the window, declare it at the reception.  When your category number is released, you will be relocated. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="O.

    <h2>  Standard Room Options </h2><p>  Most guests leave feedback about this particular category of rooms.  Moreover, you can choose a single, double or triple room.  This last room can accommodate an extra bed for a fourth guest.  What does a standard room at the Yuhai International Resort Apartment SPA 5 * hotel (China) look like?  The apartment has an electric kettle and coffee maker with a minimum of utensils.  As it should be in five-star hotels, guests are offered bathrobes and rubber slippers.  The shower gel is in the dispenser, but the rest of the cosmetic accessories - soap, toothbrushes, paste, combs, shampoo and toilet paper - bring as you spend.  Interestingly, the room also has an electric mosquito repellent.  The maids also bring records for him.  From household appliances there is an electronic safe, a minibar (which can be used as a refrigerator), a telephone, air conditioning and a TV.  As a huge plus for a hotel room, reviews note the availability of fast and free Wi-Fi.  It becomes unimportant with him that there are no Russian channels among the TV channels.  Guests also praise comfortable wide beds, new furniture and good plumbing. </p><h2>  How to feed at the Yuhai International Resort Apartment SPA 5 * hotel </h2><p>  The price of the hotel includes breakfast.  They are positioned as "continental in a buffet format."  But it is not so.  Since such breakfasts are quite ‚Äúdrawn‚Äù for lunch, and even for a hearty feast.  Moreover, among the dishes of the buffet, the requests of all categories of food are taken into account.  Are you a strict vegan?  For you there is soy milk, fruit smoothies, vegetable dishes.

    <h2>  Where to eat outside the hotel </h2><p>  The hotel has a restaurant and a stylish bar with upholstered furniture and a cozy relaxing atmosphere.  But most tourists preferred eating outside the hotel.  As we have already mentioned, the Azur Resort 5 * Hotel stands on the busy Sanyavan Lu Street, the main highway of the district.  Therefore, you can have lunch and dinner a couple of steps from the hotel.  The Yuhai International Resort Apartment SPA is surrounded on all sides by restaurants, taverns, eateries and fast foods.  Reviews claim that you should not be afraid to eat at budget points.  All dishes in tropical Hainan are prepared from today's morning fish, as well as vegetables just removed from the garden. </p><p>  Near the beach you can also have a snack.  Sanya has long been a favorite resort for Russians.  Therefore, in cafes and restaurants you will not have a language barrier with the waiters.  Many menus are duplicated in Russian.  And in some institutions, the list of dishes is equipped with their photos.  Reviews recommend trying not only Peking duck, but also local, Hainan cuisine.  These are Hele crabs with garlic sauce, quadrangular beans, Linshui noodles.  And for dessert, order "chaobin" - fried ice cream.  Also, tourists recommend a glimpse of the Sanya market, where you can cheaply buy tropical fruits - mango, lychee, papaya, guava and others. </p><p>  The price range at the resort is quite large.  You can eat here for five yuan and 150. It depends on what level of service and comfort you prefer. </p><h2>  Beach and sea </h2><p>  Directly to the coast you need to go about a hundred meters.  But taking into account the bypass of the buildings in front and the intersection of the highway, the path will take about ten minutes.  The nearest city beach is very clean and, importantly, free.  This is a feature of the Sanya resort.  Yuhai International Resort Apartment SPA does not have a dedicated territory on the beach.  Yes, it is not needed, since toilets and showers can be used for free.  The beach in Sanyavan is very spacious, several kilometers long.  It is covered with dense light sand.  In Sanyavan, the beach is ideal for bathing young children, since the entry into the sea is very gentle.  Reviews report that there are few sun loungers and umbrellas.  But along the road there is a row of palm trees, in the shade of which you can hide from the sun.  Many travelers have tried other Sanya beaches.  If you come in winter, head to Dadonghai District.  In its bay, the water is warmer than on neighboring beaches. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hainan Hotel Yuhai International Resort Apartment Spa 5" class="if" height="234" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1796084.jpg" width="312"></div>

    <h2>  Pool </h2><p>  An alternative to lush beach life with ever-scurrying merchants can be a relaxing rest by fresh water.  How many pools are there at Yuhai International Resort Apartment SPA?  Reviews report two.  One, smaller, is equipped specifically for children.  The swimming pools are very clean.  The water in them warms up well.  At the children's pool there is a small slide and a decorative mill.  On the sun terrace around these ponds there are many sun loungers and umbrellas, rescuers are on duty.  The only negative - there is no bar near the pool.  With drinks you have to go from the lobby of the hotel where this institution works.  If a group of Russian or Chinese tourists comes to the hotel, the pool becomes noisy. </p><h2>  SPA-center </h2><p>  It's time to talk about the thermal springs that Hainan is famous for.  Yuhai International Resort Apartment SPA has its own well.  Therefore, the water is not imported and at the exit from the ground has significant temperatures.  To encourage guests to use the paid services of the SPA center, the hotel gives each guest one visit as a gift.  Tourists advise visiting this kingdom of water relaxation in the evening.  Of course, no one will do massages and body wraps for free, but you can switch from one bathroom to another, experiencing new sensations each time. </p><p>  There are hot ponds, there are simply warm, but with lemon, ginger and pink essential oils.  You can dip your feet in the aquarium, in which live fish doing peeling.  Some bathtubs have a hydromassage system.  And after a relaxing whirlpool, you can sit and breathe in the ionized air of the salt mine.  For a special fee, you will experience all the nuances of Chinese traditional medicine on your body, from massage to acupuncture.  Tourists report that once they tried it, they could no longer resist and paid for visiting the SPA center. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sanya Yuhai International Resort Apartment Spa" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1796092.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Service </h2><p>  The Tripadvisor rating for Yuhai International Resort Apartment SPA is 7.7 out of ten.  Therefore, the hotel management values ‚Äã‚Äãits good name and carefully selects staff.  All employees, from the maid and gardener to the top manager and reception staff, are very helpful and friendly.  Requests of customers (if they are expressed politely) are immediately fulfilled.  An iron and an ironing board will be delivered to your room upon request.  If you have any kind of malfunction, a wizard will appear within ten minutes and fix it.  Not enough coat hanger in the closet?  Not enough glasses?  All this will be given to you at the reception.  By the way, she works around the clock.  Its employees will call you a taxi, help with the registration of tickets or excursions.  Reviews report that not all the girls at the counter speak Russian.  But with them it is quite possible to explain in English. </p><h2>  Hotel Infrastructure </h2><p> Yuhai International Resort Apartment SPA reviews are not in vain called a hotel complex.  There is everything to relax fully.  And if it weren‚Äôt for the sea and the beach, one would not have to leave the hotel at all.  In addition to the SPA center and pool, guests also have access to a laundry and currency exchange office, post office, tour desk and car rental, gift shop and free parking.  Those who enjoy sports can play mini-golf or table tennis.  Yuhai International Resort Apartment SPA 5 * hotel accepts orders for weddings and celebrations, as well as for organizing business events.  For this, the hotel has enough conditions: a plenary room and meeting rooms, a business center with the necessary equipment.  The hotel is able to satisfy the whims of the most demanding customers.  Room service is available around the clock. </p><h2>  Conditions for children </h2><p>  Resort Yuhai International Resort Apartment SPA reviews characterize as family.  It is quiet, calm and there are all conditions for children to relax.  Sanyavan with its cleanest sandy beach and a gentle entrance to the sea is simply created by nature for bathing babies.  At the hotel, young guests will find a well-equipped playground with a soft coating.  It is located in a shady place, and you can not be afraid that the baby will burn in the sun, riding a roller coaster or swing.  A children's pool is located next to an adult.  Thus, the child will always be under the supervision of parents.  Kids love the hotel grounds.  After all, in the Garden of Eden you can not only see goldfish in ponds, but also feed ducks and parrots.  The restaurant has high chairs for feeding small children.  But reviews notice that the hotel does not provide special baby food for breakfast. </p><h2>  <span>Excursions in Sanya</span> and around the island </h2><p>  Tourists strongly recommend that you do not spend all days by the sea or in the Yuhai International Resort Apartment SPA 5 * hotel.  Hainan is a fairly large island, and it has something to surprise a traveler.  The only inconvenience is that all historical sights are concentrated in the north, near Haikou.  The capital of the island itself is also interesting, where disgraced nobles settled in exile.  In addition to the ancient houses of the Ming era, you can visit the tomb of Hai Zhuya, Wugong and Nanshan temples.  And in the vicinity of Haikou, there is the Ma-An paleovolcano with a viewing platform on the very edge of the crater.  Sanya is a completely new city, but there you can find entertainment.  This is diving, paragliding, surfing and sea fishing.  Children will be interested in visiting the island of monkeys, where visitors get by cable through the strait.  Tourists are also taken to the Bethel Nath ethnopark (30 kilometers from Sanya).  There, representatives of local meow nationalities and whether demonstrate their life and culture. </p><h2>  Treatment in Sanya </h2><p>  Hainan's thermal waters help to cope with diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, hypertension, osteochondrosis, rheumatism, urological and skin ailments.  If the procedures provided in the SPA-center of the Yuhai International Resort Apartment SPA 5 * hotel seemed inadequate to you, reviews recommend visiting in the Dadonghai district.  There, on the basis of the Pear River Garden Hotel, there is a center of Chinese traditional medicine, Longevity Garden.  The best balneological hospital in Sanya is considered SanYiTang.  Its branch was opened in the Cactus Resort Hotel in the Yalongwan District.  Treatment in these medical centers is carried out exclusively with natural medicines, acupuncture, manual therapy.  Reviews also praise the Nantian, Yu-Kang, and Taiji thermal mineral springs. </p><h2>  Resort Yuhai International Resort Apartment SPA 5 *: reviews </h2><p>  This hotel accepts groups of tourists.  In the autumn, the holiday season is in the PRC, so vacationers from mainland China are added.  If the hotel gathers a lot of Europeans, there may be a shortage of forks.  For some reason, Chinese groups do not go to the sea, but prefer to sit by the pool.  But the large territory of the hotel allows you not to notice the influx of vacationers.  The rooms are quiet because the soundproofing is good.  Tourists recommend taking a mosquito cream if you want to enjoy beautiful evenings on a swing on the balcony.  Sanya is a very expensive resort, where it is quite difficult to find cheap hotels.  It is this hotel that can provide a chic service, and not too "biting" prices.  This is the secret of its popularity and high ranking among tourists.  Not without reason, many recommend it to relatives and friends and promise to come here again if possible. </p>
