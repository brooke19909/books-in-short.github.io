The locals are so friendly and hospitable that from the first days tourists feel a truly comfortable and homely atmosphere.  And about the local colorful and exotic cuisine there are real legends.  However, before the trip it‚Äôs nice to get acquainted with some features of a holiday in Goa, which can ruin your vacation.  First of all, all potential vacationers should understand that not all hotels offered by tour operators correspond to their description.  Moreover, if you take a superficial approach to choosing a hotel, you may encounter disgusting living conditions and complete unsanitary conditions upon arrival at the resort. </p>

Villa Fatima is a 2 * hotel, which is often offered by tour operators.  How suitable is it for relaxation?  What conditions can offer tourists? </p><h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  So, the <span>hotel Villa</span> Fatima 2 *, according to the description of the largest tourist portals, is a small family-type hotel, owned by the Mascarenhas family well known in Goa.  This place makes popular the hospitality of the owners, courtesy and cordiality.  The hotel has only 50 standard rooms.  Proximity to the sea, many tourists call the main advantage of the hotel.  It is quite quiet and calm here, in the evening music from a nearby hotel can be heard, but this is not critical. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The hotel is located in a lively area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe resort: within walking distance are the points of currency exchange, car and motorbike rental, shops, souvenir shops, cafes and restaurants of Asian and European cuisine.  The hotel is ideal for those who want to get acquainted with the culture of India, imbue with its color and exotic, as well as enjoy the stunning scenery. </p><h2>  Population </h2><p>  Check-in at Villa Fatima's hotel room, like at any other resort hotel, takes place after 12 hours.  But you can always leave your luggage at the reception, change clothes and go to the coast - it‚Äôs good to be within reach.  If there is a free and prepared room, the administration can check in newly arrived guests even earlier than the set time. </p>

    <h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Villa Fatima 2 * (Baga) offers modern, cozy rooms with a private bathroom and functional furniture.  For a 2 * hotel in Goa, this is a rarity.  In addition to the stylish interior, all vacationers will find in the room a TV with satellite channels, including Russian, as well as a telephone.  The quality of the reception is not always good, but it does not interfere with the rest in Goa.  Unfortunately, not all rooms have air conditioning, which is why if it is necessary for you, check this point before booking.  Some tourists note that even the presence of air conditioning in the room does not guarantee its serviceability.  Agree, to hear not the most pleasant sounds, extraneous noises during the rest certainly no one wants.  That is why when checking into a room, first of all, evaluate the condition of the equipment, its serviceability, in the presence of the slightest defects, be sure to indicate them.  The rooms are small, but they have everything that a modern tourist needs: a bed, a wardrobe, a mini fridge, a bathroom and a balcony.  Here you will not find a room with a view of the coast, at best, the windows will face the courtyard. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Now for communications: all vacationers note problems with hot water.  Or rather, it simply is not there, you have to wash it cool.  If you, as a tourist, do not bother, you are used to taking a cool shower in the summer, you can safely book an apartment. </p><p>  In each room, upon arrival, tourists will find only two bath towels, which, in principle, corresponds to its category.  By no means always towels have a neat appearance; some tourists find old stubborn stains.  Therefore, when going on the road, do not forget to put your towel in this way, you will immediately protect yourself from unpleasant emotions. </p><p>  All vacationers should understand the specifics of Goa, the exotic resort and hotels.  That is why you should not be scared if in the room of Villa Fatima you will find lovely representatives of the local fauna: lizards, monitor lizards and others. </p><h2>  Room service </h2><p>  Tourists note that all vacationers have good room service at Villa Fatima.  Reviews are mostly positive.  The rooms are cleaned daily: all surfaces are tidied up, dust is wiped, plumbing is cleaned, the floor is washed, towels are changed.  But bedding is changed every 2-3 days.  All tourists will find round-the-clock room service, however, at an additional cost.  Each room has a price list for administration services.  You can order breakfast in the room, ask the hotel staff to tidy up your things. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  The hotel area is small, but well-groomed: a lot of tropical trees, flowers.  Most are reserved for the pool, relaxation area.  In the evenings, vacationers gather on a cozy veranda, share their impressions of the rest. </p><p>  There is no currency exchange office or store on site, but all the necessary amenities are within walking distance.  For all questions, vacationers can contact the administration - hotel staff will definitely tell you where to dine, where to buy souvenirs, where to order an excursion. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  All guests of Villa Fatima 2 * (North <span>Goa, Baga)</span> with accommodation in the room will also get breakfast, organized in the hotel restaurant.  If you are used to luxurious Turkish dishes, breakfast will definitely not make any impression on you.  Most often, you can see salad, scrambled eggs, toasts with jam, fresh tropical fruits and drinks - modestly, but quite tasty.  By local standards, breakfast is not bad, in some hotels tourists will only have a toast with coffee.  All those who prefer a more hearty breakfast can eat in local restaurants and cafes or have a snack on the beach. </p><p>  More recently, a nice restaurant with Italian cuisine has opened opposite Villa Fatima.  The service and food are simply amazing - the guests of the establishment feel themselves especially important and honored guests. </p><h2>  Entertainment on site </h2><p>  Most tourists who come to Goa spend most of their time on the coast, enjoy the beauty of local landscapes or travel around the resort as part of an excursion program.  If you don‚Äôt want to go to the beach or feel unwell, Villa Fatima offers you a worthy alternative to the sea - an outdoor pool with sun loungers and parasols.  There is always a free place, since most tourists still prefer the sea.  Tourists note that the pool is quite small, its area is barely enough to cool, but for a 2 * hotel this is not bad. </p>

    <p>  Villa Fatima 2 * <span>(India, North</span> Goa) is not the best option if you have planned a trip with children.  The hotel is not particularly suitable for children, there are no playgrounds on its territory, and the pool is quite deep. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  Even 2 * hotels in Goa can offer a good service contrary to popular belief.  And Villa Fatima 2 * is a clear proof of this.  The reception desk is open around the clock, so vacationers can always contact the hotel staff on a matter of interest to them. </p><p>  For an additional fee, all visitors to Villa Fatima 2 * (India) can book an airport shuttle.  At the information desk you can always get acquainted with the resort‚Äôs rich excursion program and purchase the most interesting routes for yourself.  On the territory of Villa Fatima 2 * there is wireless high-speed Internet, connection to which is free for all its guests.  The signal level is weak, but in order to chat with friends and relatives on social networks, check mail and get acquainted with world news, there is enough speed.  In the end, we come to rest in order to enjoy the sun, the sea, to get acquainted with new and amazing places, and not to sit in a hotel. </p>

    <h2>  Additional services </h2><p>  The hotel has a safe only at the reception: here you can leave documents, money and other valuables for storage.  By the way, we strongly recommend that you do not take documents with you for a walk, it is better to limit yourself to a copy, and it is better to take money in small quantities.  Goa, of course, is an attractive destination for tourists, but do not forget that India is a ‚Äúthird world‚Äù country, so the level of theft here is quite high.  You should not take jewelry with you on vacation. </p><h2>  Sea and beach </h2><p>  Only 100 meters from Villa Fatima Hotel is one of the most popular beaches of the resort - Baga.  This beach is ideal for tourists, and all because there are practically no local residents.  This advantage will certainly be appreciated by those tourists, especially tourists who had the opportunity to relax on other beaches, where the attention to girls of Slavic appearance is quite high. </p>

    <p>  The beach is clean, the sand is fine, not the same as in the Maldives, but quite pleasant.  The sea is mostly calm, but sometimes huge waves appear that frighten vacationers.  But among vacationers there are those who look forward to waves, for example, surfers.  The beach line is quite wide, which allows you to frame it with a series of cafes.  Beach establishments offer free sunbeds and umbrellas, and vacationers have the opportunity to spend their day on the beach with a glass of a refreshing drink. </p><p>  Some vacationers noticed the presence of glass fragments, dirt and debris on the beach, but this can only be seen during a period of mass crowding.  Here you can rent equipment for water activities, finally stand on a jet ski or a board.  The beach is actually a favorite place for romantics: couples in love see the sunsets and meet the sunrises.  The places here are really beautiful and picturesque.  Yes, the sand is not so clean and white, sometimes there is dirt and garbage, but much can be forgiven for the stunning nature and the tender sea. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  If you go on vacation with a positive attitude, looking forward to the sun, sea, endless sandy beaches and real exoticism, Villa Fatima 2 * in Goa is a good place for you.  Do not forget that this is a 2 * hotel, so you can forgive some of its shortcomings.  Many tourists come back here again, but is this not the first proof that it is really possible to have a good rest here. </p><p>  That is why we strongly recommend that you pay attention to this option if you are planning a budget holiday in Goa. </p>
