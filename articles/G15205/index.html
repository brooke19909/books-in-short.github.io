    <h2>  The coastline of the cave river </h2><p>  At the top of the river, the dam has turned into a lake.  Here is the place for avid fishermen who come to the village of Peshcherka (Kemerovo region).  A waterfall is not a hindrance to fish.  Paid fishing is organized on the lake; boats are hired here.  In this area there is a wonderful recreation center.  The shore is picturesque, somewhat reminiscent of a birch world.  Between the trees on the right bank, like mushrooms, you can see houses for tourists, tents and gazebos for recreation.  Some guests met hedgehogs in this area. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The territory is ennobled, bags for collecting garbage are issued.  A special car takes him out.  There are toilets.  All conditions are created with an emphasis on comfort so that tourists can enjoy the virgin nature.  There is silence and peace.  From the view of the local landscapes, a person is filled with vitality and positive energy.  Many vacationers come to see <span>the cave waterfall, a</span> photo of which can be seen in the article. </p><p>  The size of herbaceous plants helps to feel like Alice in Wonderland - they are taller than human growth.  On the left bank of the lake, as it should be in the taiga, there are many bushes.  Due to the tangled between the branches of trees, forests here are sometimes impassable.  Huge open glades and meadows are dotted with overgrown plants, such as: hogweed, ivan tea, anemone, <span>cyanosis blue</span> and others. </p><h2>  Enchanting landscape </h2><p>  If you go downstream, you can immediately see a specially constructed staircase.  It was created so that during the tour you can enjoy the cascade of water itself.  The waterfall in the Kemerovo region has a height of 10 meters, the width depending on the season can vary from 5 to 10 m. </p><p>  In the summer, when the angry water is raging, the noise is laying ears - such a strong and powerful stream.  A person experiences multifaceted emotions: delight, peace, harmony with oneself.  If you stand under the stream (which is not forbidden), a feeling of coolness and bliss will fill the traveler‚Äôs mind.  Here you can completely swim and notice how warm the waterfall is compared to others.  Often visitors to a camp site take water baths right at the foot of a flowing cascade.  Memory photography is a great way to capture the moment of Mother Nature‚Äôs oneness with man. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="waterfall cave photo" border="0" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1147203.jpg" width="558"></div>
