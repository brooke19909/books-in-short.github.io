To be honest, this modern device attracts many buyers.  But what exactly?  After all, it is extremely difficult to please the current buyer, especially the gamer.  Only here, from numerous reviews, it is clear that this particular tablet did its job.  Why it happens?  Why is this model so good?  What characteristics does the audience have and what attracts the audience so much?  We have to find out about all this now.

    <h2>  Display </h2><p>  With what parameter do modern gamers begin to evaluate game consoles and various devices?  Of course, from the display.  It plays an important role.  And not only for games, but also for work.  In truth, finding a decent tablet with a good screen is pretty hard.  Especially if you initially want to buy this equipment for entertainment only. </p><p>  The NVIDIA Shield Tablet has a good and large screen.  It is equal to 8 inches diagonally.  In principle, this is quite a normal size in order to comfortably watch movies, as well as play modern games.  There are gaming tablets and with a smaller diagonal.  But they are not very popular.  After all, the larger the screen, the more convenient and comfortable it is to play.  So, 8 inches is just enough for this venture. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Resolution is another important indicator when choosing a device for entertainment.  The thing is that NVIDIA Shield is of high quality.  And this means that the resolution will also be quite large.  At the moment, it is 1920 by 1200 points.  Enough to watch movies and use different applications, including gaming. </p><p>  True, there are many more diverse benefits of NVIDIA Shield.  In addition to the screen, gamers (and ordinary customers) pay attention to many other indicators.  Let‚Äôs try to figure them out.  What besides the display pleases the public in this product? </p><h2>  System </h2><p>  For example, the operating system is a very important point in tablets.  She is responsible for the ability to run various programs and games.  In addition, the system is also a guarantee of the high-quality operation of the device. </p><p>  The NVIDIA Shield tablet is equipped with the brainchild of Google Corporation.  The operating system on this device is Google Android 4.4.2.  And the shell here is quite good.  She is called Kitkat.  In general, this operating system has long been called gaming.  Thus, the NVIDIA Shield Tablet is truly a device for relaxation and gaming.  After all, the tablet is equipped with a good large display, as well as a powerful operating system. </p>

    <p>  True, from time to time it requires updates.  Fortunately, there will be no problems with this matter - when any additions appear, the system will notify you about this, and then offer to update automatically.  After some time, you will see that the process has completed.  And now it will be possible without any problems to use all the new features. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Also an important indicator of system performance is the processor.  It plays an important role in any device.  The better the processor, the more powerful the computer is.  Or a game console.  The NVIDIA Shield tablet has a 4-core processor with a clock frequency of 2.2 GHz.  To be honest, now it will be extremely difficult to find any analogue in the modern technology market.  Sometimes not all computers have such a powerful processor.  So if you decide to buy an NVIDIA Shield, you can be sure that you will get a truly gaming tablet that will delight you for a very long time. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  All games require space and some device resources.  And so many try to choose such tablets that will differ in terms of memory.  True, there must be balance everywhere.  Otherwise, you can run into a low-quality model that cannot give you bright moments of joy. </p><p>  NVIDIA Shield Portable is equipped with very good RAM.  It is 2 GB.  To be honest, this amount is enough for 20 applications and games to work simultaneously in combination with a running Internet browser.  And with all this, you will not have any malfunctions, malfunctions or braking when performing certain tasks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nvidia shield portable" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/951771.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Also an important indicator, as already mentioned, is the free space on the device.  The NVIDIA Shield Tablet has 32 GB of free space.  Of these, approximately 1.5-2 gigabytes is occupied by the operating system.  There remains about 30. But this place, as a rule, is enough for a modern gamer with interest.  However, if you are afraid of a lack of free space, you can always purchase <span>a MicroSD memory card</span> up to 128 GB.  This place is definitely enough for you for a long time.  And with all this, you do not have to constantly get rid of old information or outdated games. </p><h2>  Connectors </h2><p>  Another important indicator that buyers often pay attention to is a variety of connectors for connecting.  And this applies to both external devices and internal ones.  NVIDIA Shield 32GB LTE has many different sockets. </p><p>  For example, this tablet has a slot for connecting a memory card.  As already mentioned, this is MicroSD.  There is also a USB jack on the panel.  It is needed in order to synchronize the device with the computer.  Perhaps, so far there are no advantages over other tablets in this regard.  But do not rush to grieve.  The thing is that there are special Mini-HDMI sockets, as well as Mini-Sim.  These are more interesting points.  True, with the choice of a SIM card with a tariff for the Internet, some problems may arise.  Especially if you have a number on a regular SIM card, and not on a mini-version.  Nevertheless, mobile operators in the salons will help to cope with this feature - they will easily exchange your card with saving the number for a small copy. </p><p>  If it‚Äôs important for you to listen to music, then NVIDIA Shield Tablet 32GB gives you this opportunity.  After all, this tablet has a standard headphone jack of 3.5 millimeters.  In principle, if you want to watch a movie on a small screen, but with sound, as if from a movie theater, then you can easily and simply connect the most ordinary speakers to this jack.  And they will work qualitatively.  No worse than on a computer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nvidia shield tablet" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/951772.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  To be honest, modern tablets can completely replace most modern technology.  For example, a camera or a camera.  And so many before choosing a tablet very carefully choose their tablets according to the characteristics of the camera.  It is believed that the higher they are, the better. </p><p>  In this sense, NVIDIA Shield LTE is quite good.  The thing is that this tablet has two cameras.  Front 5 MP and normal - also 5 MP.  For modern equipment of this type, these are very good indicators. </p><p>  In addition, you will have a great opportunity to watch movies and videos in Full-HD format.  In truth, this is exactly what many consumers are chasing, as well as avid gamers.  What could be better than watching videos in excellent quality?  Probably only a game with the same result.  So, having bought an NVIDIA Shield Tablet, you will not regret it.  Autofocus, by the way, is also on the camera.  It helps to create high-quality and clear pictures.  Just what many modern buyers are looking for. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  Another important selection criterion is nothing more than the connection provided for the tablet.  Without it, you will not be able to transfer data, as well as download games and access the world wide web.  This item has a special place in all gadgets. </p><p>  Fortunately, NVIDIA Shield Tablet LTE has quite good communication performance.  This model supports GPRS, GPS, as well as Wi-Fi.  But that is not all.  There is also a 3G connection and Bluetooth.  Do not forget that modern models are equipped with a special ability to connect to the 4G network.  It will provide you with high-quality Internet without any interruptions.  In addition, in this case, you can use Android TV on NVIDIA Shield - a special application that shows you TV programs based on Android with the help of good Internet.  It helps a lot when trying to relax and distract. </p><p>  In addition, in many tablets when working with the network, various crashes and malfunctions are often observed.  But in NVIDIA Shield Tablet they practically do not arise.  Only in case of infection of the operating system by a variety of spies and viruses.  Fortunately, such cases are extremely rare.  Therefore, you can be sure that no one and nothing will stop you from using NVIDIA Shield Android TV, as well as other applications that use the Internet for their operation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nvidia shield android tv" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/951773.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Dimensions and Design </h2><p>  An important point when <span>choosing a tablet</span> (for some customers) is the design of the product.  And here it can also be attributed its size.  Of course, since this is a real gaming tablet, it‚Äôs worth considering immediately that it will be far from small.  Rather moderately large. </p><p>  The NVIDIA Shield tablet has a stylish design.  As a rule, there are two generally accepted color schemes that are bought most often.  It is black and white.  It is in these colors that you can find our today's tablet on store shelves.  Only here, far from everyone likes such a banal color scheme.  I always want to somehow stand out, distinguish myself.  And then a variety of removable panels for the device come to the rescue.  They are not included in the kit, but you can easily find equipment in any hardware store.  Here there are options with a print, and with different drawings, and with photos.  If you wish, you can create your own tablet design yourself.  Get creative and see what happens. </p><p>  With the dimensions of the device, it is becoming more serious.  It is quite large for its performance.  The length of the NVIDIA Shield is 221 millimeters, the width is 126, but the thickness of this equipment is not as huge as it might seem at first glance - only 9.2 millimeters.  To be honest, now this is the average thickness of a modern smartphone.  True, our tablet is also heavy.  Its weight is 390 grams.  In order to work normally behind such a "machine", it is best to use a special stand.  She will hold the device, and also will not cause trouble with the game and at the same time fixing the tablet in the same place. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  What is included in our kit for today's gaming equipment?  To begin with, the equipment on the tablet is very good.  She cannot but rejoice.  Especially those who prefer to play.  As a rule, the package includes standard instructions, a charger, and a USB cable for connecting to a computer and third-party equipment.  But there is another small feature. </p><p>  Since we have a gaming tablet, then a stylus and, of course, a <span>warranty card are</span> attached to it to facilitate control <span>.</span>  Many believe that the configuration is nothing special.  Only this is not so.  Indeed, in the box with the device you will find a special protective case, as well as a game joystick.  It is suitable for a tablet, and for a computer, and for some consoles.  So now you can be sure that you have a real gaming tablet.  So far, not a single similar model is known that offers a game joystick as standard. </p><p>  It connects extremely easily.  And in terms of quality, as many players note, it pleases.  Especially if you decide to connect it to a computer and play something.  In particular, in an arcade game. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nvidia shield tablet" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/951774.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Price tag </h2><p>  After the main characteristics, it is important to pay attention to the price tag of the device.  Nobody wants to overpay for low-quality goods, which can be found cheaper.  True, sometimes people do this because of a big name.  The NVIDIA Shield price is not very pleasing.  As many buyers note, it would be possible to slightly reduce it. </p><p>  On average, you can purchase our current tablet model for about $ 400.  If you take into account the configuration, as well as the quality that will be provided to you, then the price tag can still be understood.  But if there weren‚Äôt so many extra gizmos, then the NVIDIA Shield Tablet would not be worth the money. </p><p>  Sometimes on sales you can find this tablet for about $ 200.  But at this price, as a rule, the goods are offered outside of Russia.  For the delivery and transportation of your purchase you will have to pay several times more.  Therefore, it is better to put up with the original cost of the gadget.  In principle, according to many buyers, we can only say that they did not regret the money spent. </p><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  What do consumers think about our tablet today?  Reviews about him, in truth, have become extremely common.  And in general they are positive.  Only it‚Äôs worth introducing a little specificity.  What is it about? </p><p>  For example, many players claim that the NVIDIA Shield Tablet is a great gaming tablet not only because of the bundle and power.  The list of main features usually put good image quality, indestructibility, as well as long battery life without recharging.  With active use, such a "machine" is able to serve you for 3 days without connecting to a network.  Not every smartphone is capable of this now.  In standby mode, NVIDIA can last about 2 months without recharging. </p><p>  Another plus to the address of our tablet is its "life" qualities.  As already noted, many claim that it is extremely difficult to ‚Äúkill‚Äù this technique.  If water gets in, just wipe the device - it is equipped with reliable protection against overheating and humidity.  And everything will work without interruptions and with excellent quality.  Also, the device survives falls well.  Of course, it is better to place the tablet in a special protective case - it will protect the case from cracks and scratches.  But to break the sensor, as many players say, is almost impossible.  Of course, if you drop the NVIDIA tablet from a height of 10 floors with the screen down onto bare asphalt, the device will break.  But if you drop it (dropped from your hands) on the floor, you can be sure that nothing bad or dangerous will happen. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nvidia shield 32gb lte" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/951775.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Should I pay attention to this <span>gaming tablet?</span>  Frankly, yes.  But no one has the right to force you to buy something.  Take a good look at the model - maybe you can find a cheaper analogue.  But if you are a true gamer, then NVIDIA Shield Portable is designed specifically for you. </p>
