    <p>  First of all, we suggest paying attention to what to ask about Singapore: "What country is this city in?"  - at least not very correct.  Why?  The thing is that this is a state located within the borders of one settlement and located 136 km north of the equator on the islands in Southeast Asia. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The country owns 28 small islands located nearby with the main.  The total area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSingapore is about 650 square meters.  km </p><p>  The capital is the city of the same name Singapore.  Large river systems are Singapore and Shangei.  Almost 5 million people live in the modern metropolis. </p><p>  This fabulous destination attracts tourists from all over the world with its colorful nature, climate and hospitality of local residents.  Travelers who have visited this place not only know for sure which country Singapore belongs to, but also strive to return here again and again. </p><h2>  Section 2. Getting there </h2>

    <p>  Going on vacation to Singapore (which country it was, they found out almost immediately), travelers begin to feverishly think about how to get there, spending less time, effort and, of course, money on the road. </p><p>  <em>From Russia</em> </p><p>  Direct flights to Singapore are made from Moscow by Singapore Airlines and from Vladivostok by Vladivostok Asia.  Also, regular connecting flights are operated from the capital, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities. </p><p>  Can't imagine how and where you will need to change trains?  On the map imagine Singapore.  Which country is nearby?  That's right, of the large ones - only China, here it will be the place of transplantation on the way to rest. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <em>From indonesia</em> </p><p>  The most convenient option is to fly by plane.  From Sukarno-Hatta, the capital of Indonesia, to Singapore, many planes of various airlines fly (Valuair, Garuda Indonesia, Batavia Air, Indonesia AirAsia, Singapore Airlines, etc.). </p><p>  You can also get from other cities: Bandung, Semarang, Denpasar, Pontianak, Medan and Surabaya, etc. </p><p>  Also, the famous low-cost airline Indonesia AirAsia flies from Bandung, Yogyarta and Denpasar. </p><p>  Another way is by ferry.  Although ferries do not depart from the main ports of Indonesia, there is a ferry service to the south of Singapore from the islands of the Riau Archipelago.  In addition to ferries, motor ships regularly depart from other ports throughout the day.  The journey takes approximately 45 minutes. </p><p>  <em>From malaysia</em> </p><p>  From Malaysia to Singapore can be reached by plane, bus, car, ferry or train.  Airplanes take off from Kuala Lampur Airport and land at Singapore Changi Airport.  The flight lasts about an hour.  You can also fly from the cities of Kota Kinabalu, Miri, Kuching and Langkawi. </p><p>  There is a bus service between Malaysia and Singapore.  The cost of the trip is acceptable.  Thanks to the new bulk road through dams, it became possible to get to Singapore by private car.  A toll is required to pay a toll.  And for cars with Malaysian license plates, a special pass is required.  However, going this way to Singapore, the capital of which country is not enough to know, you will have to familiarize yourself with a huge number of cards, so as not to get lost in an unfamiliar state, where only a few speak English, and there is nothing to say about Russian. </p><p>  Passenger ferries and small ships sail from the ports of Malaysia.  However, ships are not comfortable, and ferry tickets are quite expensive.  Trains run daily from the city of Kuala Lumpur.  Interesting fact: ticket prices in Singapore are more expensive than in Malaysia. </p><h2>  Section 3. Visa and Customs </h2>

    <p>  To travel to Singapore for residents of Russia and the CIS countries, a visa is required.  Entry without a visa is permitted only in case of transit and the availability of airline tickets to another country.  At the same time, the stay should not exceed 96 hours. </p><p>  It is worth paying attention to the fact that, taking into account which country Singapore is located in and calculating all the ways of moving, we can conclude that if a transit trip is carried out by ferry (across the water borders of neighboring countries), then the visa-free regime does not apply .  This item requires special respect.  Why?  The thing is that most of our compatriots have problems with him. </p><p>  So, the destination for your next vacation is Singapore.  "What country?  What is the currency?  What can I import? ‚Äù  - These questions are usually of interest to most travelers. </p><p>  Note that there are no restrictions on the transport of currency.  Persons over 18 years of age are allowed to transport duty-free no more than one liter of alcohol, up to 20 cigarettes in an open pack, sweets in the amount of up to 50 SGD, goods in the amount of 300 SGD (when traveling in transit - up to 150 SGD) and personal belongings.  It is worth remembering that chewing gum and tobacco should be presented to customs officers.  Importation of cigarettes is subject to a duty (approximately 7 SGD per pack), a receipt must be kept until departure. </p><p>  It is not allowed to import prohibited items and goods: drugs, weapons, meat, animals, etc. For the export of weapons, animals and jewelry, a permit is required.  A permit is also required for the export of medicines, equipment, photo, video film and expensive jewelry in quantities exceeding personal needs.  A fine or imprisonment may be imposed for the importation of chewing gum.  And for drug trafficking - the death penalty. </p><p>  Airport tax is usually included in the price of the flight.  If not, then a fee of between 8-12 USD will be charged.  Passengers in the <span>transit zone</span> and children under 2 years old are exempted from the fee.  One person is allowed to carry one piece of hand luggage. </p><h2>  Section 4. Brief History of the Country </h2>

    <p>  According to legend, Singapore was founded by the Raja Sang Nila Utama, who landed on the island in the 13th century and named it Singapore, which in Sanskrit means the City of Leo.  It was this animal that he met first on the island.  Although historically proven that these lands were settled back in the 11th century and were called Temasek ("Sea City").  But all this remained in oblivion, and the official history of Singapore began from the moment the British colony was founded on the island in 1819.  The island was at the crossroads of important economic shipping lanes between Europe, Australia and Asia.  Singapore soon became the most famous trading port in Asia. </p><p>  During the Second World War, the Singapore fortress was considered the strongest military base in Britain, but there was no fleet in the fortifications.  And in February 1942, unable to repulse the attack, Singapore surrendered.  The power of Britain over the island was lost.  Having received self-government in 1955, Singapore in 1963 entered the Malaysian Federation, but soon decided to leave it.  In August 1965, the island became an independent state. </p><p>  Now one of the richest countries in Asia is Singapore.  Which country adopts laws so that local incomes only increase in volume?  Perhaps only this state from all the surrounding. </p><h2>  Section 5. Climate of Singapore </h2>

    <p>  Due to the proximity of the island to the equator, the climate has no seasonality.  It is almost always sunny and humid.  Precipitation in the form of torrential rains falls daily, especially with the advent of the northeast monsoon from November to January.  Thunderstorms can often be observed. </p><p>  From May to October a haze appears over the island caused by forest fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra, which, however, quickly disappears. </p><p>  Those who prefer Asia as a holiday destination will not be disappointed if they prefer a state such as Singapore.  Which country can provide a photo shoot in such a way that most of the shots are successful?  Well, of course, this one.  Here, for this, all conditions are created: light, landscapes, and weather conditions. </p><p>  The average temperature during the day in December-January is + 26 ¬∞ C, at night - + 24 ¬∞ C.  The rest of the year it rises to + 31 ¬∞ C during the day and up to + 26 ¬∞ C at night.  Features of this weather require tourists from countries with more severe climates to special acclimatization.  Staying outdoors for a long time can quickly tire you out.  All residential and public buildings in Singapore are air-conditioned. </p><h2>  Section 6. Main Areas </h2>

    <p>  When going on vacation to Singapore, which country, population, attractions and culture, the tourist wants to know first. </p><p>  It is worth paying attention to the fact that the main district of Singapore forms the administrative center where the business districts of the city are concentrated and its old colonial part is located. </p><p>  The attraction of this area is the Impress Place Building complex, built in the Victorian style, which houses a museum, galleries and a restaurant. </p><p>  The district also has important state institutions, a Concert Hall, a theater, cathedrals, hotels, the Padang complex, etc. The oldest Armenian church of St. Gregor-Saint and the Christian cemetery Fort Canning Hill are also located here. </p><p>  Tourists will be interested in other sights of this part of the city: a statue of Sir Stamford Ruffles, Benjamin Shiers Bridge, Merlion Park, Singapore Museum of Art, etc. </p><p>  The secular place of Singapore is considered Orched Road with restaurants, luxury hotels, nightclubs and shopping centers.  In the western part of this area there is an old Botanical Garden, created in 1859. It was here that a corner of nature was preserved, which once occupied the whole island.  The garden is famous for its Mandai National Orchid Park, where you can see more than 60 thousand species of these flowers. </p><p>  The largest area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city is Chinatown.  The Chinese live here.  Their houses are distinguished by signs with hieroglyphs, plane trees grow on the square.  On the streets there are many cafes and shops with exotic goods and souvenirs.  In some places where fortune tellers and fortune-tellers live, mirrors hang at the intersections to protect against evil spirits.  In Chinatown, there are two old <span>temples: a Muslim</span> and a Hindu.  And very close to the side streets is the "death street."  Here in the past, the Chinese brought their old men to die. </p><p>  The Muslim center of Singapore is located on Kampong Glam (Arab Street).  The region is known for the production of sarongs and trade in carpets and silk.  Here is the main mosque of the city - Masjid Sultan, Istan-Kampong Glam Palace and the old Serai Market.  A little north of the colonial center is the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãLittle India.  In this part of the city there are many markets, restaurants and shops.  The air is saturated with the aroma of spices.  Tourists can visit the temple of Sri Srinivasa-Peremal or Viramakaliamman, a statue of Buddha. </p><p>  Singapore's largest oil center is the Jurong area.  There is a constant buzz of factory pipes and a port.  Despite this, there are sights in Jurong: Fish Museum, Discovery Center, Reptile Park and Bird Park.  You can enjoy the beauty of nature on the island of Sentosa.  From the tower "Merlion" offers a panorama of Singapore.  You can also go to shows of musical fountains, exhibitions, the Museum of History or the Butterfly Park.  The island has the largest underwater world in Asia, the underwater world. </p><h2>  Section 7. Shopping </h2><p>  No wonder this state is considered the largest shopping center in Asia with many modern shopping centers offering a huge selection of goods. </p><p>  Still amazing Singapore!  What country can still offer so much inexpensive electronics, high-quality Chinese silk and Malay batik?  And Chinese healing herbs and orchids in gold are generally famous all over the world. </p><h2>  Section 8. How to spend time </h2>

    <p>  Want to attend a holiday heading to Singapore?  What country in Asia can please so many celebrations of national scale?  Perhaps no. </p><p>  All holidays here are marked by colorful processions, concerts and fireworks.  A revered holiday is the Chinese New Year, when residents give each other citrus trees.  These days there is a Chingai parade with dances and boat races, drums are heard on the streets.  In May, Chinese churches celebrate the birthday of the Third Prince - the "divine child."  Mediums in a trance state cause cuts to the body, sacrificing their blood in exchange for the prosperity of their people. </p><p>  In August, the Chinese "month of hungry spirits."  These days, according to legend, the gates of Hell open, and the souls of the dead come to the living.  In the houses they light incense sticks and burn money, and on the threshold and on the windowsills they put bowls of food. </p><p>  But the main holiday of Singapore is considered to be Hari Raya Poissa, celebrated according to the Muslim calendar at the end of the <span>month of Ramadan.</span>  On this day, the fast ends, during which it was forbidden to take food and water during daylight hours. </p><h2>  Section 10.

    <p>  The country has harsh laws, for violation of which there is a fine or prison.  Despite this, things should not be left unattended. </p><p>  Tourists should remember that it is prohibited in the country to: </p><ul><li>  smoking in public places (fine up to 700 USD); </li><li>  litter on the street (a fine of up to 500 SGD, in case of repeated violation - imprisonment); </li><li>  use chewing gum; </li><li>  to swear and behave obscenely (a fine of up to 3,000 SGD); </li><li>  to import drugs (punishable by death). </li></ul><p>  If you violate the rules of the road, fines also apply.  Medical service in the country is expensive, so it is better to take out international insurance.  Although the ambulance is free for everyone. </p>
