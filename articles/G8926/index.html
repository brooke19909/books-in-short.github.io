Interest in its increase has a beneficial effect on the desire to achieve better results.  And the employer successfully uses this stimulating leverage, setting the employee a higher payment for certain achievements.  He can do this in many ways, such as a higher salary, incentive allowances, piecework pay, and so on.  In ne </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tariff rate for piecework direct pay" class="if" height="249" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15272/213934.jpg" width="350"></div>  In the first version, the salary refers to the monthly tariff rate.  Although it can be either hourly or daily, it depends on the complexity of the work and the qualification level.

    <p>  Calculating the monthly is not difficult: we multiply the hourly rate by the average monthly number of hours of work <span>(the norm of working time</span> for a year is divided by twelve months).  Moreover, the level of payment cannot be lower than the minimum wage established by federal law.  In addition, for the calculation of salaries, they usually use the <span>tariff grid</span> in which the tariff rates for wages are distributed in categories in ascending order by multiplying by a certain coefficient, which depends on the industry of the enterprise.  <span>Remuneration is</span> divided into time-based (depends on the time worked) and piecework (on the number of products or operations produced).  In turn, piecework consists of direct, chord and indirect. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  With a direct employee, a task (order) is issued to carry out a specific amount of production.  His salary is calculated as follows: the tariff rate of this category of work is multiplied with the norm of time and the number of manufactured products.  And if this norm is exceeded, and without marriage, then a premium is also charged from above (this payment is called piece-premium).  In addition, an employee can work on a piece-wise progressive system, when higher rates are applied to what is done above the norm. </p><p>  In a chord system, salaries are calculated as a percentage of revenue.  This means - you need to have time to complete the task (to realize a given volume of production) in a certain period of time, from this you will receive a contractual percentage - your salary.  Indirect use for accrual </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tariff pay rates in a large team" class="if" height="233" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15272/213960.jpg" width="350"></div>  salaries for workers who are not directly involved in the production process, but are servicing (controlling) equipped workplaces.  For this, the tariff rate for their category is multiplied by the norm, then by the fact of generation plus a premium.  This means that if the equipment works without interruptions, then the output increases, and the employee is supposed to have a stable salary with bonuses for processing.

Suppose a team completed an object and received a certain amount for it, which was divided into equal parts by all.  What is this <span>payment method</span> good <span>for?</span>  Yes, at least by the fact that there is no disagreement about the <span>size of the salary,</span> fewer delays, higher quality of work, and newcomers with the help of the whole brigade quickly delve into the matter.  Therefore, it is not necessary to monitor each employee to take into account what he has done.  And it is better to spend this time on control over work processes.  Again, a relief for the accountant - when calculating salaries, he does not need a tariff rate. <strong> </strong>  It is only necessary to multiply the collective collective rate by the actual output, to which the bonus is added, if any.  Then the total amount is divided into all employees.  Simply and easily!  By the way, most European countries have long preferred this system, using it quite successfully. </p>

And the salary is calculated according to the formula: the wage rate for the corresponding category is multiplied by the hours worked - this is a simple time-based payment system.  When a premium is also accrued for excellent quality, then this is already a time-bonus.  Although employers are not limited to this list of payment systems, providing individual forms of payment for some employees.  With highly qualified specialists, it makes sense to conclude a contract for contractual compensation if the company is interested in retaining a good employee.
