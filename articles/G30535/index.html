    <p>  Most of the subway routes in Japan are laid above the ground.  His system is complex and confusing.  The largest networks with an abundance of branches are located in Tokyo and Osaka.  The principles of their functioning are similar.  In the morning and evening hours, Japan's underground transport is overloaded.  Despite the crush in cars, the metro is recognized as the most affordable and reliable way to travel in a metropolis. </p><p>  The relatively high cost of the ticket is justified by the absence of traffic jams.  It is worth considering the ramified system of stations.  Metro is the best way to get from one end of the city to the other.  Instead of the usual interchange nodes, the country has implemented special hubs that simultaneously use various types of transport in Japan.  At such stations, leaving the subway car, you can transfer to the train or bus. </p><p>  Travel documents must be purchased at terminals and ticket offices that operate in the lobby.  The average cost of a trip by subway is 120 rubles.  All information plates are duplicated in English.  Entrance to the subway is blocked by ordinary turnstiles.  To leave the lobby at the desired station, you will need to present a ticket. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Municipal communication </h2>

    <p>  Land transport in Japan is represented by regular buses.  In small cities of the country they replace the metro.  True, their routes are no less complicated.  This is due to the fact that several operators are responsible for the transportation of passengers at once.  The confusion arises from the fact that traveling on the same route can cost differently. </p><p>  The bus logo is marked with the logo of the service company.  Each vehicle is colored in the color of the line on which its route is located.  The number and exact name of the end stations are indicated on the plate mounted on the windshield.  Buses do not travel long distances in Tokyo.  The length of their journey is limited to metro stations.  The cost of a ticket in land transport in Japan is approximately 100 rubles. </p><p>  In the settlements of the country where there is no subway, the movement of buses is regulated by zones.  This division determines the cost of the trip.  Up-to-date information about the movement of vehicles and the location map can be found on the information stands of the stops.  During peak hours in Tokyo, buses travel very slowly.  They are used to overcome short distances. </p><p>  The movement starts at 07:00, and ends at 22:00.  The names of the stops are in Japanese and translated into English.  According to the rules, passengers enter the passenger compartment through the front door.  In its opening is a turnstile.  If there is no ticket, then the pass can be purchased from the driver.  However, no additional trade and service fees are provided.  Ticket price is the same as in the terminal. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  With the wind! </h2><p>  A taxi driver stands out from other vehicles in Japan.  He wears a formal business suit.  Be sure to wear a ironed shirt.  He holds flawlessly white gloves.  The look complements the tie.  The driver‚Äôs shoes are always in perfect condition.  Foreign tourists, who first used the services of a taxi, are surprised by the abundance of lace with which car interiors are decorated. </p><p>  Headrests, armrests, and even seats are covered with openwork capes.  Independently open the car door will not work.  This is a driver privilege.  Therefore, you need to wait a bit until the lock is unlocked. </p><p>  Japan's public transport regulations are very different from European regulations.  The green icon on the windshield of the car means that the taxi is busy.  Red indicates that the driver is free.  Special areas for boarding a taxi are equipped in the largest <span>areas of Tokyo</span> and other megacities.  In the province, cars are caught right on the roadway. </p><p>  Despite the comfort, taxis are still inferior in popularity to the Japanese subway.  Cars often get stuck in traffic jams.  Sometimes the number of passengers waiting exceeds the number of available vehicles.  In these cases, queues accumulate in parking lots. </p><h2>  There is an alternative! </h2><p>  Monorail is another popular form of transport in the country.  Japan's single-rail railroads enveloped most of the settlements.  They are in Okinawa.  In the capital, this type of transport is represented by fully automated trains that are controlled by intelligent systems.  They do not have drivers or stewards.  This type of transport is considered one of the safest. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Despite being similar to the subway, in Japan the monorail is a completely independent transport complex.  Tickets are sold at robotic terminals and ticket offices focused on landing platforms.  Tourists at the entrance to the car tend to take first place.  Futuristic views open from the panoramic windows of the cabin.  The most popular excursion route runs through Tokyo Bay and leads to Odaiba Island, a land plot created by human hands. </p><h2>  Classics of the genre </h2>

    <p>  Trams in Japan are considered exotic.  They can be counted on the fingers.  One branch operates in Tokyo.  Others serve the suburbs of the country's megacities.  They are designed for curious tourists.  They have low speed, but trams do not stand in traffic jams.  In Japan, trolleybuses have also been preserved. </p><p>  Unlike Russian models, Japanese ply underground.  They follow to the top of the Tate mountain peak.  They are used to serve tourist groups.  These are modern and comfortable cars that are worthy of environmentally friendly transport.  Japanese trolleybuses move in a tunnel resembling a subway. </p><h2>  Railways </h2>

    <p>  The trains that service the suburbs of megacities account for the main passenger flow.  Long-distance trains are also popular.  They are preferred by airplanes.  The railway system in Japan is surprising in its simplicity and straightforwardness.  The following types of trains are distinguished: </p><ul><li>  Shinkansen </li><li>  express trains; </li><li>  electric trains. </li></ul><p>  The Shinkansens can be compared to the Russian Sapsans.  This is a convenient and quick way to get from Tokyo to Kyoto and other cities of the country.  The train network covers the entire territory of Japan.  The maximum speed of trains reaches 300 kilometers per hour.  They do not slow down on intermediate platforms. </p><p>  Mizuho and Nadzomi trains run from one point to another with virtually no stops.  Similar compositions "Sakura" and "Hikari" serve the stop stations, so the cost of a trip to them is much cheaper.  Plus there is a <span>single travel card.</span>  The express fares are even lower and the number of stops is greater.  Long distance trains are used by the Japanese and visitors. </p><p>  Electric trains follow more slowly.  They consist of several comfortable wagons.  The difference between the housekeeper and the first class is insignificant.  It is expressed in the distance between the rows of seats and in an expanded set of options. </p><h2>  Buying tickets </h2>

    <p>  Aircraft in the country operate local and international flights.  The largest airports in Japan are in Tokyo and Osaka.  Seventeen years ago, the state controlled the cost of air transportation.  In 2000, private air carriers received the right to set tariffs.  In most cases, all fees are included in the ticket price.  Local flights are operated by JAS, ANA and JAL. </p><p>  The main contingent of local flights is businessmen, travel time for which is a priority.  The cost of traveling by plane in Japan is only ten percent more expensive than the price of train tickets.  The government is actively involved in the development of transport infrastructure.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãexisting airports is increasing, new terminals are being commissioned.  The checkpoints of the country's leading air hubs are being modernized.  Reconstruction of the complex in Narita is planned. </p><h2>  Maritime traffic </h2>

    <p>  Traveling by water is an option for leisurely tourists.  The shipping system serves all the islands of the state.  From Kobe (Japan) you can get to almost anywhere in the country.  The most common type of marine vessels are ferries.  They ply not only between remote land areas, but also depart from Tokyo to Osaka and other coastal settlements. </p><p>  According to statistics, in Japan there are about 6,900 islands.  Kyushu and Hokkaido are considered the main sea gates.  The latter is a port city.  Where ferries cannot pass, bridges, tunnels and crossings have been built. </p><p>  Passenger and <span>cargo ships</span> serve not only local destinations, but also international ones.  They go to Russian cities, provide sea links with South Korea, Taiwan and China.  There are four classes of ferries: </p><ul><li>  special; </li><li>  first; </li><li>  the second with a bed; </li><li>  the second without a berth. </li></ul><p>  In the first case, the passenger pays for the trip in a cabin with one or two beds.  Sailing in the first class, he has the right to count on a common room, which has several beds, but no more than four.  Second-class travelers are accommodated in dormitories with fourteen beds.  When choosing the cheapest sea transport ticket in Japan, a tatami cabin is provided.  Room category selection service is available only to those buyers who travel long distances. </p><p>  Tickets for passenger ships are purchased at carriers' offices, at berths and at travel agencies.  From Osaka to Beppu can be reached for 3,500 rubles.  A ferry ticket from Tokyo to Tokushima will cost 4,000 rubles.  The cost of the trip depends on the distance and the selected category.  A trip from Kobe (Japan) to Kitaksu costs only 2,500 rubles.  Travel time is twelve hours. </p><p>  Hanku Ferry, Ferry Sunflower, Tokyo Ferry are recognized as the largest ferry operators in the country.
