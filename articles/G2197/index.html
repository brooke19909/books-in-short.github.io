  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Veliky Novgorod: attractions, photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Veliky Novgorod is one of the largest tourist centers in the north-west of Russia.  It can rightfully be called a museum city, since many historical objects have been preserved on its territory.  There is also an archaeological site.  The sights of Veliky Novgorod deserve the closest attention from tourists.  To visit the city and not see its beauties is an unforgivable oversight. </p><h2>  The ancient city of Russia </h2><p>  Veliky Novgorod is one of the oldest cities in Russia.  Its rich history cannot but interest.  No wonder he was called the "father of Russian cities."  And to this day, on its territory there are interesting historical monuments that can tell a lot about past times.  At one time, the first books were written here.  Local fairs gathered at local fairs, glorifying the greatness of the city.  Veliky Novgorod was famous as a rich city with strong and strong walls and ancient temples.  Its wealth and grandeur can be judged now by those attractions that have survived to this day.  Since 1992, all historical monuments of the city and its environs are recognized as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. </p><h2>  Kremlin </h2><p>  Among the attractions of Veliky Novgorod, the Novgorod Kremlin stands out.  In olden times, it was called the detinets.  He was laid by Prince Yaroslav the Wise.  By the way, the Novgorod Kremlin is the oldest surviving in Russia.  The first mention of it dates back to 1044.  Of course, in the entire history of the tower and the walls of the Kremlin have repeatedly burned.  And in the fifteenth century, the fortress was completely rebuilt from stone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In ancient times, the Kremlin was considered the public, administrative and religious center of the city.  It was here that they gathered at the veche.  Troops left the walls of the fortress to battle Alexander Nevsky with the Swedes.  The Kremlin collected the first books and copied them, as well as chronicles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="archtour.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kremlin of Veliky Novgorod" class="if uuid-2280314" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2280314.jpg"></div><p>  Detinets was erected in the fifteenth century.  It occupied an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 12 hectares.  Brick walls with 12 towers reliably protected the city from enemies.  Only nine towers have survived to this day. </p><p>  Unique ancient buildings have their own characteristics.  For example, towers and walls were built without a foundation.  They were erected on earthen ramparts, which are nothing more than an air cushion, inside of which there was earth, and outside - pure clay.  An interesting fact is that during the spring flood, the pillow - the earthen rampart - swells, which makes the walls slightly rise by a couple of centimeters. </p><p>  This construction option was chosen for a reason.  On local marshy soils, this is the only design option that is possible.  Ancient architects were not mistaken in the calculations.  If the walls were fixed rigidly, then they would begin to crack at the very first flood.  Thanks to correct calculations, powerful fortifications stood for many centuries and have survived to this day.  And now they are the main attraction of Veliky Novgorod. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Features of an ancient building </h2><p>  During construction, a serious drainage system was laid under the entire Kremlin, consisting of hollowed wooden logs that led water outside the walls.  It is difficult to imagine, but the drainage system has been successfully operating to this day, despite the fact that more than 500 years have passed.  In Soviet times, excavations were made on the territory of the Kremlin, as a result of which a part of the drainage system was disrupted.  The result of the intervention in the unique construction of the building was the collapse in 1991 of a part of the wall between the Spasskaya and Princely towers.  True, in the future the wall was partially restored, but now it is purely decorative. </p><div class="photo" data-original="freemanzone.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fortifications" class="if uuid-2280326" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2280326.jpg"></div><p>  The Kremlin was erected in a squad at the expense of the great ruler (head of the clergy) and the prince.  Since Vladyka contributed 1/3 of the funds, he occupied 1/3 of the Kremlin.  The rest was princely.  In the old days, the entire territory was very densely built up.  On each part, cathedrals and churches were erected.  To date, most of the sights of Veliky Novgorod are buildings that have been preserved precisely on the ruler‚Äôs part.  Here is the belfry, St. Sophia Cathedral, the Faceted Chamber.  An interesting fact is that it was not possible to test the power of the Kremlin walls to its full potential.  The city could not stand long sieges in the entire history of its existence. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Sophia Cathedral </h2><p>  Among the sights of Veliky Novgorod (photo is given in the article) it is worth looking at St. Sophia Cathedral, built in the eleventh century.  And to be precise, the temple was built during the reign of Vladimir Yaroslavovich.  It is worth noting that the cathedral is one of the first stone temples of that time.  The older is only the Tithe Church in Kiev, the Cathedral of St. Sophia of Kiev and the Transfiguration Church in Chernigov.  Experts believe that the building was built by Byzantine craftsmen.  In the original design, the temple was to be decorated with open galleries for walks.  However, the architects did not know how cold it was in the region.  Realizing the climate, they decided to make the cathedral closed. </p><p>  Sofia Novgorod has six chapters.  On the central gilded chapter on the cross there is a pigeon figurine. </p><p>  An ancient legend is associated with it.  It says that the Holy Spirit flew over the city during the ‚Äúbloody feast‚Äù of Tsar Ivan the Terrible.  Seeing the atrocities taking place here, the spirit crouched on the cross and petrified with horror.  Since then, for many centuries, it has been believed that Veliky Novgorod is guarded by a dove.  While he is sitting in his place, nothing threatens the city.  And if the bird disappears, Novgorod itself will die. </p><p>  Surprisingly, this prophecy really turned out to be true.  During the Great Patriotic War, a bomb fell into the temple building, as a result of which the cross fell, and with it the dove.  After that, the city was almost completely destroyed.  A massive cross with a pigeon figure was taken to faraway Spain.  For a long time he was kept in the storerooms of the Madrid Museum.  He was returned to his homeland only in 2004.  It is currently kept inside the cathedral.  And that cross that rises above the temple is a copy made before the return of the original.  Such is the interesting story of one of the main attractions of Veliky Novgorod (photo is given in the article). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.novgorod.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sophia Cathedral" class="if uuid-2280332" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2280332.jpg"></div><p>  The main shrine of the temple is an old icon "Sign".  Tradition says that she saved the city in 1170 from the troops of Prince Andrei Bogolyubsky.  An arrow hit the icon, after which tears appeared on the image.  The enemy was overcome with such fear that the troops fled in panic.  Historians do not know for sure whether this story is true, but there is indeed a trace on the arrow icon. </p><h2>  Faceted Chamber </h2><p>  What to see in Veliky Novgorod?  The sights of the city are so interesting that it is difficult to single out those that are worth seeing in the first place.  On the territory of the Kremlin is the famous Faceted Chamber, which was one of the most significant buildings of the sovereign's court.  It was built in 1433.  The building is a three-story building, equipped with 30 entrances.  The first floor of the chambers is closed, there are basements.  The interiors of the third floor, where you can get through the stairs built in the nineteenth century, are quite well preserved.  The Faceted Chamber preserved the original frescoes of 1441.  Of particular interest is the front hall, made in the Gothic style.  The name "faceted" is associated with the design of the arches with Gothic faces.  For excursions, the chamber was opened in 2012 after a long six-year restoration. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tourprom.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Faceted Chamber" class="if uuid-2280336" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2280336.jpg"></div><h2>  Monument "Millennium of Russia" </h2><p>  Of the sights of the city of Veliky Novgorod, the unusual monument ‚ÄúMillennium of Russia‚Äù, which is located opposite St. Sophia Cathedral, is of interest.  The majestic monument was erected in 1862 by order of Alexander II.  After the revolution, the monument was closed with boards. </p><p>  And during the war, the fascist troops dismantled the monument, planning to bring it to Germany.  But this was not destined to happen, since the city was liberated.  The monument was in very poor condition, but it was restored as soon as possible and solemnly returned to its original place. </p><h2>  Kokuy Tower </h2><p>  What to see in Veliky Novgorod?  The sights of the city are not so far from each other.  Inspecting the Kremlin, pay attention to the Kokuy tower.  This is a real battle tower, surviving from ancient times.  An observation deck is equipped on the top floor of the building. </p><div class="photo" data-original="strana.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kokuy Tower" class="if uuid-2280340" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2280340.jpg"></div><p>  The highest tower of the Kremlin offers stunning views.  Inside the building itself, you can see the exposition, telling about how Ivan the Terrible betrayed the execution of Novgorod.  In general, the tower is very interesting. </p><h2>  What to see in Veliky Novgorod in winter: attractions </h2><p>  The ancient city is beautiful at any time of the year.  The sights of Veliky Novgorod in winter look even more magnificent.  The ancient Kremlin in snow decoration is especially beautiful.  If you want to enjoy the beauty of the historical part of the city, then you should go up to the observation deck of the Kokuy tower, from which you can admire the snow-covered ancient buildings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yandex.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kremlin in the winter" class="if uuid-2280346" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2280346.jpg"></div><p>  Absolutely all the sights of Veliky Novgorod in winter (some photos are presented in the review) are available for tourists.  The only thing worth remembering is that the average air temperature in the city ranges from -10-15 degrees.  Therefore, for walking you need to dress well.  And sometimes the temperature drops to -30 degrees.  You won‚Äôt walk for a long time in such weather.  But the cathedrals and the Kremlin at that time look incredibly majestic, somehow very ‚Äúin Russian‚Äù.  Winter in the city is very long, everything freezes back in November.  If you plan to visit Veliky Novgorod at this time, then you should know that in the region there is a ski base "Mstinskie Gory", where you can have fun. </p><h2>  Attractions in one day </h2><p>  If it so happened that you were in the ancient city for a day, then you will invariably have a desire to see the sights of Veliky Novgorod.  What to see in 1 day?  In principle, you can have time to see the most basic historical sites that will allow you to have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city.  We recommend a walk along Sunday Boulevard towards the Kremlin.  Quickly enough you will see the Kremlin park, going into which you will find yourself at the old fortifications.  It is worth noting that the main attractions of Veliky Novgorod (photos with names are given in the article) are concentrated in approximately one area.  On the territory of the Kremlin you can visit the St. Sophia Cathedral, the monument "Millennium of Russia", walk along the bridge over the famous Volkhov River and get to the Yaroslav yard. </p><p>  Not far from the park of the 30th anniversary of the October Revolution is the St. Anthony Monastery and the Cathedral of the Nativity of the Virgin. </p><h2>  St. Yuriev Monastery </h2><p>  If you decide to see the sights of Veliky Novgorod by car, then you will have the opportunity to see more interesting places.  For example, you can go to St. Yuriev Monastery.  There is also a museum of wooden architecture "Vitoslavlitsy" nearby.  Walking to these places will not work, so it‚Äôs more logical to use a car or bus.  The journey takes no more than twenty minutes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lifejourney.club" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yuriev Monastery" class="if uuid-2280303" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2280303.jpg"></div><p>  St. Yuriev Monastery is considered one of the oldest in Russia.  It was founded in 1030 by Yaroslav the Wise.  Initially, the monastery was wooden.  But in 1119, by order of Mstislav the Great, a stone temple was laid.  Specialists attribute the monastery to the real treasures of medieval Russian architecture, and its church reflects the highest representations of ancestors about harmony and beauty.  St. George's Cathedral was at the same time not only a church, but also a princely church.  For the stay of the princely couple, special chambers were equipped here.  The temple originally had an ancient fresco painting, which, unfortunately, practically did not survive.  The monastery for many centuries was very revered in the Novgorod diocese.  He was even called the St. George Lavra.  Subsequently, many princes and members of their families were buried in the monastery. </p><h2>  Museum of Wooden Architecture </h2><p>  Another attraction of Veliky Novgorod (a photo with a description is given in the article) is the Vitoslavlitsa Museum of Folk Art.  It is located near the St. George Monastery.  The name of the museum is associated with the village that was once here.  And in 1964, the building of the Church of the Assumption was moved here from the village of Kuritsko.  This was the beginning of the birth of an interesting museum.  In the ancient chronicles of Vitoslavlitsy there are references from 1187.  Historians believe that the period of the emergence of the village can be attributed to the eleventh century.  At the beginning of the nineteenth century on the site of the current museum was the estate of <span>Anna Orlova-Chesmenskaya, the</span> only heiress of Count Alexei Orlov.  Her house, designed by the famous architect Carl Rossi, as well as several alleys, an outbuilding, a pond and several very old trees, have survived to this day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="spasibovsem.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum of Wooden Architecture" class="if uuid-2280350" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2280350.jpg"></div><p>  Currently, there are 34 monuments in the open-air museum.  All of them were transported from different areas of the Novgorod region.  The historical buildings gathered in one territory vividly demonstrate the architectural features of different regions.  Guests can not only examine all the buildings from the outside, but also look inside them.  The huts inside are furnished with interior items that were found during ethnographic expeditions.  Each dwelling has its own theme and demonstrates certain events in people's lives. </p><p>  In our article, we did not mention all the sights of the ancient city.  In fact, there are many more, so tourists have a large list of objects worth visiting. </p>
