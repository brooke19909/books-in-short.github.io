    <p>  In the late XVII - early XVIII centuries, the aristocracy of Copenhagen was one of the richest in Europe, and Danish trading companies had their colonies around the world.  Many <span>historical monuments</span> in the city were erected during this period. </p><p>  <strong>Monuments to famous Danes</strong> </p><p>  On the outskirts of Town Hall Square, a monument was erected to Danish storyteller Hans Christian Andersen.  It is curious that the sculpture has smooth shiny knees, as children often sit on them to take pictures.  Nearby is the neo-Renaissance town hall of the early 20th century with a gilded statue to Bishop Absalon, who founded Copenhagen.  <span>The capital of Denmark</span> is also famous for its tower more than 100 meters high with the famous World Clock.  The largest square in Copenhagen - the New King's Square (Cohens Nytorv) - is famous for the equestrian statue of King Christian V, who ruled Denmark and Norway in the 17th century.  It was established during the life of the king. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Four palaces</strong> </p>

The Royal Palace Amalienborg is a Baroque palace ensemble of the mid-18th century, where the monarch's residence is still located.  And in the Royal Park there is the Rosenborg Palace with three impressive Renaissance towers - the summer residence of Christian IV.  Today in the building is a museum of the royal dynasty.

    <p>  <strong>In parks and gardens</strong> </p><p>  Located between the moat of the citadel and the port, the Langelinie promenade is the most popular place for walking in the wonderful city of Copenhagen.  The capital is rich in green parks, which are located next to the promenade.  In the botanical garden you can visit the delightful palm room, the greenhouse and the museum of minerals and stones.  Nearby are the observatory.  And yet, nothing beats the popularity of Tivoli's amusement park, located in another part of the city. </p><p>  <strong>17th century mansion</strong> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="copenhagen capital of denmark" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12967/220762.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The Nyuboder estate with narrow rows of yellow houses was built in the middle of the 17th century by Christian IV for 600 families of sailors who served in the navy.  This is one of the oldest residential areas - concise and strikingly simple.  The buildings in this area have become one of the attractions that Copenhagen is famous for.  The capital receives annually a huge number of tourists who want to see the historical places of this beautiful city. </p><p>  <strong>The legendary goddess Gefion</strong> </p><p>  At the entrance to Churchill Park, the Gefion Fountain (1908) is installed, reminiscent of the emergence of the largest island of Denmark - Zealand.  According to this legend, the <span>goddess of fertility</span> Gefion was to find land for her father, the god Odin.  <span>The Swedish king</span> Gyulfi promised to give her as much land as she could plow in one day and one night.  The goddess turned her four sons into bulls and dug up most of the land, turning it into an island.  The resulting cavity was filled with water - this is how Lake Venus arose. </p><p>  Among the places of Copenhagen that are worth seeing are Borsen (a 17th-century exchange building), the <span>Grundtvig Church, the</span> new Carlsberg glyptothek, the museum of the sculptor Bertel Torvaldsen, the writer Karen Blixen and the Guinness Book of World Records Museum. </p><p>  This is not a complete list of attractions of the magnificent European city of Copenhagen.  What country's capital can still boast of such a variegated variety of historical places and cultural monuments? </p>
