With their own hands, every housewife can make them.  You can pick them up to the tone of upholstered furniture or walls, or you can create contrasting, bright, which will be accent points in the room.  It all depends on the preferences and character of the hostess at home. </p><p>  Do-it-yourself <span>pillows</span> can be sewn in a classic style, diluted with small interesting details, such as horizontally sewn stripes of satin fabric or lace, or you can make original fasteners in the center of the front of the pillowcase. </p><p>  If you are a rebel in your soul, and creative ideas simply do not allow you to sleep peacefully at night, then you can create completely unique works of art, completely transforming both the shape and fabric filling of the pillow. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider several different options for making decorative pillows with our own hands, how to sew a classic version of a pillowcase for a pillow on a pattern, and how to create your own unique shape.  The proposed options can be used in the living room, and in the nursery, and in the bedroom. </p><h2>  Choose material </h2><p>  When choosing a material, you need to carefully consider everything.  If you sew decorative pillows on the sofa with your own hands, then the fabric should be selected in the color scheme of upholstered furniture.  Even contrasting colors should harmoniously fit into the interior of the room.  Material is better to take dense and natural.  You can use leather and dermatin, burlap, linen or gabardine, brocade or velor, velvet or denim. </p><p>  In the nursery, it is better to choose hypoallergenic fabrics, without fur parts that collect a lot of dust.  Flax, satin or cotton will suit your child.  Pillows for children should be interesting for the child, portray some kind of hero of a fairy tale or have the shape of, for example, a cat, combining the qualities of a pillow and a soft toy.  It should be pleasant to the touch and pleasing to the eye. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can add gentle and calm products to the bedroom.  These can be decorative pillows with your own hands with frills and ruffles, made of artificial or natural fur, plush or velor, fleece or flock.  You can decorate pillowcases in different ways using compositions from satin flowers or appliqu√©s.  Shabby chic pillows and patchwork pillowcases look beautiful. </p><h2>  Classic pattern </h2><p>  You can sew decorative pillows with a smell yourself by drawing a simple pattern, as in the diagram below.  First you need to decide what size the product will be.  Then, on a rectangular piece of fabric, measure the length of the front and back of the pillowcase, adding the length of the pocket or smell.  Usually, from 15 to 20 cm is left on the smelling part. When cutting the fabric, note that you need to leave a margin for hem and for seams on each side.  On the short sides of the rectangle add 2 cm, and on the long - 1 cm. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Pillow Case Pattern" class="if uuid-2334540" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2334540.jpg"></div><p>  This difference is due to the fact that a greater distance is required for double folding of the fabric.  And the inner seams do not require this.  If you have at least an overlock foot on the typewriter, you can pre-overlap all the edges. </p><p>  If the smell is done in the middle or with a shift to the other side, then, accordingly, you need to increase the length of the smell, and reduce the length of the front part.  If the pillowcase is not removable, but completely wired, then you just need to add 2 cm to the seams to the back, and you don‚Äôt need to paint the smell. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For a curly pillow, you can draw an animal pattern or a heart shape first on paper, and then transfer it to the fabric according to the pattern. </p><h2>  Tassel Pillow </h2><p>  One of the classic options for decorating decorative pillows with your own hands (photo below in the article) is lining the edges of the product brushes.  You can arrange large individual items on the corners of the pillowcase.  But you can sew a tape with brushes around the perimeter. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.instructables.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tassel pillow" class="if uuid-2334612" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2334612.jpg"></div><p>  First, the main fabric of the pillow is selected and a ribbon with brushes is already selected for the selected color.  A pillowcase is sewn that cannot be removed.  One edge can be made with a zipper so that it can sometimes be stretched.  The pattern consists of two identical squares.  After cutting one piece, a tape with brushes is attached along the edges.  Then, on the back side, two parts are ground together on three sides. </p><p>  Then the craft turns out on the front side and is filled with an internal filler.  It can be a ready-made pillow made of cotton fabric with a synthetic winterizer inside, or it can be a simple synthetic winterizer without a cover.  Then the pillow in the last segment must be sewn with an internal seam so that the threads are not visible. </p><p>  If you decide to sew a pillow with a "snake", then it is sewn into the last remaining incision of the fabric on one side and the other. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Shabby chic </h2><p>  About decorative pillows with your own hands with a photo in the style of shabby chic, read on.  This style was born in the UK recently.  Having missed the baroque style, the British decided to buy up old shabby furniture and decorate their homes, breathing life into old furnishings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="shabby chic style" class="if uuid-2329150" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2329150.jpg"></div><p>  As woven details, this style is characterized by delicate pastel colors with a floral pattern, decorated with lace, ribbons, flowers, angels, etc. </p><p>  First you need to choose the appropriate style of material.  Tones are selected restrained, with a plant image.  You can decorate pillowcases on sofa cushions in any way.  In our case, two triangles of white calico with a lace ribbon at the end are sewn to one of the squares of the fabric.  The triangle of fabric itself hangs freely and is not attached.  Decorative elements are fastened on buttons that are matched in the same color scheme. </p><h2>  Pillows with bows </h2><p>  DIY pillows on the sofa with your own hands (photo below) can be decorated with wide bows that hug the crafts from all sides.  Sewing consists of two separate tasks.  Initially, simple monophonic pillows are hidden from two identical squares.  Material - dense linen.  A sewn pillowcase is filled with synthetic winterizer and sewn on all sides without fasteners.  Then a decorative element consisting of two identical wide strips is sewn.  The fabric is taken the same, only in a contrasting color. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pillows with bow" class="if uuid-2329144" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2329144.jpg"></div><p>  On the table lay both strips located crosswise.  Then in the center is a pillow.  The horizontal strip is sewn in the middle, the fabric is gathered.  A small rectangle of the same fabric is sewn separately.  The vertical ribbon is wrapped with this tie and sewn from the back, making a couple of stitches in the lower strip. </p><h2>  Pillow for baby </h2><p>  Do-it-yourself children's decorative pillows are made with additional interesting details.  As the main material, cotton is chosen.  The pillowcase is sewn from two cut out the same size squares.  They are sewn together on three sides.  Then a synthetic winterizer or artificial wool in the form of a filler is inserted into the interior.  Do not rush to sew the last side. </p><p>  The character will be placed here.  The cat is sewn in such a way that it seems that he hid behind a pillow and is looking at you stealthily. </p><p>  It is best to make the head and legs of the character from sheets of felt.  To do this, first draw a sketch of the legs.  They can simply be sewn to the fabric and sew into the side seam.  To do this, in addition to the legs themselves, on the pattern, draw a rectangle that will be sewn into the fabric of the pillow itself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="baby throw pillow" class="if uuid-2329160" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2329160.jpg"></div><p>  But for the cat‚Äôs head you need to cut out material from two identical parts.  Drawing a square with sharp ears is easy.  It is also necessary to fill the inside of the craft with a synthetic winterizer so that the head of the beast is voluminous.  Eyes can be made into appliqu√©s or sewn on purchased toys in hardware stores.  The head is inserted into the slot on the pillow and sewn inward. </p><p>  So you can do not only a cat, but also a dog, a giraffe and even an elephant.  Let the child offer a variant of the little animal, suddenly he has some preferences. </p><h2>  Felt pillow with applique </h2><p>  Felt is a wonderful material for making crafts.  It can be sewn and appliqu√©ed, it is soft and warm, and the edges of the fabric do not split, so additional processing is not required.  You can sew decorative <span>pillows with felt from felt</span> for the New Year.  Such a snowman, as in the photo below, will contribute to the festive mood and joyful expectation of the celebration. </p><p>  Each detail of the pillowcase is drawn on paper and transferred onto sheets of felt in small pieces.  Then, a part is cut out along the contours and sewn onto the front of the craft.  The back side of the pillow can be plain gray, or you can decorate it with white circles that perform the function of snow. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.buyerselect.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="applique pillow" class="if uuid-2329089" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2329089.jpg"></div><h2>  Original pillows </h2><p>  Do-it-yourself pillowcases on decorative pillows (photo samples are presented in our article) can be of different colors.  In the room of a young girl, you can sew pillows in the shape of hearts or arrows of Amur on a sofa, as in our example.  But these, of course, are not all options.  Here you can fantasize endlessly.  Make a cat or a dog, a penguin or a dog bone, sneakers or a smiley face. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="heart shaped pillows" class="if uuid-2334521" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2334521.jpg"></div><p>  How to make decorative pillows with your own hands, we will describe further in the article.  First you need to figure out what exactly you want to see on your sofa or bed.  If you decide to create a heart-shaped pillow, then this is easy to do.  It is enough to draw a heart of the desired size on the Whatman paper, add a couple of centimeters along the perimeter to the hem of the fabric and cut out two identical parts.  They are sewn together on the back of the material, but not to the end.  Leave a small, non-sewn area to insert filler.  The synthetic winterizer is mainly used.  Then it remains to sew up the edge with an internal seam. </p><p>  If the pillow has smooth edges and an end part, as in the photo above, then two identical parts of the heart and a narrow strip of matter from contrasting fabric are cut out.  Then one part is sewn along the perimeter to the strip, followed by the second.  Excess fabric is cut off and at the end a straight seam is made on the strip, securing the two ends of the fabric. </p><h2>  Patchwork throw pillow </h2><p>  Recently, it has become very fashionable to produce wraps, pillows, blankets, bags and even clothes in the style of patchwork.  A pattern is made of several types of fabric.  Such <span>decorative pillowcases</span> for pillows with their own hands, as in the photo below, are sewn according to the pattern of a circle, the sectors of which are made of scraps of triangular-shaped fabric.  On each sector, 1 cm of material is left from two sides to the seams. </p><div class="photo" data-original="creatingpaperdreams.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="patchwork style" class="if uuid-2329098" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2329098.jpg"></div><p>  It is advisable to take a cotton cloth.  It is more convenient to work with cotton, since the fabric does not stretch, but keeps its shape well.  Work on the top side of the pillow is very time-consuming, as you will have to complete many lines.  It is important not to rush and clearly combine pieces of fabric with each other so that the shape of the circle does not deform.  When the work is completed, then the circle of the lower side of the pillowcase is cut out in the first half.  It can be made monophonic, calm colors. </p><p>  By stitching both halves together, you can insert a canton into the seam.  In the center of the upper part, all the seams at one point will converge, so that this place looks aesthetically pleasing, you can sew a button in the center covered with fabric. </p><h2>  Option for the lazy </h2><p>  It‚Äôs easiest to tailor and sew a pillowcase for a decorative pillow on a sofa using an old men's cotton shirt.  Thus, you can update the pillowcase on a shabby pillow that has served the homeowners for a couple of years.  She is shoved into a buttoned shirt.  Its front should be centered on the pillow.  All unnecessary details are cut off - sleeves, sides, bottom, top with a collar. </p><p>  Then the pillow is removed, and the shirt is turned on the back side, and all the edges around the perimeter are sewn together.  Then the craft turns out on the front side and fastens with buttons.  If there is a chest pocket on the shirt, then you can insert the filler in the form of a heart or a triangular handkerchief.  You can add a pillowcase with any details at the request of the master.  You can beat both the bar and the buttons. </p><p>  Shirts are interesting to use multi-colored: plain, checkered or striped, in a flower or with a different pattern.  At the edges, you can insert a canton or sew a strip of bright plain fabric.  Any application can be made of felt, for example, as in the photo above, add black glasses to the fabric. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ducklingsinarow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="men's pillowcases" class="if uuid-2334495" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2334495.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In the article, we examined in detail the options for sewing decorative pillows with our own hands with patterns and photos.  As you can see, sewing on your own or tidying up old worn and scuffed interior items is easy.  The main thing is to show a desire to change something in your life.  Not so much tailoring will take time and money, so that they could not be allocated from the family budget. </p><p>  Self-production of decorative pillows is a creative and exciting activity.  You do not need to be a super seamstress to beautifully design sofa cushions.  Even if you don‚Äôt have a sewing machine at home, you can do all the work manually by hiding the seams inside. </p><p>  You can decorate pillows in many ways by adding satin ribbons, flowers, beautiful large buttons, fantasizing with a choice of fabric, with combinations of colors and shades.  In general, think over a creative idea and put it into practice!  Good luck </p>
