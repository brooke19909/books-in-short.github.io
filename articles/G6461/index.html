It should be noted that this topic is very extensive and to understand the mechanism of action should be understood in a significant number of its various components.  Not to do here without significant theoretical background.  So let's get started.  The most important for us in the article are receptors.  When the intensity of their irritation exceeds a certain threshold of force, then excitement occurs.  It begins to spread along the sensitive processes and is transmitted <span>to the central nervous</span> system <span>(central nervous</span> system).  After that, the response is formed - a reflex reaction.  The excitation that acts in a certain zone is addressed to the centers of the sensory nerves not by the whole organism, but only by a small part of it.  As a rule, certain effector centers receive information.

After they become an irritant, a special response is triggered.  It can be motor, secretory, food, defensive and so on.  Consider this example: as soon as we hear that we are called to eat, an indifferent stimulus is activated and the salivary reflex begins to act.  Something similar happens when we play sports.  So, the body understands that the number of loads does not decrease, and begins to closely monitor the heart rate, blood pressure, metabolic rate, and so on.  We can feel some of these transformations on ourselves.  So, it‚Äôs worth a quick run a few hundred meters, as the heart will literally jump out of the chest.  These are all conditioned reflexes.

    <h2>  Additional examples </h2><p>  Let‚Äôs start by going over the reflexes.  They can be not only physical, but also mental.  So, when a person leaves the room, he always turns off the light - reflex.  He does not think, but automatically does all the necessary actions.  Something similar can be given on the example of a phone number.  So, unfamiliar, but necessary seven digits to dial the first time few will be able to.  But if an important subscriber is assigned to the number (for example, a family member), then this will happen even without the attention of the person.  That is, the numbers will be typed reflexively.  In such cases, we can say that certain information was fixed in long-term memory and is extracted from there as an additional subprocess of brain activity. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How do they arise? </h2>

    <ol><li>  Repeated combinations of an indifferent stimulus with a previously developed reaction. </li><li>  Awake state of the body. </li><li>  A certain time period, which makes it possible to "recharge" to an indifferent agent. </li><li>  The absence of other types of active activity of the nervous system. </li><li>  A sufficient degree of excitability. </li><li>  Above-threshold intensity of a conditioned stimulus. </li></ol><p>  In fact, ‚Äúhooking‚Äù the human body is quite difficult.  This is due to the fact that a significant number of bacteria live on the surface of our skin.  And if we were overly sensitive, then we would not know peace.  It should also be noted that in the same situation, subsequent reflexes are produced much faster.  But still the speed varies. </p><h2>  Principle of operation </h2><p>  Let's look at the mechanism of formation of the conditioned reflex according to Pavlov.  This surname is known to many.  But what is this man famous for?  He linked the formation of conditioned reflexes and the activity of the cerebral cortex.  Moreover, it is not the whole ball that is responsible for this, but its individual parts.  So, it was established by him that the arcs of unconditioned and conditioned reflexes are engaged in this.  Between them, with repeated combinations, a temporary connection occurs.  Why so?  It was found that if there were no reinforcements, then it would disappear.  Moreover, each arc has its own peculiarity.  So, for this, a conditional signal or unconditional reinforcement can be used.  It should be noted that the emerging relationship works on the principle of dominant relations.  Over time, this translates into the occurrence of a conditioned reflex response.  Therefore, it is wrong to say "arcs of the conditioned reflex."  Cortical mechanisms of education provide for the participation of two components. </p><h2>  Exemplary </h2>

Probably, many have heard such an expression - "dogs (a) Pavlova."  This is a true reference in the world of examples of reflexes.  A scientist once studied the digestive system.  And he noticed that when a light comes on that signals the supply of food, saliva starts to be released in dogs.  And even if they do not receive food, salivation will still occur.  This strange fact interested the scientist, and in 1903 he announced the reflex mechanism to the whole world.  The scientific community was so impressed by this discovery that it awarded him the Nobel Prize.  And in 1904.  Regarding the effectiveness, it was found that different animals produce reflexes in different ways.  So, for dogs it was necessary to make 10-20 combinations.  In the same setting, subsequent reflexes formed faster.  Regarding man, the result was obtained that one combination of stimuli is enough for us (hello to British scientists).

In relation to dogs, it was found that the most optimal is the time range of 5-10 seconds.  It is also necessary to take into account that in cases when reinforcing stimuli begin to act earlier than indifferent ones, conditioned reflexes will not be developed.  Such is a feature of biochemistry.  It was also found that the best formation of bonds between arcs occurs when the body is awake.  When observing drowsiness, it was noted that conditioned reflexes occur slowly or their formation is not observed at all.  The same can be said of man.  Here is what can be said about the mechanism of formation of conditioned reflexes.

    <p>  Briefly presented information in the article gives an idea only about the general situation, and if you are interested in the topic, you can get acquainted with scientific works - they are very interesting and informative.  Certain difficulties can also be noticed if centers that are not associated with conditioned reflexes dominate in the nervous system.  So, when a cat was left in front of the dogs and the bulb was turned on, they did not salivate.  The same can be said about a person who is busy with his own affairs. </p><h2>  Interference </h2><p>  It should be noted that the formation of conditioned reflexes is possible only when the body is ready for this process.  So, if we consider the situation with the dog, then salivation occurred only in those cases when the animal was in a hungry state.  This is due to the fact that the food center was excited.  It should be noted that the weaker the stimulus, the slower the formation of conditioned reflexes (or they will not be created at all).  And the result obtained in this case is not stable.  In this case, one should not ignore the fact that the presence of excessively strong stimuli can lead to the fact that the mechanism of beyond (protective) inhibition will be launched.  This will also negatively affect the formation of conditioned reflexes. </p><h2>  Formation basis </h2>

In this case, the physiological side of the issue will not help us much.  Here it is necessary to delve into the molecular level.  So, the fixation of information is largely carried out thanks to ribonucleic acid.  If its amount in the body decreases, then the effectiveness of the training of experimental animals worsens.  Also, the cerebellum, <span>striatum,</span> and so on take part in this process.  But the above applies exclusively to lower animals.  In mammals and humans themselves, as already noted, the cerebral cortex is responsible for this.  They take on the largest role, but are not the only entities that are adapted for this purpose.  As an alternative, a <span>reticular formation</span> can be used <span>.</span>  So, in experiments on dogs, it was found that if they remove the large hemispheres, then they can form conditioned reflexes.  But only the simplest.

It would seem - such simplicity!  And we cannot yet recreate it or even just restart the disconnected one.  But this is only a matter of time - more research, and we will eventually understand what and how it works.  True, alas, they are not always pleasant, and for their conduct you will have to find people with a strong psyche and a good store of knowledge.  For the sake of justice, it must be noted that this is nevertheless carried out in the interests of mankind.  But, despite the usefulness, such manipulations nevertheless disgust a fairly large number of people.
