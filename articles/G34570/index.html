Archeologists still work on the remains of the ancient settlement, the main find of which was the ruins of a stone structure, slightly reminiscent of the pyramids.  The origin of the mysterious ruins, which turned out to be a high defensive tower, was later clarified. </p><h2>  Historical attraction </h2><p>  Kalos Limen (Crimea) is the main attraction of the village of Black Sea on the coast of <span>Karkinitsky Bay.</span>  The city mentioned by ancient authors at the moment consists of the territory on which scientists are excavating, and the Museum of History and Local History. </p>

    <h2>  Settlement history </h2><p>  Interestingly, no one knew the exact location of the city, about which ancient travelers so often wrote.  For a long time, researchers could not decide where the settlement was located.  And only the man-made hill, which kept the ruins of the tower, became a clue for archaeologists. </p><p>  The first expeditions began their work in 1929 and continue to this day.  Researchers of the ancient city found that the settlement with a beautiful name was founded in the IV century BC by the Greeks who arrived to capture the land.  They fell in love with a vast territory of about four hectares so much that they gave it such a poetic name. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The erected small settlement, which turned into a large policy, was surrounded by fortress walls, and all the land was distributed among the residents as allotments on which estates or towers were built. </p><p>  The ancient city of Kalos Limen, which came under the rule of Chersonesos, had a very good location.  The convenient harbor, which was visited by foreign ships, and fertile soils famous far beyond the polis, became the cause of constant raids by stronger neighbors.  It is believed that the period of independence of the settlement was very short. </p><h2>  Invaders raids </h2><p>  With the emergence of the Late Scythian state, raids on Kalos Limen became more frequent, whose quiet life turned into an eternal upholding of their positions.  Residents strengthened the lines of defense and built forts and fortresses to prevent the plunder of the Greek city.  However, this did not help much, and in the 2nd century BC it was subjugated by the Scythians, and the sea harbor turned into a popular port of invaders. </p><h2>  The destruction of the ancient city </h2><p>  It was at this time, according to historians, that the largest military operations began.  The Pontic commander Diophantus, who arrived at the request of the besieged Chersonesus, takes possession of the Crimea and takes away the ancient Kalos Limen from the Scythian rulers.  The once blooming city is gradually declining.  Locals leave him, and all the buildings are filled with sand and slowly destroyed.  The famous harbor, which has become a large port and hosted military and merchant ships, turns into only a shallow estuary. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  But the policy suffered the most terrible losses in the 1st century BC after the invasion of the Sarmatian nomads, who destroyed it almost to the base, leaving only the ruins of defensive fortresses and residential buildings. </p><h2>  Kalos Limen: Description </h2><p>  The city, standing on the shore of the bay, was surrounded on all sides by a fortified wall, supplemented by rectangular towers.  As soon as the Scythians began to threaten the polis, the local population strengthened their fortifications.  A 16-meter tower is being built, from the height of which, with the help of stone throwers, the path to the invaders was blocked. </p>

    <p>  In addition, in the dark, it served as a beacon for merchant ships calling at a local port.  And the organized basement inside the building, where food supplies were stored, allowed the city to be in a long siege.  After the attacks of the Scythians, the tower was surrounded by a stone belt, which gave it the form of mysterious pyramids, and the structure itself turned into a real bastion, protecting all approaches to the city from land. </p><h2>  Distinctive features </h2><p>  The remains of the fortress walls, which show blows from rams, are still being investigated by scientists.  Through Kalos Limen there was a wide street along which carts drove.  She was the connecting link between the main gate and the harbor.  Along one side of it was a sidewalk, and on the other a gutter of a drain. </p><p>  Archaeologists note the neat style in the architecture of the immigrants of Hellas, who looked advantageously against the backdrop of new Scythian buildings. </p>

    <p>  Around the city stretched agricultural land on which local residents worked, receiving nine hectares for each.  But gradually the main activity of the population becomes handicraft and trade. </p><h2>  Organized Museum </h2><p>  Now the historical and archaeological museum-reserve "Kalos Limen", opened in 1987, attracts the attention of curious tourists who want to get to know the amazing ancient city with a tragic fate.  Employees often conduct informative excursions telling about the ancient rites of the ancient settlement and its valiant struggle with the invaders. </p><h2>  What to see? </h2><p>  Well preserved not only part of the fortress wall.  You can see several towers that served as a gate protection, residential buildings, giving a complete picture of the life of the population.  Of great interest are the remains of brick walls with tightly biting tips of the Sarmatians. </p><p>  Scythian buildings are best preserved in the ancient settlement, and their careless laying indicates the lack of building skills inherent in the Greeks. </p><p>  Far from the settlement, burial mounds were found, under the embankments of which were cemetery crypts and ordinary graves.  Scientists found <span>clay vessels,</span> jewelry, weapons in them. </p>
