  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sights of Moscow: list, photo with a description, what to see for tourists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the general list of Moscow attractions, all objects are so diverse and magnificent that with their view they can cause interest to any traveler.  In the capital of Russia there are dozens of places worth visiting.  About the most magnificent of them is written in the article.  In the material you can find a detailed description that is useful to all tourists. </p><h2>  World popularity </h2><p>  The most famous in the list of Moscow attractions is Red Square.  Even those people who have never been to the capital of Russia heard about it.  The history of this place goes deep into the 16th century, but then the square was called Troitskaya and was intended for commercial affairs.  Throughout the history of the state, it was here that crucial events took place.  This applies to the Soviet Union and Russia as well. </p><p>  Now on Red Square tourists are more likely than locals.  Muscovites appear here only at night after clubs and at the celebration of the New Year.  On Red Square, you can see another famous attraction called the Moscow Kremlin.  Such a name in Russia had all the castles that protected the state from enemies.  Large-scale construction of the bastion began in the 15th century, when Tsar Ivan III invited the best masters from Milan.  They confirmed the title of world fortifiers and made the Kremlin beautiful from an architectural point of view and impregnable in defense.  Not a single tower of the outer wall is repeated, and on the territory of this complex there are many places that are worth visiting for tourists. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.privet-russia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Attractions List" class="if uuid-2446905" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2446905.jpg"></div><h2>  A piece of modernity </h2><p>  Each city has its own symbols, which become business cards and in Moscow, one of those is the Ostankino television tower.  This building appeared in 1967.  The construction was built in order to conduct high-quality television and radio broadcasting.  The reliability of the design was ensured by the fact that the craftsmen used reinforced concrete and squeezed it from the sides with special cables.  At that time, the height of 540 meters was a record all over the world.  The Ostankino television tower has remained a symbol of the grandeur of a past era.  Now tourists can climb to the site at an altitude of 337 meters and see the city.  There is also a restaurant "Seventh Heaven" for those who love unusual places.  You can also walk inside it along the technical route. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The second attraction from the list of more modern buildings will be the architectural complex "Moscow City".  In the middle of a huge metropolis in a short time, a real town of the future has grown.  Large skyscrapers shine with glass and attract the eyes of travelers.  Work on the construction of a modern business center began in 1998 at the place where the quarries used to be.  Today you can see sixteen towers that have their own symbolic names.  There are other interesting places on the territory of the Moscow City complex.  Underground there is a parking for 2700 places, drinking establishments, the largest fountain in Europe - all this causes genuine admiration among tourists. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rbth.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Kremlin" class="if uuid-2446908" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2446908.jpg"></div><h2>  Incredible beauty </h2><p>  If we talk about St. Basil's Cathedral, then for many travelers this <span>particular attraction</span> will become a cherry on the cake from interesting places in Moscow.  The cathedral with incredible architecture was erected in the twentieth century, and the project was approved by Stalin himself.  The building was erected during the reconstruction of Red Square. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Basil's Cathedral" class="if uuid-2446910" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2446910.jpg"></div><p>  St. Basil's Cathedral is distinguished by the fact that each dome in it differs in its features.  The color scheme was applied so successfully that now tourists can spend hours near the building, studying all the details.  If you forget about the world around you, you might think that a person fell into a fairy tale, and before him is one of the buildings of some unknown universe. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  With this cathedral, the Cathedral of Christ the Savior in Moscow can argue in splendor.  This is the main religious building in Russia, which attracts believers from all over the country.  It was erected after the Patriotic War in 1812, when Napoleon conducted his campaign on Russian lands.  In honor of the fallen soldiers, this temple was erected.  It was planned to erect a building on the Sparrow Hills, even the foundation was laid, but the architect was convicted of misappropriation of funds.  After that, the project was moved closer to the Moscow Kremlin.  At that time, the goal was to overshadow the famous Peter's Cathedral in Rome with the grandeur of the building.  Whether it was possible to do this, each tourist will decide for himself, but you should definitely look at the temple.  The dimensions themselves are impressive, and attention to detail during construction has led to the fact that it is impossible to take your eyes off the building. </p><div class="photo" data-original="weheart.moscow" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cathedral of Christ the Savior in Moscow" class="if uuid-2446909" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2446909.jpg"></div><h2>  Two other places of worship </h2><p>  It is impossible not to include the Ascension Church in Kolomenskoye in the list of Moscow sights.  This structure is unique already because during the reign of Prince Vasily III, such projects did not exist in Russia.  In honor of the birth of the heir to the throne, she erects a church, which is now one of the most interesting objects in Moscow.  The real embellishment of the Kolomensky park complex was erected under the supervision of the Italian master Pyotr Fryazin.  The bell tower forty-two meters high was a revolutionary decision at that time.  Another feature is the use of mainly white in the outer lining.  Plus, the nature around makes you immerse yourself in an incredible atmosphere of peace and comfort. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary is included in the ranking of Moscow attractions that delight its architecture.  The religious building appeared in 1911, and the construction took as much as ten years.  Masters adopted a neo-Gothic style, and therefore the building is distinguished by high spiers and other relevant design elements. </p><p>  With the advent of Soviet power, the purpose of the temple changed - it was turned into a hostel, even though they had been engaged in rich interior decoration for six years.  Only in 1996, after a long struggle for the rights to the building, the cathedral was transferred to the Catholic Church.  Before that, divine services were already held in it. </p><h2>  Interesting architectural complexes </h2><p>  The list of Moscow sights is so diverse that along with places of worship there is a place for magnificent estates.  One of those is Tsaritsyno, which was here back in the 17th century.  After some time, the princes of Cantemira took possession of it.  They added to the general splendor the greenhouse, and in the late 18th century, the mistress Catherine acquired this place for herself.  Since then it has been called Tsaritsyno.  During the formation of the Soviet Union, the Council of Deputies was located here, and only in 1960 the complex became part of Moscow.  Nowadays, various exhibitions are held within the walls of magnificent buildings.  Each traveler is recommended to visit the various museums in this reserve and enjoy the architecture. </p><p>  The Kolomna Palace is inferior in scope to the whole Tsaritsyno complex, but when viewed, it can present no less emotions.  This building is located in the park of the same name, and recreated it from scratch.  In the 17th century there was a real palace in which Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich spent time.  Due to lack of funds, the palace fell into decay, and the ruins were soon completely dismantled.  Reconstruction from scratch has been carried out for twenty years since 1990.  All rooms are restored identical to those in the primary palace.  Exterior architecture has interesting elements and different colors.  The construction in the midst of the natural environment captivates the eye, and therefore no traveler wants to leave from here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hg2.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Attractions List" class="if uuid-2446911" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2446911.jpg"></div><h2>  History and culture </h2><p>  If entertainment in the modern business center "Moscow City" is not attractive, then you should visit another complex called the Izmailovsky Kremlin.  At the end of the 90s of the last century, a project for an entertainment center appeared that will convey the spirit of the historical era.  Masters used the drawings of a real fortress, which stood in this place in the 17th century.  Today, the Izmailovsky Kremlin attracts travelers already with one splendor of appearance.  At the entrance at the majestic gate are two tall towers.  The first sight is attracted by the Church of St. Nicholas, on which there is an observation deck.  From a height of 46 meters, people can look at the environment.  In addition, there are many drinking establishments and other interesting sights. </p><p>  After viewing this complex, you can go on spiritual enlightenment at the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow.  This cultural site is known around the world and it is ranked with the magnificent La Scala and Covent Garden.  Construction began in 1776, and in 1821-1824 a monumental building was erected.  Inside the audience there is a five-tiered magnificent hall for viewing performances.  It simultaneously accommodates 2,153 people, but even this is not enough for everyone to join the culture.  Now the Bolshoi Theater is considered one of the important symbols of the capital of Russia.  Here, their talents were discovered by great composers, actors, dancers and directors, who are now known to the masses. </p><h2>  Historical buildings </h2><p>  One of the most interesting sights of Moscow is considered to be the Krutitsky Compound, which is located near the Novospassky Monastery and the alley of the same name.  It is worth noting that this is a whole architectural complex, which stores the spirit of the seventeenth century.  On its territory is located the Small Assumption Cathedral, and now the courtyard is transferred under the control of the patriarch of the Orthodox Church.  The historical roots of this attraction go back to the 13th century.  It was then that a monastery was built here, which over time turned into a residence for the higher clergy.  In the middle of the 20th century, the Krutitsky Compound was restored, but even so the spirit of history is in the air here.  It is for the sake of a special appearance that it is recommended to visit the place. </p><p>  After visiting the farmstead, tourists should go on a tour of the Kuskovo estate.  The incredible palace complex was built in the 18th century by order of the famous Sheremetev family.  Over the course of many years, the counts held lavish celebrations and invited the most famous persons of the state as guests.  Kuskovo Manor is perfectly preserved, this also applies to the French garden, which surrounds the building.  About twenty architecture monuments, pavilions, ponds and more will open to the eyes of tourists.  The contrast of the natural nature and structures of the 18th century is fascinating.  Hundreds of beautiful photos, as well as pleasant emotions are guaranteed when visiting the estate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.inyourpocket.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow City" class="if uuid-2446913" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2446913.jpg"></div><h2>  Cultural capital </h2><p>  It is worth noting that Moscow has a huge variety of museums, and to see them all, you will have to spend a lot of time.  If tourists have to make a choice, then it is worth stopping at the Armory.  This building contains so many incredible memorabilia that visitors take their breath away.  Despite the name, the exhibits in the museum are very diverse.  What is only a combination of four thousand jewelry, weapons, gold embroideries and other things.  Among the most striking exhibits, it should be noted the gift of Napoleon Bonaparte to Tsar Alexander - the Olympic service.  Also noteworthy is the Faberge collection, Byzantine jewelry embellishments that were created in the fourth century.  To appreciate all the jewelry, you need to be patient, but it's worth the time spent. </p><p>  Moscow is replete with sights of various types, and all of them will not be able to see even in a month time.  Visitors to people on their first visit to the capital of Russia are recommended to definitely walk along the Arbat.  This is a magical street, which symbolically can be compared with other popular places.  There is an atmosphere of free art.  Street musicians and artists delight passers-by.  Due to the popularity among the population in 1986, the Arbat was made completely pedestrian.  Modern infrastructure has captivated the streets, but many interesting places can be seen behind it.  For example, the restaurant "Prague", where Leo Tolstoy performed. </p><h2>  Best Fun for Kids </h2><p>  The Moscow Nikulin Circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard is one of the reasons why you can come with children to the capital of Russia.  For a family vacation, a visit will be a great option, and the kids will be charged with a positive.  The history of the institution begins in 1880, when it opened to the first visitors.  Since then, the building has undergone restoration many times, and the interior decoration has changed according to the trends of new styles.  In 1985, the old building was demolished, and soon a new institution with the same name and in the same place was opened.  The greatest artists, gymnasts and magicians managed to mark themselves on the circus stage.  Presentations can surprise not only children, but also adults with their splendor and beauty. </p><div class="photo" data-original="parentbook.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Zoo in Moscow" class="if uuid-2448032" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57442/2448032.jpg"></div><p>  The second institution where the child will feel great is the Moscow Zoo.  It was founded in 1864, and among other similar institutions in Europe it is the oldest.  Throughout its entire existence, the zoo has expanded significantly in size and diversity of fauna representatives.  The impressive territory of the institution contains enclosures with animals from around the world, a dolphinarium, a terrarium and even an educational center.  To see all the inhabitants of this amazing place, you have to spend a day visiting.  The administration took care of the developed infrastructure, and therefore there will be no problems with the needs of the people. </p><div class="photo" data-original="theculturetrip.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Kremlin" class="if uuid-2446915" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2446915.jpg"></div><h2>  Unusual Attractions </h2><p>  Not everyone will consider the Moscow Metro an interesting place, but it deserves special attention.  Already one design stations will amaze with its splendor.  Each of them differs in design style.  Stained-glass windows, mosaics, sculptures and murals on any subject - not every metro boasts such a luxury.  For example, at the Ploshchad Revolyutsii station in the Moscow Metro there are 76 bronze statues that were created by the famous sculptor Manizer.  The general system is divided into twelve lines with a length of 298.2 kilometers.  Many stations were built in the years 1930-50 and are considered to be separate sights.  To go down here for a while is recommended to any traveler. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dokonline.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gorky Park" class="if uuid-2448030" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57442/2448030.jpg"></div><p>  The second attraction from the list of unusual places is Gorky Park.  Due to the popularity among the local population, work is underway to improve the improvement.  Paid entrance is canceled, interesting events appear, and the infrastructure is developing.  The water bodies are now clean, there is even a small beach with a local bar.  Gorky Park can be considered a separate resort inside a huge metropolis.  Here, nature is perfectly combined with a piece of modernity.  A walk in the park will benefit anyone.  Here you can just sit in the shade of old trees or take part in free dance lessons. </p>
