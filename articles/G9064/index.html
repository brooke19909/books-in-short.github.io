  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mortgage growth trends in 2014</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The main goal of many residents of the capital of Russia, and indeed of any other city, is the acquisition of their own housing.  For those who are unable to immediately pay out a round sum and buy an apartment right now, banks have come up with a convenient solution - mortgage loans.  The client can get housing now, and his cost will be paid to the bank for a long period, which usually reaches 15-20 years. </p><h2>  How much more expensive apartments in 2014 </h2><p>  What is happening in the real estate market in 2014?  What are the main trends in its development?  Experts say that stabilization will become the main line in the real estate market of Moscow this year.  If the cost of housing can rise in price in only a few areas of the capital, then the price of a mortgage can increase in any case. </p><p>  In 2013, housing in Moscow rose in price exclusively within inflation, and residents bought apartments most often outside the city, issuing a mortgage for them, so we can assume that last year for the capital and the region passed without much upheaval. </p><p>  According to Rosstat, the inflation rate observed annually may exceed 7 percent.  That is why a significant increase in apartment prices can be discussed only if the cost per square meter for a year exceeds 10 percent.  In 2013, inflation kept in the region of 7 percent, therefore, housing increased in price only within these limits, that is, no more than the inflation rate. </p><h2>  Mortgage Value Trends </h2><p>  Most of the capital‚Äôs new buildings, namely 70%, are located in New Moscow, that is, it will be almost impossible to buy an apartment from a builder in the old city.  Quite inexpensive housing can be purchased in the sleeping areas of Moscow, for example, in Tsaritsyno or Novokosino. </p><p>  The rise in price of mortgage loans is directly related to the fact that they are really in demand.  Since the average cost of housing in the city can reach 168 thousand rubles, more often apartments are bought on credit.  If in 2013 the number of mortgage loans increased by 23% compared with 2012, then in 2014 we can expect an increase in the number by another 25%.  The cost of loans will also increase. </p><p>  The largest demand among Muscovites is in one-room apartments, the number of purchases of which in percentage terms is estimated by consultants at 47% out of 100. The remaining share is divided almost equally between two- and three-bedroom apartments. </p></div></article>
