The ability to listen to music of your favorite artists using portable players sets the pace of our lives.  However, you can get the maximum listening pleasure only when there are really good headphones, and they can be incredibly expensive.  Will have to work hard to find affordable analogues.  In this case, China comes to the rescue.  The best headphones from Aliexpress can compete with most of the devices on the market. </p>

    <h2>  Chinese approach </h2><p>  Online stores, and in particular the Aliexpress known to almost everyone, have become a real drug of the twentieth century.  The fact is that on such trading floors you can find a product much cheaper than its market value.  However, it should be remembered that the Chinese adore the original approach to work.  This creates a lot of problems.  These small troubles begin with the fact that the device may have completely unnecessary functions that drain the battery, and end with fraud. </p><p>  First of all, in search of the <span>best headphones</span> on Aliexpress, you just need to follow the main rule - never buy supposedly original brands.  Most often it will be a cheap replica or even a crude fake. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Expect a lot is not worth it, because it is China.  Even <span>the best headphones</span> from Aliexpress will not be able to compete with global brands.  No matter how good and pleasant the product reviews are, no matter how colorful the seller praises them, all this will be very far from the true quality. </p><p>  There are only two scenarios.  If the headphones are made of plastic that is pleasant to the touch, strong and beautiful, then it will not be superfluous to check the sound.  On the speakers, most likely, they saved a lot to increase the number of sales due to the original design and the quality of decorative materials.  However, things could be different.  For example, acceptable sound will be offset by cheap materials.  Surprisingly, this is also aimed at increasing the number of sales, because cheap plastic and a braid of wires quickly fail, and a customer happy with sound quality will most likely buy the product again. </p><h2>  Best of the worst </h2><p>  There are no products on Ali that could be the best.  This marketplace has only millions of products with modest quality, but you can choose from them that are better than the rest.  So, the best headphones from "Aliexpress" are Meizu EP51. </p><p>  Meizu is a reliable manufacturer.  This is a Chinese brand trading in the global market.  All products are not a replica and you can be completely sure of the originality of the purchased goods.  This model belongs to the earbuds category.  They are wired only partially.  There is no standard 3.5 mm jack.  Headphones are interconnected by a wire with volume controls, but at the same time they are connected to the player using wireless technologies.  The main feature, of course, is the dynamics.  They can not be called bad or cheap, but they are worse than those that are equipped with the flagship devices of world brands. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Down with conservatism, down with the wire! </h2><p>  The desire to get rid of wired devices is laudable, but not necessary.  Despite the apparent simplicity, such headphones are fraught with a lot of inconvenience.  <span>The best wireless headphones</span> on Aliexpress are the MEElectronics Air-Fi Matrix2 AF62.  These are not <span>earbuds</span> , but <span>full-size headphones</span> with an attractive ascetic design. </p><p>  You can be satisfied with this purchase, because it will not make you regret the money spent.  Yes, this model is really good.  She has no shortcomings, with the exception of one - the price.  They are incredibly expensive even on Ali.  Their cost starts from 7000 rubles.  This is comparable to global brands, but still a little cheaper.  Perhaps the best value for money in the Chinese market.  You should beware of replicas and fakes.  You need to buy with caution. </p>

    <h2>  Quality wireless earbuds - a myth </h2><p>  Another type of headphones - earbuds - can also be wireless, at least that's what manufacturers promise.  There is, however, a problem: they are cunning.  Even the best bluetooth earphones from "Aliexpress" are most often not without a common wire.  Yes, they are connected to the player using bluetooth, but there is still a short wiring.  The choice of such inserts is huge.  On "Ali" there are many high-quality "ears" of this type. </p><p>  Luoka S9 is exactly what you need.  Stylish and comfortable headphones.  The wires are hidden, but they are there.  This model is not so expensive, and also has a very decent sound. </p><h2>  Inexpensive, stylish, cool! </h2><p>  Music can be different.  Based on this variety, many manufacturers have chosen to make different headphones that can play the track as qualitatively as possible only if the genre matches.  Many do not need crystal sound.  Some are used to demanding only great bass in speakers.  Such is modern music.  Headphones with good bass on Aliexpress are hard to find, but they are there. </p>

    <p>  This is Bluedio T3.  Despite the low cost, these headphones will compete with Dr.  Dre.  Of course, this is hard to believe, but the point is not only in the headphones themselves, but in the fact that the world brand and this Chinese model were made by the same people.  It turned out inexpensively, stylishly and very cool. </p>
