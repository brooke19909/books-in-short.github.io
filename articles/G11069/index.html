Besides the <span>fact that such an amount</span> will help to solve the existing problems, it will also become a good airbag in the future.  But one must also approach such financial matters wisely. </p><h2>  How realistic is it to accumulate </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.stephens-scown.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Terms of savings" class="if uuid-2736908" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70525/2736908.jpg"></div><p>  How to save a million in a year?  In principle, nothing is impossible, it is only important to prioritize correctly.  For example, if you are determined to save, you no longer need to spend money in vain. </p><p>  But all this is good if there is start-up capital, that is, there is money available from which to start accumulation. </p><p>  If there is no initial money, then you will have to study investments and other financial instruments. </p><h2>  Goal definition </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.camdenadvertiser.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Purpose of savings" class="if uuid-2736900" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70525/2736900.jpg"></div><p>  How to save a million in a year?  This can be done if the goal is set correctly. </p><p>  First you need to decide what amount is required.  Next, you should set the time that can be spent on savings.  The amount that a person can afford to save is also important. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When calculating income, you do not need to set unrealistic deadlines.  It‚Äôs better to choose an option that doesn‚Äôt hit the wallet hard, but doesn‚Äôt push the accumulation indefinitely. </p><p>  When miscalculating options for how to save a million in a year, do not forget about bank deposits.  It is thanks to them that possible inflation will not greatly affect savings. </p><p>  An indisputable advantage is the fact that banks offer deposits for a certain period.  This means that under the influence of a minute you won‚Äôt be able to spend money, and they will continue to be in the account. </p><h2>  Determine the monthly amount for accumulation </h2><p>  If a person first thinks of how to save a million rubles in a year, and then limits himself in everything, then the crush will not last long.  This means that you need to calculate a comfortable amount that can be safely postponed. </p><p>  According to research, for stable accumulation it is necessary to allocate not more than thirty percent of income, but also not less than twenty five.  It is worth remembering that these figures are relevant for people who do not have debts and loans. </p><h2>  How not to break </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.briantracy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reasonable savings" class="if uuid-2736902" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70525/2736902.jpg"></div><p>  There are frequent cases when people, under the influence of a minute, spend all the money that was accumulated on random purchases.  For this reason, many undertakings in financial savings have remained at the initial stage. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So that this does not happen to you, it is important to adhere to the plan.  A great option would be setting up auto payment.  Money will be debited to the account immediately after receipt, and there will be no chance to spend it.  But for such a service, it is necessary that the salary card and deposit are in the same bank. </p><p>  No less effective way to accumulate a million for the year will be the distribution of priority.  What does it mean?  Everything is simple - at first the money is deposited in a savings account, and then the rest is spent on other needs. </p><p>  Another convenient option would be to open a deposit for a long period without the right to withdraw money from it.  So the accumulation will definitely remain intact and will only multiply. </p><h2>  How to optimize expenses </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.feedster.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hoarding wisely" class="if uuid-2736896" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70525/2736896.jpg"></div><p>  To understand how to save 1 million rubles per year, you need to correctly calculate your own expenses.  To do this, you need to consider all revenues and compare them with expenses. </p><p>  It is with this approach that budget holes and those items that can be dispensed with will be visible.  For example, on some trips to a cafe or restaurant, you can save up to five thousand a month.  At the same time, nutrition will only become more beneficial. </p><p>  If you give up bad habits such as alcohol or smoking, you can also save a lot per month. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  But do not rush to extremes.  If you forbid yourself everything, then the desire to save will disappear.  After all, no one wants to live in anticipation and austerity. </p><h2>  Proper financial behavior </h2><p>  When you started saving, you don‚Äôt have to give up keeping your home budget.  This is a good way to learn financial literacy and distribute money wisely. </p><p>  If earlier notebooks with a pen were assistants in home accounting, now there are a bunch of smartphone apps.  You can choose exactly what you like. </p><p>  In addition, there are other ways to return the money.  You can not discount cashback returns or various tax deductions.  It will be equally effective to track all kinds of discounts and sales. </p><h2>  Budget Tips </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.videoblocks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rash spending" class="if uuid-2736910" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70525/2736910.jpg"></div><p>  Try not to gain anything under the influence of advertising.  It is no secret that nowadays advertising has a very strong effect on customers.  But this is not even the case.  Often a person goes to the store, not because he needs something, but to kill time.  Just at such moments, unnecessary purchases occur.  The reasons for such acquisitions can be different: for some, shopping is a way to get rid of stress, and for others, a desire to make yourself comfortable.  Both that, and another leads to a waste of money. </p><p>  It will be great if you before weighing something, weigh the pros and cons of the purchase.  And only if necessary will you acquire a thing. </p><p>  No wonder all psychologists recommend going to the store well-fed.  The fact is that a hungry state encourages a person to rash purchases.  In addition, if a person goes to the store hungry, then he will pick up much more than he intended, simply because he wants to eat.  With this behavior, all thoughts on how to save a million in a year can be abandoned. </p><p>  Specialists recommend having cash.  This is because when buying with a card a person does not see money, therefore it is easier to part with them.  But if there is cash in the wallet, then before paying, he has time to think about whether this purchase is needed.  In addition, spending money that is in front of your eyes is much more difficult than the ones on the card. </p><h2>  Bad advice </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.moneysense.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cost optimization" class="if uuid-2736917" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70525/2736917.jpg"></div><p>  So that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow to save a million in a year without a bank does not become intrusive, you need to be distracted periodically.  We offer you harmful advice that will show how even the most noble impulse can be brought to absurdity.  So, we started: </p><ol><li>  At public catering facilities, you can pick up free bags of salt and sugar.  And also do not ignore toilet paper and paper napkins on tables. </li><li>  Down with the electric dryer!  Give me cat stuff!  These slogans are known to every economical person.  It is enough to fill up the filler at night - and in the morning the shoes will be dry. </li><li>  Burnt matches perfectly replace air freshener.  Cheap and natural! </li><li>  Only homemade food.  The author of this phrase is right if he means saving on meals.  But going to a restaurant in the evening a couple of times a month will not break a hole in the budget, and life will brighten up. </li><li>  Collect bills that have a figure eight in the serial number, and the money will not be spent.  After all, it is precisely the eight that will save from waste, if, for example, winter boots are torn. </li><li>  Money on the road is also money.  Feel free to pick up a coin of any denomination, because there is an example of an English couple who has accumulated so many millions.  Suddenly, and you are lucky? </li><li>  Mobile phones need to be charged at work.  And there you can bring a tablet, laptop and iron.  And rightly so, a freebie is so freebie. </li><li>  We forget about lying in the bath and introduce ourselves as a cadet.  Only they need to get dressed while the match is burning, and you need to wash in two minutes.  But this is a trifling matter for someone who decided to save seriously. </li><li>  Soap also needs to be saved.  All remnants are perfectly collected in one pretty soap.  And this very little soap can serve endlessly. </li><li>  Fine clothes are sold in second-hand clothes.  The quality is excellent, and things can be bought in kilograms.  So even the stars do. </li></ol><p>  All this would be very fun if it were not so sad.  Instead of increasing their financial literacy, people go to extremes, and then they fail. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="organic-tory.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Financial savings" class="if uuid-2736892" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70525/2736892.jpg"></div><p>  How to save a million rubles per year?  Of course, for an average Russian with a salary of thirty thousand this is unattainable.  But if you put a more realistic time frame, then everything will work out.  Before you start saving, there are a few things to remember: </p><ol><li>  The amount that is deferred for savings should be comfortable.  You can not start to postpone a lot, because soon it will get tired and accumulation will stop. </li><li>  Savings should be economical.  No need to bring to the point of absurdity.  If you go to a cafe or a movie several times a month, you will not cause significant damage to the budget. </li><li>  In order not to spend the already accumulated money on all nonsense, you need to open a deposit.  It is advisable that he be for a long time and without the right to withdraw money. </li><li>  <span>Cost optimization</span> also helps to save money.  Do not abandon control of expenses and income in the future. </li><li>  If everything is completely deplorable, then it will be useful to sign up for financial courses.  Such a pastime will certainly be useful.  Do not spare money for your own education, because then all this knowledge will come in handy. </li></ol><p>  If you follow all the rules, then you can save for a long time and fruitfully, without prejudice to anything. </p>
