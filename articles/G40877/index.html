    <p>  <strong>Materials and components</strong> </p><p>  First of all, you need a durable 10-liter plastic container.  It is used to create the frame of the body.  For the legs you will need a particularly strong wire and plastic tubes to hide it.  The diameter of the wire should be slightly </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Making crafts from plastic bottles." class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/209600.jpg" width="584"></div>  less pipe.  A welded mesh of metal is required.  Its approximate dimensions should be 45 cm wide and 150 cm long.  This will become the frame for installing plastic feathers.  Dense, good polystyrene, with which the head of a bird will be made.  Well, and of course, a certain supply of plastic bottles, which will be spent on the appropriate design.  These are the main components with which the peacock will be made from plastic bottles.  If necessary, this list can be significantly expanded and supplemented.

The upper section is divided into 3 equal parts.  At a distance of 2/3, the edge of the side wall is lowered and fixed with a wire or screws.  Connect the legs with the letter "P".  From below we put plastic tubes on them and fix them on the base (for example, a wooden circle may be suitable for these purposes).  From the top of the letter ‚ÄúP‚Äù we retreat the distance, which is equal to the length of the rib on the side of the tank, and make a certain bend of 30-45 degrees.  Next, we put the container on the resulting supporting structure.  The base on which the peacock will be built from plastic bottles, <strong> </strong>  ready. </p><p>  <strong>Feathers</strong> </p><p>  At the next stage, feathers from plastic bottles are cut and glued to the lower body and legs in a certain order.  Then to the top of the body </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Peacock from plastic bottles master class." class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/206770.jpg" width="353"></div>  a mesh is applied for welding and bends along the surface of the tank.  This also results in a frame for the tail, which should protrude from the back.  Next, elongated feathers made of plastic are cut and laid on a grid.  Fix them with a wire.  Similarly, wings are obtained.  After finishing styling the feathers, you need to start cutting the head.  It is made of polystyrene with a knife.  Buttons that stick to the right place can be used as eyes.  Then we make standing feathers on the head of plastic.  When installing, their base is coated with glue for bond strength.  Then we make a beak.  It is cut from the same material.  We fix it with the help of screws.  At the next stage, we make the neck and connect the two elements made earlier.  Then the neck is covered with feathers on which paint is applied.  At the final stage, the upper part is glued with feathers and then covered with paint of the corresponding color.  On the basis of the model are created paws.  All this is made of plastic.  Everything is ready, after drying the paint, the bird can be taken out to the garden and put in the place you like.  Making crafts from plastic bottles is a rather time-consuming process.  Experienced craftsmen take about 10 days to get a peacock.  If you are a beginner, it may take even more time for such a job.  It is important to remember and not to rush.
