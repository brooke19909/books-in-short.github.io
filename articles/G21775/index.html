A distinctive feature of this variety is the presence of a connection with the management processes of groups of people, organization.  Economic information takes place in the <span>process of production,</span> exchange, distribution and consumption of material goods.  A significant part of it is associated with the process of <span>social production.</span>  Thus, it can be called production. </p><p>  The very concept of "economic information" is a complex of information that reflects <span>socio-economic phenomena</span> and processes.  They (information) serve to control these processes, as well as groups of people in the non-productive and industrial sphere. </p><p>  Information reflecting social <span>production relations</span> includes information circulating in the economic system, data on production processes, management procedures, <span>material resources, and</span> financial transactions.  This concept also includes data exchanged between different control systems. </p><p>  In the structure of communication exchange, economic information occupies a special place.  At the same time, production processes, the order of consumption and distribution of material goods are reflected.  Economic information is distinguished by repeated use, large volumes, continuous transformation and updating.  In addition, it is characterized by the presence of a large number of logical procedures.  These, in particular, include selection, ordering, grouping, and unification.  The complex of information includes various mathematical calculations that allow you to get different types of result data needed in management. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Classification of economic information. </p><p>  All provided knowledge, information, messages contribute to the solution of one or another managerial task.  Along with this, it is possible to some extent to establish the value of economic information.  The faster or with the least losses it leads to the solution of the question posed, the more useful it is. </p><p>  In accordance with the purpose in the process of production management in society, there are the following types of economic information: informative and managing. </p><p>  The latter includes decisions communicated to performers.  In this case, both forms of planned tasks, direct orders, and forms of moral and economic incentives that motivate the behavior of performers can be used. </p><p>  Awareness information is reflected primarily in the reporting indicators.  It plays the role of feedback and is information about the results of the execution of decisions, the state of the control object.  Based on these data, subsequent decisions are made.  Thus, a further management process is carried out. </p><p>  The production, as well as the use of information should be well motivated, since it requires significant costs. </p><p>  In order to make marketing, commercial, investment and any other <span>management decisions,</span> it is necessary to have information about supply and demand, competitors and products, production costs and the availability of resources, inflation rates and stock prices and so on.  It should be remembered that the result of the decision manifests itself after some time. </p><p>  A manager who effectively makes decisions collects information only until the expected marginal benefits increase the foreseen marginal costs.  The necessary information, as a rule, is not concentrated in a certain place, due to the pattern of scattering and concentration of data. </p><p>  The recipient of the information evaluates them according to where and for what purpose they will be applied.  In this regard, information is distinguished by relativity and has different value for different recipients. </p>
