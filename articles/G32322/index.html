The harsh and beautiful northern nature has always served as a source of inspiration for such famous painters as Shishkin and Kuindzhi.  She was glorified in their works by Leskov and Tyutchev.  But Balaam is not only beautiful nature.  <span>Monasteries, monasteries</span> and cloisters are scattered throughout the archipelago.  No wonder Balaam is called the "North Athos".  This is a real monastic republic.  According to legend, the apostle Andrew the First-Called himself visited here when he came to baptize Slavic lands.  And the very secluded location of the island in the north of Lake Ladoga disposes to a contemplative life. </p><p>  A deeper plunge into the monastic life you will allow a trip to Valaam.  Pilgrims come here from Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities to touch the shrine.  But ordinary tourists like to visit Valaam.  Indeed, sheer cliffs, shining domes and piercing blue of the lake will not leave anyone indifferent.  But this article is devoted to very practical questions: "what are the tours to Valaam", "how long do they last" and "what is their cost." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Riding on the ramparts from Moscow" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2159520.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Island Visits Overview </h2><p>  Without exaggeration, we can say that the archipelago is one of the main attractions of Russia.  Foreign guests also come to Valaam, usually aboard a cruise ship.  You can visit the islands on your own.  But most tourists get here as part of organized groups - pilgrimage or sightseeing.  If we consider trips to Valaam from Moscow, then they differ from each other: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  by duration; </li><li>  by orientation (pilgrimage or secular acquaintance with the life of the monastery); </li><li>  by transport (cruise ship or bus and boat; for wealthy customers, transportation by helicopter is possible); </li><li>  there are also combined tours. </li></ul><p>  These latter can also be different both in duration and in intensity of travel.  For example, you can order such a combined tour as ‚ÄúValaam + Kizhi + Petrozavodsk‚Äù or ‚ÄúVisit to the monastery, rest on the shore of Lake Ladoga and rafting on the rivers of Karelia‚Äù.  Now consider all of these opportunities to visit the archipelago separately. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pilgrimage ride on ramparts from Moscow" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2159525.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Pilgrimage trip to Valaam from Moscow </h2><p>  Such trips are the most popular tours to the archipelago, because in this case you can not only see a lot of interesting things, but also order trebs, confess and take communion.  Pilgrimages last for three days, for one or two weeks (the last two options are with novice cooperation).  You can book a tour only to Valaam, or you can visit another island of the archipelago in one trip (most often it is Konevets).  As a result, the price range is quite wide.  If you take accommodation in the monastery as a novice (with the performance of manual labor), then a week in Valaam will cost you 8300 rubles.  This price does not include transport, but only accommodation in a strange house and meals. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Three Day Pilgrimages </h2><p>  The most popular trips to Valaam from Moscow to pious tourists who want to join the holy life of the monastery are precisely such tours.  In fact, they do not last three, but five days.  Here is an approximate program of such a trip.  Travel by <span>train Moscow</span> - St. Petersburg - the first day.  The price depends on the class of the car and is not included in the price of the ticket.  On the morning of the second day, pilgrims are collected, put on a bus and taken to Priozersk.  There they are loaded on board the motor ship of the Valaam fleet and sent to the island.  Having lunch at the monastery refectory, the pilgrims set off to inspect the Central Estate of the Transfiguration <span>Monastery.</span>  On the third day after the morning liturgy and breakfast, the boat excursionists visit the Voskresensky and Nikolsky sketes.  In the evening, worship and dinner await them.  On the fourth day, pilgrims have the opportunity to visit Skitsky Island.  In the evening they are delivered back to Priozersk, and then to St. Petersburg.  On the morning of the fifth day, travelers return to Moscow.  During the tour, pilgrims spend the night aboard the ship.  More comfortable conditions at the Igumenskaya Hotel are available for a fee.  The approximate cost of such a three-day pilgrimage tour is 13 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Drive on shafts from Moscow by car" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2159537.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Secular excursions </h2><p>  A bus trip to Valaam from Moscow is not much different from a pilgrimage tour.  Except that the excursionists should not participate in the compliments and matins.  Tourists spend the night in the cabins of the ship.  The price includes breakfast and dinner, as well as a transfer from St. Petersburg to Valaam and vice versa.  The price of such a tour also differs little from the pilgrimage.  It is approximately 12-13 thousand rubles.  A one-day helicopter tour from St. Petersburg for a group of 10-20 people will cost 280 thousand rubles.  If you are planning a trip to Valaam from Moscow by car, then you need to know that finding the right pier in Priozersk is not so simple.  In this town, an independent traveler has two options: </p><ol><li>  Buy a one-day excursion, which includes a <span>Meteor boat ride</span> and lunch at the refectory.  The price is 2,500 rubles. </li><li>  Get a round-trip ticket for the same boat.  There is no ticket office on the pier; you need to negotiate with the crew.  The fare is two thousand rubles. </li></ol>

    <h2>  A trip to Valaam from Moscow by boat </h2><p>  You can go to the archipelago and aboard a river cruise ship.  Of course, the program of this tour includes not only Valaam, but also other interesting places, such as Uglich, Goritsy, St. Petersburg, Kizhi, Mandrogi, Yaroslavl, etc. </p>
