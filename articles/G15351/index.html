Some items are removed from the school curriculum, and some vice versa. </p><p>  The same confusion occurs with the allocation of hours to each of the subjects.  But there are disciplines that will always be taught at school and beyond.  Those without which human development is impossible.  For example, <noindex>  <span>maths</span> </noindex>  . </p><p>  It helps a person understand the world around him, because everything that happens in him happens directly according to the laws of this fundamental science. </p><p>  Thanks to mathematics, it became possible to translate everything that happens in nature into the language of numbers, thereby realizing the relationship of everything around. </p><p>  Without this science, it is simply impossible to make a single discovery and invention.  Not a single state, enterprise, country can function normally without knowledge of mathematics. </p><p>  It is also actively used in combination with other equally important sciences, such as chemistry, physics, biology, computer science and others. </p><p>  Mathematics is a complex of abstract relations and interconnections that undergo various operations.  But when a science interacts with another material science, it is immediately modified into a description or simulation of a specific natural process. </p><p>  Also, mathematical knowledge is very important in everyday life.  To fill out a payment receipt, calculate family expenses and income, calculate the amount of interest on a loan or deposit, calculate the amount of taxes, etc.  Even the choice of a mobile operator is closely connected with mathematical calculations, since the main task will be to select a more profitable option.  After all, our life is completely embraced by counting, calculations and various analyzes. </p><p>  As for the direct influence of mathematics on a person, it affects his mental development and abilities.  Science gives a person the ability to see various patterns, generalize, think quickly, analyze what is happening, plan the future and think abstractly. </p><p>  Without these abilities, a person simply cannot be a part of modern society, cannot live a normal life.  After all, mathematics also educates the character of man.  Forces him to be more accurate, attentive, focused on the task. </p><p>  Mathematical knowledge will not allow us to deceive and mislead.  After all, this science is not just formulas and equations, this way of thinking, the logic of reasoning and orderliness in actions. </p><p>  The science of mathematics is very important in the life of every modern person.  Without it, it is impossible to become a full member of society. </p><p>  Develop and learn new things! </p></div></article>
