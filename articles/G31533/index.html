The construction of the <span>residential complex is</span> carried out as part of the reconstruction project of the neighborhood ‚ÄúCobblestone village‚Äù.  To do this, 25 dilapidated residential buildings were demolished, which freed up space for the construction of the Park Alleys residential complex. </p><p>  The complex offers apartments of various layouts: one-room, two-room and three-room.  The footage of the first starts at 33 square meters, and the latter are quite spacious, their footage is more than 92 square meters.

    <h2>  Ecological situation </h2><p>  Many believe that the city of Krasnogorsk is an ideal place for permanent residence.  Around the city is a large green massif.  Small rivers flow nearby.  Industrial plants located within or near the city do not produce waste that is harmful to health.  The wind from Moscow does not bring exhaust fumes here.  All these factors create the most favorable environmental situation in the complex. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Speaking directly about the Park Alleys residential complex, the developer chose the most successful land in the city - next to the city park.  Some of the apartments in the complex even have a view of it.  Nearby are <span>Ivanovo Ponds,</span> where you can walk and relax. </p><h2>  Infrastructure: external and internal </h2><p>  The infrastructure of the complex, like many other new buildings (Krasnogorsk), offers its residents built commercial premises on the ground floors of residential buildings.  Owners of cars will appreciate the spacious underground parking.  The developer designed the construction of a comprehensive school, a sports complex with a swimming pool, two shopping and office centers. </p><p>  Considering that the Park Alleys residential complex is being built within the city of Krasnogorsk, then all its infrastructure is at the disposal of their future residents.  Until the social system objects declared in the project have been built, for example, a school or kindergarten, you can use those located within walking distance from the complex.  There are several such establishments and residents can choose exactly where to take their child.  The city has clinics, supermarkets, museums, educational institutions of secondary vocational education, various banks, the Palace of Culture and the stadium.  In a word, all the objects that are necessary for a comfortable existence. </p><p>  As for the intra-complex infrastructure, here the developer will not leave his customers to wade through the mountains of construction debris.  The court territory will be ennobled by lawns and flower beds.  It is planned to equip several children's playgrounds and sports grounds.  Access roads to the complex will be asphalted, guest parking is equipped for guests of the complex. </p><h2>  Reviews about the complex </h2><p>  LCD "Park Alleys" (Krasnogorsk) reviews contain both positive and negative.  A sufficient number of negative statements.  Most of them are associated with a long construction and the postponement of the delivery of keys to the apartment for almost two years from the fourth quarter of 2015 to the second quarter of 2017.  Many buyers of residential real estate sue and exact a penalty related to non-fulfillment of the terms of the share agreement. </p>

    <p>  But there are also many positive reviews from those who have already settled.  Especially, a lot of them are written by residents of dilapidated housing, on the site of which the Park Alleys residential complex was built.  Krasnogorsk fulfilled its planned activities for the renovation of old dilapidated housing in the neighborhood "Cobblestone Village", relocating people from the demolished high-rise buildings to new apartments.  People are satisfied with the developed infrastructure.  Those who have children take them to the nearest school and kindergarten.  A children's clinic is also within walking distance of the complex.  Many are happy that the prices of apartments in the complex are quite low. </p><h2>  Layouts of apartments and the cost of housing </h2><p>  In total, the project of the complex provides for the construction of 1613 apartments.  Among them there are apartments of any size: from one-room to three-room.  The footage of the first starts at 33 square meters.  Three-room apartments offer their residents an area of ‚Äã‚Äã92 square meters. </p><p>  The average cost of one square meter of housing in the complex is a little more than 100 thousand rubles.  The most expensive are traditionally apartments with the smallest area, that is, one-room apartments.  All of them are ready to move in, with a turnkey finish.  Thus, the Park Alleys residential complex, it was the reviews about apartments that were positive.  A lot of buyers, having invested almost all of the available funds in the acquisition of real estate, already have no funds for repairs.  And with a finished finish from the developer, you can move into apartments and live. </p>
