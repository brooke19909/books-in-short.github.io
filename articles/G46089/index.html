It consists of the city of the same name and its environs.  The history of Singapore begins with the emergence of a small settlement that has long been unknown to the rest of the world.  However, over the years, Singapore has been built and grown and turned into a place that millions now dream of seeing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="singapore hotel with rooftop pool" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15653/314569.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h3>  World Trade Center </h3><p>  Singapore has one of the leading places in the world in economic development and welfare.  And all this despite the fact that in this country there are no minerals, and even water is supplied here from other countries.  Singapore today is a center of <span>world trade.</span>  And thanks to competent and talented management, this city is one of the most interesting and unusual in the world. </p><h3>  Marina Bay Sands </h3><p>  So, what is Singapore primarily famous for?  A hotel with a rooftop pool is known to almost everyone who comes here.  Marina Bay Sands is one of the most luxurious and expensive places in the world.  Rooms at this hotel must be booked in advance.  The building itself was erected in 2010.  On that day, huge spotlights illuminated the sky above the city, marking the appearance of the largest hotel complex in all of Southeast Asia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Singapore hotel rooftop pool" class="if" height="308" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15653/314570.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The opportunity to visit this unique place attracts many tourists to Singapore.  The hotel with a 200 meter rooftop pool is a breathtaking view that you can watch while swimming in the pool.  Everything is designed there in such a way that it seems that there is an abyss around the edge.  And the water flows straight down.  This is actually an appearance, but it gives a wonderful effect in photographs. </p><p>  The creation and opening of this unusual place undoubtedly glorified <span>Singapore.</span>  <span>The hotel</span> with a rooftop pool has become his hallmark.  Photos from the pool of this hotel bring thousands of tourists from all over the world from trips.  As conceived by the architects, the building itself is designed as <span>a gondola ship.</span>  It consists of three sixty-story buildings, connected upstairs into one magnificent platform, which serves as an observation point, pool and green garden. </p><p>  A hotel in Singapore with a pool is actually a common thing.  The large and noisy metropolis is designed in such a way that almost all buildings have gardens and landscaping on balconies or roofs.  This helps residents to live more comfortably in a big city, and improves people's living standards.  Many tourists understand this when they come to Singapore.  The rooftop pool is also convenient because the heat is not felt due to the competent organization of space. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Singapore hotel with pool" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15653/314577.jpg" width="600"></div>
