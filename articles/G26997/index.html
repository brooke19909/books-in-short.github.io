He is one of the creators of the string field theory and continues the efforts of Entstein to combine the fundamental forces of nature. </p><h2>  short biography </h2><p>  Michio Kaku was born on January 24, 47 in the North American city of San Jose, California.  It has Japanese roots - his grandfather immigrated to the United States to participate in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake of 1906 in San Francisco. </p><p>  Science attracted Kaku from an early age, and while studying at a high school in Palo Alto, he became famous for creating an particle accelerator in his parents' garage. </p><p>  Michio eventually enrolled at <span>Harvard University,</span> who graduated in 1968, becoming the best physics student.  From there he went to Berkeley, University of California, where he worked in a radiation laboratory and in 1972 received a Ph.D. </p><p>  The following year, Kaku lectured at Princeton, but was soon drafted into the army.  He was prepared for service in the infantry, but the war in Vietnam ended before he completed the course of combat training. </p>

    <h2>  Scientific activity </h2><p>  Since 1969, Michio Kaku has been widely published on string theory.  In 1974, together with prof.  K. Kikkava, he wrote the first work on the subject of string fields, which today is one of its important directions, capable of combining all five existing string theories in one equation. </p><p>  In addition, he wrote one of the first works on multi-loop amplitudes and the first article on their differences.  He first described the violation of supersymmetry at high temperatures in the early Universe, superconformal gravity and was one of the pioneers in the study of the non-polynomial theory of a closed string field.  Many of the ideas that he put forward were developed in the active fields of string research. </p><p>  His current work is devoted to the complex problem of revealing the nature of M-theory and string theory, which, he believes, has not yet been reduced to their final form.  Until the theory is completed, it is premature, he believes, to compare it with experimental data. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Popular science works </h2><p>  Kaku is the author of several textbooks for graduate students in quantum field theory and <span>string theory,</span> more than 70 articles published in magazines on supergravity, superstrings, supersymmetry and hadron physics.  He is the author of the non-fiction books Hyperspace, Visions, and Parallel Worlds.  In collaboration with Jennifer Thompson, he wrote "Beyond Einstein." </p><p>  The Hyperspace book by Michio Kaku has become a bestseller.  She was recognized as one of the best non-fiction works of the year by the New York Times and the Washington Post.  The book tells of parallel universes, the curvature of time and the tenth dimension. </p><p>  The work ‚ÄúParallel Worlds‚Äù became a finalist for the British <span>Samuel Johnson</span> Prize in the category of non-fiction.  In kig, questions of the origin of the Universe, higher dimensions and the future of space are touched. </p>

    <h2>  Michio Kaku - visionary </h2><p>  One of his latest books (Physics of the Impossible) deals with technology of invisibility, teleportation, foresight, starships, antimatter engines, time travel and much more - everything that is considered impossible today, but may become a reality in the future.  In this work, the author ranks the technologies according to when, in his opinion, they can become a reality.  In March 2008, Physics of the Impossible hit the New York Times bestseller list and stayed there for five weeks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The book ‚ÄúPhysics of the Future‚Äù by Michio Kaku was published in 2011. In it, the scientist writes about the impact science will have on the fate of humanity and our daily lives by 2100. </p>

    <h2>  Social politics </h2><p>  Michio Kaku has publicly expressed his concern about the problems caused by anthropogenic global warming, nuclear weapons, nuclear energy and the general abuse of science.  He criticized the creation of the Cassini-Huygens space probe for containing 33 kg of plutonium, used as a thermoelectric generator.  He informed the public about the possible consequences of the dispersal of fuel in the environment in the event of a breakdown and accident during maneuvering near the Earth.  He criticized NASA's risk assessment methodology.  Ultimately, the probe was launched and successfully completed its mission. </p><p>  Kaku is an ardent supporter of space exploration, believing that the fate of mankind is associated with stars, but criticizes some of NASA's economically ineffective missions and methods. </p>

    <h2>  Kaku Michio: Soul Physics </h2><p>  Dr. Kaku explains his anti-nuclear stance by the fact that during his student days in California, he listened to Pacific Radio.  It was then that he decided to abandon the career of a developer of a new generation of nuclear weapons in collaboration with Teller and focused on research, teaching, writing books and working in the media.  Kaku joined forces with Helen Caldicott and Jonathan Schell to create the Peace Council, a global movement against nuclear weapons that arose in the 1980s during the administration of US President Ronald Reagan. </p><p>  Kaku was a member of the board of the Peace Council and the WBAI-FM radio station in New York, where he led the Research program for a long time on the issues of science, war, peace and the environment. </p><h2>  Media personality </h2><p>  The American-Japanese physicist has appeared in many media and on many programs and networks.  In particular, he participated in the TV programs Good Morning America, The Larry King Show, 60 Minutes, CNN, ABC News, Fox News, History, Science, Discovery, and others. </p><p>  In 1999, Kaku was one of the scientists about whom the full-length film ‚ÄúMe and Isaac Newton‚Äù was directed by Michael Epted, sponsored by Paul Allen.  The picture was released throughout the country, broadcast on national television and won several cinematic awards. </p><p>  In 2005, Kaku starred in the short documentary Obsessed &amp; Scientific about the possibility of time travel and the people who dream about it.  The tape was shown at the Montreal World Film Festival.  Kaku also participated in the ABC documentary film ‚ÄúUFOs: seeing means believing‚Äù, in which he said that he considered it extremely unlikely that extraterrestrials would visit the Earth, but called on to be ready to accept the possibility of civilizations that were millions of years ahead of us in technologies based on completely new physical phenomena.  He also spoke about future exploration of space and alien life on the Discovery TV program, Alien Planet, among many speakers who participated in the show. </p><p>  In February 2006, Kaku starred in the lead role in the four-part BBC documentary, which explored the mysterious nature of time.  The first series was devoted to personal time and our perception and measurement of its course.  The second concerned the ‚Äúdeception‚Äù of time, the study of the possibilities of prolonging the life of organisms.  The topic of geological time was devoted to studies of the age of the Earth and the Sun.  The last series concerned cosmological time, its beginning and events that occurred at the time of the Big Bang. </p><p>  In 2007, Kaku led the three-hour 2057 program, which discussed the future of medicine, urban planning, and energy.  In 2008, he starred in a documentary about the prospects of computers, medicine, and quantum physics. </p><p>  Kaku became a member of such documentaries as ‚ÄúVision of the Future‚Äù (2008), ‚ÄúStephen Hawking: the master of the Universe‚Äù (2008), ‚ÄúWho's Afraid of a Big Black Hole?‚Äù  (2009‚Äì10), ‚ÄúPhysics of the impossible‚Äù (2009‚Äì10), ‚ÄúWhat happened before the Big Bang?‚Äù  (2010), The Science of Games (2010), How the Universe Works (2010), The Prophets of Science Fiction (2011), Through the Wormhole (2011), The Science of Dr. Hu (2012), The Hunt for Higgsom ‚Äù(2012),‚Äú Principle ‚Äù(2014), etc. </p><p>  Michio Kaku is popular in the media because of his knowledge and approach to presenting complex scientific issues.  Although his work is limited to theoretical physics, his speeches touch upon other areas.  He spoke on topics such as <span>the Kardashev scale,</span> wormholes, and time travel.  According to Kaku, terrorism is one of the main threats to the evolution of humanity from a type 0 to type I civilization. </p>
