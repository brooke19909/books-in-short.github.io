It was destroyed several times and rebuilt, but in 70 A.D.  was wiped off the face of the troops of Rome. </p><p>  The Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem was erected on a 9-foot platform.  A staircase with 10 steps led to its entrance; columns were placed on both sides of it, the names of which reached us as Boaz and Jahin.  The meaning of these names, unfortunately, has not yet been guessed. </p>

One of them was a sanctuary in which there were several windows under the ceiling.  The floor was made of cypress boards, and the walls are lined with cedar.  This part had a flat roof, which was supported by large logs.  On the doors and walls were flowers, palm trees, chains and cherubs.

    <p>  The temple of Solomon had another room, which housed <span>church utensils.</span>  There was a small altar carved from cedar, decorated with gold, as well as various lamps and a bread table.  The location of the altar is the same as in the Canaanite temples - right in front of the stairs leading to the next room. </p><p>  The third room was called the ‚ÄúHoly of Holies‚Äù, and it was the abode of God.  There were no windows in it, but there were two 15-foot cherubs trimmed with gold.  Their outer wings reached the walls, while the inner ones touched each other in the very center of the hall.  It is believed that the <span>Ark of the Covenant was</span> located there <span>.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  This temple was built 7 years, in the 10th century BC.  On the feast of Tabernacles, he was consecrated, and the "Ark of the Covenant" was brought into it.  After which King Solomon entered and said a prayer, after which the fire came down from heaven and singed the sacrifices made to the Lord on the altar. </p><p>  The most ambitious and solemn services have always been held here.  Sometimes the ministers of the temple could not even continue the service, because with a large crowd of people in elegant clothes, singing and sounding music, a cloud of the Glory of the Lord filled him. </p>

Three and a half centuries later, Jerusalem was captured by the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar, and the temple was destroyed to the ground.  The Jewish people were captured, and since then nothing has been known about the ark.

    <p>  After the return of <span>Jerusalem, the temple</span> was rebuilt, but it was no longer so beautiful that people really regretted it.  During the reign of King Herod, the temple was expanded and richly decorated, it began to look like a shining mountain peak.  But, unfortunately, the troops of the Roman Empire destroyed it, this time forever. </p><p>  To date, only a small section of the western wall has remained from it, not far from Mount Moria, on top of which it was located.  This place is called the <span>Wailing Wall</span> and is the greatest shrine among the Jews. </p><p>  The Temple of Solomon was undoubtedly one of the most beautiful buildings in Jerusalem, and it is thanks to it that today this city is the greatest religious center, which attracts pilgrims from all over the world. </p>
