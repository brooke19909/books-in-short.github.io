The essence of the latter: the desire to visit, after all, a classic European resort.  What to do such a tourist?  Indeed, on the one hand, hunting, as they say, is worse than bondage, and on the other, European resort prices will be higher than, say, in Goa. </p>

    <p>  However, in any situation there is a way out.  In particular, you can visit a fairly democratic resort, while choosing a small and inexpensive three-star economy hotel. </p><h2>  Hotel among attractions </h2><p>  As an option (one of many), you can recommend a tour with accommodation in Donau 3 * (Italy).  Hotel Donau (Rimini) is located extremely well: in the center of the famous Adriatic resort, just in the center of Rimini, Marina Centro quarter, and even on the first line.  Magnificent European Blue Flag beaches are spread out over a wide sand strip of 15 kilometers along the coast.  In addition, Rimini is considered one of the world famous centers of budget fashion.  Italians themselves come here to relax. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Not far from the hotel we are considering, lies Piazza Cavour (square), the famous Rimini Conference Center, and the Fiabilandia theme park.  From the hotel you can walk to the train station in a quarter of an hour, and Miramare Airport in a few minutes. </p><p>  However, the Italians themselves will describe the location of the hotel in a slightly different way: Donau Marina Centro 3 * (Italy, Emilia Romagna).  After all, Rimini for them is one of the eight provincial centers of the richest, successful and dynamic region of Italy, which is called Emilia Romagna.  He is known in the world as the patrimony of the Ferrari, Mozeratti, Lamborghini automobile concerns.  This land is also famous in the world of art thanks to such names as Pavarotti, Toscanini, Verdi. </p><h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  In a compact five-story building at Viale Vittorio Alfieri, 12 47921 Rimini is a small private hotel Donau Marina Centro 3 *.  Reviews about him emphasize his niche in the resort business: a budget but decent vacation.  The architecture of the building and the design of the rooms can be characterized by a single word: minimalism.  However, tourists get good basic services here and enjoy obvious bonuses from the advantageous location of the hotel. </p>

    <p>  For Wi-Fi you need to pay $ 5.  Free access is available in the reception area.  However, resourceful and advanced guests of Donau Marina unofficially use the wireless network of a neighboring hotel (password is its name). </p><p>  Donau Marina Centro 3 * rooms are cleaned daily, towels are replaced with laundered every other day, and bed linen is replaced twice a week.  Guest reviews, unfortunately, also contain a recommendation that should be mentioned: it is advisable to rent a room on the upper floors.  Unfortunately, there were two cases of theft at the hotel, both of them by strangers and on the ground floor (a video camera is installed near each room).  Of course, the administration made the corresponding conclusions, but the fact remains ... </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  From the Donau Marina Centro 3 * hotel (Italy, Rimini) to the wonderful sandy beach of Marino Centro, vacationers should walk only 70 meters.  The entrance to the water is comfortable, smooth, the sea is clear, the water is clear.  The beach is paid.  The price for a daily rental of two trestle beds and an umbrella is 10 ‚Ç¨ (the cost of a sunbed is 4 ‚Ç¨, and an umbrella is 2 ‚Ç¨). </p><p>  In total, in the vicinity of Rimini there are about 150 (!) Various beaches rented by different hotels, pleasing the spa guests with wonderful yellow coarse sand.  Their numbering begins with a sand strip near Fellini Park (No. 1) and extends further south.  Near the first beach stands the coolest Grand Hotel on the coast.  This beach is a favorite place for lovers of tennis, volleyball, scuba diving, diving, water skiing, yachting, windsurfing.  And in the evenings there are discos, concerts, costume shows. </p><p>  There are beaches in Rimini, especially suitable for children, with a high level of security.  Among them: </p><ul><li>  Marino Centro. </li><li>  Rivadzurra. </li><li>  Torre Padrera. </li><li>  Rivabella </li><li>  Mirimare </li></ul><h2>  Rest on site </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews of the guests, the Donau Marina Centro 3 * Standard Air Conditional Hotel is ideal for budget excursions and beach holidays.  However, families who came with children spend part of the time in the walls of the hotel.  After all, children are tired of long excursions and shopping, and, in addition, a short afternoon nap is useful for young tourists.  Many parents appreciated the equipment of the hotel's playroom and cinema. </p>

    <p>  Older guests also often spend time in their circle in the hotel bar, discussing plans. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The food offered by the Donau Marina Centro 3 * hotel to its guests can be called typical of small hotels.  It is provided by a small hotel restaurant.  As you would expect from an institution with 20-30 rooms, the range of dishes is not too wide, but only a little more diverse than what is prepared at home.  The emphasis is on freshness and quality. </p><p>  Since most tourists are on the beach during the day, on excursions or shopping, then, accordingly, the type of food offered to them is bivariate: </p><ul><li>  breakfast only; </li><li>  breakfast + dinner. </li></ul><p>  Breakfast, judging by customer reviews, is quite easy: scrambled eggs, ham, cheese, granola, croissants, several coffee options (the restaurant has a good coffee machine).  Dinner is very tasty: meat or fish main course, side dish (pasta, potatoes or stewed vegetables), very tasty salads.  All this is prepared by a really tasty hotel owner himself, with unique good nature and the skill of a good chef. </p><h2>  Leisure </h2><p>  As we already mentioned, the Donau Hotel P 3 hotel complex (Rimini, Marina, Centro) is located in a wonderful city with magnificent nature and wonderful beaches.  Here, the resort infrastructure is well developed along the coast: there are many sports fields, clubs for water sports (diving, windsurfing, surfing), and dance floors.  Fans of outdoor activities do not feel deprived of their hobby in Rimini. </p>

    <p>  Wonderful diving is obtained in the bay of Rimini, where two-meter waves, ideal for surfing, are common. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  The hotel was built in the very town of Rimini, where in our time a small rivulet flows, the name of which is known throughout the world: the Rubicon.  Yes, the same Rubicon that Guy Julius Caesar crossed.  Here, in Rimini, stands the oldest of the ancient arches - the Arch of Augustus, and nearby - a very symbolic structure - the two-thousand-year-old Tiberius bridge, which has been continuously used to this day.  It was built so powerfully that it could not be destroyed by the bombing of the Nazis.  Tourists often make amateur excursions here, using city buses.  Tickets can be bought at a specialized kiosk for 1.3 ‚Ç¨.  In this case, the "purchase" is valid for an hour and a half.  If you purchase a travel document on the bus, then its price will be 2 ‚Ç¨. </p><p>  Within walking distance from the hotel complex are the Fellini Museum, Tempio Malatestiano Temple, Rimini Stadium.  Taxi fare in Rimini - 1.3 ‚Ç¨ per 1 km.  Some tourists prefer to explore the city by renting a bicycle.  Daily rental price - 10 ‚Ç¨.  Renting a car here is also real.  Daily rental price - from 30 ‚Ç¨. </p><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  Some of the guests of Donau Marina Centro 3 * traditionally go to Rimini precisely because of shopping.  Therefore, we highlight this aspect in more detail.  After all, this city is considered in Italy the informal capital of budget fashion, a place where relatively inexpensive, but spectacular purchases are made.  It is here that cunning "shuttles" entrepreneurs fill their trunks. </p>

    <p>  Where to begin?  First, accept it as an axiom: experienced buyers purchase light industry products in Italy not in markets and stores, but directly in the factories that manufacture them.  At the same time, for example, buying a pair of shoes in a warehouse can save up to 150 ‚Ç¨ compared to purchasing it in a company store. </p><p>  What do hotel guests write in their testimonials?  Let's start by buying fur coats.  There are two factories in Rimini: Unifur (which produces more affordable products) and Brashi.  Accordingly, it is more profitable to buy in the warehouses of these companies. </p><p>  Italy is traditionally famous for its shoes.  Among the top shoe stores in Rimini, we will name the following: Nando, Prada, Fiorangelo, Muzi Moschino.  Fashionistas, of course, will be interested in the Casadey store located in the suburb of Corso D'Augusto, where they sell branded shoes with high heels. </p><p>  It's easier than ever in Rimini to buy good wine.  Indeed, in Italy, winemakers, as a rule, specialize in a certain type of this sparkling drink.  However, based on the experience of experienced tourists, we‚Äôll tell you what contents of the bottle should be expected from a particular brand: </p><ul><li>  Abboccato - semi-dry wine; </li><li>  Amablie - semisweet wine; </li><li>  Secco - dry wine; </li><li>  Dolce is sweet. </li></ul><p>  Of course, you should buy the famous Italian pasta.  Many locals prefer similar products from a company with the Barilla brand.  Obviously, for tourists it makes sense to follow their example.  If you are planning to buy a souvenir for your friends, fans can recommend buying t-shirts, badges, baseball caps from the famous football clubs Milan, Juventus, Inter, putting out only 5 ‚Ç¨ for them. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The small hotel Donau Marina Centro 3 *, located in Rimini, is deservedly popular among Russian-speaking tourists. </p>
