During his military service, he participated in several key operations.  The biography of General Andreev, his military merits and awards will be discussed later. </p><h2>  Childhood and youth </h2><p>  The birthplace of Andreyev Andrey Matveevich is St. Petersburg, the date of birth is November 12, 1905. My father was a worker at the Semyanikovsk Shipyard, there is no data on the mother‚Äôs profession, presumably she worked there.  When the son was 15 years old, the whole family moved to the Smolensk region, the village of Tatarsk, Monastyrschensky district, to the small homeland of the father of the future general Andreev.  The whole family almost immediately began to engage in agriculture.  In 1922, Andrei graduated from high school. </p><h2>  The beginning of military service </h2><p>  In 1924 he was called up to the ranks of the OGPU - the united state political administration.  In the same year, Andreev was sent as a private to the 1st Smolensky Regiment.  Later, he was transferred to the 13th Zaslavsky border detachment. </p><p>  A year later, Andreev was sent to study in Minsk, at the 2nd Belarusian school of border guards of the OGPU.  After graduating from this school in 1927, he receives an appointment to the frontier post, becoming the senior assistant to its head.  This is the 12th Bigosovo border detachment (OGPU troops) in the Vitebsk region. </p><p>  In mid-1929 A.M. Andreev was transferred to the Pleschenitskaya border outpost in the Minsk region, where he served as an assistant to the chief.  A year later, the future General Andreev was transferred as an instructor for political affairs to the 28th separate Smolensk division, which belongs to the OGPU troops. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Training and further service </h2><p>  At the end of 1933, Andreev began training at the Higher Border School in Moscow, run by the NKVD, and after its graduation, from mid-1935, he entered the service of the NKVD troops, in the 13th Motorized Rifle Regiment.

After its completion, he was included in the special Soviet-Finnish commission, which was responsible for the demarcation of the new border, and also settled possible border disputes and conflicts.  In this position, he proved himself to be a competent and unyielding employee, which allowed most of the contentious issues to be resolved in favor of the USSR. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.liveinternet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Soviet-Finnish War" class="if uuid-3034568" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3034568.jpg"></div><p>  In 1940, Andreev was again appointed the head of the fifth Red Banner detachment, which was stationed there. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  War </h2><p>  During the beginning of the Second World War, Andreev served in the same position, in the same place, but the next month he was transferred to the Leningrad Front.
