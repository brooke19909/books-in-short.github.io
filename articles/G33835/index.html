No wonder it is she who every day wins more and more hearts of users around the world.  This also applies to telephone devices that are not inferior to the most famous brands of the planet, such as LG, Samsung or Nokia.  But which Chinese smartphones are the best today, because there are so many of them?  The answer to this question will help the review of the most popular models for 2014. </p><h2>  Huawei Ascend Mate7 </h2><p>  This is the best Chinese smartphone in 2014 according to most respected publications.  Initially, Huawei showed huge ambitions in the production of mobile phones.  The success of the brand came several years ago with the release of several high-profile new products.  In 2014, the entire world was shocked by the Ascend Mate7 line.  This smartphone has become a sales leader not only in Asia, but also in many countries of Europe and America. <br><br>  The device‚Äôs operating system is represented by ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù version 4.4.2, flashed by Emotion UI 3. The screen of the <span>new Huawei model</span> is 6 inches, which makes Ascend Mate7 one of the largest smartphones at the moment.  Naturally, the supported resolution is FullHD.  Image density - 368 ppi. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="best chinese smartphone" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/626935.jpg" width="600"></div>  The best Chinese smartphone has in reserve not only a powerful Mali-T628 video adapter, but also an 8-core processor with a total frequency of 12.4 GHz.  Of the other hardware characteristics, 2 GB of RAM and 32 GB of integrated memory can be distinguished. <br><br>  The device also features high-definition cameras.  The main - 13 megapixels, the front - 5 megapixels.  In addition, you can select a powerful <span>battery with a capacity of</span> 4100 mAh.  The net weight of Ascend Mate7 is 185 grams. <br><br>  One of the main advantages of the device is <span>a fingerprint scanner,</span> which is able to work in the background of a pedometer.  Unlike many other smartphones with this option, Ascend Mate7 has a universal scan.  To read the fingerprint does not require any movement other than applying a finger.  The likelihood of system failure is minimal.  According to experts, the scanner on the new Huawei is much better than the same iPhone 5.
