    <h2>  Short story </h2><p>  In the modern resort of Ochamchira (Abkhazia), around the VI century BC, the city of Guenos was located.  It was founded by the Greeks.  Today, the ruins of the Roman bath, stone defensive walls and other structures of that period are accessible to the travelers.  Until now, such rare architectural monuments as the Bedia Cathedral dating from the 10th century and the Mokva Cathedral of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, also belonging to the 10th century, have managed to survive. </p><p>  The name Ochamchira in Abkhazia appeared due to the fact that the village is surrounded by boxwood groves.  After all, in Turkish, boxwood is pronounced like chimshir or shamshir.  This influenced the fact that this territory was first called Oshimshir, and after a while this name was transformed into Ochamchir.  Active development of the resort infrastructure took place during the period of the Soviet Union.  So, tea factories were opened, a railway station began to work, tobacco enterprises were built, a poultry farm and a cannery started working.  Despite the fact that Ochamchira suffered greatly in the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict, she managed to remain a sought-after resort, which after some time was completely restored. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Abkhazia rest ochamchira" class="if" height="433" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1924704.jpg" width="600"></div>
