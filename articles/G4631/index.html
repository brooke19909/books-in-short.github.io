Not so long ago, on the site of this developed town was a small fishing village.  Now Ayia Napa, conveniently located in a secluded bay near Cape Greco, has become one of the first-class resorts in the region, which at the same time managed to not lose its provincial charm. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Margadina 3" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/721363.jpg" width="550"></div></h2><h2>  From mythology </h2><p>  According to legend, once upon a time in place of modern Ayia Napa an impenetrable dense forest grew, and therefore the whole territory was considered uninhabited.  However, a stray hunter in a cave often found an image of the Mother of God on the wall.  Since then, this place is called Ayia Napa, which from ancient Greek translates as "sacred forest."  This small fishing village became a flourishing resort not so long ago, however, despite its comparative youth, it is rapidly developing and is gaining more and more popularity. </p><h2>  Holidays in Ayia Napa </h2><p>  This direction is chosen mainly by young people.  The reason is that the resort is quite lively and noisy for fans of solitude and a relaxing holiday.  During tours to Ayia Napa, tourists live a busy life, not even calming down deep at night.  Here you can dance all night long at discos or in numerous clubs, show your singing talent in karaoke, enjoy excellent cuisine, drink the legendary Cypriot wine and just enjoy spending time in tiny, but very cozy taverns. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Margadina 3 (Cyprus)" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/721368.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In Ayia Napa, cultural or entertainment holidays are constantly held, for example, Green Monday, the Day of the Apparition of the Holy Week, the carnival before Maslenitsa, the festival in commemoration of the <span>global flood,</span> Easter holidays, etc. </p><h2>  To the tourist note </h2><p>  The summer season at the resort is rich in a wide variety of holidays, so those who like mass events come here.  However, if tourists cannot combine their holidays with any of the holidays, you should not get upset: Ayia Napa is generous with other entertainments.  For example, in the Marine Park you can visit dolphin shows here every day.  Children under twelve years old can come to them for free.  Among the places worthy of close attention, one can distinguish the Venetian monastery, built in the sixteenth century in honor of the Virgin Mary.  This holy monastery, which since 1978 serves as the Ecumenical Conference Center, is considered the hallmark of the resort.  In addition, those who combine relaxation with sightseeing can visit the People‚Äôs and the Museum of Marine Life, as well as Europe‚Äôs largest water park, Waterworld Waterpark. </p><h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  The resort annually receives thousands of tourists from around the world.  A significant proportion of travelers in this army are Russians.  Ayia Napa pleases visitors not only with a comfortable climate, but also with picturesque bays and sandy beaches, vibrant nightlife and interesting sights.  Conquers tourists and the hospitality of hotels in the resort.  All conditions have been created in them so that residents feel at home here. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Ayia Napa hotels, like many in Cyprus, are built right on the coast or across the road.  Those apartments that are offered in four- or five-star hotels have a very developed infrastructure and are fully consistent with their category.  For example, living in an Alion Beach Hotel 5 * per person per night will cost an average of about three thousand three hundred rubles with the concept of a continental breakfast.  There are more expensive apartments, for example, Adams Beach Deluxe Wing, designed only for adult clients.  A day in them will cost about eight and a half thousand rubles. </p>

    <p>  In general, almost all Ayia Napa hotels offer good service and a high level of comfort, so even two- or three-star accommodation options will not disappoint travelers.  One of these hotels is Margadina 3 (Margadina 3 *). </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The hotel is located one hundred and fifty meters from the municipal white sandy beach.  It is surrounded by many bars, taverns and restaurants.  Just ten kilometers away is one of the most beautiful places in all of Cyprus - Cape Greco. </p><p>  Larnaca International Airport is only forty minutes away.  This factor is very relevant for those who come to the Margadina 3 * hotel with children.  As a rule, little travelers do not tolerate transfers, so the shorter the transfer, the more convenient it is not only for the kids, but also for their parents. </p><p>  The hotel area, although relatively small, but fully equipped.  Everywhere there is a lot of greenery, palm trees and citrus trees are planted, between which you can stroll along the snow-white paths in the evenings, breathing in the aroma of flowers and the sea. </p><p>  The last overhaul in Margadina 3 * (Cyprus) was carried out in 2012.  The rooms are stylishly decorated, all furniture and plumbing are completely replaced. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2>

    <p>  Margadina (Ayia Napa, Republic of Cyprus) offers its customers all-inclusive, half-board and continental breakfast.  Meals are offered in the main buffet restaurant.  Those with the concept of ‚Äúhalf board‚Äù can change their dinner for lunch.  They can also pay sixteen euros per day per person and get a ‚Äúfull board‚Äù.  This must be agreed in advance at the registration desk. </p><p>  Margadina 3 * <span>(Cyprus),</span> guest <span>reviews</span> serve as proof of this, offering very good food for a three-star hotel.  Many Russians liked fruit salads, grilled vegetables.  The menu has many different varieties of cheese, delicious sauces.  Three types of meat are offered daily.

And who does not want to eat in a restaurant, can visit taverns or cafes located next to Margadina 3 *, or go to a nearby supermarket, where there is a huge assortment of food products. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Tourists call the sea in Ayia Napa nothing less than incomparable.  In May, it is still slightly cool in the morning, but the water heats up during the day.  The beach is municipal, like everywhere in Crete.  It is large and long with a snow-white sandy coating.  You can walk to the coast from the hotel in five minutes.  Sun beds and umbrellas are issued for a fee - five euros per set. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Margadina Hotel Cyprus Ayia Napa" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/721370.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Many Russians living in Margadina 3 * (Cyprus, Ayia Napa) liked Nissi Beach more, where a city bus leaves every half an hour from the hotel.  Travel time is twenty minutes, the fare is 1 euro one way.  Nissi is considered one of the best beaches in all of Europe.  And although there is always a lot of people on it, it is so big that those who bathe each other do not interfere at all. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Margadina 3 * has a heated pool, which is very important in the spring.  Around him are many sunbeds and umbrellas.  Many vacationers who do not want to go to the beach sunbathe here.  Animation is not included in the infrastructure of the hotel, but twice a week discos and shows with dances are organized.  There is a playground with swings and slides for children on site.  If desired, parents can use the paid babysitting service. </p><p>  Those with an active lifestyle can visit the fitness center and play tennis or billiards.  There is also a sauna and a jacuzzi.  A large number of water activities (paid) are offered on the beach. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  In Cyprus, and in Ayia Napa in particular, there are many places that tourists should definitely see.  It is convenient for those who do not want to use the services of excursion companies to rent a car or an ATV.  They can comfortably travel around the entire Cavo Greco, as well as numerous beaches, including Connos Bay, as well as Fig Three Bay, located in Protaras.  You can visit the water park, watch a show of dancing fountains, ride through mountain Cyprus, admire the numerous waterfalls, visit a trout farm, where you can taste this fish inexpensively.  It is necessary to see many local attractions, especially since the convenient location of Margadina Hotel (Cyprus, Ayia Napa) contributes a lot to this. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  You can talk about this island endlessly: it is simply incomparable.  Smiles of the Cypriots, beautiful landscapes, a wonderful sea with endless beaches ... I would definitely like to come back here more than once.  Ayia Napa is a resort town with a bunch of shops, taverns and restaurants, in which life does not stop for a minute.  In the evenings you can go to discos, of which there are a lot.  Walking around the city even at night is safe; entrance to many entertainment venues is free. </p>

    <p>  Many Russians liked the unobtrusive service at the hotel, beautifully decorated rooms with designer renovation in interesting colors.  False ceilings, laminate flooring, comfortable lighting, LED TVs, chic bedding, comfortable furniture, especially transparent chairs and coffee tables, scented towels - all this, according to the Russians, even pulls the ‚Äúfive‚Äù. </p><p>  As for nutrition, our compatriots especially remember the delicious olives and fried ribs.  The menu, judging by the reviews, has always been varied.  According to the Russians, watermelons, bananas, dates and grapefruits are served daily.  There are several types of meat: lamb or beef, pork or chicken, often served turkey.  There were many different sauces and spices. </p><p>  A lot of positive reviews about the work of the staff. </p><p>  In a word, the hotel is excellent, and therefore so many people dream of returning to it. </p>
