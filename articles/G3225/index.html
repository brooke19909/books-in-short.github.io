It often happens that tourists plan to go on an exotic journey with their children and show them all the beauties of a foreign country.  What features should be considered when planning a family vacation in Thailand with a child?  Let us consider the main ones further. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.holidayswithkids.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Thailand with children" class="if uuid-2546908" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2546908.jpg"></div><h2>  Documenting </h2><p>  It is no secret that in most cases, for crossing the border of a foreign state, tourists should have a visa with them - permission for this action, as well as for staying in the territorial borders of the country for a certain time. </p><p>  It should be noted that in addition to the basic documents required by adults to visit the country, several papers per child will also be required.  One of them is his birth certificate.  In addition, in case of a trip to the company of persons who are not the parents of the child or his guardians, the accompanying persons must have written permission to take the child out.  Moreover, this document must be notarized.  Such permission to leave the child in Thailand is also necessary in case the child travels outside Russia with one of the parents.  In this case, it must be provided by the person who is the second guardian (or parent). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Climate features </h2><p>  When planning a vacation <span>in Thailand with children,</span> any parents should clearly understand that the climate of this country has certain features.  It should be remembered that at the height of the resort period, which lasts from November to March-April, the country is mostly sunny.  Moreover, some recommendations of tourists say that the sun is somewhat insidious: it may not be observed throughout the day, but it‚Äôs good to hide behind the clouds, as a result of which people who are not on the beach under an umbrella simply sunbathe in the evening.  It should be understood that for an adult or a child this fact will not be useful. </p><p>  Knowing the peculiarities of the climate of Thailand, any caring parent, planning a vacation in this country in the company of his child, should stock up on a stroller with an awning, sunblock, body milk, and also a small amount of baby food, which will be required for the period of acclimatization. </p><p>  You must also understand that, having arrived in Thailand, you should not immediately take the child to the beach - you need to let his body get used to the new atmosphere, which is enough for one day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ciaobambino.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Thailand vacation with children" class="if uuid-2546912" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2546912.jpg"></div><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Another important issue related to a short-term flight to an exotic country is nutrition.  You need to understand that for an ordinary Russian child it may seem too exotic and a sharp transition to a new diet can adversely affect the general condition of the baby's body.  That is why for some time before the trip, it is best to start preparing the body for a new diet.  To do this, you can include marine fish and seafood, spicy salads and exotic fruits in your usual lunch. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition, on the road with you it is imperative to take some familiar products.  Many tourists naively believe that they will be able to purchase suitable products in Thai supermarkets.  However, in reality this is not quite the case, as many tourists from Russia have already noticed: far from all the products offered in stores are presented in good quality. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  As a rule, most tourists prefer to fly to Thailand with children for a beach holiday, which, according to most travelers, is organized at the highest level.  Many of those families who spent their holidays with children in the country in question note a number of beaches that are ideal for the youngest tourists.  These include Kata, Kata Noah, Patong, and, of course, the world-famous Karon.  All these places for recreation share a number of common characteristics: soft sand, cleanliness and gentle descent into the water. </p><p>  Staying on the beaches of Thailand with children, you should definitely remember some safety measures.  In particular, parents should constantly monitor the presence of a hat on the child, sunglasses and sunblock on the skin. </p><p>  Many beaches in Thailand are paid, but the cost of visiting them is small - in terms of Russian currency, it is about 200 rubles per person (200 Thai baht).  For the indicated price, guests of the private coastlines are provided with places with sun loungers and large umbrellas. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  One of the attractions of tourists who come to Thailand is visiting interesting places as part of organized excursions.  Where do experienced travelers recommend going with a child? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.holidayswithkids.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Permission to travel a child to Thailand" class="if uuid-2546909" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2546909.jpg"></div><p>  Many tourists claim that a guided tour of Phuket will turn out to be very interesting, in which adults and children will be able to get acquainted with the features of rubber production, jewelry making and pearl mining.  In addition, while relaxing in Thailand with children, you can go to the picturesque Siliman Islands, where you can swim and enjoy the huge stones.  With a similar mission, you can also make an excursion to the island of Roy. </p><p>  A separate part of tourists recommends visiting the local amusement park, which will be interesting for both the smallest and the teenagers.  The child will also be interested in visiting the elephant nursery, where for a small fee they will be allowed to ride an elephant and even take pictures with it. </p><p>  Many experienced tourists leave certain recommendations regarding the order of tours.  They note that it is advisable to purchase them not at a hotel, but at local offices - their prices are much lower.  In addition, you should give preference to those tours that are conducted by Russian-speaking guides - so the trip will be much more interesting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="honeykidsasia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Thailand Phuket with children" class="if uuid-2546911" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2546911.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotel selection </h2><p>  In the process of planning a vacation with children in Thailand, you should definitely pay attention to what conditions the hotel chosen for accommodation offers its guests.  Of course, the child will not care what rating has a place to relax - it is much more important for him to have an air conditioner in the room, an individual bathroom, as well as a separate crib.  It should be noted that it is advisable to negotiate with the administration in advance about providing a berth for a child, since the number of cots in places for rest is usually limited. </p><p>  An ideal hotel option would be the one that offers guests breakfast included in the price of the room.  Typically, a grocery set includes a light salad, chicken eggs, sausages and a small set of exotic fruits. </p><p>  Of course, it is advisable to give your preference to those hotels that are within walking distance from the coastline - to travel long distances with a child is not always convenient. </p><h2>  Where to go to Thailand with children? </h2><p>  When choosing a tour to an exotic country, you should pay particular attention to the region in which you are planning a vacation.  Seasoned travelers have long compiled a list of towns and areas in the country that you can visit with your child and be satisfied.  Among them are Chiang Mai, Hua Hin, Samui, Krabi and, of course, the island of Phuket, which is loved not only by children, but also by adults. </p><p>  It is in all of the above regions that there is a certain list of conditions for recreation and entertainment for kids.  In addition, an acceptable climate is observed here, as well as in almost all local hotels the rooms are equipped with everything that is necessary for the smallest tourists to stay. </p><p>  Further we will consider each of the listed regions in more detail. </p><h2>  Phuket </h2><p>  Of course, first of all, you should consider the features of Phuket, which are ideal for the youngest tourists.  To all those who plan to travel to Thailand with children, in the reviews left on various forums and sites, I recommend that tourists do this from February to April - during this period, the climatic conditions prevailing here are most favorable. </p><p>  In Phuket, with a child, you can visit the best beaches of the island: Patong, Kata and Karon.  In addition, any teenager will be interested in fishing in the Andaman Sea, as well as visiting a golf club.  Younger children will be happy to visit the local amusement park, playgrounds, as well as children's discos and cafes. </p><h2>  Krabi </h2><p>  Krabi Island is a very calm place, which, according to tourists, is great for families with small children.  The climatic conditions of this region are very similar to those that prevail in Phuket.  On the island there are completely no cars, which provides some kind of safety for children. </p><p>  There are three beaches that are distinguished by their shallow water: Hat Rai Leh, Hat Rai Leh and Hat Phra Nang.  The majority of hotels are located on their territory, the conditions of which are well suited for a child staying at any age. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ciaobambino.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Thailand with children where to go" class="if uuid-2546914" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2546914.jpg"></div><p>  Older children can try their hand at climbing, training on specially equipped climbing walls.  In addition, fishing and kayaking are offered for this group of tourists. </p><h2>  Samui </h2><p>  This picturesque island is located off the east coast of Thailand.  Where is it better to relax with children in this region?  First of all, you need to turn your attention to the coastal part of the island, where the bulk of upscale hotels are located.  In them, as a rule, all the conditions necessary for the relaxation of children and their parents are tripled. </p><p>  As for the entertainment that is available on the island, among them it is worth highlighting a visit to the National Marine Park, as well as Na Muang Elephant Camp, which offers elephant rides - kids will be very interested in such an activity. </p><p>  As for adolescents, in addition to all of the above, they can go in for kayaking, as well as diving.  It should be noted that along the coast of Koh Samui there is a considerable number of picturesque underwater sections, excursions to which are very popular among tourists. </p><div class="photo" data-original="comparetravelmarket.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="We are going to Thailand with a child" class="if uuid-2546917" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2546917.jpg"></div><h2>  Hua hin </h2><p>  Hua Hin is another region in which silence reigns constantly.  Here you can have a wonderful time with your child.  You can visit this region at any time of the year, however experienced travelers still do not recommend doing this from August to October - at the present time there are rare rains. </p><p>  As for a beach holiday, he is also present in Hua Hin.  Most travelers recommend that tourists who travel to Thailand with a child stay at or near Sofitel - this is the best beach in the entire region. </p><p>  What local entertainment will children like?  First of all, staying in Hua Hin with a child, you need to visit Monkey Mountain, Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park, as well as caves located near the region in question. </p><p>  Tourists who rested in Hua Hin note that walks, delicious food and a pleasant urban atmosphere are perfectly combined in this region. </p><h2>  Chiang mai </h2><p>  And finally, another region that is distinguished by its conditions favorable for holidays in Thailand with children of different ages.  It is located in the northern part of Thailand and, as many travelers note, combines the vibrant culture of Bangkok and the picturesque village. </p><p>  As for entertainment, most of them are incredibly popular among both adults and kids.  These include hiking in the hills, rafting, as well as a visit to the unique zoo.  Of course, very nice walks are also possible along the picturesque streets of Chiang Mai. </p><p>  Where to go with children in Thailand?  There is an excellent culinary school in Chiang Mai, which will be interesting to visit for both adults and children.  It is in this place that many culinary fans study certain features of cooking Asian dishes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.puretravelnw.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Thailand with baby hotels" class="if uuid-2546922" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2546922.jpg"></div><h2>  Cons of Thailand holiday with children </h2><p>  It is no secret that, along with a lot of advantages, certain disadvantages can exist.  Of course, they are available in family vacations in Thailand.  Let us consider some of them further. </p><p>  The first significant minus of relaxing with young tourists in such an exotic country is the duration of the flight.  On average, transporting travelers by air takes about 10 hours, which is definitely not good for the condition of the child.  In case of such a long journey, tourists recommend taking a laptop or children's toys with them to entertain the baby. </p><p>  A significant disadvantage of relaxing with children in Phuket (Thailand), as well as in all other regions of the country, is exotic animals, insects that can scare the child or even bite him - you should also pay attention to this factor. </p><p>  When planning a vacation in Thailand with a child, you need to choose a hotel thoroughly.  Many unscrupulous travel operators often try to give out what they wish for validity, which subsequently can turn into uncomfortable conditions for children to stay.  That is why when choosing a family tour to an exotic country, you should not chase the cheapest prices. </p>
