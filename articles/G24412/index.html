Father Gudrun, who holds the post of Reichsfuhrer, madly loved his daughter, as a result of which she became the personification of Nazi childhood. </p><p>  Her father gave her the nickname "Puppy," which means "Doll."  The girl was really beautiful - with blond curls and gray eyes. </p><p>  From a young age, Gudrun Himmler (date of birth - 08.08.1929) attended events related to parties and state affairs.  She even had a certain ‚Äúmission‚Äù - the girl handed the bouquets to the F√ºhrer.  This touched him, and quite often he rubbed the girl by the cheeks. </p><p>  Many said that at the time the war began, she was the happiest child. </p>

    <h2>  Family relationships </h2><p>  Relations between the parents of Gudrun - Heinrich Himmler and Margaret von Boden - were quite tense, as a result of which the couple stopped living together.  The girl‚Äôs father stopped appearing in his daughter‚Äôs home in Munich.  But this did not worsen the relationship between dad and daughter.  Henry continued to pay due attention to her, often saw the girl and even sent a special military plane to bring Gudrun to him in Berlin - even if this meeting was short, only for a couple of hours. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The father loved his daughter very much and gave her many expensive gifts, including a huge number of jewelry made on an individual order.  Gudrun still keeps one of these gifts - this is an old silver brooch with the image of four horse heads, which together make up the swastika. </p>

    <h2>  Concentration camp </h2><p>  The most striking impression from Gudrun Himmler‚Äôs childhood is a visit to the concentration camp in Dachau.  The girl was accompanied by her father and Adolf Hitler.  What she saw led her into real delight: she was happy that they were fed, watched with admiration the beauty of the nature of those places, and sometimes even with sincere curiosity and enthusiasm she looked at the drawings created by the prisoners. </p><p>  In an interview, Gudrun Himmler, whose photo is in the article, told how, after visiting the concentration camp, she said to her mother: ‚ÄúBeloved mother!  Today, Papa and Uncle Adolf and I visited the SS camp in Dachau.  We were warmly welcomed and deliciously fed.  It was the most beautiful day! ‚Äù </p><p>  She recorded this event on the pages of her diary.  The girl wrote: ‚ÄúOn this day we became guests of the SS concentration camp in Dachau and saw a lot of interesting things.  We looked at the beauty of pear trees, drawings created by prisoners.  It was just wonderful.  I'm happy". </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Himmler‚Äôs records do not mention crematoriums and gas chambers, but this does not mean that she did not visit them.  That day, senior Himmler arrived at the concentration camp with an inspection, and his daughter followed on his heels.  Many believe that at that moment young Gudrun was exposed to the negative impact of the situation.  Her child psyche suffered. </p>

    <h2>  Gudrun Tragedy - Father's Death </h2><p>  The girl's happy and carefree life came to a logical conclusion in 1945.  Heinrich Himmler was captured this year, and he intentionally swallowed potassium cyanide and passed away.  For the daughter it was a severe blow.  She found out about his death quite by accident. </p><p>  From strong feelings and longing, the girl fell ill with a fever and for about 3 weeks was in a forgotten state, almost dying.  She did not believe in the suicide of her father, she believed that the British dealt with him.  As a result of this, a woman to this day has hatred of the British. </p><p>  After the death of Heinrich Himmler, Gudrun plunged into inconsolable mourning.  Her mother, Margaret, was also hit.  The daughter accused her of discord in the family, considered her the culprit of the fact that she spent little time with her father.  In connection with these circumstances, the most dear people - mother and daughter - were estranged from each other. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Hardships of life </h2><p>  After the death of Heinrich Himmler, the mother and daughter were imprisoned in Britain for two years. </p><p>  Margaret and Gudrun Himmler were arrested by the British on May 13, 1945.  At that time, Gudrun was 15 years old.  The girl refused to testify against her father, in connection with which difficult times began for mother and daughter.  Constant movement from camp to prison, then again from prison to camp. </p><p>  1946 was a happy year for mother and daughter - they were finally released.  Upon leaving prison, Margaret and Gudrun led a poor lifestyle, they had neither money nor things that could be sold and bought food.  Then they decided to ask for help at the Protestant shelter.  Its doors were open to all who needed support.  They did not refuse anyone. </p><p>  In 1947, Himmler‚Äôs daughter Gudrun, whose photo you have the opportunity to see in the article, submitted documents for admission to the Higher School of Arts, indicating ‚ÄúReichsf√ºhrer SS‚Äù in her father‚Äôs paper and as a result she was refused.  But then the school leadership changed its mind, agreeing to accept the girl for training, provided that she would not receive a scholarship.  Gudrun agreed. </p><p>  In 1951, the girl graduated and received a diploma of a tailor's assistant and a certificate of denazification, confirming that she was not responsible for the actions of her father. </p>

    <h2>  The beginning of Nazi activities </h2><p>  After leaving prison, Himmler's eldest daughter, Gudrun, began to search for work.  But they were unsuccessful.  She was refused at all Munich clothing factories. </p><p>  The girl was offered to change her last name, as a result of which her candidacy would be approved for work at one of the factories, but Gudrun Himmler flatly refused.  The girl was not ashamed of her father and his activities, and always said: "He is my father!"  The girl constantly claimed that he was slandered, there was no fault on him. </p><p>  In the future, the girl begins to actively participate in the activities of various communities created by former Nazis.  But due to the fact that in 1951 any activity of the Nazis was banned, the girl entered a secret community called Stille Hilfe ("Silent Aid"). </p><p>  Today, people studying issues related to the activities of the Nazis even suggest that Gudrun herself became the initiator of the opening of the community.  But this statement is false, because the community was created before 1951.  Its creators were two clergymen: Catholic Bishop Johannes Neuhuisler and Lutheran pastor Theophilus Worm. </p><h2>  Goals and Activities of Stille Hilfe (Quiet Aid) </h2><p>  The organizers of the Stille Hilfe community had only good intentions.  As stated in an interview with Bishop Neuhuisler, who had previously been a prisoner of Dachau, the organization posed the following tasks: to reconcile the German people and convince victims of violence to forgive their tormentors, as they say, ‚Äúrepay good for the evil done‚Äù. </p><p>  The community welcomed any help to prisoners.  Parcels from relatives were handed over to them, members of the organization helped find lawyers for those prisoners who were considered unjustly punished. </p><p>  Since joining Stille Hilfe in 1951, Gudrun Himmler has changed the focus and goals of the community.  The organization ceased to be interested in the life and fate of ordinary soldiers, all efforts and opportunities in assistance were aimed at helping influential people, namely the participants of the Third Reich.  The girl became the representative of Stille Hilfe and gave guarantees that all the money coming into the treasury of the organization would be used for good purposes.  The girl also had another significant role: she actively campaigned for people to join the community of young neo-Nazis. </p><p>  In addition to Gudrun, the community was another famous personality of that period - Princess Helena Elizabeth von Isenburg.  Her task was to provide the organization with cash, through donation fees.  The girl monitors observance of decency in the community. </p><p>  According to documents provided to the authorities, Stille Hilfe continued to help prisoners of war and prisoners.  In fact, the organization tried to hide the criminals from the state, providing them with housing, material assistance and medical services.  Most researchers conclude that it was this organization that helped to employ the German politician Arthur Axmann, who had been in prison for 3 years. </p><p>  Gudrun did not like to talk and discuss her activities at Stille Hilfe.  ‚ÄúMy help is that I devote time to everyone - at least I try.  As much as I can, I make the lives of others better.  But I don‚Äôt want and will not talk in detail about my activities, ‚Äùshe put an end to in one of the infrequent interviews. </p><p>  After time, the organization has new concerns.  There was no longer any need to transport Nazi criminals abroad.  This has been replaced by the task of providing the Nazis of advanced age with high-quality medical care, as well as sponsoring their accommodation in boarding houses and nursing homes.  The most important task is to pay for the services of lawyers, as the ‚Äúhunt‚Äù for the Nazis has begun throughout the country, which the state has caught and sent to Germany for further trials. </p><p>  Gudrun assisted many criminals.  The girl had a good relationship with Mallot.  Gudrun was not only his sponsor, regarding lawyers and living in a nursing home, but very often visited him for simple conversations.  According to reliable sources, after the death of Mallot, she sponsored his funeral, organizing them at the highest level.  Thanks to the activities of the community, it was known in almost all countries, especially in Holland, Denmark and France. </p><p>  According to German scholars, Gudrun Himmler only by his presence attracts young neo-Nazis and their money to the community. </p>

    <h2>  Wiking-jugend </h2><p>  In 1952, Gudrun Himmler created an organization called Wiking-Jugend.  She was frankly neo-Nazi and looked like a Hitler Youth. </p><p>  Wiking-Jugend lasted until 1994, after which it was closed due to the recognition of unconstitutional. </p><h2>  Personal life </h2><p>  In 1960, Gudrun Himmler married a journalist, writer, and formerly active activist of the neo-Nazi movement Wulf Dieter Burwitz. </p><h2>  Children vs Parents </h2><p>  Unlike Gudrun Himmler (Burwitz), many children of their Nazi parents do not support the actions of their parents.  They confirm that Gudrun carried out neo-Nazi activities. </p><p>  According to Martin Bormann, the youngest son of the head of the party chancellery and Hitler‚Äôs closest adviser, Gudrun repeatedly asked her to support and help her organize the National Democratic Party of Germany. </p>

    <h2>  Attitude towards Gudrun Burwitz </h2><p>  Most people loved Gudrun Himmler (Burwitz).  When she appeared at events in Germany and Austria (a meeting of SS veterans and youth organizations in Austrian Ulrichsburg) related to Nazism, people were incredibly delighted.  One of those present at this meeting shared his memories: ‚ÄúThey walked in front of her on their hind legs.  Gudrun was interested in everyone, how he lives now, where, when and who he served.  Everyone considered her an ideal, sought to be like her.  The young part of the population saw it as something unearthly, divine, Gudrun was considered the standard. " </p><h2>  Present day </h2><p>  According to German authorities, Gudrun Himmler (Burwitz) and its organization are closely monitored and controlled by the authorities.  But they also say that the authorities have no reason to close the Stille Hilfe or simply ban it as unconstitutional.  Members of the organization do not violate laws that do not prohibit providing assistance to the elderly and the poor. </p><p>  But still, opponents of Nazism were able to oblige Stille Hilfe to pay taxes. </p><p>  According to numerous opinions and experts, Gudrun Himmler (Burwitz) and her Stille Hilfe (Quiet Aid) have good funding, the organization has many sponsors, which makes it possible to pay taxes without problems. </p>

    <h2>  The role of G. Himmler in history </h2><p>  From infancy, Gudrun is in love with the image of his father.  The death and actions of which did not disappoint her, but rather exalted him in the eyes of her daughter.  Throughout her life, a woman helps and makes every effort to help those criminals who have harmed all of humanity.
