    <h2>  Accrual of bonuses under the program "Thank you" </h2><p>  <span>Before moving on to the topic of the article and answering the question of how to pay MTS (communication services) bonuses, we will consider the process of scoring points on the bonus program.</span>  <span>The first thing that holders of Sberbank cards need to know is that the program is activated only manually by the client (it does not connect automatically when a card is received at a bank branch).</span>  <span>To become a member and start receiving bonuses for operations on the card, you must familiarize yourself with the terms of the program and become its member.</span>  <span>You can do this yourself: through the personal account of the account holder, through bank terminals, using the phone.</span>  <span>In the first two cases, everything is pretty obvious: we select the appropriate menu on the website or at the ATM.</span>  <span>You can also enter the bonus program through your mobile phone.</span>  <span>To do this, send a message to number 900 with the text: " <em>THANKS &lt;4 last digits of the card</em> &gt;".</span>  <span>After registration has occurred in the program, for each purchase that will be paid with a credit card, its holder will receive an amount of 0.5% of the payment to the account.</span>  <span>The mechanism for accruing bonuses is quite transparent.</span>  <span>In the future, accumulated points can be used to pay for services and goods through stores included in the affiliate program.</span>  <span>The only drawback of the Thank You program is the modest number of companies where you can "spend" bonuses.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

Thus, if your card, for example, has 400 rubles, then transferring them to the balance of your mobile number is not possible (at least 495 rubles are needed).  There are also restrictions on the maximum transfer amount - 6000 rubles.  It should be noted that for one subscriber (for one number) only 12,000 rubles are available for transfer per month.  Details can be found in the offer agreement, which the payment system proposes to familiarize yourself with at the first stage of data entry in the form of bonus transfers on the MTS website. </li><li>  In 24 hours, you can make no more than three transfers from the bonus account to the mobile number. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to pay with bonuses Thank you MTS communication services" class="if" height="430" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45312/1502895.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Payment for communication services from the mobile operator‚Äôs site </h2><p>  How to pay with ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù MTS bonuses through the operator‚Äôs resource?
