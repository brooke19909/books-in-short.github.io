The device operates on a more advanced Symbian Belle operating system, which, although it cannot compete with Android and iOS, still works much better and more efficiently than older versions of the brand‚Äôs platforms. </p>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  This aspect is one of the most important advantages that the Nokia 700 can boast of. Users can choose from several color options for the case, including turquoise, white, black, purple and red.  The design of the model is not bad, but there is a slight backlash.  The device is pleasant to hold in your hands and conveniently stored in small pockets. </p><p>  On the front panel of the device is the Nokia 700 screen (the instructions describe it in detail), three control keys, a speaker for conversations and warning lights.  It is worth noting that the music speaker is also placed on the front panel immediately below the buttons.  So now, even if the phone is on a table or some other surface, you will never miss an important call or message.  Speaking of cons: if you cover the speaker with your hand, then the melody becomes almost inaudible.  By the way, being in a tight pocket, Nokia 700 gives a muffled and fuzzy sound. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  On the back of the device is a camera, one of two microphones and an LED flash.  The left end is empty, while on the right there is a volume rocker, a phone lock button and a camera activation key.  At the top, the connectors are adapted: a slot for a 3.5 mm headset, a hole for a proprietary charger and a micro-USB connector.  The lower part of the device was limited to a second microphone.  The overall dimensions of the device are 50x110x9.7 mm., Weight - 96 g. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The display of the device measures 3.2 inches.  When it was created, the developers opted for ClearBlack AMOLED, which looks much more preferable to the usual TFT matrix used in the previous model.  The display is protected by <span>Gorilla Glass.</span>  The screen resolution of 640x360 pixels is not enough at first glance, but in reality the picture looks quite presentable. </p><p>  16780000 colors allow the display to demonstrate excellent image quality: the colors are bright and saturated, it is also worth noting good viewing angles.  In addition to the juicy palette of colors, the incredible depth of the black shade catches your eye, which is especially impressive in devices with a white body color. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The multi-touch works imperfectly, but does not have any special drawbacks: maps and photos are scaled without any problems. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The Nokia 700 has a single-core processor running at 1300 MHz.  512 MB of RAM is also responsible for processing information.  To store data, the user has 2 GB available, in addition, there is a slot for memory cards that accepts microSD flash drives up to 32 GB in size.  As for the interfaces, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 3.0, USB and NFS are available to users. </p><p>  The characteristics are rather modest, and now you will not surprise anyone, but they cope with their tasks with dignity.  The transition between the menu items is smooth, the device thinks pretty quickly.  The gadget is capable of launching many serious toys and applications, so those who plan to use this model as a smartphone will have something to occupy themselves with. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 700 phone" class="if" height="425" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27558/1055187.jpg" width="424"></div></h2><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The camera, embedded in the Nokia 700 smartphone, is both impressive and disappointing.  A resolution of 5 megapixels allows you to take medium pictures, and the LED flash copes well with lighting objects.  A set of necessary functions is available to help you set the shooting mode.  But instead of the usual autofocus, full fokus is installed here, which is completely unsuitable for high-quality macro photography.  The colors are bright, but often the image visible through the lens flickers, and the colors are distorted. </p><p>  The Nokia 700 camcorder, whose performance looks slightly better, shoots with a resolution of 1280 √ó 720 pixels.  Quality videos look better than photos.  High-quality video recording is also due to a good processing frequency of 30 frames / s.  With the flash on, you can shoot in dark rooms or later in the day. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  The speaker for playing music has a volume slightly above average.  In a pocket on a noisy street, the sound is weak, so you have to use a vibrating alert.  The device works well as a modest mp3 player, but you should not expect a lot from the variety of functionality and playback quality. </p>

    <h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The Nokia 700 has a 1080 mAh lithium-ion battery.  In the operating mode of the music player, the device will last about 47 hours without recharging, in the mode of telephone conversation - 7 hours, and the standby time reaches the mark of 465 hours. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The filling of the device turned out to be weak, the dubious operating system also confuses.  But do not forget that the smartphone was made with a bias towards design: a pleasant appearance, compactness, many bright panels, etc.  - and in this regard, the device succeeded as well as possible and turned out to be very stylish and attractive.  And the bet on the technical characteristics is made by models of a completely different plan.  The camera disappointed with the lack of full-fledged autofocus, which is why it will not be possible to achieve truly high-quality images.  With video shooting, things are somewhat better.  The screen left only a pleasant impression: the colors are saturated, rich and attractive.  There is an amazing depth of black shades.  The battery has an average battery life.  In general, a smartphone has both significant disadvantages and advantages.  He coped with the main task, but otherwise everything depends on the preferences of users. </p><h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  User reviews regarding this device vary widely.  For example, some consider the camera to be a weak part of the gadget, in particular, due to the lack of autofocus, others believe that it will work for the phone. </p><p>  Absolutely everyone liked the design and vibrant Nokia 700 cases, photos of which can be seen in the article.  Reviews say that the device is very durable, convenient and stylish.  A slight backlash of the construction is noted. </p>

    <p>  They criticize the quiet speaker, because of which the call is sometimes inaudible.  As for the use of a music player using headphones, here most of the reviews are positive.  Some even compare the phone with a full mp3 player. </p><p>  The bright screen was to the liking of most of the audience.  Vibrant colors and ClearBlack technology are noted.  Reliable glass Gorilla Glass protects the smartphone in the event of a fall. </p><p>  If we talk about the Nokia 700 operating system, its characteristics from users are ambiguous: some believe that it is quite capable of satisfying the needs of smartphone owners, others consider it a failed platform, which is an uncompetitive opponent for Android and iOS. </p>
