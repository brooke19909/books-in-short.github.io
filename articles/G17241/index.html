They are so penetrated into the life of an ordinary person that portable electronics can be easily found in every home, in particular digital cameras and video cameras, players, smartphones, tablets, etc. Their constant use makes it difficult to use only what is needed from time to connect to the charger, and not always and not everyone has time to charge their devices to the desired level.  Very often you have to deal with when you immediately need to call or go online, and there is no charge at hand, or this problem occurs during a trip or long-distance flight.  Today, there are a large number of different devices that will help extend the time you use your favorite gadget.  Almost all electronic devices are powered by their own internal rechargeable batteries. </p><h2>  How to choose portable charging?  Basic Rules </h2><p>  First you need to find out the power consumption of the electronic device, and then choose a portable charge that will be able to provide equal or even greater power.  For long trips, it is better to purchase a recharging <span>solar panel,</span> with which you can repeatedly recharge the device.  In sunny weather in nature, it is better to use autonomous solar charging.  Part of the gadgets can not be used while they are charging.  It is better to leave the house with a fully charged battery, since charging from the sun does not provide a full recharge.  Having made the right choice once, for a long time you can completely get rid of the problem of a dead mobile gadget.  Uninterrupted operation of the mobile phone will be ensured within 3-6 days.  For users of iPhones, special charges have been developed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="portable charging" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41181/1203028.jpg" width="529"></div>

Sometimes solar charging does not have an internal power source, and it charges the electronics from the sun.  The output power of the charger must be greater than or equal to the battery power of electronic gadgets.  When it is less, charging, on the contrary, will discharge the device.  When choosing portable chargers, they do not always pay attention to this.  Sometimes the problem is not the power output, but the USB cable.  For Apple products, you only need to use the USB cable that comes with the device.  When choosing a portable charge for your phone, you need to consider the time of its use, the method of recharging and the frequency of recharging. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="portable phone charger" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41181/1203027.jpg" width="500"></div>
