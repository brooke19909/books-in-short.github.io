    <h2>  Overview and Description </h2><p>  The Grand Blue Sky Hotel 4 * at first sight impresses with its splendor and plenty of greenery.  The hotel is considered one of the newest in the resort, it was commissioned in the late nineties of the last century.  Since the opening, the hotel complex has been described in tourist catalogs as a place where you should go with a child.  Therefore, it was very popular among travelers from all over the world. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is interesting that the main contingent in The Grand Blue Sky Hotel 4 * (Turkey / Kusadasi) is the Turks.  And this means that the hotel complex is able to satisfy even the highest demands of local residents who are trying to choose only the best hotels in the resort for their vacation (at the moment there are about 8 of them).  The Grand Blue Sky Hotel has 4 stars, which it fully corresponds to.  Almost everyone who has been here writes about this in the reviews. </p><p>  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel is approximately forty thousand square meters.  The territory has a large number of green spaces, stairs and artificial hills are beautifully inscribed in the landscape.  Therefore, many tourists bring from vacation simply magnificent photographs taken in different parts of the hotel. </p><p>  The last repair work was carried out here four years ago.  But in reviews of The Grand Blue Sky Hotel 4 * it is often mentioned that not the entire number of rooms looks presentable.  In some buildings, it is noticeable that the repair was done and the apartments welcome guests with a luxurious design and fresh furniture, but in others the rooms definitely require updating.  However, dissatisfied guests are quickly relocated to other apartments.  Often this process is dispensed even without surcharge. </p><p>  The Grand Blue Sky Hotel 4 * itself is a three six-story building.  Most of the rooms are standards, but they are designed to accommodate a different number of guests, which is reflected in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe apartment. </p><h2>  Location of the hotel complex </h2><p>  If you analyze the resorts of Turkey, Grand Blue Sky Hotel 4 * is in a very good place.  Kusadasi is famous not only for its beaches and a wide selection of entertainments, but also for its sights, where you can find out many interesting facts about the ancient history of this place.  Tourists usually enjoy visiting the ruins of the ancient ancient city of Ephesus, go to hot springs and visit the famous house of the Virgin Mary.  All this makes the rest more intense and gives a lot of good impressions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The hotel is only four kilometers from the city center.  Some tourists use public transport, while others prefer taxis.  In any case, they positively evaluate the location of Grand Blue Sky 4 *. </p><p>  The Grand Blue Sky in Kusadasi (Turkey) is also convenient because it is relatively close by Turkish standards to the international airport.  It is located in the city of Izmir at a distance of approximately seventy-five kilometers from the hotel complex.  Tourists say that along perfectly smooth roads this distance was not a great test for them even after a long and tiring flight. </p><p>  The hotel is advertised as being on the first coastline.  However, vacationers from the sea will be separated by a small promenade and a steep staircase.  Adult tourists rarely complain about inconvenience, but with a small child, the stairs and the path to the sea may not be too pleasant. </p>

    <h2>  Coastal characteristic </h2><p>  If you have never been to such a resort, then the beach will make you just an indescribable impression.  Almost none of the reviews about Grand Blue Sky International 4 * (Kusadasi) can do without the characteristics of the beach area.  And this is not surprising, because before the tourists appear three hundred meters of fine sand, spread on the background of the turquoise sea.  This picture is worthy of getting on the canvases of the great masters of past centuries. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There are four rows of sun loungers on the beach, so there are always a lot of empty seats.  Although our picky compatriots write that the most convenient places are occupied after breakfast.  However, this can not be attributed to the shortcomings or shortcomings of the hotel. </p><p>  The entrance to the water is quite convenient for children, moreover, it rarely storms here.  Aegean Sea pleases with tranquility most of the day.  But those who like waves can go to the famous Ladis Beach.  It is nearby and is distinguished by the absence of a calm water surface in the morning. </p><p>  There is a small bar on the coast, where from ten in the morning you can already enjoy various drinks and snacks.  By the way, many tourists in reviews of Grand Blue Sky mention the magnificent work of bartenders.  They can easily make any cocktail for you on an individual order, which greatly bribes vacationers. </p><h2>  A few words about infrastructure </h2><p>  As you probably already understood from our previous description, The Grand Blue Sky Hotel 4 * is a rather large hotel with developed infrastructure.  There are six bars and restaurants on its territory, this provides tourists with constant access to food.  Many people write that in the hotel you can eat literally non-stop, which is very convenient for those who relax with their kids. </p><p>  Two beautiful outdoor pools are almost constantly filled with tourists from different countries.  Reviews often describe how well-groomed the area around is.  This gives the overall atmosphere some unusual touch. </p><p>  Children and adults often spend time on two water slides, but the mode of their work is not always respected, which is very frustrating for small guests. </p><p>  The reception in the main building is open around the clock, but not all employees speak Russian.  Although many speak English almost perfectly.  This is quite natural, given that most of the vacationers are locals and immigrants from Europe. </p><p>  In the main building, you can rent vehicles for moving around the resort, exchange currency or agree on the use of a safe.  Despite the fact that each room has a separate safe, many tourists prefer to use the one located at the reception. </p><p>  All guests enjoy free car parking.  This is especially important for those guests who are accustomed to freely move around the resort and do not know where to leave the rented car. </p><p>  The hotel has numerous shops and souvenir shops.  The choice of goods in them is quite wide, so if you have forgotten something important at home, you can always buy it in a hotel. </p><p>  Reviews of The Grand Blue Sky Hotel 4 * in Kusadasi allow us to draw conclusions about the good work of the tour desk.  It employs professionals who are ready to pick up an excellent tour, focusing on the interests of all family members. </p>

    <h2>  Service and Facilities </h2><p>  Of course, a four-star hotel should provide its customers with a high level of service.  Guests rarely complain about it, most of the tourists are satisfied with how they were met and cared for comfort throughout the vacation. </p><p>  Wi-Fi catches pretty well throughout the hotel complex, as many vacationers at the Grand Blue Sky Hotel 4 * noted.  Reviews about the work of the Internet are usually written by those tourists who work remotely and cannot leave work for the duration of the vacation.  Therefore, for them, this characteristic is extremely important. </p><p>  A huge number of thanks are written by Russian tourists to the spa staff.  Almost everyone who happened to fall into their skillful hands mention their professionalism.  On average, you can get into a hammam for thirty-five dollars, but they work it out in full.  Therefore, often after the first visit, vacationers purchase a subscription to massage sessions.  The director of the spa does not skimp and gives discounts on many procedures, and communication with him is a real pleasure. </p><p>  Laundry and dry cleaning services are available every day.  Guests write that the clothes are very quickly tidied up and returned most often on the same day.  If you are very busy, you will receive your things the day after you donate them. </p><p>  The hotel has 24-hour room service and there is even a VIP service that includes a fairly wide range of services.  If you are used to practicing in the gym several times a week, then you should not change your habits on vacation.  The hotel complex has an excellent gym where you can work out absolutely freely. </p><h2>  Hotel check-in and check-out </h2><p>  Reception staff check in apartments usually no earlier than two in the afternoon.  If you arrive at the hotel early in the morning, you will get the opportunity to use all the infrastructure and services before checking in.  Be prepared for the fact that you have to change the number.  Unfortunately, among a large number of apartments there are those where a safe, air conditioning or broken furniture do not work.  At the first request, the number will be changed, but this system leaves a deposit with many tourists. </p><p>  Check-out is before noon, but keep in mind that the hotel also has a late check-out.  It is necessary for those guests who fly out of Turkey in the evening.  For them, the room is extended, but at an additional cost. </p><p>  If you have special food preferences, then when booking an apartment, do not forget to inform the hotel about this.  They will clarify whether they can fulfill the request of the guests. </p><p>  Canceling a reservation made over the Internet is quite difficult.  Therefore, carefully consider your options when planning a vacation. </p>

    <h2>  Accommodation in a room with children </h2><p>  There are a lot of children of all ages at the hotel, so the administration took care of their comfortable accommodation.  Toddlers under two years old have the right to stay in cots for free. </p><p>  Children under twelve years old are accommodated in extra beds for free.  In any room, you can install another bed plus the existing ones.  However, our compatriots often write that in the standard standard, an extra bed significantly reduces the room‚Äôs space and it becomes uncomfortable to move around. </p><h2>  Conditions created for children </h2><p>  Kids enjoy spending time in the children's pool.  However, keep in mind that it is very small and designed for very small guests.  Older children there will be uninteresting, so they can be allowed into the adult pool.  Moreover, it has a different depth. </p><p>  In the evening, the child can be sent to play on the playground.  Everything is arranged there in order to keep the children busy for several hours.  Little fidgets with pleasure climb structures and swing on a swing. </p><p>  Those parents who are not afraid to leave their child with animators can bring their child to a kids club.  It is very fun here and interesting classes are selected for each age. </p><p>  The restaurant provides a children's menu with the concept of food.  It has dishes for very young guests, for them there are high chairs. </p><p>  If you want to spend the evening in a club or restaurant, and you have no one to leave the baby with, then call the nanny.  Her services are not included in the price and will need to be paid when leaving the room. </p><h2>  Entertaining activities </h2><p>  Hotel guests are not bored.  They have access to various entertainments for every taste.  Animators work in the territory day and evening, but they conduct their performances mainly in Turkish.  Sports enthusiasts have access to volleyball, football and basketball courts, and can also choose other games for themselves. </p><p>  Water sports, including diving and windsurfing, are in great demand. </p>

    <h2>  Description of rooms </h2><p>  The hotel is equipped with three hundred and twenty-five rooms.  Their area ranges from thirty to fifty square meters.  Family rooms, which are few in the hotel, boast an area of ‚Äã‚Äãone hundred squares.  Usually they have two bedrooms and a small living room. </p><p>  Each room has everything you need to relax.  Maids replenish water supplies daily, but you can always take water in the lobby.  The main pride of all apartments are balconies.  They look more like a terrace with fantastic views of the sea and mountains. </p><p>  It happens that in some rooms, guests complain about the shabby furniture and the carpet is not the first freshness, but in general the apartments are awarded with positive ratings. </p>

    <h2>  Food concept </h2><p>  Guests eat on an all-inclusive basis, they have a main restaurant and several a la carte establishments.  In Italian, fish and Mexican restaurants, guests can dine for free once during their vacation. </p><p>  In the reviews, guests very much appreciate the quality of food.  Every day on the tables there is fish, meat, vegetables and fruits.  The choice of dishes is quite large and even with the full occupancy of the hotel you will not remain hungry. </p><p>  Tourists attribute the queues to the minuses of the restaurant, but they are inevitable in the event that the hotel complex is fully populated.  Therefore, such inconvenience should be treated easier.  Many praise the cafe on the beach, you can not only refresh yourself in it, but also have lunch.  Hamburgers, pasta, pizza or other dishes are prepared for you.  Of course, the choice here is not as wide as in the main restaurant, but still quite acceptable. </p><h2>  Hotel reviews The Grand Blue Sky International Hotel: negative points </h2><p>  Without flaws, it is simply impossible to imagine a hotel complex.  Therefore, among the positive comments there are always some reviews of tourists about Grand Blue Sky (Turkey / Kusadasi), from which you can get an idea about the shortcomings of the hotel.  And although there are not many of them, we still could not tell about them in this section: </p><ul><li>  a large number of children; </li><li>  low-quality housekeeping; </li><li>  seasoned sunbeds; </li><li>  with full occupancy of the hotel in the restaurant comes across dirty dishes; </li><li>  the abundance of Iranians, Turks and Europeans. </li></ul>
