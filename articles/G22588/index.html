  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The drug "Potassium bromide": indications and warnings</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Means "Potassium bromide" - a therapeutic <span>sedative drug</span> designed to intensify the inhibition processes that occur in the cerebral cortex.  The international name of the drug is Potassium bromide.  But it is formed by the name of the therapeutic substance - Potassium bromide. </p><p>  The drug balances the excitation and inhibition in the brain, has some <span>sedative effect</span> during epileptic seizures.  The effect of the drug on the body depends on the personal perception of the substance, the characteristics of the nervous system, its type.  That is why the drug "Potassium bromide" can not be bought without a prescription: the doctor must choose the dosage for a particular patient. </p><p>  The medicine is available in solutions or tablets, which are recommended to be taken some time before meals.  Usually, adults are prescribed up to four grams per day at regular intervals, and for children - from 0.05 g for infants to half a gram for adolescents.  When choosing a dosage, the doctor should focus not only on the state of the patient‚Äôs nervous system, but also on his well-being and even weight. </p><p>  With an overdose of the drug, fatal effects do not occur, but so-called "bromism" may occur.  This condition is characterized by the appearance of cough, rhinitis, rash.  With a strong overdose, severe inhibition, a sharp slowdown in thought processes, drowsiness and lethargy are possible. </p><p>  However, sometimes side effects occur without an overdose.  In some patients, allergic manifestations are possible: itching, stomach pain, diarrhea. </p><p>  To get rid of unwanted side effects, just stop taking the medicine.  The doctor should be informed about the occurrence of cough or other side effects. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Patients taking and doctors prescribing the drug "Potassium bromide" should remember that parenteral administration is unacceptable.  Subcutaneous or intravenous injections contribute to the inhibition of K + molecules of the heart muscle.  Therefore, the drug is taken only by mouth. </p><p>  The medicine "Potassium bromide" irritates the mucous membranes, so during the course of treatment it is necessary to rinse your mouth regularly, brush your teeth more often than usual, take a bath.  It is also important to monitor systematic bowel movements. </p><p>  There are some types of drugs that are incompatible with potassium bromide.  For example, it can not be used simultaneously with ophthalmic yellow ointment.  Mercury may form on the mucous membrane of the eye. </p><p>  With caution, you need to combine taking potassium bromide and barbiturates: the drug enhances the effect of the latter. </p><p>  It is worth limiting the amount of salt in food at the time of treatment. </p><p>  <strong>Who is this drug recommended for?</strong> </p><p>  People suffering from neurosis, neurasthenia or hysteria.  It helps with the initial degree of insomnia, irritable conditions, primary <span>forms of hypertension.</span>  Often, the drug is prescribed as part of the complex treatment of chorea and epilepsy. </p><p>  The drug is not always prescribed in a "pure" form.  Sometimes it acts more efficiently in combination, so some patients are advised to take a medicine called Adonis Brom.  This drug enhances the sedative effect of potassium bromide, has a noticeable diastolic effect, and normalizes the tone of the <span>vagus nerve.</span> </p><p>  Reception of potassium bromide in the complex in other substances helps to get rid of <span>vegetative dystonia,</span> anxiety, reduce the number and strength of panic attacks. </p><p>  The drug is contraindicated in patients with bradycardia, allergies, suffering from angina pectoris or Adams-Stokes-Morgani syndrome, in which syncope often occurs, provoked by a sharp cardiac output and <span>cerebral ischemia.</span>  Potassium bromide should not be taken by people with personal intolerance to bromine. </p>
