Tombs of Egyptian nobles and officials</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the oldest civilizations on the planet is Egypt.  The rich historical and cultural heritage has been sealed for centuries.  Great pyramids and sphinxes, mysterious sarcophagi and mummies, an amazing river and the state built on it, occupy the minds of thousands of scientists and archaeologists.  Egypt has always been a state with the absolute power of a ruler, with full faith in its divine origin.  And society for millennia has maintained a strict class structure. </p><h2>  What classes existed in ancient Egypt? </h2><p>  In ancient Egypt there was a clear estate division of the entire population.  The society was structured like a pyramid, at the top were gods such as Ra, Osiris, Isis.  The Egyptians believed in them, considered their power undeniable, made sacrifices, prayed for a good harvest.  Immediately after them was located the pharaoh - God in the guise of man, in his hands was concentrated <span>absolute power.</span>  The second place in importance in society was occupied by viziers, assistants to the ruler, they were almost the only ones who were educated in literacy, knew how to read and write.  The next step is occupied by priests and nobles. </p>

    <p>  Below are scribes and soldiers.  A separate layer of society were artisans.  And at the very bottom of the conditional pyramid of society were those who cultivated the land, and slaves. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The place of the nobleman in ancient Egypt </h2><p>  The estate of the nobles was very significant.  It was the pharaohs and nobles of ancient Egypt who built and richly equipped their pyramids and tombs.  According to them, to this day, many historians and archaeologists study the history, culture and customs of <span>ancient civilization.</span>  The status of the nobleman was inherited.  They held important government posts in various fields: construction, agriculture, medicine, law.  For which they received a significant monetary reward from the pharaoh.  Of the families of nobles often chose a new ruler and created royal dynasties.  Nobles in ancient Egypt led certain regions of the country - nomes, that is, they were governors of the pharaoh on the ground.  Therefore, there their social significance was much higher than that of the central government, where the viziers gradually took precedence. </p><h2>  The life of the Egyptian nobility </h2>

    <p>  Nobles lived in stone houses, which were built like a fence around a courtyard, where the sun did not fall.  The dwelling had rich interior decoration, it was abundantly covered with carpets, the house had ebony chests, and interior items made of copper and gold.  Wealthy nobles already at that time had wooden beds with a frame of palm branches and a kind of mattress.  Nobles in ancient Egypt, their status in society, of course, emphasized appearance.  Luxurious white clothes were adorned with rich jewelry, first of all, these were peculiar collars that were abundantly inlaid with precious stones.  Hands and wrists of the nobles covered a lot of gold bracelets and rings.  Long wigs of black sheep wool or human hair were traditionally worn on the head.  To emphasize their high <span>social status, they</span> wore a hat with a striped pattern or embroidery.  The nobles spent their free time hunting and fishing. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Tombs of Egyptian nobles and officials </h2><p>  Only the pharaoh himself could bestow the right to have his tomb, so all the nobles and officials tried to fulfill their duties in full and most effectively.  The Egyptians believed that the tomb is the home of man after his death.  The central place in it was occupied by a statue (sarcophagus) with mummified remains.  It was most often located in the western part of the tomb in a special niche. </p>

    <p>  The interior decoration included numerous images of a buried person: solitary or most often surrounded by his family.  Also depicted are episodes from the <span>life of a nobleman in ancient Egypt.</span>  Pictures and bas-reliefs tell about the life, customs and culture of the people.  The image of the travel of the master of the tomb to the afterlife is extremely common after death.  Tombs, as a rule, tried to build closer to the pyramid, in which the pharaoh was buried.  The higher the position of a <span>noble person,</span> the greater the likelihood that he will be allowed to be buried next to the ruler. </p>

    <p>  Near the pyramids of Giza, you can see numerous tombs, where the most senior officials and nobles in ancient Egypt are buried.  The photo clearly demonstrates that there were a lot of them, but the place had to be earned.  Tombs of the nobles are located to the left of the pyramid. </p><h2>  Una: a nobleman of ancient Egypt </h2><p>  There is little reliable historical information about ancient Egypt, but nevertheless they are.  Una is a nobleman, a historical figure who has left his mark on history.  At the court of the pharaoh, he began his service with a position similar to the modern forester.  Then he became a judge and at the same time made a quite successful military career.  Further <span>professional growth</span> brought him to the highest echelons of power, he became the ruler of Upper Egypt.  He kept his amazing ‚Äúautobiography‚Äù on the walls of the tomb, in which he was buried. </p>

    <p>  There was practically no social mobility and mobility in ancient Egypt.  Poor farmers could save some money and send their children to learn to read and write to temples.  It is extremely rare that they become scribes or soldiers.  But most often a person was born, lived and died within the framework of his estate. </p>
