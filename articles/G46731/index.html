  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is the best phone</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Now it‚Äôs hard to imagine a modern person who does not have a mobile phone.  Moreover, this industry has stepped forward so far that, along with a communication device, we have a first-class mini computer that fits easily in your pocket.  Previously, we could only dream of such a good for humanity, but now all these dreams have become a real reality.  Moreover, we visit the salons of mobile phones with the same frequency with which we visit, for example, clothing stores.  But with such a rapid development in the production of mobile phones, a new problem has arisen, which is not so insignificant as it might seem at first glance.  It's about which is the best phone? </p><p>  Naturally, this evaluation criterion applies not only to the plant or country of manufacture, but also to the availability of various additional functions, or as they are now commonly called gadgets.  And these gadgets can be a huge number, ranging from simple organizers, which were equipped with the first mobile phones and ending with various online maps and navigators.  According to many experts, the best phone in the world is a phone that always rings and never fails its owner.  That is, the phone should remain, first of all, the phone, and only then the camera, video camera, memory card, game console, navigator, etc. </p><p>  In addition to the fact that the phone must be reliable, it must also have a sufficiently powerful <span>battery</span> so that you can always use your pet.  The best phone always leaves only the best memories of it.  Remember the first mobile phones that you had.  Many of you will smile, remembering black and white screens and primitive polyphony, but, nevertheless, at that time there were always leaders among them.  Such leaders include the world-famous company Nokia, which has been rightfully considered the world leader in the production of high-quality and reliable phones for several years.  For example, the Nokia C7 mobile phone is perfect for almost any person.  But from the point of view of modern technologies and gadgets, there are no equal phones that are made in Japan and China. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now it‚Äôs hard enough to answer the question which brand of phone is better, since each brand and model has many advantages and some disadvantages.  For example, it‚Äôs hard to compare the Apple iPhone 4 and Samsung GT-S8500 Wave.  Of course, the more expensive the phone, the better and more reliable it is, but there are also a lot of interesting offers among budget options.  Moreover, in the world new models appear almost every week, therefore, to determine the best phone, we will not succeed even theoretically, since it is impossible to track and test all the new items.  And trusting banal user reviews is simply stupid, as the manufacturers of these mobile phones themselves hire such people to promote their products. </p><p>  Unfortunately, domestic phone manufacturers cannot boast of achievements in this industry, since in our country this industry, as it were to put it mildly, is poorly developed.  But do not despair, as foreign manufacturers think not only about their consumers, but also about the consumers of those countries with which they have concluded trade agreements.  To date, all mobile phones imported from abroad are fully Russified and standardized, as well as entered into a single database.  Therefore, you will have to determine which is the best phone yourself, because only you know which criteria are important to you and which are not very important.  Only you yourself can give an adequate assessment of a particular phone model, based on your own considerations.  In any case, do not forget that the mobile phone should be, first of all, a telephone, and only then a friend or an assistant. </p>
