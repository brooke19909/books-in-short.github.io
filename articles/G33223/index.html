However, despite the fact that Rainbow loom stores have enough to create jewelry, some needlewomen do not even know what to do with them, and whether they need any special tools, or you can braid a bracelet.  And here you can please them - everything you need to create such an ornament will certainly be found in every home.  Of course, you can buy a special set, but for a start one ordinary metal hook will be enough. </p>

    <h2>  The easiest way to weave a bracelet out of <span>rubber bands with a hook: getting</span> started </h2><p>  If you do not have a special machine for weaving, and in general you first heard about rubber bracelets and decided to make such a jewelry for yourself or your loved ones, then you will definitely like this way of creating it.  To work, you will need to prepare a Rainbow loom and a hook. </p>

It is necessary to take one element and, pulling it on two fingers, turn it with an eight, fold it in half and put it on the hook.  After this, you need to take another gum and, hooking it with a working tool, stretch it through the existing loops.  This will be the first link of the future bracelet.  Next, to the rubber band folded by eight, you need to attach a special plastic clasp in the shape of the English letter S, and you can continue to work.  Now the two loops obtained by threading Rainbow loom through the first element of the bracelet must be thrown onto the hook and the next elastic band should be passed through them.

After that, the extreme loops will need to be attached to the other side of the clip fastener.  The amount of gum needed for manufacturing depends on the width of the wrist of the person who will wear this product.  So, to create an ornament on a children's pen, 20 elements will be sufficient, while an adult will need a little more.  Such woven crochet bracelets from rubber bands will surely take pride of place among the adornments of every fashionista. </p><h2>  Creating an original bracelet on a hook: features of work </h2><p>  In order to braid a bracelet, it is best to use elastic bands of two colors (for example, brown and yellow).  First you need to take one brown gum and wind it on the working tool in two turns.  Next, you need to take two yellow parts, fold them together and, hooking, throw on them both loops that are present on the instrument.  Then the second side of these two elements must also be thrown onto the hook.  The result is a yellow loop, consisting of two elastic bands, through which another one, but already brown, passes.  At this stage, it is important to pay attention so that one of the two elements present on the hook is external, and the second is internal.  That is, the gum should form one loop, the sides of which are on the left and right edges of the working tool, and the second should be located between them.  It is important that these elements are not confused, that is, one elastic band should not simultaneously create the inner and outer sides, otherwise it will be very difficult to weave the bracelet with a hook. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Making the first link of the original bracelet </h2><p>  Next, you need to take another yellow element and, having hooked on the working tool, pass through the loops on it.  Thus, one side of the gum will turn out on the hook, in the middle the previously woven elements will be hooked on it, and the other end will hang freely.  It should also be thrown over the working tool.  Next, you need to take another brown Rainbow loom and throw yellow loops on it.  In this case, the second end of the element should be held so far with your hand, without throwing on a working tool.  Next, you need to turn the bracelet in such a way as to look at it from above, and get inside the two outer elastic bands (on the left and right sides), which were discussed above.  After these actions, the second part of the brown element, which is still held by hand, should be thrown onto the hook.  As a result, two yellow loops in the center and two brown loops at the edges will be present on the working tool.  But this does not end the information on how to weave bracelets out of rubber bands. </p><p>  After that, it is necessary to hook another element on the hook tip and pull it through the existing four loops.  Moreover, the second end of the gum should again be held by hand.  Using a hook, it is necessary to pull out two internal loops, which were discussed above, from the inside of the product.  To do this, you need to push all the above elements.  Now you can put on the hook the second side of the brown gum, which until this time was held by hand.  As a result, the working tool will have 2 yellow loops inside and two brown loops on the sides.  Thus, one link will be obtained, without which a crochet bracelet cannot be made. </p>

    <h2>  Continuation of weaving bracelet </h2><p>  Then again you need to take a pair of yellow rubber bands, fold them together and stretch through all the available elements, and fasten the second side to the hook.  And from this moment you should repeat all the steps that were done at the previous stage after a couple of yellow elements were inserted in the first loops, and you only figured out how to weave bracelets out of rubber bands with a hook.  It is important to remember the correct location of the external and internal elastic bands, otherwise the finished product may not look quite neat or may randomly unwind.  The sequences described above can be woven as much as necessary for the length of the bracelet. </p>

    <h2>  Shutdown </h2><p>  After the required number of links is reached, you will need to complete the work.  This should be done as follows: pass one elastic band through the loops on the hook and fasten the clip to the two parts that have turned out.  Two loops of the opposite end of the bracelet, from which weaving once began, should be attached to the other side of the clasp.  You can decorate your wrist with a finished bracelet or give it to a loved one.  And you can also share information with your friend about how to weave bracelets crocheted. </p>
