    <h2>  The practical side of things </h2><p>  <span>At the second stage of the work - field work - surveyors conduct reconnaissance of the area.</span>  <span>This is a rather complicated process, because often the real conditions can differ significantly from those specified in the documents.</span>  <span>The most important procedure of this stage is called topographic survey.</span>  <span>It belongs to the most famous and sought-after varieties of engineering research and is carried out on different scales - from 1: 500 to 1: 5000.</span> </p><p>  <span>According to the results of its surveyors are able to draw up a topographic plan.</span>  <span>Modern events in the field are accompanied by the use of the latest technical means in the form of electronic and optical theodolites, laser levels, etc. Their use not only facilitates the hard work of surveyors, but also increases the accuracy of measurements by an order of magnitude.</span> </p><h2>  What does the plan contain </h2><p>  <span>On the compiled topographic plan should be displayed any elements of the terrain, which include buildings, and elevations, and large objects of vegetation.</span>  <span>Without fail, all available <span>underground utilities,</span> such as pipelines or electric cables, should be recorded.</span>  <span>If this point is not given enough attention, the consequences can be very serious.</span>  <span>That is why the preparation of a topographic plan is the task of a highly qualified specialist.</span> </p>
