The main thing is to get your hand on creating the main parts - pompons.  There are several ways to wind them. </p><p>  Here's the first one: to make a pompom, you will need to cut two thick rings from cardboard.  The larger the ring in diameter, the more magnificent the future pompom will be.  But do not overdo it, you can focus on the bottom of a wide glass.  The matter is small, connect the two rings and wind the yarn from the center on them.  Spread the threads evenly around the ring.  When finished, pushing the scissors between the cardboards, cut the wound.  But do not rush to remove the cardboard boxes, slightly spread them aside and tightly tie a piece of thread between them. </p><p>  After removing the cardboard base, give the pompom a perfect round look and take on the second. </p><p>  For convenience, you can cut the rings, but hold the threads so that they do not slip. </p><p>  The second method will require a plug.  It will turn out only small pompons.  In the middle, between the third and fourth cloves, leave a long piece of yarn, which will fix the center of the pompom.  Wrap the yarn over the cloves of the fork with a thick layer.  Leave the yarn left around the center of the wound threads and tightly knit.  Cut the threads and give them the desired shape. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For the third method, you can use a toilet paper sleeve or half-folded cardboard.
