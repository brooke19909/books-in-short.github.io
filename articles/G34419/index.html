According to the current legislation, each driver is required to draw up an insurance policy on his vehicle.  Without it, you can‚Äôt even leave the garage by car, and if you are stopped by a traffic police officer, you won‚Äôt be able to avoid the fine.  However, it often happens that several people are allowed to operate the machine, but only the vehicle owner is included in the policy.  Here, many motorists have a completely logical question of what will happen if the driver is not included in the insurance.  Let's look into this in more detail and find out what kind of monetary penalty will need to be paid and if there are any ways to avoid it. </p><h2>  The main legal aspects </h2><div class="photo" data-original="cars.usnews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fine if not included in insurance" class="if uuid-2950939" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2950939.jpg"></div><p>  Before you talk about what will happen if the owner or other person for whom the general power of attorney is not included in the insurance, you must first understand the main legal aspects.  An insurance policy is not just a guarantee of payment of monetary compensation in the event of an accident.  Today, it is equal in importance to a driver‚Äôs license and is among the documents allowing to drive a vehicle.  Therefore, if the machine will be used by other family members or relatives, then they must be included in the policy.  It is important to understand that there are two types of insurance: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  with restriction; </li><li>  without limitation. </li></ul><p>  Each of them has certain features that you need to have at least the slightest idea about, so each type of policy should be discussed in more detail. </p><h2>  Limited insurance policy </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.telacare.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="persons insured" class="if uuid-2950951" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2950951.jpg"></div><p>  Let's look at this aspect in more detail.  The answer to the question of what will happen if the driver is not included in the insurance, it is necessary to start by considering this particular type of policy, since it is one of the most common.  This insurance service is suitable for those car owners who clearly know who will use the vehicle.  When concluding an agreement with the UK, all persons who will have the right to drive a car immediately enter the policy.  However, it is very important to make sure that the information about each person is correct. </p><p>  This type of policy is cheaper, but it has one significant drawback.  If the person behind the wheel is not included in the insurance, then he has a great risk of being fined if the traffic police inspector stops and documents are checked.  In addition, in the event of a car accident, even if another person is the culprit, all the costs of repairing the vehicle will be borne by the driver who drives the car without insurance.  Therefore, all these subtleties should be thought out in advance, so that later you do not have to regret very much. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Unlimited insurance policy </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.policybazaar.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="driving is not insured" class="if uuid-2950955" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2950955.jpg"></div><p>  What is he like?  As you already know, only persons inscribed in insurance are entitled to drive a car.  However, if you do not know in advance who and when can get behind the wheel of your vehicle (for example, you have a company that employs a huge number of people and has official transport), then in this case there is an excellent way out of the situation.  It is about issuing an insurance policy without restriction.  Its name speaks for itself.  This document is drawn up by the car owner, but an unlimited number of people are allowed to operate it.  The only minus of this product is its too high cost. </p><h2>  What penalties apply for driving without an insurance policy </h2><div class="photo" data-original="thegarage.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what penalty if not included in the insurance" class="if uuid-2950963" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2950963.jpg"></div><p>  This aspect is worth exploring in the first place.  If the driver does not have valid insurance, driving is prohibited.  What will happen if you were stopped by the traffic police inspector, and you don‚Äôt have liability insurance with you or your data is not indicated in the document? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  As mentioned earlier, for such a misconduct is expected to pay a monetary penalty.  Such a violation is not considered serious, so nothing bad will happen.  No one will take your driver‚Äôs license and confiscate the car, which in itself is not bad. </p><p>  However, many are interested in the question: if not included in the insurance, what will be the fine?  By current standards, its size is relatively small.  You will need to pay only 500 rubles.  But here is another matter if you have an accident.  In this case, it does not matter for what reason it occurred, since all expenses will automatically fall on you. </p><h2>  What happens if the driver is not enrolled in the policy, but the owner sits nearby </h2><p>  This situation is more serious.  Each traffic police officer will tell you that if the driver is not included in the insurance, driving is prohibited.  And the fact that the owner of the vehicle in whose name the policy is drawn rides nearby in the passenger seat does not change anything.  Moreover, this is considered a more serious misconduct, so the punishment for it will be tougher. </p><p>  In this case, the protocol will be drawn up on both, and each will pay 500 rubles as a fine.  However, if you know the law well and be able to understand all its aspects, then punishment can be avoided.  You will learn more about how not to pay a fine if the owner of the car or the person who controls it instead is not included in the insurance. </p><h2>  The best way out </h2><p>  If you do not want to have problems with the law, it is recommended that all people who might need to use the car someday need to be included in the car insurance.  To do this, you must first send a written notice to the UK that issued the policy of your intention to expand the circle of people who are allowed to manage the vehicle. </p><p>  In this case, the request acts as the basis for amending the terms of the insurance contract.  It is worth noting that most large organizations that have long been working on the market and valuing their customers reissue the policy for free, but there are also situations when you need to pay for a new document. </p><h2>  Can a power of attorney act as a substitute for insurance? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.wheels24.co.za" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the owner is not insured" class="if uuid-2950947" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2950947.jpg"></div><p>  There are many opinions about the MTPL policy, the majority of which are erroneous.  For example, many drivers think that if they have a <span>power of attorney for a vehicle,</span> then they can move without problems without insurance.  Undoubtedly, in the event of an accident, she will cover the cost of repairs if it happened through the fault of another person, but the driver will not be affected by the policy.  But do not forget about the legislation, which states that to control the machine you must have the following documents with you: </p><ul><li>  driver's license; </li><li>  STS; </li><li>  insurance policy. </li></ul><p>  This package is required, and it is one for all.  As for the power of attorney, if the driver is included in the insurance, its registration is not required.  The following cases are exceptions: </p><ul><li>  vehicle sale; </li><li>  travel abroad; </li><li>  statement or removal of the car from the register; </li><li>  passing MOT. </li></ul><p>  Any situation involving the commission of an action with a means of transportation requires a general power of attorney, so this should not be forgotten. </p><h2>  How to avoid a fine? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.generalinsurance.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="insurance penalty" class="if uuid-2950959" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2950959.jpg"></div><p>  Let's dwell on this in more detail.  Probably one of the most common questions that haunt any motorist is the following: how to get away from punishment if a relative or owner is not included in the insurance?  And this is not surprising, because despite the fact that 500 rubles these days is not such a large amount, nobody wants to part with them.  At the same time, there are situations when the owner of the vehicle wants to do everything according to the law, but he simply does not have time to send a request to the insurance company in a timely manner.  How to be in this case?  Very simple. </p><p>  There is one win-win option that will allow you to avoid a fine.  It is based on the conclusion of a contract for gratuitous use, which is a kind of alternative to a purchase / sale transaction.  It provides an opportunity to move freely by car for 10 days from the moment of conclusion using a valid insurance policy without reissuing documents.  In this case, the traffic police inspectors will not have any questions about why OSAGO is issued for one person, and it sits completely different behind the wheel of a car.  This is an excellent option for transferring a vehicle for temporary use with minimal paperwork and associated problems. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.rac.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="insure car insurance" class="if uuid-2950941" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2950941.jpg"></div><p>  You have received an exhaustive answer to the question of what will happen if the driver driving the car is not included in the insurance.  You also learned how to avoid a fine and to legally move around in a vehicle.  However, each person must really assess the possible consequences of this. </p><p>  As practice shows, every year the number of accidents is constantly increasing, and the cost of car repair is constantly growing.  If your trustee suddenly damages or crashes the car, then repairing it will cost much more than re-issuing insurance or entering other persons into it.  Therefore, this kind of saving is far from always justified.  It is best to issue a CTP policy on yourself and all family members and calmly use your car. </p>
