    <p>  Increasing interest in travel agencies has been noted for Tanzania.  This African country attracts tourists with its originality, magnificent beaches, amazing turquoise ocean and unusual excursion programs.  A significant disadvantage of such permits is the fact that the classification of local hotels often does not coincide with the European accepted throughout the world.  Based on this, a hotel complex, which is awarded three stars, can be much better and richer than a five-star hotel.  However, this does not always happen, and sometimes three stars mean a budget complex with a minimum of services.  In addition, there are not so many real reviews about Tanzania hotels on the Internet, which also causes certain difficulties. </p><p>  If you are also thinking about spending your holidays in a similar place, we suggest you stay at Amaan Bungalows Nungwi.  Traveler reviews of this hotel characterize it as a pleasant place to experience local traditions and cuisine.  As you probably already guessed, our article is devoted to rest in this hotel complex.  Welcome to Amaan Bungalows Nungwi! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  General description of the hotel </h2><p>  Amaan Bungalows Nungwi 3 * refers to mini-hotels, the number of rooms in which does not exceed eighty rooms.  Therefore, when you come here, you can not worry about the fact that there will be a huge number of other vacationers disturbing your peace. </p><p>  The hotel is built on the coast and many balconies literally hang over the water, revealing magnificent views of the coral reefs.  The hotel territory is surrounded by greenery, tourists enthusiastically describe the lush bushes, exotic flowers and trees that make the complex literally in the <span>Garden of Eden.</span> </p><p>  Amid this beauty, it is somehow difficult to focus on the small territory of Amaan Bungalows Nungwi 3 * hotel.  In addition, its area satisfies all the requirements for a three-star hotel complex.  Therefore, it is quite comfortable for all categories of tourists. </p><p>  Amaan Bungalows Nungwi 3 * building is a low-rise building that fits perfectly with the surrounding beauty. </p><h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  The Amaan Bungalows Hotel is located in Tanzania's Zanzibar Nungwi.  This small and calm village is built on the north coast of the island.  She can not boast of anything remarkable, but tourists say that it is very pleasant to relax here, thanks to the cordiality and kindness of local residents. </p><p>  The hotel complex has a very convenient location in relation to cafes, restaurants and markets.  Often, tourists write in their reviews that the prices in shops and on spontaneous trading floors are quite reasonable.  At the same time, for the asking price, you can become the owner of truly unique and high-quality things. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A clear minus of Amaan Bungalows Nungwi can be considered the fact that it is located at a sufficient distance from Kisauni Airport.  From it to the hotel will have to overcome more than fifty kilometers.  Therefore, do not recklessly go on vacation with young children.  It will be quite difficult for them to endure a difficult and long journey.  In addition, tourism in Tanzania is under development, and medical care even under insurance leaves much to be desired. </p>

On its territory there is a pier with sunbeds, a small number of sun loungers are set in the sand.  You can enjoy refreshing drinks at the coastal bar, but keep in mind that freshly squeezed juices and local alcohol can be considered the most delicious.  It is of good quality, but you should not order cocktails from it at the bar.  Since most of the Tanzanians profess Islam, they do not drink alcohol-containing drinks and rather unsuccessfully mixes them together. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Amaan Bungalows Nungwi 3 * (Zanzibar), judging by the reviews, has not too luxurious infrastructure, but tourists will be provided with everything necessary for a good stay. </p><p>  The hotel complex is made in the Tanzanian style, which shines literally in every piece of furniture.

    <h2>  Hotel check-in rules </h2><p>  We‚Äôll clarify right away that you can officially check into a room from one in the afternoon.  However, in reality, this time can move by an hour, two, or even three.  Often, hotel employees prepare apartments for a class lower than stated.  And only after the indignation of tourists populate them in reserved rooms. </p><p>  You can only leave between ten in the morning and ten thirty.  At this time, an extract from the hotel and settlement of bills for additional services. </p><p>  Please note that pets are not allowed in the hotel. </p><h2>  Hotel accommodation with children </h2><p>  Of course, our compatriots do not often go to Tanzania with their children.  However, if you plan such an adventure, then know that you will be happy to be accommodated in a hotel room with a child of any age. </p><p>  Children under four years old can stay with their parents for free.  They are provided with cots.  For children up to twelve years old, hotel staff will put an extra bed in the room.  Twenty-five dollars a night must be paid for it. </p><p>  Only one bed can be installed in the apartment, otherwise the room will be very crowded and uncomfortable. </p>

    <h2>  Catering </h2><p>  Tours to the hotel complex are sold only with breakfast included in the price.  This is enough for most tourists, because they mostly dine with fruits, and go to local restaurants for dinner on the coast. </p><p>  If you want to dine on site, you will be offered local and European dishes, as well as a wide selection of seafood. </p><p>  Breakfast is served in buffet style.  They begin at half past seven in the morning and end at ten in the morning.  Many guests note that most of the guests come to the restaurant to the opening itself, so there are very few empty seats at this time.  However, after half an hour or an hour the influx of visitors subsides, and the dishes are updated. </p><p>  Some of our compatriots come to the beginning of breakfast for coffee, and then go to the pool.  And after an hour they return and begin to eat. </p><p>  The choice of dishes is quite standard for any treshka.  Guests will be offered fried eggs, scrambled eggs, hot pancakes, stewed vegetables and potatoes, sausages and various gravy with meat.  Also available is always a wide selection of fruits, biscuits, several types of pastries, cereals, milk, coffee and tea. </p><p>  In general, such an assortment is enough to not remain hungry.  In addition, all dishes are very tasty and satisfying, so tourists generally praise the local cuisine. </p><p>  Music is played in the bar in the evenings, and guests can enjoy fresh drinks and cocktails.  The terrace offers gorgeous views of the Indian Ocean. </p>

    <h2>  Brief description of the number of rooms </h2><p>  Almost all apartments in the hotel are ascetic.  They are furnished with a minimum of furniture and many guests lack nightstands, cabinets and chairs.  There are fifty-two rooms in the hotel, which are divided into three categories: </p><ul><li>  <em>Sea View Rooms.</em>  Sixteen rooms of this type are located above the water itself, they literally hang over the ocean, as they are on the beach itself.  These apartments are quite spacious and designed for one or two people. </li><li>  <em>Deluxe rooms.</em>  Seventeen rooms can accommodate three people, they are located in a certain distance from the beach area, surrounded by shady trees. </li><li>  <em>Garden view rooms.</em>  You can stay here with your family, but note that beds in nineteen rooms of this category are only single. </li></ul><p>  All rooms are made in the Zanzibar style and look very unusual.  Please note that there is a lack of a kettle in the rooms.  Therefore, you will not be able to enjoy evening tea or hot coffee on the balcony. </p><h2>  Voucher cost </h2><p>  An African trip, by definition, cannot be cheap.  A tour for ten days from Moscow will cost two tourists from one hundred twenty-eight to two hundred thousand rubles, depending on the day of departure. </p><p>  However, if you wish, you can purchase a two-week tour for about the same cost.  To do this, it is worth contacting different agencies and subscribing to the newsletter in order to monitor all changes in value in real time. </p>
