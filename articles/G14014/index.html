This is a Russian company calling itself ‚ÄúElectronic Systems Alkotel‚Äù, since 2004 producing various players, electronic ‚Äúreaders‚Äù, recorders for cars, GPS-systems and other gadgets that significantly help us in everyday life.  Since the company is primarily focused on the CIS market, its price segment can be called ‚Äúbelow average‚Äù. </p><p>  Recently (just a few years), the company began to produce <span>tablet computers.</span>  This was due to the growing popularity of such devices and their real supply wave from China.  Having inexpensive equipment and economical assembly, teXet-devices were able to compete with the ‚ÄúChinese‚Äù. </p><p>  We will talk about one of the computers in this article.  Meet the teXet TM-7025.  Read about what this gadget is and what target audience it is focused on in the first place. </p>

    <h2>  Positioning </h2><p>  Perhaps we should start with a description of the device‚Äôs concept, its characteristics against the background of other devices of the company and, in general, by its belonging to the price segment.  So, the teXet TM-7025 version is framed in a metal case, despite its low cost (only 6 thousand rubles).  A tablet based on Android 4.0.1 functions, which makes it an almost universal electronic device capable of performing the functions of a ‚Äúreader‚Äù, a gadget for surfing the net, a device for interacting with ‚Äútoys‚Äù and much more. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another interesting feature that the manufacturer mentions in the description of the gadget is the presence of a 3D screen that can qualitatively reproduce three-dimensional graphics.  What does this mean for the average user, read on. </p><h2>  Device kit </h2><p>  First of all, we look at the kit in which the device is offered to the buyer: what the standard kit includes and which of its elements will be really useful to all of us (teXet TM-7025 users).  In addition to the computer itself, it should be noted the charging adapter, headphones, a cord for connecting to a PC, as well as a connector for connecting to flash memory cards.  The latter is particularly convenient in that it allows you to simplify the process of transmitting information, making it accessible without a computer. </p>

    <p>  Many users note that they also do not quite understand the meaning of packaging a complete charger with a device and a cord for connecting to a PC.  In practice, the teXet TM-7025 could have an adapter for connecting to a network and a portable micro-USB cable, this would be much more economical and convenient. </p><p>  Another element that we came across with the tablet is a smart-cover leather case.  In its design, at least, it really strongly resembles such cases that can be found on ‚Äúapple‚Äù devices.  However, according to user reviews, although the accessory looks solidly, the tablet itself constantly falls out of it due to the insufficiently strong mounting mechanism. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Device design </h2><p>  The next point that I would like to draw attention to is the appearance of the device, its design.  True, the <span>teXet</span> TM-7025 <span>tablet</span> has a very simplified, ‚Äúclassic‚Äù design, like many 7-inch devices from Chinese manufacturers.  However, some of the simplest Samsung also have such an appearance.  The Russian company was somewhat distinguished and presented its model in a case with thickened frames.  Due to this, the device looks a little less attractive than it could.  And indeed, judging by the dimensions, we can say that the device is clearly devoid of any refinement and elegance.  Although this does not make him any less interesting. </p><p>  Quite originally, the developers approached the issue of device design.  So, they placed the tablet‚Äôs navigation elements in an interesting way, completely abandoning the generally accepted model (the audio connector on the top panel, the sound adjustment in the upper right, the power connector in the bottom).  So, absolutely all functional openings were placed on the bottom of the case, which looks somewhat strange.  The second point is the location of the screen lock button and the ‚Äúrocker‚Äù to change the sound level - these elements are installed on the right side of the case in the lower segment.  It turns out that the left side and top of the device remained empty. </p><p>  The buttons on the front of the case can be called superfluous (they completely duplicate the same system keys from Android, located just above).  The manufacturer installed the camera at all in the lower part, which forces the device to be turned over each time it wants to use video communication services. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The back cover is presented in beautiful metal, which is very pleasant to the touch and perfectly lies in the hands. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  Despite the developers' emphasis on the fact that the device‚Äôs screen has a 3D display function, in general, the display installed on the teXet TM-7025 tablet is also its weak point.  So you can say by looking at the screen resolution.  It is only 800 by 480 pixels!  This means that in conditions of a high level of illumination, all the pixels simply fade, preventing the possibility to examine in more detail what is displayed on the screen. </p>

    <p>  In addition, there is not enough sharpness of the picture, which we usually expect from touch electronic devices.  Therefore, the characteristics describing the teXet TM-7025 (in terms of display) slightly alienate it from other representatives of the segment (including inexpensive Chinese gadgets, whose screen is much better).  The pixel density here is very low: you can view the same 3D content here, but the user is of little use for this, since for him the picture will still not be sharp enough. </p><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  Drawing a parallel with how the characteristics describing the teXet TM-7025 presented the device‚Äôs screen, we can say that the ‚Äúheart‚Äù of the gadget - its processor - also has not the most impressive parameters.  To begin with, we are dealing with a processor whose clock frequency is 1 GHz. </p><p>  With a RAM of 512 MB, the system enables the user to enjoy some simple but entertaining games and play videos.  The minus of the device is that the teXet TM-7025 tablet computer will not be able to provide you with proper work with costly (in terms of graphics) toys that were oriented to more powerful devices.  Yes, and RAM, again, is greatly reduced here.  It is possible that at the beginning of operation, the tablet will work smartly, but over time, apparently, delays may begin even in the process of working with the menu and during the most simple operations.  This situation is observed with all gadgets that have a small amount of RAM. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  As noted above, the device is offered with Android OS version 4.0.1.  This is a fairly old modification, which, of course, has much less features than the modern system of the 6th generation (relevant at the time of writing).  However, given that we are talking about a cheap tablet from a Russian manufacturer, it is obvious that it will not be possible to upgrade to a more recent build here. </p>

    <p>  And in fact, many users, judging by the reviews, are interested in this.  On the Internet, many forums on electronics flash questions about how to flash teXet TM-7025.  This information may be of interest to users for various reasons: someone does not like the standard interface of the system, and someone, for example, wants to simply get rid of some error that occurred during the operation of the device. </p><p>  In fact, this happens quite often with the teXet TM-7025.  The firmware, as the reviews show, really helps to fix the problem, returns everything to the original settings.  But at the same time there is really a risk that the user will not be able to properly install the new version of the firmware, because of which he will not only lose the warranty on his device, but will not be able to work with him in the future. </p><p>  On various electronic forums and sites devoted to mobile systems, there is more detailed information on <span>how to flash the</span> teXet TM-7025 <span>tablet</span> . </p><p>  The main thing here is not so much the actions of the owner of the device, as correctly selected files with which you want to <span>flash the tablet.</span> </p><p>  For example, in the process of searching for information on this subject, we were able to find several different versions of CyanogenMode software.  It operates on the basis of the Android system, while having only a few features. </p><p>  In general, firmware is useful in many ways.  For example, on forums, users note that the tablet did not recognize coups in the ‚Äúnative‚Äù firmware.  When tilted, the device did not respond to a change in position, due to which the user would be forced to change the orientation of the screen using a special application.  Immediately after the gadget was flashed, he began to ‚Äúnotice‚Äù the coup.  There are a lot of such stories: people are satisfied with how the system has changed after its update.  Another situation is if your teXet TM-7025 does not boot.  It happens that in the event of any software failure the device refuses to function without changing its ‚Äúblack screen‚Äù on the display.  The way out of this situation is very simple: do a flashing. </p><p>  Another example is the installation of another operating system.  This, of course, for some may seem completely absurd (and wild), but judging by the reviews, some users were able to play the Windows system on their teXet TM-7025, which completely changed the device‚Äôs functionality and its capabilities.  This shows that those who are versed in portable electronics can experiment in different ways with technology, achieving different results. </p><p>  Since this is not the topic of the article in which we describe the teXet TM-7025 tablet, firmware is a somewhat secondary problem, so we will not pay so much attention to it. </p><p>  In the original version, there is a classic Android, which you could watch on older devices. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  Describing the teXet TM-7025 tablet, the characteristics of which are the subject of our review, we can also pay attention to the communication capabilities that it possesses thanks to the pre-installed modules.  Given the budget of the device, we are not talking about the ability to connect SIM cards (3G / LTE are not available here, you can use the gadget with the Internet exclusively using the Wi-Fi module), as well as about any navigation system (GPS is not here). </p>

    <p>  Probably, manufacturers did not bet on this, having made a somewhat ‚Äútruncated‚Äù (in terms of functionality) version of the tablet.  However, as the reviews describing teXet TM-7025 show, for many users what is available is enough.  Apparently, the whole point is the purpose for which such a tablet is purchased: for a child to go to school, for the simplest viewing of Internet pages, for reading books, and so on.  In all these cases, such a simple modification of the tablet computer is ideal.  Especially for such a price! </p><h2>  Applications </h2><p>  Speaking about the OS, I would also like to refer to what programs are available to the user on this device.  In addition to standard Google applications, you can mention the social network programs installed by the manufacturer, some entertainment services, tools for checking the speed of the device, programs for watching television, and more.  Obviously, the manufacturer was generously sponsored by the developers of all these programs, which was the reason for such a variety of software.  If you wish, you can remove all this by filling the space on the device with your favorite applications. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2>

    <p>  If we talk about any gadget, the most important issue remains the topic of its autonomy and speed of charge.  The hero of our review is no exception.  Given its ‚Äúbudgetary‚Äù nature, it is not surprising that not the most capacious battery is installed here - only 3100 mAh. </p><p>  For some smartphone, this volume would seem appropriate, but not for the whole tablet.  The flow rate here is also not the lowest (apparently, the screen makes itself felt), because of which, according to information from the reviews, the charge will last for no more than 4-5 hours watching movies.  As you know, this is enough, except for working with the gadget on the road between the house and work with the subsequent charging of the device. </p><p>  It would be possible to increase the ‚Äúlifespan‚Äù of the device using portable batteries, if this option is acceptable for you.  However, another point is that a more or less decent power bank with a suitable capacity will cost as much as half of our tablet.  Perhaps, in this case, it is more expedient to simply put this money together and choose a more expensive device. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Since the gadget is offered at a very affordable price, there is nothing surprising in the large number of reviews left about it on a variety of resources.  We turned to such recommendations in order to understand what the user likes or does not like in his device.  Let's start with the positive points. </p><p>  First of all, everyone praises the price of the device.  Each user positively notes the cost of the device, its availability and writes that the tablet ‚Äúfulfills‚Äù its price very well.  In some networks, its cost is 5-6 thousand rubles, which is why the device is very attractive to a very wide audience of customers.  The second reason to praise the model is its design.  As user recommendations show, the gadget has an attractive exterior and a touch-friendly case made of metal.  Due to this, the device seems even more impressive, in addition, it has reliable protection against falls and bumps.  People like how the materials are arranged and this tablet is designed.  Quite often they turn to the rich configuration of a mini-computer, praise its equipment with various accessories.  In addition, many mention the ability to directly exchange information with PCs and flash cards, which also simplifies interaction with the gadget.  As a rule, users don‚Äôt have any problems with how to connect USB to teXet TM-7025: just connect the device physically via a cord and the connection is ready! </p>

    <p>  Of course, customer reviews also mention disadvantages quite often.  Perhaps finding them is even easier than the positive qualities of the gadget, because in terms of its technical parameters, the tablet is far from the flagship.  The ‚Äúweaknesses" of teXet include a camera that is not powerful enough, which will not work with high-quality images;  quiet speaker, high power consumption, which significantly reduces the duration of the device.  Also, speaking about the shortcomings of the model, users often mention a weak screen (which has a very small resolution), as well as an insufficiently fast sensor that can ‚Äúskip‚Äù your touches and not respond to them properly. </p><p>  So, disassembling the teXet TM-7025 into ‚Äúpros‚Äù and ‚Äúcons‚Äù is, of course, good.

Even the equipment of the device shows the fact that the manufacturer is trying in every way to ‚Äúplease‚Äù the client, to make the gadget more attractive to him.  As we see in practice, such a strategy works. </p><p>  Indeed, all the disadvantages of the device are ‚Äúsmoothed out" due to the low cost and good configuration.  Plus, do not forget about the attractive design and good communication of the tablet with a computer and flash cards: together all this characterizes the device on the positive side, definitely giving it a high rating. </p><p>  Can I recommend this model to my friends?
