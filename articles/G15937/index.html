    <p>  Studying land development by man, Grade 7 of a secondary school.  This knowledge is very important and helps to better understand the history of civilization. </p><h2>  How did man develop the earth? </h2><p>  The first stage of resettlement, during which ancient erect people began to migrate from East Africa to Eurasia and develop new lands, began about 2 million years ago and ended 500,000 years ago.  Later, ancient people die out, and with the advent of a reasonable person in Africa 200,000 years ago, the second stage began. </p><p>  The main resettlement of people was observed along the mouth of large rivers - the Tigris, Indus, Euphrates, Nile.  It was in these places that the first civilizations arose, which were called river ones. </p><p>  Our ancestors chose such sites in order to break up settlements that would later become centers of states.  Their life was subject to a clear natural regime.  In the spring the rivers flowed, and then, when they dried up, fertile moist soil remained at this place, ideal for sowing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Resettlement </h2><p>  The vast majority of historians and archaeologists consider Africa and Southwestern Eurasia to be the birthplace of the <span>first people</span> .  Over time, mankind has mastered almost all the continents, with the exception of Antarctica.  Where the <span>Bering Strait</span> is now located <span>,</span> 30 thousand years ago there was land that connected Eurasia and North America.  It was on this bridge that people penetrated into more and more new places.  So, hunters from Eurasia, passing through North America, were in its southern part.  Man came to Australia from Southeast Asia.  Scientists were able to draw such conclusions based on the results of excavations. </p><h2>  Main areas of resettlement </h2><p>  When considering how land was developed by man, it will be interesting to know how people chose places to live.  Very often, entire settlements left the familiar corner and set off for the unknown to find the best conditions.  The mastered new lands have allowed the development of livestock and agriculture.  The <span>population of the planet</span> also increased very rapidly <span>.</span>  If 15,000 years ago about 3,000,000 people lived on Earth, now this figure exceeds 6 billion.  The vast majority of people live in flat areas.  It is convenient to divide fields into them, build factories and plants, equip settlements. </p><p>  On the <span>globe</span> , four areas can be distinguished where people are most densely populated.  These are <span>Western Europe,</span> South and East Asia, East North America.  There are reasons for this: favorable natural factors, prescription of settlement and developed economy.  For example, in Asia, the population is still actively sowing and irrigating the soil.  The favorable climate allows you to collect several crops a year to feed a large family. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  In Western Europe and North America, urban settlement prevails.  The infrastructure is very developed here, many modern factories and factories have been built, industry prevails over agriculture. </p><h2>  Types of economic activity </h2><p>  Economic activity affects the environment and changes it.  Moreover, various industries affect nature in different ways. </p><p>  So, agriculture was the root cause of the reduction of the planet, on which natural conditions remained.  More and more space was needed for fields and pastures, forests were cut down, animals were losing their homes.  Due to the constant load, the soil partially loses its fertile qualities.  Artificial irrigation allows you to get a good crop, but this method has its drawbacks.  So, in arid areas, over-abundant watering of the land can lead to salinization and lower yield.  Pets trample vegetation and compact the soil cover.  Often in arid climates, pastures turn into desert. </p>

    <p>  Particularly harmful to the environment is the rapid growth of industry.  Solid and liquid substances penetrate the soil and water, while gaseous substances are released into the air.  The rapid growth of cities necessitates the development of new territories in which vegetation is being destroyed.  Environmental pollution adversely affects people's health. </p>

    <h2>  Human development of the Earth: countries of the world </h2><p>  People who live in the same territory, have a common language and one culture, form an ethnic group.  It can consist of a nation, tribe, people.  In the past, great ethnic groups created entire civilizations. </p><p>  Currently, there are more than 200 states on the planet.  They all differ from each other.  There are states that occupy the whole mainland (Australia), but there are very tiny ones consisting of one city (Vatican).  Countries vary in terms of population.  There are billionaire states (India, China), and there are those in which no more than a few thousand live (San Marino). </p><p>  So, considering the question of how the development of the Earth by man took place, we can conclude that this process is not yet completed and we still have to learn a lot of interesting things about our planet. </p>
