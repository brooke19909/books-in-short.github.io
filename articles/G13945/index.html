In general, such a concept is most convenient, since it allows you not to think about food at all and to devote all your time to rest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="avantgarde hotel resort 5 reviews" class="if" height="409" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1979712.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As we have already mentioned, there is a large network of bars on the territory of the hotel, so being in one place, you absolutely do not need to go to another to have a snack or order drinks.  It is very convenient and eliminates the need for guests to make unnecessary movements. </p><p>  In addition, the hotel has a water complex "Water Planet", whose area is 3000 square meters.  It consists of a huge outdoor pool, a lagoon, a children's heated and indoor pools, as well as water slides.  A large selection of water activities for guests of all ages allows you to have fun. </p><p>  For business guests, the hotel has a well-equipped conference room.  In addition, the complex has its own shopping center, consisting of two floors.  There are eighteen boutiques from leading world companies.  Also at the hotel you can use parking or rent a car. </p><h2>  Sport and leisure </h2><p>  Turkish hotels have gained worldwide fame and popularity not only thanks to the all-inclusive system.  Most tourists prefer a vacation in this country due to the fact that good five-star establishments offer a large selection of entertainment and decent animation.  And this means that the guests are provided with a fun and eventful vacation and at the same time there is no need to organize leisure activities and invent something for themselves.  All this for all will be done by experienced animators. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel avantgarde hotel resort 5" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1979716.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In terms of entertainment, Avantgarde Hotel Resort 5 * (Turkey) is a worthy representative.  The hotel has a fitness center, there are tennis courts, as well as table tennis tables, a climbing wall.  Tourists can play bowling and visit the water sports and entertainment center.  In addition, vacationers have the opportunity to do aerobics, play boccia, volleyball, darts, billiards, futsal.  For guests of the institution, daily animators conduct sports events, discos and show programs. </p><h2>  Services for children </h2><p>  Avantgarde Luxury Resort Hotel 5 * is focused on family vacations, and therefore much attention is paid to children's leisure.  On the territory of the water complex there are two ponds for children with slides.  The hotel also has an outdoor playground for toddlers.  Professional animators organize the leisure of kids in the mini-club, dividing them into groups by age. </p><p>  The main restaurant has a children's and diet menu.  And if necessary, parents can use the services of a nanny (however, this service is paid by tourists separately).  The youngest guests of the hotel can stay for free without a separate bed. </p><h2>  additional services </h2><p>  The hotel provides many different services.  Some of them are included in the price, and some must be paid separately. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="avantgarde hotel resort 5 reviews 2017" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1979717.jpg" width="600"></div>

The hotel has its own 700 meters long beach with three piers and several bars.  The coast is equipped with awnings and sun loungers.  In addition, there are tents, the cost of which must be paid separately.  The beach has a sand and pebble coating and convenient entry into the sea. </p><h2>  Avantgarde Hotel Resort 5 *: reviews </h2><p>  Continuing the review of the hotel, I want to pay attention to the reviews of tourists.  And they are not as rosy as we would like.  Three or four years ago, vacationers admired the Avantgarde Hotel Resort 5 *.  Reviews of tourists were confirmation of this.  But, apparently, during this time the situation has changed, since now guests note a lot of shortcomings.  Not so long ago, the hotel acquired a new name due to a change in ownership.  However, the changes affected not only the name itself, but also the internal state of affairs. </p><p>  Avantgarde Hotel Resort Kemer 5 * has an excellent number of rooms, which can safely be called the main advantage of the hotel.  Absolutely all apartments of the complex have a large area.  They feature balconies with great views.  The rooms are decorated in Turkish style and equipped with modern technology.  Beautiful interiors, nice furniture and a beautiful bathroom - all this creates a wonderful atmosphere for relaxation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="avantgarde hotel resort 5 turkey goynuk" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1979718.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  But the hotel staff is not so pleasant.  Many tourists have complaints about the service.  The rooms are cleaned with sufficient quality, but sometimes they just forget to do it.  The situation is corrected by the presence of tips.  The minibar, unfortunately, is also forgotten to replenish.  As for the Internet, it is in the rooms and in the hotel, but it is very weak. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  Recent reviews (2017) about the Avantgarde Hotel Resort 5 * indicate that the food in the hotel is not well established.  The main restaurant is a beautiful establishment with spacious rooms and a great base.  But the whole experience is spoiled by poor service.  Tourists note that the restaurant has several spacious rooms with a large number of tables, so everyone should have enough space.  However, in reality the situation is completely different.  If you arrive for breakfast, dinner or lunch not at the opening, but a little later, then the tables in the halls are either occupied by visitors or loaded with dirty dishes.  We have to ask the staff to clean up, but the waiters are slow and reluctant.  And in order to bring drinks, in general, you need to ask for a long time, so it‚Äôs easier to handle the task yourself. </p><p>  As for the quality of food, tourists are dissatisfied with the range of dishes.  There is a lot of food at the buffet, but it is very monotonous and not very tasty.  But the excellent Turkish sweets and desserts are greatly praised by the guests.  It also affects the daily variety of fruits. </p><p>  Vacationers greatly praise bartenders working in beach bars.  They serve guests quickly and make great cocktails. </p><h2>  General impression of the complex </h2><p>  According to tourists, the hotel "Vanguard Resort" makes a very double impression.  Its indisputable advantage is a chic number of rooms and beautiful villas.  The facilities and their design are at their best.  But as regards the service and staff of the establishment, numerous problems begin here.  It is noticeable that the hotel complex has a good base, which has not yet had time to become worthless.  A large area with green spaces, spacious rooms, a private beach - all this can be attributed to the advantages of the hotel.  However, the general positive impression is spoiled by unskilled personnel.  Arrivals at the reception upon arrival are very slow, attendants are not interested in visiting.  In addition, tourists are not informed at all about the events held at the hotel and its infrastructure.  Vacationers themselves are forced to study the vast territory of the institution. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="avantgarde hotel resort 5 turkey kemer" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1979720.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel has a good kids club, there is a playground and a water park, amusement park.  Adult animation is not very active.  And in the evenings karaoke and discos are sometimes arranged.  Unfortunately, the administration of the institution does not conduct active and fiery evening shows. </p><p>  The hotel's beach is very spacious and there are always a lot of free sunbeds on it.  Pontoon is convenient for those who like to go scuba diving.  The local coast is suitable for families with young children. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Hotel Avangard Resort is a good complex in the Kemer district, which, according to tourists, needs some changes in terms of staff and service, since the current level of service of the institution does not correspond to the five stars on the plate of the complex. </p>
