Of course, there were also dissatisfied users who noted the slow operation of the device when connected via a wireless module.

    <p>  Reviews on the Samsung Soundbar K 650 remained positive.  They were unhappy only with the cost, since the device costs more than 20 thousand rubles, which not everyone can afford.  But the buyer gets wireless speakers with a total power of 340 watts.  There are a large number of functions that replace the "smart" TV.  Equipped a soundbar and all the necessary technologies. </p><p>  Soundbar "Samsung" HW-F450 also received good reviews.  We noted its budget value, the presence of all the necessary technologies.

Most of all, this model was suitable for those who do not want to install large acoustic systems such as home theaters near the TV, but still dream of improving the sound of their TV using such options. </p>
