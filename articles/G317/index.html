    <h2>  Convenient rate </h2><p>  From the ‚Äúeasy payment‚Äù service, users expected many convenient functions.  But in fact, not all MTS customers will be able to answer the question: "What is SMS iMTCPay?"  This service provides busy people with the opportunity to pay for various services using mobile communications, including utility bills, payment for a purchase made in a shopping center or over the Internet, MTS bills, various other payments. </p><p>  The financial infusion is due to replenishment on the telephone balance, but thanks to the existing bank card, you can solve the issue of payment. </p><p>  What is convenient - the financial procedure does not take much time, since the service is open for use at any time of the day, there are no breaks here as well as weekends.  A part of payments does not have a commission or it is less than in any bank or payment terminal.  It is possible to create payment templates. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This service also has compatibility with a huge number of different phones, flexible settings. </p><h2>  Use possibilities </h2><p>  This service has become available thanks to: </p><ul><li>  special mobile application; </li><li>  ussd commands.  Dial enough code 115. This portal is considered the most versatile in terms of access to "easy payment"; </li><li>  special web-portal. </li></ul><p>  To make payments from a personal account, you can use one of these methods, but if we are talking about a bank card, then this can only be done through a mobile application. </p><p>  Regardless of how the function is used, before the payment has to go through, a message is sent to the phone with a request for confirmation of the financial transaction, which indicates all payment parameters and the commission for services.  In response, the client sends a message confirming or rejecting the operation. </p>

    <p>  If a bank card is involved, information comes from the mobile application to the bank that an iMTCPay payment is required.  This automatically includes the card number and payment amount. </p><h2>  Is the protection reliable? </h2><p>  Access to this mobile application is password protected.  It should be known only to the user who switched to the ‚Äúeasy payment‚Äù tariff, therefore the formation of any request by third parties should be completely excluded.  When the money is debited, iMTCPay payment is completed, the transaction has been completed, an SMS notification will necessarily come from which it is clear that the payment has been made, and if the commission has been withheld, its amount is also announced. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Security was promised thanks to a closed password and automatic verification of the service, which is able to find out whether the addressee and the specified payment match.  All this is done in order to avoid any kind of fraud, so that there is no substitution of the recipient of the payment transaction. </p><p>  This mobile system has received a certificate that legally complies with banking standards - PCI DSS, and therefore constitutes equal rights in terms of security for various types of payments that are made from bank cards. </p><h2>  Spending restrictions </h2><p>  If a client of MTS uses a bank card, requests are charged for service management, reports, messages, etc. </p><p>  The tariff has limitations, and is quite strict.  For example, you can pay a personal account up to a certain amount, and financial transactions performed per day should not exceed an amount of 15 thousand rubles, and per week - no more than 50 thousand rubles. </p>

    <p>  If a bank card is involved in payments, it is not valid for all banks, including corporate card holders cannot use the service to cover production costs, and no more than seven operations can be performed during the day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If the next payment cannot be made due to the fact that there is not enough money in the account, there is still the option to make the payment, but the money will be withdrawn from the bank card.

After the program is launched, all conditions of the contract are accepted, a password is set, access to all programs is opened after updating the necessary parameters. </p><h2>  How to disable iMTCPay? </h2><p>  Not all users were satisfied with the work of this service, although it was conceived as a very profitable and simple function that makes life easier in many cases and significantly saves time. </p><p>  Someone did not agree to overpay for the services provided by the service, or the commission fee seemed more than we would like, someone had contradictions and conflicts with the service provider. </p><p>  If you nevertheless have a question: ‚ÄúHow to disable iMTCPay Easy Payment?‚Äù, There are several options for how to do this. </p><h2>  password change </h2><p>  But first, operators, if the user hesitates whether to refuse the service, may be advised to change the password.  To do this, use the previously set function "personal account" and change the access code.  In this case, the updated menu is loaded, a list of available payments is displayed, and the number of those payments that are already in the history is set. </p>

    <p>  You can also reset your password here.  If it was forgotten, then solving this problem will be more difficult, since for security all applications - bank cards that are connected are deleted.  All will have to reconnect. </p><p>  If there is a cancellation of the tariff, a message should be sent about the successful cancellation of the package. </p><h2>  Danger from fraudsters </h2><p>  But if before that a significant amount of money had disappeared from the account, and it is impossible to determine how this happened, you will have to seek a refund.  Sometimes this happens due to scammers who have managed to make a so-called clone of a SIM card, and money debiting continues. </p><p>  If such suspicions arise, operators are advised not to respond to SMS messages sent from unfamiliar numbers, not to answer those calls whose subscribers are unknown.  It is not recommended to send messages from your phone when advertising mailings arrive or unknown subscribers request to provide any assistance possible by transferring a certain amount to an unfamiliar number.  According to statistics, in most cases fraudsters are involved in such actions, therefore in the future the subscriber will be forced to lose significant amounts without having understood where they disappear from their accounts. </p><p>  Even if it is very interesting to know what kind of sms iMTCPay is received, it is better to restrain curiosity, and turn off the ‚Äúeasy payment‚Äù faster. </p><h2>  The fight for a refund </h2><p>  Codes via SMS messages are also not recommended if iMTCPay is stolen, and what is still unclear what to do.  Most likely, you will have to contact the nearest service center of the operator with a written statement, which will set out the requirement to terminate the tariff.  You must have a passport and a copy of it with you. </p>

    <p>  If fraudsters are guilty of withdrawing money, they will have to contact law enforcement agencies to help resolve the conflict, return the stolen money and punish the criminals.  Again, you need to bring along identity documents. </p><h2>  Disable short number </h2><p>  You can disable the service through your existing smartphone running on the Android or iOS platform. </p><p>  There is a way to suspend the ‚Äúeasy payment‚Äù service using a short number.  To learn how to disable iMTCPay, 6996 is the number you need to call and follow the instructions.  This number is used during the validity of the tariff, when a request is required that will confirm any payment made.  This function is paid during the tariff, and its cost depends on the region where the subscriber is located. </p><p>  In order for the transaction to take place, a message should be sent to this number.  The text can be of any content.  In order for the message to be eliminated, just enter the sign ‚Äú0‚Äù.  All messages are processed, and the sender ultimately receives a notification. </p><p>  If there is a desire to disconnect from the tariff, then after dialing the short number, ‚Äú0‚Äù is pressed on the keyboard and then all the actions must be performed according to the instructions.  After the tariff has become invalid, the short number automatically stops working. </p><h2>  Special trip codes </h2><p>  The short number is included in the services of the standard ‚Äúeasy payment‚Äù service and is connected to many tariffs that MTS has, by default.  The short number does not have a monthly fee; payment is included when something needs to be paid.  For each payment there will be a percentage, which is laid down in various organizations individually. </p><p>  MTS does not have a special code for disabling the ‚Äú6996‚Äù service, but if it is not needed, it is possible to contact the operator or go to the service center, be sure to have a passport, and ask the employee to disable the service.  You can contact the operator by phone by dialing the number ‚Äú0890‚Äù, then following the instructions of the autoinformer, to get in touch with an employee of the company, press the number ‚Äú0‚Äù. </p><h2>  Service center </h2><p>  As users advise, for faster resolution of issues related to services provided by telephone companies, it is better to contact service centers for help.  The service is good there, you can get expert answers to all your questions. </p><p>  An interactive menu will come to the rescue.  For this, the familiar combination ‚Äú* 111 * 1 #‚Äù is dialed, and all operator prompts are executed through the voice menu. </p>

    <p>  If the need to disconnect has occurred while the user is in roaming, you can use the services of a telephone number - + 7-495-766-01-66.  This number is dialed in the international format, after the connection you will need to listen carefully, and follow the instructions in sequence. </p><h2>  Disconnect using the "personal account" </h2><p>  In the "personal account" the problem of how to disable iMTCPay will be solved almost instantly, but the password and login entered earlier will be required. </p><p>  It is the phone number that is the login, and the password is the ability to order.  There is a certain link for this, you can get it through a special SMS message. </p><p>  If you have a tablet, in the case when you need to figure out how to disable iMTCPay on the MTS, or if it is a MTS Connect modem, you can enter the ‚Äúpersonal account‚Äù automatically.  When the authorization has occurred, then having entered the ‚Äúpersonal account‚Äù, it will be disabled, but at the same time it is possible to untie the bank card. </p><p>  There is another short number - 7763. If the transaction and payment are completed, it is still not clear how to disable iMTCPay, then it is enough to cancel the options and this number will cease to work.  If all the same messages continue to arrive, you must use a service such as "ban content."  You can connect it using the "personal account" or using the following combination - "* 152 * 2 #".  When the tariff cut-off takes effect, both paid and free subscriptions that were carried out from short numbers will disappear. </p><p>  In the MTS service department, any operator of the center knows how to disable iMTCPay, and therefore he will be able to deactivate the service as quickly as possible. </p><h2>  Authorization on the site </h2><p>  The official website will also help to refuse the ‚Äúeasy payment‚Äù service.  To do this, go through authorization on mts.ru.  Some users who have not previously visited this site can also take advantage of its capabilities.  To do this, enter your own mobile phone number, and using an SMS message, require you to send a password for further actions. </p><p>  If the manipulations are carried out on a tablet or modem from MTS, the input will be made automatically.  No credentials are needed. </p><p>  In the section where the services are displayed, there is a panel "easy payment".  Here you need to run the ‚Äúdisconnect‚Äù command, and here, more precisely, in your personal profile, the bank card is unfastened. </p>

Initially, it was a micro-code placed in a special SIM card, where the mtcpay service was contained and the transaction was carried out only when the SIM card was changed to a special one.  But only after a while the service itself was introduced directly, which could be carried out immediately from the phone or from the site.  It is convenient or not - only users of this service can decide. </p>
