    <h2>  Should I buy a UPS? </h2><p>  Before considering how to choose a UPS, it is useful to determine whether it makes sense in principle to purchase an uninterruptible power supply.  So, if we are talking about the need to only stabilize the voltage in the network, then other, more affordable devices, for example, special surge protectors, can be used for this. </p><p>  But if there is a need to ensure the functioning of the device during interruptions in the supply of electricity, then you can not do without a UPS.  Of course, if the device has a reliable built-in battery - the need for uninterruptible power supply in this case may be absent. </p><p>  UPS purchases are a significant cost item in large enterprises.  At the same time, managers may face a variety of questions: how to choose the optimal uninterruptible power supply, which battery to choose for a UPS for a computer, industrial device, heating infrastructure element. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  UPS classification </h2><p>  In accordance with the widespread approach among specialists, UPSs are classified into the following main types: </p><p>  - reserve; </p><p>  - linearly interactive; </p><p>  - UPS class online. </p><p>  Consider their features in more detail. </p><h2>  Standby UPS </h2><p>  Redundant UPSs are designed for use mainly in cases where a device that is powered by an electrical outlet must be maintained in a functional state with regular <span>blackouts.</span>  This UPS is enough, in particular, to ensure the operation of the computer - for example, if necessary, while there is no electricity, save the file or end the game.  Many experts advise users who are thinking about how to choose a UPS to pay attention to the peculiarity of many models of devices of the appropriate type: they do not have stabilizing elements.  This means that when the computer switches to backup power, a small interruption in the supply of electricity appears. </p>

    <h2>  Line Interactive UPS </h2><p>  Line-interactive UPSs are characterized by high resistance to voltage drops.  To which, in turn, backup devices are sensitive.  Line-interactive devices have a number of features, they should also be considered when considering the issue of how to choose a UPS.  So, these devices can generate network interference that fall into the public network.  In addition, the corresponding type of device is characterized by rather high noise, which makes it difficult to place them in residential premises.  But, one way or another, their main advantage - resistance to voltage surges, makes the corresponding UPS in demand. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Online UPS </h2><p>  UPS type online have, according to experts, the highest resistance to voltage surges.  In addition, they do not cause network interference.  Thus, they have no shortcomings characterizing other types of UPSs that we examined above.  However, the corresponding devices are much more expensive.  In addition, it should be borne in mind that in some cases they are inferior to standby and linearly interactive in energy efficiency. </p><p>  There are other classification criteria for the devices in question.  In many cases, the question of how to choose a UPS should be considered in the context, first of all, of the equipment for which the corresponding device is purchased.  So, the characteristics of a UPS adapted for a PC can differ significantly from those of a device designed, for example, for connecting to a gas boiler.  The fact is that this device is designed to ensure the functioning of the relevant equipment as a complex infrastructure component of the heat supply system. </p><p>  Therefore, choosing the UPS of gas boilers based on this feature can be difficult: in particular, a detailed study of the power indicators of devices, their compatibility with specific types of technological infrastructure will be required. </p>

    <h2>  UPS power as a criterion for device selection </h2><p>  Thus, power is one of the key criteria for choosing an uninterruptible power supply.  It is measured in volt-amperes or VA.  If necessary, they can be converted to watts.  For this, the indicator in volt-amperes must be multiplied by 0.6. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The required UPS power value depends on the device to which it is intended to be connected.  For example, if the question is how to choose a UPS for a computer, then you should focus on an <span>uninterruptible power supply</span> with a capacity of at least 500 volt-amperes.  A device designed to ensure the functioning of a gas boiler must have a disproportionately large power.  In turn, if you need a UPS for the refrigerator - how to choose it, of course, consultants can always tell you when purchasing the appropriate type of equipment, but the buyer should have guidance on the parameters of the device in question - then its capacity will be closer to the one that characterizes the UPS for PC. </p><p>  The next most important criterion for choosing a device is the duration of its battery life in the absence of electricity. </p><h2>  Battery life </h2><p>  The considered parameter is most often expressed in minutes, sometimes in hours.  If the question is how to choose a UPS for the home, then you can pay attention to those solutions that provide uninterrupted supply of electricity for about 5-7 minutes.  As a rule, this time is enough to make the necessary operations with the computer.  However, if we consider the refrigerator, it will obviously require a significantly longer battery life.  In principle, turning off the refrigerator for 5-7 minutes is not critical, and in this case, even the UPS is not required to be connected to it.  But if such shutdowns are regular or significantly longer, then an uninterruptible power supply will be needed, and it should work significantly longer than the specified time - for example, about 20 minutes. </p><p>  The next most important criterion for choosing a UPS is the number of devices that can be connected to the corresponding device. </p><h2>  Choose a UPS: the number of connected devices </h2><p>  Uninterruptible power supplies are most often equipped with the number of sockets from 1 to 8. Which UPS to choose when considering devices with a different number of sockets? </p><p>  The answer here will not always be obvious.  The fact is that experts advise paying attention not only to this indicator, but also to the qualitative characteristics of the outlets.  So, among them there may be those that have increased immunity to interference in the electrical network, or there may be ordinary ones.  If the UPS is selected for a computer, then you can buy a device that has about 4-6 outlets, and among them it is not necessary to have those that are protected from extremes.  UPSs for more powerful devices may already require special outlets. </p>

    <h2>  Features of the electrical network as a criterion for choosing a UPS </h2><p>  The next most important criterion for choosing a UPS is the features of the electrical network operating in the building or premises, in which uninterruptible power supplies are installed.  So, if the network works without failures, then, probably, the user will not need to purchase expensive devices that have appropriate security. </p><h2>  UPS Choice: Nuances </h2><p>  Consider a number of nuances that characterize the choice of uninterruptible power supply. </p><p>  It is desirable for the UPS to switch the device to battery power in no more than 10 milliseconds.  Only in this case, the computer will continue to function fully - for example, in the mode of launching a game or editing a document.  But it is worth noting that most modern models of redundant uninterruptible power supplies meet this criterion. </p><p>  True, if the power outages are too frequent, then the battery installed in the UPS may experience excessive load.  In this case, pretty soon the user may need to solve another problem - how to choose a battery for the UPS, the cost of which is not always affordable.  In this case, it may be advisable to consider purchasing a line-interactive UPS.  These devices are usually equipped with a voltage regulator, which operates in automatic mode.  An appropriate type of uninterruptible power supply can, by transferring the device to which it is disconnected to the battery, adjust the output voltage if the voltage in the network increases or decreases. </p><p>  In turn, if you want to ensure the highest possible stability of the system to the appearance of problems in the network, it is better to focus on more expensive, but at the same time technologically advanced online UPS. </p>

    <h2>  UPS selection by capacity: nuances </h2><p>  Choosing the UPS power that is optimal for ensuring the operation of the device is a task whose solution is also characterized by a number of nuances. </p><p>  So, experts advise purchasing uninterruptible power supplies that have a capacity of about 30% higher than that of the device to which the UPS is supposed to be connected.  In the case of computers, this is due to the fact that PCs sometimes reach a significantly higher power than that which corresponds to the average load on the device - for example, due to the active use of the processor. </p><p>  It may well be that the user may need to install a more powerful hardware component in the system unit of the computer, for example, a cooling system or a video card.  This hardware update can significantly increase the overall power of the system connected to an uninterruptible power supply. </p><p>  Another criterion that should be taken into account when deciding how to choose a UPS for a computer by power is the number of additional devices that are supposed to be used simultaneously with a PC in standalone mode.  So, for example, such a printer may be: it is quite possible that when the computer is switched off, the user will need to not only save, but also print the document.  If the printer will work simultaneously with a PC, especially when it comes to printing a large number of pages in a row, then the total system power can jump by an order of magnitude.  This is where the indicated reserve of uninterruptible power supply comes in handy. </p><h2>  Choosing a UPS by battery life: the nuances </h2><p>  As a rule, the user needs about 5 minutes to save documents and even complete key operations with programs.  Therefore, if the objective is not the task of working with files, which requires a lot of time, then there is no need to buy uninterruptible power supplies that ensure battery life in the above 20 minutes or more.  In this case, it is quite possible to choose a good UPS, albeit not designed for long battery life, at a very affordable price, from a branded manufacturer. </p><h2>  UPS Choice: Software </h2><p>  Another noteworthy criterion, according to which an uninterruptible power supply can be selected, is the equipment of this device with functional software.  The fact is that situations in which users most often need to use a UPS are quite typical.  If the device to which the uninterruptible power supply is connected is a PC, then its operation, as a rule, is accompanied by the need to quickly save files.  Many manufacturers of relevant devices implement similar data protection algorithms at the firmware level. </p><p>  The advantages of such solutions may be that the files are saved in accordance with the program, even if the user for some reason will not be at the computer.  In many cases, UPSs are also equipped not only with sockets, but also with connectors for peripheral devices - for example, those powered by a USB cable.  Some uninterruptible power supplies are adapted to protect network equipment and other devices that operate using technological interfaces. </p><h2>  UPS Selection: Management Tools </h2><p>  Another important criterion that you can focus on when considering the question of which UPS to choose is the convenience of controlling the device.  The user should not have, in principle, any particular difficulties in bringing the device into operational readiness, and if necessary, in turning it off, replacing the battery, and conducting simple diagnostics.  Many devices of the corresponding type are equipped with rather informative built-in displays, which can reflect various parameters of the device.  For example - the voltage level in the network, the <span>power consumed by the</span> system. </p><p>  In addition, manufacturers of <span>uninterruptible power supplies</span> can also supply specialized software to the market that will allow the user to receive the same data, as well as many others, directly on the PC screen.  And this will be another aspect of the convenience of controlling the device, which you can pay attention to when choosing the optimal model of uninterruptible power supply. </p><h2>  UPS Choice: Battery Replacement </h2><p>  An important, according to many experts, criterion for choosing a UPS is the ability to change batteries in it.  It so happens that the user has a need to quickly replace the battery.  For example, if power surges are very often observed in the network, while the device may not be designed to operate in such conditions.  Therefore, it is desirable that the owner of the equipment to which the uninterruptible power supply is connected has the opportunity to relatively easily purchase an average range of computer stores and install new batteries in the UPS. </p>
