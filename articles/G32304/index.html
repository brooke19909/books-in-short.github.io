Crafts-donuts, the manufacture of which we will describe in the article, can be used for decorating the kitchen, playing in the store, decorating small stationery and jewelry.  Modeling from polymer clay is very similar to working with plasticine.  It is enough to stretch it in the palms and form a ball or sausage. </p><p>  A polymer clay donut is easy to make.  It is enough to follow the detailed instructions and follow the advice of experienced craftsmen to create a craft that looks like a real glazed donut.  In the article, we will reveal all the secrets of making various options for such "baking", describe how to make small earrings or decorate cutlery for a holiday gift.  We will advise you on how to properly shape the sidewall of a light shade and create a donut made of polymer clay with a bite-off edge with tooth marks.  This creative work is sure to captivate, so do not hesitate to get down to business with us. </p><h2>  The basis of crafts </h2><p>  For work, prepare several colors of polymer clay.  Beige is for the ‚Äúbaking‚Äù itself, and bright colors are for decoration.  They start modeling a polymer clay donut by rolling beige plastic into a ball.  Then it is placed on the surface of the silicone mat and pressed down with the palm of your hand.  It turns streamlined shape of the product. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.woojr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="polymer clay donuts master class" class="if uuid-3075605" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3075605.jpg"></div><p>  The hole in the center can be perforated in several ways, using a wooden skewer or the back of the brush.  If you have a professional dots, then with its help the hole can be beautifully rounded from above and from below.  If there is no such device, then you can use a simple pencil with an eraser at the end. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you carefully consider the real donut, then on its side there is a light stripe.  To create such an effect, you need to glue a polymer clay donut with a thin strip of adhesive tape around the entire circumference.  ‚ÄúFry pastries‚Äù on both sides with brown shades using a brush.  At the end of the work, the adhesive tape is carefully removed. </p><p>  The texture of the donut consists of small holes.  The craftsmen achieve this surface in several ways - they are done with a toothpick, a toothbrush, or the product is crushed in coarse salt. </p><h2>  Make icing </h2><p>  The upper part of the donut is usually covered with glaze of any bright color, decorating it with a powder of small details, sparkles or ornate lines.  How to make donuts from polymer clay with glaze, we will consider further in the article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fabricate-workshops.myshopify.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="donut glaze" class="if uuid-3075600" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3075600.jpg"></div><p>  Masters design the top of the product in different ways: </p><ol><li>  Some people flatten a colored ball with their fingers to a thin pancake with uneven edges and simply spread it on the surface of the donut.  Bottom of the toothpick mark the location of the hole, then on top of it expand and smooth to the inner edges of the product with your fingers or a convenient device. </li><li>  Others before coating the glaze, the main part is dried in the oven at the temperature indicated on the clay package.  Then, liquid clay is used and the surface is poured, creating uneven streaks in all directions.  While the icing is liquid, it is possible to arrange small details in it or sprinkle with spangles, fashioned separately by stars or sticks. </li></ol><p>  To make it convenient to cut the clay into small pieces, put long, thin sticks in the freezer for several minutes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Bitten donut </h2><p>  To make a donut with lateral tooth marks, after sculpting, put the workpiece in the refrigerator.  The material will subsequently become a little harder.  For cutting use tubes with a wide opening, for example, cocktail, or a felt-tip pen without a rod.  Pressing is done from one side, creating a semicircle of the impression from the teeth. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make polymer clay donuts" class="if uuid-3076896" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3076896.jpg"></div><p>  All that remains is to bristle the "dough" inside the bite with the bristles of the toothbrush, creating a rough surface.  Some are diligently doing this work with a toothpick. </p><h2>  Polymer clay donut on a spoon </h2><p>  Ready-made donuts can be stuck in the handle of a spoon or fork, creating a gift set of utensils for the cake. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="polymer clay donut on a spoon" class="if uuid-3075620" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3075620.jpg"></div><p>  Do this before baking in the oven.  You can make donuts the same way to make a kit, but crafts with different colors of glaze or powder will look spectacular.  Fix the craft on metal with superglue. </p><h2>  Using crafts </h2><p>  Donuts can be made in different sizes.  It is interesting to lay out large crafts on a decorative dish and arrange a showcase of a candy store or a children's game.  Small items can be attached to a keychain or pendant on a bag, decorated with earrings, a brooch, a pendant or a ring. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bluemaize.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="donut earrings" class="if uuid-3075602" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3075602.jpg"></div><p>  The article presents a master class of polymer clay donuts.  Try to create crafts yourself.  This is a fascinating creative process that everyone can do. </p>
