In the spring of 2015, the Finnish company introduced in its lineup a new phone based on an OS called Windows Phone 8. The name of the new smartphone is Nokia Lumia 720. When the devices on this OS are a little less than a dozen, testing such a representative is undoubtedly interesting.  Although on the other hand, there may be doubts about large sales.  In short, it all depends on the manufacturer.  Of course, making a new project on the device market is more and more difficult. </p><h2>  Nokia Lumia 720 Smartphone: Specifications </h2>

The processor of the device has two cores that operate at a frequency of 1.0 GHz.  However, it is in this case that the chip does not function at a very high frequency, at least the reviews of the owners speak of this.  But this did not affect the smoothness of the interface - the screen turns over very well.

    <p>  Next, let's see what <span>Nokia Lumia</span> 720 features graphics.  Prior to this, the <span>Adreno 305</span> core was seen only once - in a Huawei device on WP8.  But the younger brothers showed themselves well in models with the Android OS.  Of course, it is worth considering that almost everything will depend on games and programs (but with this on this platform, everything is not very good).  However, at the moment, a large number of users are interested not in 3D games, but in video decoding. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Nokia Lumia 720: a characteristic of RAM and ROM </h2>

However, all the same, statistics on the operation of this operating system are still too few to specifically judge the capabilities of the devices.  Many reliable utilities say that 395 MB is available.  By the way, this parameter is also taken into account when the content of the application store is filtered, so some programs will not be available for the device.  Moreover, in the application requirements, these characteristics are not indicated, and it is very possible that users of this smartphone will be upset during their choice.  The device is equipped with a built-in flash memory of 8 GB, and about 7.3 GB are allocated for the drive from it, 4.9 GB are available for user files after formatting.  Of course, you can also use microSD cards.  This adds to the device‚Äôs attractiveness, as the 920 didn‚Äôt have such a function.

The screen of this phone has a diagonal of 4.3 inches and is created using IPS technology.  He really got very large viewing angles.  Also during use, high contrast and brightness can be noted, so the Lumia 720 can be used even on an incredibly sunny day.  This is a merit of the ClearBlack system.  The resolution of the matrix itself is 800 by 480 pixels.  In fact, this is a typical option for this diagonal, however, due to contrasting patterns, a lack of resolution is sometimes striking in the eye.  In the work of games and applications, we also did not notice any significant delays.  The only case where the latency has been extended to a few seconds is the process of restoring or running applications.  It is difficult to say exactly what this may be connected with - a small amount of RAM, the OS device itself, or a low flash memory speed.

The phone comes in a cardboard box, which is familiar to us from other latest devices.  The main color of the device is recognizable by all blue.  Almost no technical specifications and descriptions are indicated, there are only logos of the Windows Phone OS and Qualcomm platform, as well as a list of the delivery set.  The color of the smartphone can be recognized by the sticker, the information on which includes the serial number and model name.  On the first level of packaging are the phone itself and a key for inserting a SIM card, on the second tier there is a very compact charger, a headset with a microphone, a Micro-USB cable, as well as a brief user guide and certification information.  It is unfortunate that the developers provided a large selection of bright colors of the case itself, but did not design other elements in this way. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

The characteristics of the phone were given above, and we can only summarize.  If you have not met this line before, then the look of the smartphone itself will seem interesting and fresh to you.  Particularly attractive is the availability of a choice of incredibly bright colors - red, yellow and turquoise.  After all, before that, only white and black were available.  Probably some people might be scared using WP8.  But in our opinion, there is nothing terrible in this OS.  If you compare this device with other modern smartphones in all basic characteristics, then it is not inferior to them in anything.  In what direction the duo of Nokia and Microsoft will go further, especially considering the events of recent years, it is not yet clear.  But if you want to try something new and are ready to take risks, then this solution is for you.  This is our view on the Nokia Lumia 720 device, the reviews, specifications and features of which we reviewed today.
