In a relatively small area of ‚Äã‚Äãthis region, a huge number of old manors have been preserved.  Many of them, unfortunately, are in an abandoned or dilapidated state.  But this does not make them less interesting for tourists.  Moreover, every year the number of people who want to see these objects only increases. </p><p>  In this article we will talk about six estates of the Vladimir region - the most valuable in historical terms and the most interesting in terms of architecture.  Each of these scenic spots is definitely worth visiting at least once! </p><h2>  The most beautiful estates of the Vladimir region (list) </h2><p>  Today, about 40 manor complexes have been preserved within the Vladimir region.  Although once there were at least a hundred.  Not everyone was lucky to survive to this day.  And among those that remained, there are many dilapidated and ownerless.  But even the abandoned estates of the Vladimir region are quite attractive objects for a certain caste of tourists and local historians.  And they are very fond of photographers.  Agree: the dilapidated Gothic turret against the background of centenary trees looks great in the frame! </p><p>  In this article we will tell only about the six most interesting and most beautiful estates of the Vladimir region.  Here is a list of them: </p><ul><li>  The estate of V. S. Khrapovitsky in Muromtsev. </li><li>  The estate of N. E. Zhukovsky in Orekhovo. </li><li>  The "Noble Nest" of the Taneyevs in the village of Marinino. </li><li>  The Mitkov estate (Varvarino). </li><li>  Estate "Undol". </li><li>  Manor Grozinsky-Shorigins. </li></ul><p>  By the way, in 2015, the illustrated catalog Vladimir Manors was published.  It provides information on 161 estates of the region (only 33 of them have retained their main buildings).  The collection also contains a detailed map of the estates, which will help the tourist to find all these objects on the ground. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Khrapovitsky Manor in Muromtsev </h2><p>  Vladimir region is a real storehouse of historical and architectural monuments.  Here in almost any town or village there is sure to be something interesting.  We will begin our story about the estates of the region, perhaps, with the most remarkable and original object. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.abandonedplaygrounds.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="estate Muromtsevo Vladimir region" class="if uuid-2698367" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/2698367.jpg"></div><p>  Manor "Muromtsevo" in the Vladimir region once belonged to the landowner and rich man Vladimir Semenovich Khrapovitsky.  In 1880, traveling around France, a wealthy count was struck by the beauty of the castles there.  Returning to his homeland, he wished to build something similar for himself.  And built it!  The magnificent architectural ensemble of the estate today is striking in its scope and exoticism.  The castle had all the necessary amenities: a sewer, water supply and even a telephone.  Khrapovitsky set up a park near the estate with fountains and a system of cascading lakes. </p><p>  In the Soviet years, the estate housed a forestry college.  But in the late 70s, he left the palace and the estate was empty.  Today, the pseudo-Gothic miracle decays and collapses.  From the lush decor of the building there was practically nothing left.  Only above the window of the rounded tower can you still see the Khrapovitsky coat of arms in the shape of a lily. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Location: Muromtsevo village, Sudogodsky district. </p><h2>  Manor of Zhukovsky in Orekhovo </h2><p>  In the Vladimir region, the estate of Zhukovsky, perhaps, is preserved in the best way.  It was here that Nikolai Yegorovich Zhukovsky, an outstanding scientist, the father of theoretical and experimental aerodynamics, was born.  Subsequently, he came to Orekhovo very often to take a break from the bustle of the city and gain strength.  Here, a talented physicist created several of his works.  Not only the estate complex was perfectly preserved, but also the adjoining park, including the original layout of the alleys and authentic arbors. </p><p>  Today, the estate operates a memorial museum.  In its 11 halls, you can familiarize yourself in detail with the rich scientific heritage of N. E. Zhukovsky.  The museum administration conducts interesting excursions with theatrical mini-performances and tea parties. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.voyagevladimir.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Zhukovsky manor in the Vladimir region" class="if uuid-2698371" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/2698371.jpg"></div><p>  Location: Orekhovo village, Sobinsky district. </p><h2>  Manor of Taneyev in Marinino </h2><p>  But <span>Taneyev</span> ‚Äôs <span>estate</span> in the Vladimir region holds many mysteries and secrets.  Rumor has it that the estate once belonged to Gustav Vasa - the son of the Swedish king, sung by William Shakespeare himself.  According to legend, Boris Godunov wanted to extradite his daughter as an overseas prince.  However, it did not work out.  But all this is nothing more than a legend. </p><p>  In fact, the estate belonged to the noble family of the Taneyevs.  At the beginning of the XVII century, the king granted Tikhon Taneyev the Marinino area, where he founded his ancestral nest.  A one-story wooden house, a church, a park and an old linden alley have reached our time.  The estate also has a museum, the main purpose of which is to recreate the atmosphere of life in a provincial noble estate in the first half of the 19th century. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kraeved-museum.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Manor Taneyeva Vladimir region" class="if uuid-2698372" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/2698372.jpg"></div><p>  Location: Marinino village, Kovrovsky district. </p><h2>  Manor Mitkov in Varvarino </h2><p>  The estate was built in the middle of the XVIII century and belonged to the Mitkov family.  Later it was bought by Tyutchev's daughter.  In the Soviet years, the village club was located in the main house of the estate, and warehouses were located in the outbuildings.  Of course, this did not benefit the old building.  Every year it more and more decayed and collapsed.  Already in the 2000s, the complex was rented by one metropolitan entrepreneur.  After that, large-scale work on its reconstruction began, but they were never brought to its logical conclusion.  Soon the philanthropist disappeared without a trace, and the manor again was left without a master. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vladimirtravel.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mitkov estate" class="if uuid-2698369" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/2698369.jpg"></div><p>  The main house of the estate is in a terrible state.  The outbuildings do not feel any better - one of them is destroyed almost completely, in the other the floors are collapsed.  Of the entire complex of the Varvara estate, only the stables are not badly preserved. </p><p>  Location of the object: the village of Varvarino Yuryev-Polsky district. </p><h2>  Manor "Undol" </h2><p>  Driving along the Moscow - Vladimir highway, on the outskirts of the town of Lakinsk, it is simply impossible not to notice a bright yellow stone church with a high multi-tiered bell tower.  These are the remains of another interesting estate of the Vladimir region, which was once the estate of A.V. Suvorov. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rivage.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Undol manor" class="if uuid-2698368" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/2698368.jpg"></div><p>  The former village of Undol became the property of the Suvorovs in the 18th century.  Alexander Suvorov inherited the estate after the death of his father in 1775.  Here he lived only a few years, and then often returned to the family estate in between military campaigns.  It was in Undol that Suvorov wrote his notorious work ‚ÄúThe Science of Winning‚Äù. </p><p>  There is very little left of the estate itself: only a temple and a fragment of the park.  According to legend, several lindens in it were planted by the hands of Alexander Suvorov himself. </p><p>  Location: Lakinsk city of Sobinsky district. </p><h2>  Manor of Georgian-Shorigins </h2><p>  We conclude our list with another magnificent estate, made in the style of the Tudor era.  The complex was built in the 1870s and belonged to Prince Nikolai Gruzinsky, a descendant of the noble Bagration family. </p><div class="photo" data-original="deni-spiri.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="abandoned estates of the Vladimir region" class="if uuid-2698370" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/2698370.jpg"></div><p>  The Gothic tower with a spire gives a special charm to the main house of this estate.  In addition to this building, the estate complex includes other buildings: houses for workers, a chapel, a pumping station, and a kitchen.  However, they are all designed in the same style, which is very valuable.  For a long time, the estate was desolate.  But in the late 2000s, she was in private hands and began to recover little by little. </p><p>  Location: Mikhailovka village, Kameshkovsky district. </p>
