How to knit a cardigan: schemes, instructions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you follow fashion trends, then you may have repeatedly wondered: what is a cardigan?  Is it a sweater, jacket or jacket?  A cardigan is a type of knitwear with a front closure: on <span>buttons, hooks,</span> zippers, velcro.  Let's find out more about the hero of fashion chronicles. </p><h2>  What is a cardigan, where did the name come from </h2><p>  This item of clothing owes its appearance in the usual form for us to the English commander Bradnell James Thomas.  Opinions about exactly when this happened are divided: some historians believe that he came up with a sweatshirt with a front fastener to warm the soldiers' uniforms during the Crimean War.  Others are of the opinion that Lord Cardigan began to wear this type of clothing much later, resting from military feats in the countryside near Northamptonshire, which also did not have a particularly warm climate. </p>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Job Description (Size M) </h2><p>  <em>Back and shelves</em> </p><ul><li>  Type 113 stitches on circular knitting needles of size 4.5.  Tie 8 cm with 1x1 elastic. </li><li>  Change the knitting needles to size 6 and knit with a <span>stocking knit,</span> in the first row evenly add 11 stitches (hereinafter - p.), A total of 124 p. </li><li>  To indicate the shelves, put a marker after the first 30 p., And after another 64 p. </li><li>  Continue until this part becomes 25 cm wide. Then reduce two points on each side of the marker. </li></ul><p>  <em>Sleeves</em> </p><ul><li>  We also start with gum, as well as on the body.  Dial 34 loops and knit the part with knitting needles No. 4,5.  Then go to size 6 and evenly add 4 p., Total 38 p. </li><li>  Every 4 cm 3 times add one loop after the beginning and before the end of the row, totaling 44 p. </li><li>  When the height of the part is 40 cm, knit two loops, 40 p. </li><li>  On this work with the first sleeve is over, do the second in the same way. </li></ul><p>  <em>Coquette and assembly</em> </p><ul><li>  Lay the sleeves on the sides of the main body.  Open loops should be near.  Combine them on one knitting needles by placing markers between the sleeves and the main part (4 pcs.).  Now do reductions to form a raglan: </li><li>  When 3 points remain before the marker, make 1 point decrease, when 1 point is knitted after the marker, again knit two points together.  So continue to 18 rows, a total of 52 p. </li><li>  Make one reduction - 51 p. - and knit 3 cm with an elastic band on the knitting needles 4,5.  Close the hinges. </li><li>  Now move on to decorating the shelves.  You need to dial the loops along their edges (2.5 cm = 3 p.) To complete the cardigan.  Scheme of how this is done: <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cardigans for women" class="if" height="284" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/685899.jpg" width="400"></div></li><li>  Now continue to work with an elastic band (3 cm), close the loops. </li><li>  On the other part, knit a strip with holes for buttons: after 1.5 cm of elastic, make 5 holes with the help of yarn.  In the next row in these places, you need to perform a decrease so that the total number of loops remains unchanged.  Tie the elastic, close the edge, hide the threads, sew the buttons - and the new thing is ready. </li></ul><h2>  Soft touch </h2><p>  Lace inserts give the model a concise form of special charm. </p>

    <p>  If you are a beginner, then carefully read the entire description before you start knitting this cardigan with knitting needles.  Schemes will facilitate the work, but still this is a more complex project than the previous one. </p><p>  Description is given for size M. Work is carried out using knitting needles No. 4,5 and No. 5,5.  A smaller knitting tool will provide the edges with stiffness, they will not stretch in the toe, and a larger one will keep the knitted fabric soft in the rest of the product.  Otherwise, you will get a very dense cardigan with knitting needles.  Schemes for work: </p><ul><li>  pattern: <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cardigan knitting scheme" class="if" height="242" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/685902.jpg" width="397"></div></li><li>  openwork pattern: <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knit cardigan" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/685901.jpg" width="341"></div></li></ul><h2>  Back </h2><ul><li>  We begin to work with knitting needles No. 4,5, so that the edge is tight and holds its shape well.  We collect 78 loops and knit a 3 cm handkerchief pattern. Note that the first and last row are purl. </li><li>  We take knitting needles No. 5.5 and then we work in stocking knitting until we reach the width of the part 38 cm. We finish work on the wrong side. </li><li>  We make bevels for the sleeves, evenly reducing the loops around the edges: </li><li>  Row 1-4: close 4 loops (70 p. Remains), repeat the operation, but already 2 loops with two subsequent rows (66 p.). </li><li>  Row 5: 3 p., 2 together, continue to the last 5 p., 2 p. Together, last 3 p., All face. </li><li>  Row 6: similar to the previous one, but all wrong seams. </li><li>  Row 7 = row 5. </li><li>  Row 8 knit purl without reduction. </li><li>  Next, repeat the rows 7-8 3 times.  There are 50 loops on the knitting needles, we work with the front stitch, until the part becomes 53 cm wide, we finish the work on the wrong side. </li><li>  Go to the cutout.  We knit 13 p., Attach the second skein of yarn, close 24 p. And knit the remaining 13 p. We continue to work on both parts evenly.  We reduce 1 p. Along the edges and knit to a part width of 55 cm. </li><li>  Then close 4 p. At the beginning of the next two front rows.  When 4 points remain, they will also need to be closed. </li></ul><h2>  Left shelf </h2><ul><li>  We knit 37 pts with smaller needles, work with a garter stitch 3 cm. We change the tool and knit the front smoothness to the width of the part 38 cm. </li><li>  Then we perform the reduction for the bevel of the shoulder similarly to the back.  When the part reaches 46 cm in width, we complete the work with the front row. </li><li>  Since the cutout is deeper in the front, working on it is different from knitting the cutout at the back. </li><li>  Row 1, 3, 5, respectively: close 4, 3, 2 p. At the beginning.  The rest are knit purl to the end </li><li>  Rows 2, 4 - front p. </li><li>  Row 6: tie to the last 5 p., 2 p. Together, 3 p. </li><li>  Row 7: 3 back loops, 2 together and to the end of the row. </li><li>  We knit and close the loops in the same way as on the previous part. </li><li>  The right shelf is made in the same way, but in a mirror. </li></ul><h2>  Sleeves </h2><p>  Openwork adds a twist to this cardigan.  Carefully follow the pattern knitting pattern, try to pay special attention to this site so as not to stray and prevent mistakes. </p><ul><li>  Again, we start the garter stitch by typing 43 p. Then we take the needles number 5.5 and carry out an openwork pattern.  After that, go to the <span>front surface,</span> making additions of 2 p. Every 10 cm (total 53 p.).  We continue to work until the part becomes 33 cm long. Then the formation of the shoulder begins, similarly to a row of 1-5 back reductions.  We continue like this: </li><li>  Row 6: without reduction. </li><li>  Row 7 = Row 5 </li><li>  Row 8: Wrong. </li><li>  Repeat rows 7-8 9 times, a total of 21 loops. </li><li>  Then finish work on the sleeve like this: two rows of decreases (similar to rows 5-6 of the back);  close 2 p. at the beginning of 4 subsequent rows;  close the remaining 9 p. </li></ul><h2>  Assembly </h2><ul><li>  Perform seams in this order: shoulders, sleeves, sides. </li><li>  Type 83 p. Along the cutout and make 2.5 cm garter stitch. </li><li>  Shelves for buttons are made as follows: type 82 p. Along the edge of the canvas, make holes for buttons: in the 4th row, close 2 p. Where there will be holes, and then add 2 p. In total, 8 rows should be connected. </li><li>  Hide the threads and enjoy your creation. </li></ul>
