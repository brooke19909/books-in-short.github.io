What is it and how to make it</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Voodoo is an ancient <span>African religion</span> that still remains traditional in the most backward countries of Africa.  In the modern world, the voodoo doll came from there.  The followers of this religion believe that a voodoo doll is like a bridge to a person, giving its owner complete control over him.  She was endowed with the energy of a certain personality, the owner of this little thing could influence a person while away from him.  It was used both for the good and to the detriment of the person whose symbol she was. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself wood-doll" class="if" height="299" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14597/162648.jpg" width="284"></div>

    <p>  As a rule, the doll was used with negative intentions.  Sorcerers and magicians poked her with needles in different places, it was believed that the person whom this little thing symbolized would have exactly the organ that was pierced by a needle.  In the end, the sufferer was dying. </p><p>  Do-it- <span>yourself voodoo doll was</span> made.  From time immemorial, the wisest sorcerers and magicians only collected material themselves and sewed or sculpted it from wax.  Voodoo magic was considered one of the most powerful.  And African sorcerers and shamans are the most insidious.  It was believed that they communicate directly with otherworldly forces and know how to convince them of the need to do what the shaman needs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Making dolls with your own hands is not difficult, but also not entirely simple.  Usually more time is spent on collecting materials than on the creation itself.  In order for the energy of a certain person, the doll to be a small prototype, to transfer to the thing itself, you need material such as nails, hair, blood, saliva, skin and other possible elements that are sometimes not so easy to get. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY doll making" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14597/162644.jpg" width="337"></div>

    <p>  A voodoo doll, made with your own hands, may turn out to be not quite beautiful, but more often even quite ugly, but this is not the main thing, because the main thing is what kind of information load it will bear.  And now about the manufacturing process itself. </p><p>  As a rule, there is no general instruction for creating, because a voodoo doll has been made by many generations in many countries, different magicians having this or that improvised material.  I will tell you how it is made of fabric. </p><p>  Let's start with the collection of material, and we will need, as mentioned earlier, hair, skin, blood, saliva, tears, any similar elements of a certain person.  Also, for stuffing the doll, you will need moss (it is easier to find) or dry herbs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="voodoo magic" class="if" height="430" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14597/162649.jpg" width="250"></div>

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  From the fabric we cut two flaps with a width of about 15 to 15 cm.  These will be the right and left halves of the doll.  We sew them, leaving a hole so that you can fill the space inside with moss, grass and other material.  In the same way we make arms and legs, only the size of the flaps should be much smaller.  In total there will be 4 - 2 arms and 2 legs.  We make our doll's head, tying the upper part of the trunk stuffed with material with a string.  In the same way we do the waist (optional).  Hands and feet are stuffed with material and sewn to the body. </p><p>  It is worth noting what is on the victim.  Saliva is in the head, nails are in the arms and legs, and so on. </p><p>  You can also make the doll hair from threads and collect them in a bun on the head.  Eyes are made from embers that are taken at the intersection, from small buttons or simply embroidered, just like the nose and mouth. </p><p>  Do-it-yourself voodoo doll is done simply, it‚Äôs worth recalling that you shouldn‚Äôt do bad things with it, because, as you know, all evil returns.  Try to make yourself a voodoo doll, let it be your talisman. </p>
