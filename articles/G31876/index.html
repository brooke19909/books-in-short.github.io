  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How much a notary earns: salary level by region</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Notaries are considered the fifth branch of government.  This is the highest rung in the legal field.  Working as a notary is attractive because they have virtually no competition in the market.  Therefore, they have a good income from their activities.  We will find out how much a notary earns and why many graduates of law schools dream of becoming one. </p><h2>  Who is a notary public? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.curtisparkinson.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much notaries in Russia earn" class="if uuid-2948622" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18963/2948622.jpg"></div><p>  A notary is a public institution that protects the rights and interests of individuals and legal entities.  The corresponding functions in the Russian Federation are performed by notaries.  They can be employees of government agencies or provide the necessary services privately. </p><p>  The position is appointed in accordance with the rules approved by the federal executive body.  Together with the Federal <span>Notary Chamber,</span> it exercises control and supervisory functions in the notarial sphere.  He also determines the number of posts that are possible in a particular district. </p><p>  The notary is vested with authority on the recommendations of the Federal <span>Notary Chamber.</span>  Persons newly taking up their duties take an oath in which they undertake to fulfill their duties in accordance with the law, ensure the preservation of professional secrets, and be guided by the principles of a humane, respectful attitude to people in their work. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The exact income of notaries is hard to call.  For some legal services, they can set their own price, which is several times higher than state tariffs.  Therefore, before answering the question: ‚ÄúHow much does a notary earn?‚Äù, You need to understand what structure he works and which of his works are in greatest demand. </p><h2>  Functions </h2><div class="photo" data-original="notaryclassonline.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much the average notary earns" class="if uuid-2948625" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18963/2948625.jpg"></div><p>  Sometimes it seems that a notary public employee sets high prices for elementary actions that do not require special efforts.  But this is an erroneous opinion.  The range of actions of a notary is very wide.  Such a person should be well-versed in legislative acts in order to professionally advise clients and correctly draw up each document.  The main functions of a notary public are as follows: </p><ul><li>  Registration of procedural actions of various nature. </li><li>  Certificate of documents (including copies), extracts, signatures. </li><li>  Providing evidence. </li><li>  Drafting transactions. </li><li>  Clarification of questions on notarial acts. </li></ul><p>  The amount of services rendered depends on how much a notary will earn per month. </p><h2>  Responsibilities </h2><ol><li>  To provide notarial services to individuals and legal entities. </li><li>  Explain the rights and obligations of citizens seeking help. </li><li>  Promote customer protection. </li><li>  Talk about the possible consequences of committed notarial acts. </li><li>  Refuse to perform a service if it does not comply with Russian law. </li><li>  Comply with the professional code of notaries of the Russian Federation. </li></ol><p>  According to the law, he is responsible for all actions taken, including mistakes, even if they were made by negligence.  This practice is a fairly responsible area of ‚Äã‚Äãemployment.  The complexity of the work affects how much the notary earns.  His income may be high. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What does it take to become a notary? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.vice.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much a private notary earns" class="if uuid-2948628" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18963/2948628.jpg"></div><p>  It can be a person who has a law degree and has passed a specific exam.  The following requirements are established for a candidate for a notary public: </p><ul><li>  Russian citizenship. </li><li>  Higher specialized education. </li><li>  One-year internship at an experienced notary public. </li><li>  Successful passing the qualification exam. </li><li>  Obtaining a license to carry out professional activities. </li></ul><p>  Many want to become a notary.  Even if the candidate meets all of the above requirements, he may not be hired if a stronger opponent wins the competition for the vacant position.  Many agree to remain in the position of assistant notary until free space appears.  Often the waiting period is delayed for several years.  How much does a notary who has just begun to fulfill his duties earn?  The earnings of a novice employee will be 2-3 times less than that of a practitioner. </p><h2>  What does a salary consist of? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.nbn.org.il" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much a notary earns per month in Moscow" class="if uuid-2948630" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18963/2948630.jpg"></div><p>  In Russia, a notary public has about 60% of the income received.  His <span>salary</span> depends entirely on the amount of work performed.  The more services he provides, the higher his monetary reward will be.  By opening the price list of any office, you can approximately calculate how much an average notary earns.  So, certification of a standard form agreement costs clients 8,000‚Äì15,000 rubles, and a power of attorney costs about 1,000‚Äì2,000 rubles. </p><p>  Notaries of clients do not experience a lack of clients.  Every day, hundreds of people are forced to seek their services to certify various documents.  In large cities, queues are arranged for them and preliminary appointments are made.  If we take 60% from the income received on the day and multiply this amount by a forty-hour working week, we can imagine how much a notary earns in seven days. </p><p>  Where do the remaining 40% of earnings go?  For the payment of taxes, insurance payments, membership dues, office rent, staff remuneration (if any are available in the state).  Also, the costs of notaries take into account the illegal contribution for their admission to the profession, the amount of which depends on the region of residence.  In a large metropolis, this amount is several thousand US dollars. </p><h2>  Salary in the capital </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.notary-chamber.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much notaries earn in Moscow" class="if uuid-2948621" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18963/2948621.jpg"></div><p>  How much do notaries in Moscow earn?  Their official income in a large metropolis can reach 70,000 rubles per month.  At the same time, the monetary remuneration of an employee of the public and private sphere can differ significantly.  The latter has the right to independently set the price for some of his services. </p><p>  How much does a private notary earn?  A beginner can have about $ 1000 per month.  An experienced specialist, this amount increases several times.  At the same time, private notaries have the same responsibility to clients as their colleagues working in the state structure.  They provide qualified, full-scale legal assistance to everyone who applies.  The main professional guarantee of a private notary is his full property liability for harm caused to an individual during the commission of actions. </p><h2>  Salary by region </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.zancopenotary.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="notary salary" class="if uuid-2948640" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18963/2948640.jpg"></div><p>  Many are interested in how much notaries earn in Russia, in different regions of the country.  There is an opinion that their income is significantly lower than that of the capital's colleagues. </p><ul><li>  In St. Petersburg and the Kostroma region, notaries earn about 50,000 rubles a month. </li><li>  In Smolensk and Obninsk, their income varies between 45,000‚Äì50,000 rubles. </li><li>  In Buryatia, Magnitogorsk, Kislovodsk and Chechnya, the cash compensation of office workers is around 47,000 rubles. </li><li>  In Taganrog and Ufa, a notary can earn about 40,000 rubles. </li><li>  In the Krasnodar Territory, this figure is reduced to 30,000 rubles. </li></ul><p>  The average salary of notaries in Russia is 50,000 rubles.  The minimum value is at the border of 34,000 rubles, and the maximum exceeds 105,000 rubles.
