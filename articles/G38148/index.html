To do this, pieces of cardboard are glued with strips of paper in all places of contact with the frame.  Next, outside the box, mark the windows and exit to the balcony or terrace and cut them with an <span>office knife.</span>  The next stage is wall decoration, here self-adhesive film is ideal.  This is a very practical material for a children's toy.  In which case such walls of the house can be wiped with a damp washcloth.  In addition, the sheen of the film will add gloss and glamor to the finish.  Bright pink walls with a black cobweb, a dark purple ceiling and a floor on which white fur with a long pile will look great as an original will look original.  Outside the house also needs to be pasted over and highlight the window and door frames with a contrasting color.  Here you can safely fantasize and experiment, directing the children's flow of ideas in the right direction. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY monster high house" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/346693.jpg?1393851197884" width="326"></div>  It is worth noting that even children can cope with this task, because making a house for Monster High is very easy, the main thing is to turn on your wit.
