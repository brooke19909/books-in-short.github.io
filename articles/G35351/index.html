The first mention of the city dates back to 862.  In the "Tale of Bygone Years" it is indicated that this settlement was founded by the Krivichi tribes on the picturesque bank of the Dvina.  Through Polotsk lay the famous ‚Äúway from the Varangians to the Greeks‚Äù, which contributed to the very rapid political, economic and cultural development of the region. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="polotsk sights" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/467031.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  This settlement is located near the cities of Vitebsk and Novopolotsk, in the North-Eastern part of Belarus.  By the way, Polotsk is considered the most ancient <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãof Belarus</span> .  The sights of this place attract tourists from near and far abroad.  They come to admire amazing architectural ensembles, numerous monuments, museums, temples and simply beautiful nature. </p><h2>  Amazing Sofia </h2><p>  Almost all of Polotsk's guests of this city are primarily associated with the white-stone Sophia Cathedral.  This temple is a real masterpiece of architecture.  It was erected in the 11th century at the highest point on the banks of the <span>Western Dvina.</span>  In those days, the construction symbolized the power of the <span>Principality of Polotsk,</span> and now St. Sophia Cathedral is a prototype of the independence of Belarus. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of polotsk belarus" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/467032.jpg" width="320"></div>

Altar apse, foundation and fragments of frescoes of the XI century are now in the Museum of the history of temple architecture. </p><p>  <span>St. Sophia Cathedral</span> in Polotsk survived many dramatic events, fires and destruction.  The modern temple has two symmetrical towers 57 meters high.  The interior of the church is simply luxurious: arched columns, stucco moldings, elaborate cornices and unusual colors. </p><p>  The altar of the cathedral was separated by a three-tier barrier, and the image of the Trinity of the New Testament previously adjoined it.  Since 1983, the chamber has a chamber music hall. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sofia Cathedral in Polotsk" class="if" height="421" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/467033.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Now in St. Sophia Cathedral you can not only enjoy a concert of organ music, but also go down to the basement of the church, touch pieces of ancient masonry, and visit an exposition dedicated to the history of the cathedral. </p><h2>  Holy relics </h2><p>  We continue a fascinating tour of the city of Polotsk.  Many sights of a global scale are in a hurry to see, one of the most popular places can be called the Spaso-Evfrosinievsky monastery, which is called the spiritual center of the city.  Hundreds of pilgrims come here annually in order to bow to the holy relics.  One of the most important shrines of the monastery is the Cross of <span>Euphrosyne of Polotsk,</span> created in 1661 by the talented jeweler Lazar Bogshe.  True, during the Second World War, its original was lost, but now in the monastery they offer to see its exact copy, which was consecrated in 1997. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Polotsk city attractions" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/467036.jpg" width="600"></div>

This temple is the only building where wall painting and architecture of that time were preserved. </p><h2>  Center for European Tourism </h2><p>  The Savior-Euphrosinius and St. Sophia Cathedral are amazing shrines.  However, the sights of Polotsk (Belarus) do not end there.  The city center also has something to see.  Perhaps the <span>geographical coordinates of</span> 28 degrees 48 minutes east longitude and 55 degrees 30 minutes north latitude does not tell you anything, but for Polovtsy these are very significant numbers.  Almost every local resident is aware that the sign ‚ÄúGeographic Center of Europe‚Äù is located on <span>Francis Skorina</span> Avenue.  It depicts a wind rose, a globe with the outlines of Europe, the ship and the coat of arms of Polotsk.  Every tourist who has visited this city can buy a souvenir certificate, which confirms that a person has visited the very center of the European continent. </p><h2>  Famous monuments </h2><p>  Have you decided to visit the city of Polotsk?  Attractions can be seen almost everywhere.  For example, every year there are more and more monuments.  In 2009, a monument was erected in honor of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker (near the Spaso-Efrosinievsky monastery).  The mute used to be a sculpture of the enlightener Simeon of Polotsk, Prince Vseslav and Euphrosyne.  In 2010, a monument was opened in Polotsk to the architect John, who built the Transfiguration Church, as well as a bust of the ‚Äúfather‚Äù of Belarusian cinema Yuri Tarich. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of polotsk photo" class="if" height="463" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/467037.jpg" width="600"></div>

Here is a memorial dedicated to the heroes of World War II.  All the complex details of the composition were poured at the Technolit-Polotsk factory. For this purpose, the plant‚Äôs specialists had to master the art of casting. </p><p>  What to see in Polotsk yet?  In this ancient city, it is also worth seeing a monument to the honorary commander Francis Skorina, who first printed books in Old Russian.  His very first work was the Bible, which he translated from a complex Church Slavonic language.  In glorious Polotsk there is the only monument to the merchant in all of Belarus.  Do not forget to visit the Borisov stone; it is a huge boulder, which remained here after the glacier.  In the country, several such stones were found, all of them are in the museum.  It is believed that if you circumvent Borisov‚Äôs stone three times and make a wish, it will certainly come true. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of polotsk and novopolotsk" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/467038.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  To see all these interesting sculptures, you need a map of Polotsk with attractions. </p><h2>  Bernardine Monastery </h2><p>  The temple building itself has not been preserved to this day, only the ruins of the residential monastery complex and church have survived.  The monastery was founded in 1498 at the direction of Alexendre Jagiellon.  In 1563, there was a very strong fire, as a result of which all wooden buildings were destroyed.  In 1696, another attempt was made to rebuild the monastery.  At the invitation of the governor Alexander Slushka, a Bernardine church was created.  The city authorities wanted to consolidate Catholicism in this region and therefore allocated a very decent amount of money for the construction of the structure.  After the Russians arrived in Polotsk, the monastery was closed, and the church was transformed into an Orthodox church.  Unfortunately, due to numerous wars, it is not possible to see this monument of architecture, however, looking at its remains, we can guess that it was really beautiful. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="map of polotsk with landmarks" class="if" height="306" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10499/470137.jpg" width="532"></div></h2><h2>  Other interesting places </h2><p>  Of great interest is the Epiphany Cathedral, which includes the former complex of the monastery.  This architectural monument was built in the 18th century (1777).  It operates today.  Here, rites of baptism and weddings are held.  No less attracts tourists and the Defensive Val of Ivan the Terrible.  It has remained untouched since the Livonian War (1558-583). </p><p>  Just a walk around the city can also be interesting.  Walking along its ancient streets, looking at old buildings and numerous shrines is very exciting. </p><h2>  Picturesque fountain </h2><p>  To fully enjoy the beauties of this region, it is worth a glimpse in Novopolotsk.  There is an amazing fountain, which was founded in honor of the 50th anniversary of the city.  This beautiful composition consists of 6 synchronously operating dynamic light fountains.  Water is supplied in a closed cycle using LED energy-saving backlight. </p>

The sights of the city are the Museum of Local Lore, Belarusian Book Printing, the Children's Museum, Natural Ecology, the house of Peter I (the tsar really did stay here), the library museum of Simeon Polotsky, weaving, Battle Glory, etc. </p><p>  In this village you can also walk along the shores of the picturesque <span>Western Dvina</span> with enchanting views, walk to the Eternal Flame and the Mound of Labor Glory.  All historical sights of Polotsk and Novopolotsk are under the state protection of the National Cultural and Historical Museum-Reserve. </p><h2>  Haunted Places </h2><p>  As in any ancient and legendary city, there are ghosts in Polotsk.  According to the stories of local residents, one of them lives in a picture gallery, which is located in the building of the Jesuit College.  True, this unidentified object lives quietly and peacefully here and does not bother anyone, only occasionally drops pictures on the floor.  According to one version, the spirit of General Gabriel Grubber is ruffian here.  During his lifetime, this man was a very talented physician, chemist, and mechanic; many also believed that he could associate with evil spirits.  The general died under very mysterious circumstances, and then returned to this collegium in the form of a spirit. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sofia Cathedral in Polotsk" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/467040.jpg" width="600"></div>
