Today, people's consciousness has changed a little, and many understand that life in the vast space of space, of course, is in one form or another.  And the urgent question now is no longer ‚ÄúDo extraterrestrial civilizations exist?‚Äù, But ‚ÄúWhat do aliens look like?‚Äù  The article provides materials in the <span>form of theories of</span> scientists, as well as information from people involved in channeling. </p><h2>  Variety of alien life </h2><p>  First of all, it is worth noting that alien life is as diverse as the infinite universes in space. </p>

    <p>  The opinion, and even more so the assertive assertion that earthlings are the only creatures in the entire Universe, testifies only to the narrowness of thinking and interests of the individual. </p><p>  Aliens not only live on other planets, galaxies and universes, but also on our home planet.  There is plenty of evidence describing what aliens look like.  Photos in various sources show already inanimate humanoids or incomprehensible translucent clots, silhouettes that people also take for aliens. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A man with his bloated ‚Äúego‚Äù imagines himself to be the master of the Earth: some people subjugated others, and to maintain power, true knowledge began to hide from the vast majority.  Many myths were invented to distract attention, invented unnecessary needs and artificially nurtured a desire and desire to possess things that are not necessary, but created so that people do not think about the main thing - who they are, where and why they came to Earth from. </p><p>  In fact, people can only live on land, and even then, despite the scientists developing stations to control weather conditions, any typhoons, earthquakes, floods and other natural phenomena can easily erase the entire civilization from the surface.  However, in conflicts between ourselves, we ourselves can destroy the Earth. </p><p>  The ocean occupies seventy-one percent of the surface of the entire Earth, being practically unexplored.  The underground space is huge and also unknown to people.  And this is just what concerns our planet, which is the smallest particle of the cosmos. </p><p>  And some of us continue to laugh and exclaim: ‚ÄúWhat kind of nonsense, what extraterrestrial civilizations?  What a question, what do aliens look like? ‚Äù, And so on and so forth ... </p><h2>  Extraterrestrial beings from a scientific point of view </h2>

Where there is strong gravity and a dense atmosphere, large, strong and aggressive creatures are likely to dwell.  On ice-covered planets, perhaps only bacteria can live. </p><p>  The molecules on Earth are built primarily from carbon.  As a result of this, some scientists suggest that life on other planets is possible only if carbon is present on them. </p><p>  So, American and British scientists suggest that they will soon find a <span>planet similar to the Earth,</span> which revolves around a red dwarf (a cold star that produces much less light from the Sun).  Such a hypothetical planet was called Aurelia. </p><p>  It is believed that the beings of such a planet are similar to the earthly senses: eyes, nose, ears, skin, and taste sensors.  They have a brain and a data center, a long neck and legs. </p><p>  Another hypothetical object of study is the Blue Moon, a satellite of the planet like Jupiter, completely covered by water with a dense atmosphere.  What do aliens look like there?  Hypotheses are put forward that due to excess oxygen, huge flying creatures with a wingspan of up to ten meters can live there. </p><p>  In 2010, however, scientists discovered that there are organisms that do not need oxygen to function.  Instead of a carbon atom, organic structures there most likely form silicon, which in many respects resembles carbon in its properties.  Silicon-based life is thought to be much less diverse than carbon-based. </p><h2>  Aliens according to ufologists </h2><p>  Researchers are sure that they know what an alien actually looks like.  They divided the aliens into humanoids and non-humanoids. </p><p>  The former are like humans.  Their height is from eighty to three hundred centimeters, the body is not always proportional, on the long limbs there are three or four fingers, gray skin, a <span>large head.</span>  Humanoids communicate telepathically, although they can speak the language of their homeland. </p>

    <p>  Non-humanoids, according to ufologists, can take any form: jellyfish, beznosnye and earless dwarfs, giants, translucent entities and so on. </p><h2>  What aliens look like, according to contactees </h2><p>  Some people communicate or think that they are communicating with extraterrestrial beings through meditation.  This connection is called channeling. </p><p>  They later tell what aliens told them about their civilizations, what real aliens of different systems look like.  These are aliens from the Pleiades and Sirius, Orion and Zeta ... </p><h2>  Pleiades constellation </h2><p>  Peaceful and benevolent towards earthlings are the majority of Pleiadians.  Moreover, according to their stories, we have the same roots.  That is, earthlings and Pleiadians came from the <span>constellation Lyra,</span> from where, due to conflicts, they were forced to fly away.  Someone settled on Earth in the solar system, and someone in a star cluster of the <span>constellation Taurus, the</span> Pleiades.  What do aliens look like with the Pleiades?  They live on six planets and differ in genotype from each other.  On three planets humanoid aliens live, on others - creatures without a physical body, but with energy and light shells.  There are also those that have both physical and light bodies at the same time.  They transmit information through channeling. </p>

    <p>  Pleiadians with physical bodies mostly have fair hair, ears are slightly lower than humans, their height is from one and a half to one hundred and eighty centimeters, and their eyes are from blue to golden. </p><h2>  Orions </h2><p>  Orion is one of the brightest constellations of the night sky.  According to legend, it represents a hunter who died due to his pride and boasting.  Most Orion people are like humans.  They mainly have dark skin, and only a small part of them are Caucasoid type, with blond hair. </p><p>  They are aggressive and participated in many wars. </p><h2>  Aliens from Sirius </h2><p>  The brightest star in our sky is in the <span>constellation Canis Major.</span>  About four million years ago, hybrids of people and Sirians, with semi-physical physical bodies, remained to live on Earth, serving as guardians and mentors.  They were called Kantarians.  As masters of sacred geometry, they collaborated with Egyptian and Sumerian priests. </p>

    <p>  According to the book ‚ÄúRace of Explorers,‚Äù the Sirians came to Earth, creating a Mayan civilization.  Their mission was to insert an axis into the planet in order to upset its balance.  When the earthlings are spiritually ready, this axis can be shifted, thus checking the spiritual level of people.  Sirius' energy supports the Earth through the African race - the Syrians themselves are also dark-skinned. </p><p>  The book also describes that male energies were provided by Orion, and female energies by Sirius. </p><p>  Some Sirians eventually became like reptiles and insects.  All of them are very different both in appearance and in intent - from evil to light creatures. </p><h2>  What aliens look like (photo for real) </h2><p>  Not only scientists, ufologists and contactees deal with alien issues.  More and more information appears that the elite of the leading states of the world met with humanoids.  The secret services are closely involved in this topic.  They, like no one else, know what aliens look like.  Photos found in the press can be both skillfully fabricated fakes and real ones. </p>
