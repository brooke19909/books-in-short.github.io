Plus, its real story is intertwined with fabulous myths, and there are attractions that confirm their reality!  All this attracts a lot of tourists here.  We offer you, upon arriving on the island, to stay at the amazing Aqua Sun Village Water Park 4 * hotel.  Its highlight is the water park with pools filled with sea water, and an important feature is its location on a hill, from which views of incredible beauty open up. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  In a rather interesting place is the Aqua <span>Sun Village 4 *.</span>  Greece is a country of small towns and well-groomed villages that look like suburbs, and the Greeks try to use every inch of their mountainous land.  On the coast of the <span>Cretan Sea,</span> about 20 km (in a straight line) from Heraklion, lies the ancient Chersonissos.  It occupies a fairly wide strip of the coast.  It is generally difficult to distinguish between where one village ends and another begins, since everything has long been mastered and built up.  Up from Hersonissos, about 2 km from its center, lies the village of Piskopiano, smoothly passing into the village of Koutouloufari.  Above them are only mountains, more precisely one mountain, Pyrgia.  The four-star Aqua Sun Village is built at its foot.  If at the gates of the hotel you become facing the sea, the road to the left will lead to Kutulufari, to which no more than a couple of hundred meters.  The road down rests on the central highway Eleutherios Venizolos, to which about a kilometer.  From this place to the sea’s edge is another 200 meters. Hersonissos will be on the left, to the outskirts of which 500 meters, and on the same highway to the right, tourists will find a number of gorgeous beaches, the elite village of Stalida and the city of Malju, to which from Hersonissos is less than 8 km. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  It is more convenient to travel to Crete from Russia by plane.  The airport closest to Aqua <span>Sun Village 4 *</span> is located near Heraklion.  It is called Nikos Kazantzakis.  It is no more than 22 km from the hotel, which takes half an hour.  Organized tourists at the airport are met by a representative of a travel agency, provide a shuttle service and drive to the hotel.  Those who arrived to Crete on their own can take a taxi at the airport or take the bus to Heraklion bus station.  There, take the bus to Hersonissos, and from there take a taxi to the hotel. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Since Aqua Sun Village 4 * is not located in the city, but on the most Greek nature, nobody and nothing is embarrassing.  Its territory is so large (4.5 hectares) that tourists travel freely around it in rented cars, scooters or ATVs.  There is a spacious parking lot right at the central gate, but many park right at their hulls.  The size of the territory allows to place a lot of entertainment objects on a large scale.  This gives the impression that Aqua Sun Village is a real small town.  There are central and residential buildings (15 in total), huge pools, an aquapark for large and small, sports grounds, tennis courts, numerous flower beds, a garden, a spa, a mini-store, and numerous recreational areas. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Not very convenient in relation to the sea coast is the hotel Aqua Sun Village 4 *.  Crete has dozens of equipped and wild beaches, each of which has a clear sea, but there is not a good sand everywhere.  There are beaches where stone slabs are laid, and the entrance to the water is not at all suitable for kids.  There are very comfortable beaches equipped with cabins and other amenities, but they are always crowded.  Guests of the hotel in question can walk to Star Beach.  From the hill down to him a quarter of an hour go, but you have to come back up, overcoming a rather steep climb.  Since a shuttle service is not provided, all who find it difficult to walk, especially uphill, take a taxi.  A trip of 1,200 meters costs 5 euros.  Star Beach itself is not bad, clean, with a gentle approach to the sea, with taverns located nearby and with a lot of water activities. </p><p>  If you drive towards Stalida from the hotel, you can discover a more convenient beach, where the conditions of rest are much more comfortable. </p>
