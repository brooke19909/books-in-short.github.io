  <section class="page js-page"><h1>State investment policy</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>The investment policy of the</span> state directly depends on the course of the corresponding process, i.e.  this is the participation of business entities in the economic sphere of activity in increasing the gross domestic product in the country.  The result of investment activities by business entities is the implementation of a number of measures for the use of various types of investment: financial and real, short-term and long-term, private, foreign and state. </p><p>  State investments are made ‚Äúunder the direction‚Äù of the main element of this process - the state, which can act in such ways as the organizer or participant of the financial and investment markets, as well as as the manager of the investment process. </p><p>  In the modern Russian economy, regional investment policy is of great importance.  The goals, methods, forms and tasks of its implementation do not coincide among the regions.  However, there are common goals and objectives of this policy, consisting in the following provisions: </p><p>  - thanks to the improvement of the structure of investments, their effectiveness is increased and the volume of this type of investment is significantly expanded; </p><p>  - to create a prerequisite for economic growth, it is necessary to ensure a favorable <span>investment climate</span> ; </p><p>  - proper prioritization when choosing enterprises that are of strategic importance for the regional economy and require additional capital raising. </p><p>  The investment policy of the state has a sufficient number of participants engaged in multilateral activities to increase, in addition to their capital, and national capital as well.  This phenomenon is quite diverse and complex, therefore, it is necessary to consider in more detail the concept of "investment" with their classification. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Among experts today there is no general opinion about the wording of this concept.  However, when summarizing the available theoretical material, it can be formulated that investment means the released funds of business entities or individuals that are withdrawn from current use for investment in a specific direction and bring benefits in the future. </p><p>  As such funds can be used intellectual, property, financial values ‚Äã‚Äãthat are invested in any kind of activity with the aim of obtaining a social effect or profit. </p><p>  The state investment policy is aimed at long-term investment of resources in enterprises of strategically important sectors of the economy. </p><p>  Investments can be represented in cash, various bank deposits, stocks, shares and other securities, <span>property (movable</span> and immovable), property rights, rights to use natural resources, etc. </p><p>  The investment policy of the state is implemented through the relevant activities of citizens and <span>entities of the business</span> sector.  The objects of such activities include fixed assets created and modernized, working capital, land and securities.  The subjects of investment activity are considered to be investors, contractors and users of objects, suppliers of <span>inventory items,</span> compatriots and citizens of foreign countries, and other investment companies.  Based on the listed entities, the following <span>types of investments</span> are distinguished: </p><p>  - ordinary citizens; </p><p>  - state or foreign; </p><p>  - non-state enterprises; </p><p>  - joint investment. </p><p>  But depending on the values ‚Äã‚Äãinvested, real, intellectual and financial investments are distinguished. </p>
