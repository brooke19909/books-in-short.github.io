  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Korean mythology: characters, legends and myths</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For many centuries, Korea has been a cultural and ideological mediator between East Asia and the population of the Pacific Islands (mainly Japan).  Her mythology was formed under the influence of Indian-Buddhist and Chinese civilizations.  The culture of the ancient Koreans, which is autochthonous in nature, that is, characteristic only for this territory, has presented mankind with many unique myths and legends that have been included in the treasury of world literature. </p><div class="photo" data-original="aminoapps.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The mysterious world of ancient legends" class="if uuid-2465917" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31546/2465917.jpg"></div><h2>  The story embodied in myths </h2><p>  The earliest examples of myths and legends were discovered by scholars in the chronicles of the ancient states of Silla, Baekje and Kogur, who were in different historical periods in the territory adjacent to modern Pyongyang.  In addition, notes on Korean mythology are contained in the Chinese stories of famous dynasties.  However, the most complete representation of this genre of folk art is given by the first official Korean annals called the Samguk Sagi.  It is dated 1145. </p><p>  Studying this historical monument, one can notice that the characters of Korean mythology are taken mainly from the history of the country or from folk tales, and from the world of the gods to a much lesser extent.  They reflect the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãpeople about their ancestors, as well as about the heroes to whom historical authenticity is attributed.  A separate group is made up of cult myths, which explain the origin of all kinds of rites.  They are usually associated with Confucianism or Buddhism, and often with demonology. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Royal bear offspring </h2><p>  We begin our short review with the myth of Tangun, since this character is traditionally assigned the role of the founder of the ancient state of Joseon, who was on the site of the current South Korean capital.  According to legend, the son of the lord of heaven, Hwangun, molested his father with requests to let him go to earth.  Finally he got his way.  Hvunoon with three hundred followers left the sky. </p><p>  On earth, he gave people laws, taught crafts and agriculture, which is why they healed richly and happily.  Seeing the picture of general well-being, the tiger and the she-bear began to beg the celestial so that he would turn them into people.  He agreed, but with the condition that they pass the test.  It was required for 100 days not to see sunlight, and in food to limit itself to only 20 wedges of garlic and a stalk of wormwood. </p><p>  After 20 days, the tiger abandoned this venture, and the bear passed the test and turned into a woman.  However, an unsatisfied thirst for motherhood prevented her from feeling happy.  Descending to the requests of the sufferer, Hwanun married her.  From their marriage, according to an ancient legend, that same Tangun was born, who inherited the throne from his father and founded the Joseon state.  A characteristic feature of Korean folklore is that it often indicates the specific place and time of the events described.  So, in this case, the exact date of the beginning of the reign of Tangun is given - 2333 BC.  e. </p><h2>  Korean version of the creation of the world </h2><p>  In Korean mythology, as in any other, popular beliefs about the creation of the world were reflected, and they were different in different parts of the peninsula.  So, according to one version, the sun, moon and stars are nothing more than earthly children who climbed to heaven in search of salvation from the tiger.  Perhaps the one who did not have enough endurance to become a man.  As for the seas, lakes and rivers, they were created by the giants on the orders of their mistress Hallasan, so huge that mountains served as pillows for her. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.ancient-origins.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Legendary Hwanun with a bear and a tiger" class="if uuid-2465962" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31546/2465962.jpg"></div><p>  The nature of eclipses explains in ancient legends.  According to the version cited in them, the Sun and the Moon are relentlessly pursued by the fire dogs sent by the prince of Darkness.  They try to swallow the heavenly bodies, but each time they are forced to retreat, because one of them is daytime, unusually hot, and nightly too cold.  As a result, the dogs can only tear off a piece from them.  With that, they return to their master. </p><p>  Regarding how the first people came into being, several versions are given in Korean mythology.  According to the most common of them, the sky fairy sparked with love for the laurel tree.  From their union came the ancestors of modern Koreans.  Propagating in a completely traditional way, they populated the entire territory of the <span>Korean Peninsula.</span> </p><p>  Special sacredness was given to the sky, where many amazing creatures of Korean mythology lived.  The most significant among them was the ruler of the world, Khanynim.  His closest assistants were the Sun (it was depicted as a raven with three legs) and the Moon.  She was usually given the appearance of a toad.  In addition, the vault of heaven housed a countless host of spirits that controlled the animal world, ponds, weather conditions, as well as mountains, hills and valleys. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The myth of Mount Amisan </h2><p>  In the north-east of South Korea is Mount Amisan, the upper part of which is bifurcated, which makes it look like a two-humped camel.  An ancient legend tells about the origin of its so unusual form.  It turns out that in ancient times the mountain had the most ordinary appearance.  At her foot lived a poor peasant woman with a son and daughter.  This woman was modest and inconspicuous, but her children were born giants.  The legend does not say anything about their father. </p><p>  Once they started a contest in strength and endurance, and the winner got the right to kill the loser.  According to the condition, the boy had to run 150 miles in heavy steel shoes in a day, and his sister in the meantime would erect a stone wall around Mount Amisan.  The damsel, apparently, was working.  By evening, she was already finishing the job, but her mother suddenly called her to dinner.  Interrupting the unfinished building, she went home.  At this time, a breathless brother came running, covering the prescribed distance in a day. </p><p>  Seeing that the wall was not ready, he considered himself a winner.  Drawing his sword, he chopped off his sister's head.  However, his joy was overshadowed by his mother‚Äôs story that because of her daughter did not have time to complete the work begun.  Realizing the mistake, the son felt dishonored.  Not wanting to bear the shame, he tried to plunge the blade into his own chest, but deadly weapons bounced off it and flew off towards the mountain.  Hitting the top, the sword left a notch that gave it the shape of a two-humped camel.  This story occupies a very prominent place in Korean mythology.  Nowadays it is told to all tourists visiting Mount Amisan. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bbc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Legendary Amisan Mountain" class="if uuid-2465980" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31546/2465980.jpg"></div><h2>  Tales of Good Dragons </h2><p>  From the inhabitants of China, the ancient Koreans took over the love of dragons, which their imagination gave rise to an unusually large number.  Each of them was given special features, depending on his place of residence.  In contrast to the ideas rooted among European and most Slavic peoples, in Asia these terrible-looking creatures were perceived as positive characters.  Korean dragons, for example, helped people with their miracles, fought evil in every way possible.  They were indispensable companions of the rulers. </p><p>  In folklore, the legend of a long-lived dragon named En is very popular.  Unlike most of his brethren, he was a mortal creature.  Having lived a long life at the palaces of local rulers, Yong once felt that his earthly path was completed.  On his deathbed, he promised that, being in a different world, he would forever remain the patron of Korea and the East (Japanese) Sea washing its shores. </p><p>  Folk fantasy inhabited dragons lakes, rivers and even ocean depths, from where they sent rains so necessary for the fields and forests.  These mythical animals appear not only in the oral legends of Koreans, but also in all fields of art without exception.  They even penetrated into politics, where from time immemorial they were considered the personification of emperors.  At the same time, none of the lower rulers were allowed to use their symbols. </p><p>  The external difference between Korean dragons and their relatives, spread throughout the world, is the absence of wings and the presence of a long beard.  In addition, they are often portrayed holding in one of their paws a certain symbol of power, reminiscent of a royal power.  It is called Eiju.  According to legend, that daredevil who manages to wrest him from the clutches of a monster will become omnipotent and gain immortality.  Many tried to do this, but, having failed, laid down their heads.  Dragons to this day do not miss Eiju from their clutches. </p><h2>  The closest relatives of Korean dragons </h2><p>  These fantastic creatures include giant snakes, known as "Imugi."  There are two versions of what they are in Korean mythology.  According to one of them, these are former dragons, but cursed by the gods for some wrongdoing and deprived of their main decoration - horns and beards.  These creatures will serve the sentence imposed on them for a thousand years, after which (subject to decent behavior) they will be returned to their previous status. </p><p>  According to another version, Imugi are not delinquent creatures, but dragon larvae that take a thousand years to develop into full-fledged fairytale reptiles with horns and beard.  Be that as it may, but it is customary to portray them in the form of huge good-natured snakes, somewhat reminiscent of modern pythons.  According to legend, they live in caves or deep bodies of water.  Having met people, Imugi bring them good luck. </p><div class="photo" data-original="aminoapps.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dragon of Korean mythology" class="if uuid-2465990" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31546/2465990.jpg"></div><p>  There is another curious creature in Korean mythology, which is an analogue of the well-known snake that has many fabulous properties.  It is called "Keren," which literally means "dragon-cock."  He is assigned a modest role as a servant in more powerful <span>mythical heroes.</span>  Many ancient images of this snake harnessed to the carts of reigning persons have been preserved.  However, once he had a chance to excel.  According to legend, from the egg of this Korean basilisk in 57 BC.  e.  the princess was born, who became the founder of the ancient state of Silla. </p><h2>  Perfume - guardians of dwellings </h2><p>  In addition to dragons, in Korean mythology a significant place is given to the images of other fairy-tale characters who relentlessly accompanied a person throughout his life.  These are the closest relatives of our Slavic brownies - very funny creatures called "tokabe". </p><p>  They settle in people's dwellings, but do not hide behind the stove, but start a very stormy activity: they reward the owner of the house with gold for good deeds and spoil him for bad deeds.  Tokkebi willingly become interlocutors of people, and on occasion even drinking buddies.  They are usually depicted as horned dwarfs covered with wool.  On their faces they always wear masks in the form of animal faces. </p><p>  The ancient Koreans entrusted to preserve their homes from all sorts of misfortunes and misfortunes, not only all kinds of spirits, but also to the deities that made up the highest heavenly pantheon.  It is known that the patroness of the dwellings of the opschin enjoyed constant veneration.  This generous celestial lady not only protected families from disasters, but also attracted luck and wealth. </p><p>  However, despite all the blessings, among other Korean gods, she stood out by the fact that folk fantasy "awarded" her unpleasant appearance - a snake, spider, toad or rat.  In real life, it was strictly forbidden to kill these creatures for fear of incurring the wrath of the goddess Opschin. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DPRK Political Poster" class="if uuid-2465996" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31546/2465996.jpg"></div><h2>  "Communist Godzilla" </h2><p>  In addition to the dragons, which were discussed above, among the mythical animals of Korea, chimeras called "bulgasari" were very popular.  They were a fantastic hybrid of a tiger, a horse and a bear.  In humans, these creatures were grateful for protecting the sleeping from bad dreams.  However, for this they had to be fed, and they fed exclusively on iron, which at that time was very expensive. </p><p>  It is curious that today the image of pulgasari is often used in Korean cinema as an ideological element.  According to legend, the monster was created from rice grains, and then helped the peasants in the fight against the feudal exploiters.  In this regard, the nickname of "Communist Godzilla" was even established behind him. </p><h2>  Demons in the representation of the inhabitants of Korea </h2><p>  Korean mythology is also very rich in demons, one of the varieties of which is called "Kvishchin."  According to legend, these evil and treacherous creatures are born every time when one of the people leaves the world as a result of violent death or becomes the victim of an unjust sentence.  In these cases, his soul does not find rest.  Having gained <span>supernatural powers,</span> she takes revenge on everyone left on earth. </p><p>  Among all the demons of Korean mythology, a particular category is made up of kvishchins who were born as a result of the untimely death of unmarried girls.  These spirits of darkness are extremely embittered, because they, being in the human body, were deprived of the opportunity to fulfill the main female destiny - to marry and have a baby.  They are depicted in the form of gloomy ghosts, dressed in mourning clothes, on top of which long strands of white hair flow. </p><p>  From Japanese folklore, the Koreans borrowed the image of Kumiho, a nine-tailed fox who used to turn into a woman to seduce naive men.  Alone with another victim for love pleasures, the evil werewolf devoured her heart.  According to Korean demonology, each Kumijo is a real woman in the past, cursed for excessive lust, therefore doomed to destroy her lovers. </p><p>  The curse imposed on her does not last forever.  It can be removed, but for this a werewolf-fox must refrain from killing for a thousand days, and this is beyond her power.  There is another way of "healing."  It consists in the fact that the man who saw Kumijo in someone should keep his discovery a secret.  But this path is unlikely, because it‚Äôs hard not to share such news with others. </p><div class="photo" data-original="aminoapps.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Seven-Tailed Werewolf Fox" class="if uuid-2466054" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31546/2466054.jpg"></div><h2>  Types of Demons in Korean Mythology </h2><p>  Along with worshiping the sky, on which the well-being and life of people depends, Koreans have long spiritualized all visible nature, inhabiting it with countless armies of demons and spirits.  It is generally accepted that these fantastic creatures not only fill themselves with air, land and sea, but are also found in every stream, ravine and forest thicket.  They literally teem with chimneys, cellars and closets.  You can hardly find a place inaccessible to them. </p><p>  According to Korean mythology, demons come in two categories, each of which has its own characteristics.  To the first belong the spirits who came from hell to do evil and do harm to people in every way.  In union with him, the souls of the deceased poor and those whose life path was full of deprivation are working.  After becoming demons after death, they roam the earth, taking out their anger at everyone who comes in their way. </p><p> The second category includes demons born in the dark depths of the other world, but capable of good deeds.  Their closest allies are the shadows of people whose life was full of happiness and virtue.  All of them do not refuse good deeds, but the trouble is that by their nature they are extremely touchy and capricious. </p><p>  In order to get the desired help from these demons, people have to ‚Äúcajole‚Äù them with sacrifices first.  In Korea, a whole system of rituals was developed for this occasion, allowing earthly people to enter into communication with otherworldly forces.  It is generally accepted that the happiness and well-being of each person depends on his ability to win over good, but wayward demons. </p><h2>  A horse that has become a symbol of the nation </h2><p>  A peculiar product of folk fantasy was the Korean mythical winged horse named Chollino, capable of overcoming vast distances in the blink of an eye.  For all his merits, he had such a frantic disposition that none of the riders could sit on him.  Once soaring into the sky, the horse melted in azure blue.  In North Korea, the horse of Chollima is a symbol of the movement of the nation along the path of progress.  His name is called the mass popular movement, similar to that which in the USSR was called Stakhanovsky. </p><p>  In the capital of North Korea, Pyongyang, the name of the winged horse is one of the subway lines.  It is also assigned to the national football team.  Since the revolutionary spirit of the North Korean people is embodied in the image of this mythical creature, it is often used to create posters and sculptural compositions of an ideological orientation.  One of them is presented in our article above. </p><h2>  Mermaids </h2><p>  In addition to the brownie named Tokkebi mentioned above, mermaids are also present in Korean mythology.  More precisely, there is one mermaid, whose name is Ino.  She, like the Slavic virgin waters, is a half-woman-half-fish.  Ino lives in the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãJapan near Jeju Island. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="One of the varieties of Korean mermaids" class="if uuid-2465953" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31546/2465953.jpg"></div><p>  Outwardly, it is very different from the inhabitants of the Dnieper and Volga backwaters.  According to eyewitnesses (they say there were more than a hundred such people), this ‚Äúbeauty‚Äù has six or seven pairs of long legs, which is why its bottom half does not resemble an octopus, but a fish.  Her body, arms and head are quite human, but covered with smooth and slippery skin, like a burbot.  A long horse tail complements the image of a sea maiden. </p><p>  Periodically, the mermaid Ino produces offspring that feeds breast milk.  She is a very caring mother.  When one of the children upsets her, she cries bitterly.  Tears, emerging from the eyes, immediately turn into pearls.  In Korean folklore, she is given the place of a completely friendly character. </p><h2>  Heirs of mythical mermaids </h2><p>  Near the island of Jeju, the creators of legends noticed another variety of sea maidens, who also had a very extravagant appearance.  Small scales covered them, and instead of arms, fins protruded on the sides.  In their lower body, like all decent mermaids, a fish tail was placed.  Representatives of this type of mythical creatures, dubbed "Hene", loved to have fun, but their entertainment was far from always harmless.  ‚ÄúIt is for certain‚Äù known that some of them, turning into beautiful maidens, lured gullible men into the deep sea. </p><p>  It is curious to note that at present the name "Hene" is carried in Korea by unique women - professional divers from Jeju Island.  Diving without scuba diving to a depth of 30 meters, they are engaged in the industrial collection of oysters, sea urchins and other seafood.  It seems unbelievable, but their average age ranges from 70 to 80 years.  They do not have young followers.  Hene divers, as recognized by the Korean government, are the island's trademark, its endangered cultural heritage. </p>
