  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Chittagong port city in Bangladesh. Description, attractions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In our article, we will talk about the port city of Chittagong in Bangladesh.  We will consider the attractions that will interest tourists from around the world.  Note that the city of Chittagong (Bangladesh) is located in the south-east of the country, 19 km from the mouth of the Karnapuli River. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  It is the administrative and tourist center, the largest - the second city in Bangladesh.  The reason for the popularity of Chittagong among tourists was its good location between the mountainous regions and the sea, a large number of monasteries and a beautiful sea coast.  Guests of the country are interested in the life of the original hill tribes who inhabited the famous hills of this city.  Chittagong has experienced a lot of dramatic events in its history, which is why it is famous for its characteristic mix of different cultures and architectural styles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="memorial cemetery" class="if uuid-3209671" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/3209671.jpg"></div><h2>  Major Attractions in Chittagong (Bangladesh) </h2><p>  The main decoration of the city is the old Sadarghat district.  It appeared with the appearance of the city at the turn of the millennium.  The area was populated by wealthy merchants and ship captains.  By the way, Sadarghat is one of the few in Bangladesh where Christianity is still practiced. </p><p>  In the old part of the city there are many different attractions.  These include: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Mosques of Quadam-Mubarak. </li><li>  Bayazid Bostami Shrine. </li><li>  The mosque of Shahi Jama-e-Masjid.  She is very similar to a fortress. </li><li>  Shrines of Dargah-Sah-Amanat. </li><li>  Chandanpur Mosque. </li><li>  Fairy Hill Court Complex. </li><li>  Mausoleum of Bad Shah. </li></ol><p>  Many of the above attractions are not in the best condition, but this gives the city a special touch. </p><h2>  Other sights of the city </h2><p>  Tourists in Chittagong in Bangladesh are advised to visit the Ethnological Museum, which is located in the Modern City area.  It presents interesting exhibits with elements and attributes of the peoples and tribes that previously inhabited this country. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ethnological museum" class="if uuid-3209776" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/3209776.jpg"></div><p>  Tourists should visit: </p><ol><li>  Memorial cemetery for the victims of World War II. </li><li>  Patenga Beach. </li><li>  Picturesque reservoir Foy.  It is located about 8 km from the center of Chittagong in Bangladesh.  The local population calls the reservoir a lake, although it actually formed in 1924 during the construction of the railway dam. </li></ol><p>  Amazing views of Chittagong from the British City and Fairy Hill Hills.  Despite the fact that it is constantly hot here, a cool sea wind blows, thanks to which you can often meet a large number of vacationers in this place.  True, people do not stay here for long, since the main attraction is the hilly areas just east of Chittagong in Bangladesh. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Famous Ship Cemetery </h2><p>  The famous ship cemetery deserves special attention.  His story began in 1960.  This year the Alpine was washed ashore.  Attempts to take him aground did not lead to positive results, so after five years he was decommissioned.  A local company acquired it and quickly dismantled it for scrap using cheap labor.  In the 90s, the largest ship recycling center appeared here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.independent.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ship cemetery" class="if uuid-3209691" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/3209691.jpg"></div><p>  It is one of the most polluted places in the world.  More than two hundred ships are brought here every year - it is in this place that they find their last refuge.  Thanks to the old ships, work appears here for locals who take apart each vessel to the last screw.  Work takes place in terrible conditions, and locals receive very little reward for their work, but they are happy about it, as there is no decent alternative for employment. </p><p>  Before the main dismantling work begins, the ship is delivered to the port, put aground.  After fuel and oil are drained, everything possible is removed - from equipment to furniture.  All that remains is sent for recycling. </p><p>  An amazing but sad sight attracts tourists from all over the world. </p>
