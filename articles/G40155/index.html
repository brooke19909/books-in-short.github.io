    <p>  The resort village of Vityazevo is famous for its mild climate, sand dunes and incredibly clean sea air.  In addition, guests of this tourist complex will enjoy impeccable comfort, a great atmosphere of serenity and relaxation, quality service, beautiful and comfortable rooms, and most importantly - a reasonable price for all this! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By the way, thanks to such unique characteristics, the Venera Resort Hotel (hotel; Russia, Vityazevo) has positive reviews in almost 100% of cases, but we will discuss this in more detail at the end of our article. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  One of the main advantages of this institution is its location (1st coastline).  Also, the guests of the project believe that a large selection of rooms of different categories is an important advantage.  It is quite logical that a hotel complex with 5 different types of rooms will be more popular than a somewhat similar establishment, where, for example, two different categories of rooms are available for order. </p><p>  The Venera Resort <span>Hotel (Vityazevo) is</span> ideal not only for family vacations, but also for people who want to turn their short vacation into an interesting adventure. </p><p>  For lovers of sunbathing and swimming there is a special advantage - a clean sandy beach, where not only adults, but also children will like it.  By the way, it is also worth noting that the windows of the Venera Resort Hotel offer a gorgeous view that even world-class hotels will envy. </p><h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  At this stage of its development, the tourist complex is represented by a huge number of various infrastructure objects.  For example, you can visit the large outdoor pool, whose area is 300 square meters. </p><p>  For those who love delicious and beautiful food, a restaurant is constantly working here.  There you can order a variety of culinary masterpieces, the preparation of which will be handled by the most experienced chefs of Russia and other countries. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Adults dream of being children, and their small copies want to be more adult.  If you come to a hotel with children or just want to have a great time, then be sure to go to the entertainment zone, in the territory of which everyone can enjoy pastime! </p>

    <p>  As you already understood, Hotel Venera Resort (Hotel Venera Resort) never forgets about children, therefore, in addition to them, there is also a playground and a special room on the territory of the tourist complex.

In addition, yogurt, milk, kefir or fermented baked milk will be an ideal complement to the main meal. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If you are a person accustomed to a rich breakfast, then be aware that Hotel Venera Resort (Hotel Venera Resort, Vityazevo) additionally offers you to order a classic European breakfast consisting of an omelet or a classic scrambled egg with sausages, bacon or other ingredients. </p>
