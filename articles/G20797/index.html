Indeed, it is at this time that I want to be near the pond, soak up the sun, plunge into the warm water.  Many people, having waited for their vacation, go on a trip.  Not far from St. Petersburg is <span>Lake Ladoga.</span>  Even considering that water is rarely heated to a comfortable temperature in the water area, there is still no end to the tourists here.  What is remarkable about this place?  First of all, by nature.  She is truly unique here.  Also, many come to these parts in order to visit the island of Koyonsaari.  Once on it, you just won‚Äôt believe that it is located near civilization.  Tourists can enjoy the beautiful virgin nature, the cleanest sandy beach, the length of which is about 2 km, cliffs and a clean lake.  Access by car is prohibited, <span>recreation centers,</span> cafes, shops and other similar establishments are not here.  Tourists can only stay on the island with tents in designated areas.  There are several rules that can never be violated.  For example, deforestation (even if you only need a couple of branches), hunting animals, litter only in special containers, etc. It is worth noting that it was thanks to this attitude that the island managed to preserve the original flora and fauna. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="koyonsaari island" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1444151.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is located near the Arctic Circle.  Consists in a group of Western <span>Ladoga skerries.</span>  Administratively refers to the Republic of Karelia, located in the Lahdenpoh district.  Next to it are two settlements: Kurkijki and Vyatikk√§.  Until the 40s of the twentieth century, the island was called Haseksensaari.  Subsequently, it was renamed Koyonsaari.  There is no official version of the origin of such an appellation, but, according to local residents, it came from a Finnish surname - Kojo (Rus. Koyo). </p><p>  The island in <span>Lake Ladoga</span> is small.  In length from west to east, it stretches only 2.4 km, and in width does not even reach 1.5 km.  Rocks are found on Koyonsaari, however they are not high - up to 51 m. It has always been considered the most popular tourist attraction.  The sandy beaches, which are not characteristic of this area, contributed to this.  Among the people they are called the "Pearl of Ladoga".  The coastline has the shape of a crescent moon, deployed specifically to the lake. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather on Lake Ladoga" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1444153.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Historical data </h2><p>  At the beginning of the XXI century, the island of Koyonsaari began to rapidly gain popularity.  Several times there were attempts to rent the entire territory.  Local residents said that in 2003 there were signs indicating a change of name, but this was not officially confirmed.  Two years later, the construction of the bridge that connected Koyonsaari with the mainland was completed.  This has led to a significant increase in the flow of tourists.  In 2013, conservationists discovered the start of illegal construction on the island.  There were many appeals to the minister, the prosecutor's office with a request to ban the destruction of protected forests of Lake Ladoga.  Only temporary structures are allowed on the island.  Recently, esoteric festivals have been held at Koyonsaari. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Climatic features </h2><p>  The weather on Lake Ladoga is not particularly pleasing with warmth.  The climate is temperate.  There are only about 60 really warm days in a year. The greatest amount of precipitation falls in early autumn.  And in a year this indicator averages 475 mm.  Mostly in this region, cloudy weather with prolonged cloudiness is established.  In winter, the duration of daylight hours is only 6 hours, but in summer it lasts more than 18 hours. Surprised?  And everything is extremely simple, in May, the "white nights" begin, which end around mid-July.  As for temperatures, it sets -8 ... -9 ¬∞  above the lake in winter, and on average +16 ¬∞  in summer.  Given these indicators, it becomes clear that water is rarely comfortable for swimming.  Also, the weather on Lake Ladoga depends on the wind.  This region is dominated by western and southwestern air currents.  Their feature is that during the day they can change direction several times.  Their average speed fluctuates around 5 m / s.  There is almost no calm, but stormy winds are a frequent occurrence.  At these intervals, the flow velocity reaches 20 m / s.  At the end of summer, a nebula is added to the clouds. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="island in Ladoga lake" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1444155.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Features of rest </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, it is forbidden to call on Koyonsaari Island by road.  Tourists leave their personal cars in paid parking lots or directly on the highway at their own risk.  What will surprise this island?  First of all, the beach.  They heard about him not only in Karelia, but also throughout Russia, as well as beyond its borders.  Forest plantation is represented by pine trees.  In summer, there are many mushrooms and berries.  Animals live in the forest.  Tourists need to be extremely careful, as several species of snakes are found on the island, some of them are poisonous.  Lovers of outdoor activities go for a walk to the rocks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="koyonsaari island how to get" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1444154.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Koyonsaari Island: how to get there? </h2><p>  In order to reach the island by car, you must move from Priozersk on the A-129 highway.  The first to appear is Kurkijki village.  After about 7 km there will be a turn to Vyatikka.  You still need to drive 6 km to the village.  From this place, if there is a boat, you can continue on the water.  If you continue to move by car, then you will still have to drive 2 km.  And already from this place the reserve zone begins, on which it is necessary to move only on foot.  The road to the island takes no more than 2 hours. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="recreation center on koyonsaari island" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1444164.jpg" width="600"></div>
