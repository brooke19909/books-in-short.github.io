Queensland - a state in which you can combine a spa holiday with a sightseeing.  The Gold Coast is considered the beach capital of Australia.  But when you get bored of basking in the sun, and you want something extreme, go on an excursion to Mount Tamborin.  But be prepared for the difficulties - the route passes through a very steep slope. </p><p>  Climbing a mountain, you will see an amazing waterfall: in it, water appears as if from a void.  There really is no river, so it is completely unclear where the water comes from.  Swimming is prohibited here - poisonous trees surround the waterfall.  Their villi, getting on the skin, cause intolerable pain.  In ancient times, Mount Tamborin was an active volcano.  Today, people live on the crest of the crater, and around it are vineyards. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Queensland Attractions" class="if" height="352" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1761318.jpg" width="600"></div>
