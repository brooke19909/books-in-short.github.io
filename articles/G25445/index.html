This is the second longest coastline in the city within Brazil.  Officially, the city is divided into 34 administrative units, but residents are used to breaking it into four parts: North, South, West and the Historical Center.  In the south and west are concentrated beaches of the city, which have their own characteristics. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  Brazil is in the subequatorial climate zone, the average annual temperature in Rio de Janeiro is +23 degrees.  It has hot summers and warm winters.  Precipitation is distributed evenly throughout the seasons, but July and August are more arid than the other months.  The hottest are January and February.

    <h2>  Ipanema </h2><p>  Today, the question of what is the name of the famous Rio de Janeiro beach is increasingly heard in response: Ipanema.  This is one of the most prestigious places in the city.  Geographically, the beach is a continuation of Copacabana.  A song about a girl from Ipanema added fame to this place.  This beach is a more upscale analogue of the famous Copacabana.  In the shadow of the Two Brothers Mountain, the most important part of the beach with white sand, luxurious restaurants and cocktail bars, fashion boutiques, chic galleries and museums is located.  Here you can often see celebrities, come here in swimsuits from the best designers in the world.  The public on Ipanema is more decent than on neighboring Copacabana, and the level of security is higher. </p><h2>  Leblon </h2><p>  Leblon is a prestigious area of ‚Äã‚ÄãRio de Janeiro.  Leblon Beach is the most peaceful place on the coast of the city.  According to vacationers, this is the best place to relax with children.  Beach decoration is the Seventh Heaven rock.  On the shore there are many playgrounds, complexes, attractions.  Leblon has the most calm course.  But you do not need to think that there is a continuous playground.  The beach is loved by the "golden" youth and a respectable audience for their peace and security.  The upper part of the beach is calmer, wealthy tourists and locals relax here, and the lower is more suitable for entertainment, it contains many bars and discos.  Near Leblon is an elite residential area and reputable hotels. </p>

    <h2>  Urka </h2><p>  The most calm course is on Urka beach, swimming lovers come here.  The beach is located at the Sugarloaf itself, on the background of which perfect photos are obtained.  Near Urca are the most inexpensive and decent hotels in Rio de Janeiro.  Local schoolchildren and students can often be seen on the beach, and a university campus is nearby.  The disadvantage of Urka beach is its high pollution.  Relatively stagnant water does not take garbage from the shore and therefore swimming here can not always be pleasant; you need to swim away to overcome the dirty lane.  The surface of the beach, too, despite cleaning, can be very dirty in the evening.  But on Urka wonderful views of the city and the ocean.  From the restaurant on Sugarloaf you get great view photos. </p><h2>  Barra da Tijuca </h2><p>  This beach is a real mecca for surfers.  There are magnificent waves, and therefore people with boards spend off the coast of Barra da Tijuca almost round the clock.  Several schools are open for beginners; on the beach, you can rent any surf equipment.  This is the longest beach in Rio de Janeiro, its length is 18 km.  Therefore, there is enough space not only for surfers.  A big disadvantage of the beach is its proximity to the favelas (poor areas), whose inhabitants also like to spend time in this place.  But its length allows you to find a safe and suitable place to relax.  One edge of the beach adjoins a quite respectable area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city with a large number of boutiques, restaurants, good hotels.  In 2016, it was Barra da Tijuca that became the venue for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. </p>

    <h2>  Flamengo </h2><p>  The most authentic view of Brazil is preserved on Flamengo beach.  In a cozy bay, traditional nature and buildings have been preserved.  Lovers of familiar beach activities come here, they constantly grill barbecue, build sand castles and even hold competitions, play beach volleyball.  Flamengo offers the best views of the city of Rio de Janeiro.  Here you can find many locals who indulge in their favorite pursuits: sunbathe, fish, enjoy life.  Due to the not very high wave, garbage can accumulate at the coastline, and this is the only drawback of this beach. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Along with other attractions, the beaches brought Rio de Janeiro the glory of a city that knows how to please its guests. </p><p>  Travelers who have been to Rio de Janeiro consider themselves lucky.  Their reviews are almost always overwhelmed with positive emotions and admiration.  We mentioned all the positive points above. </p><p>  However, tourists say that local recreation has its drawbacks.  This is a large amount of garbage in the water and on the shore, and a high risk of being robbed.  Teenagers are constantly snooping around the beaches, as well as suspicious people loitering around.  In the evening, loud speech, swearing is heard on many beaches, even fights happen.  Therefore, tourists recommend choosing beaches and hotels in respectable places.  Let the rest come out more expensive, but safer. </p>
