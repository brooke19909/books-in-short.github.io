Translated from the Komi language, the name means "city by the Sysola River." </p><h2>  Vedomosti about the city </h2><p>  Finding out where Syktyvkar is located, we really see that a river flows nearby.  The city itself has been standing here since the year 1586.  However, the new name began to be used only in 1930. Before that, one could only hear about Ust-Sysolsk. </p>

    <p>  The forest surrounds Syktyvkar from all sides.  Where this place is located, it will become clear if on the map you find a settlement between the Vycherga and Sysola rivers.  It is the <span>capital of Komi.</span>  To understand where Syktyvkar is located, it is worth looking at the north-west of the Russian Federation.  From Moscow you need to drive 1300 km.  The area where Syktyvkar is located is 152 square kilometers.  The largest part falls to land, 5% of the territory has passed to ponds and wetlands. </p><h2>  Resource base </h2><p>  Studying the question of where the city of Syktyvkar is located, we see that forests prevail around, due to which the wood industry is very well developed.  72% of urban land is covered with dense tree thickets.  Here you can find many minerals, including mineral and ore.  This is peat, and valuable iron ore, and useful <span>oil shales,</span> and stone materials.  If you go down the city, you can find sources of fresh as well as healing mineral water. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A lot of valuable resources are located where <span>Syktyvkar</span> is located <span>.</span>  <span>What area is</span> still able to satisfy the need for valuable minerals for other Russian lands, if not the Komi Republic? </p><p>  The prevalence of temperate continental climate is noticeable here, since this place is located in the north-west of the country.  It is not hard to live here, since winters are very severe, and summer, unfortunately, is short.  In the area where Syktyvkar is located, winter temperatures can sometimes drop to minus 40 degrees.  Summer also does not pamper the inhabitants with heat.  The maximum is only 17 degrees of heat. </p>
