In those days, the treasury of the state was filled mainly due to tribute levied on conquered peoples.  The second item of income was trade.  She was also the engine of progress.  Cities were built mainly along the banks of the rivers that served as trade routes.  According to historical information, the Scythians had no other roads at all.  The coastal cities became first shopping centers, and then crafts developed in them.  In ancient Russia, a merchant is not only a merchant.  <span>Athanasius Nikitin, whose monument</span> was erected in Tver, in his homeland, was a <span>great traveler who</span> traveled "beyond the three seas", and a discoverer, and a diplomat.  And the famous legendary Novgorod merchant Sadko also went to the bottom of the sea.

    <h2>  Trade routes </h2><p>  Thanks to the exchange of goods and its representatives, merchants discovered such great trade routes as “from the Varangians to the Greeks”, “the Great Silk Road”, which is called the “crossroads of civilizations”, “Chumatsky Way”, the famous “Incense Way”, which crosses the <span>Arabian Peninsula,</span> and a lot others.  The merchants were Russian princes, forced to somehow get rid of excess natural tribute or accumulated money, spending them on overseas wonders.  The merchant is also the main informant in those distant times: “Okay, is it bad for the sea?  And what a miracle in the world? ”  - learned only from representatives of this multifaceted profession. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Peter's reforms touched everyone </h2><p>  This type of activity was respected, the merchants were an important estate at all times.  There were legends about the commercial enterprise of the Russians.  Ancient merchant houses often came to the aid of the state.  The richest Stroganovs discovered new lands, built factories, erected temples.  Some historical studies say that Peter I defeated the merchants, which killed many types of Russian crafts, beloved and supported by merchants.  The tsar carried out reforms, as a result of which the old form of merchants' associations “hundreds” was abolished, and guilds replaced them.  <span>It</span> was good or bad, but the merchants did not perish. </p><h2>  Rich and kind </h2>

For example, the Rukovishnikovs.  The Moscow dynasty founded a noble family, and Ivan Vasilyevich (1843-1901) rose to the rank of Privy Councilor.  The Novgorod dynasty, the founder of which was a resourceful peasant, already in the third generation began to belong to the upper class.  The motto of this family was the words "sacrifice and guardianship."  The same can be said of a very large number of Russian entrepreneurs.  This is the special mentality of the domestic merchant.  The Russian merchant is in most cases a benefactor and patron.  The names of the largest merchants-patrons, the memory left by them occupy a special place in Russian history.  Who does not know the merchant Tretyakov, the founder of the art gallery of his name.  Everyone who is even a little familiar with the history of Russia knows the names and deeds of the best representatives of this estate - the Mamontovs and Morozovs (the legendary Savva Morozov), Naydenovs and Botkins, Schukins and Prokhorovs.  A large number of hospitals, charity houses, theaters and libraries of Russia were built at the expense of merchants.

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian merchant" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/556696.jpg" width="328"></div>  However, in Russian literature the image of a merchant is rather negative.  In many of Ostrovsky’s plays, the merchant’s environment is ridiculed, and the merchant himself is more like a cunning freak than an educated, generous person.  Kustodiev’s merchants and merchants personify what is mockingly called “merchant taste”.  Traits and reviews of foreigners add to the negative image.  In this regard, I want to note that there are very few Russians about whom foreigners respond well, in general.  Their opinion should not be a sentence.  Many famous writers laughed at the merchants.  But Kalashnikov at Lermontov is very good.  The best features of the merchants are concentrated in it - honesty, decency, courage, willingness to give their lives for the good name of a loved one.  There were, of course, rogues in this environment.  And in what environment are they not?  And then, the merchants, as noted above, were divided into guilds.  To the "third", with little capital (500 rubles), any irresponsible people could belong.  But the wealthy Russian merchants, living in full view of everyone, thinking about their brand, for the most part were little to say conscientious and decent, but fanatically honest people.  “Merchant's word” is not a legend.  Of course, not all transactions were concluded only verbally.  But this merchant's word held tight, otherwise it would not have become a legend in the good sense of the word.
