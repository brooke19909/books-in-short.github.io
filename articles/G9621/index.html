    <p>  The main material is jute cord.  It is not difficult to purchase a twine spool.  For multi-colored works, it is painted with acrylic paint in a wide variety of colors. <br>  Scissors, tweezers, an awl, a thin knitting needle, transparent glue "Titan" or any other similar purpose will also be needed.  The use of all kinds of additional materials is not ruled out.  As such, bamboo sticks, wire for the frame of products, as well as rhinestones for decorative decoration, are used.  Acrylic varnish covers finished crafts. </p><h2>  How to learn jute filigree technique? </h2><p>  Like any creative undertaking, jute filigree requires special training.  This technique can be learned from experienced craftsmen who own it.  Jute filigree for beginners will open its huge possibilities under the guidance of experienced craftsmen.  Practical exercises will be very useful.  They will undoubtedly, in the shortest possible time, help to master the technique of performing work and allow an inexperienced creative person to acquire an interesting hobby.  The secrets and subtleties of performing such work, the choice of material is easier to learn in a practical lesson.  However, in the absence of this feature, jute filigree for beginners will be clear after reading this article. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Experienced craftsmen advise those wishing to engage in this type of <span>applied art</span> to start with the simplest.  And only the acquisition of certain skills will allow you to swing at something serious. </p><h2>  Work technique </h2><p>  Work begins with a choice of drawing.  Let it be a plain sketch.  We make a clear sketch on paper or use the finished one.  For convenience, a sheet with a sketch is placed in a stationery plastic (transparent) file. </p><p>  Begin work with a neat and very careful application of glue along the entire contour of the sketch of the drawing.  Now, over the adhesive contour, lay out segments of twine.  It should be noted that the jute thread is heterogeneous.  When laying it should be slightly straightened and twisted.  Many craftsmen do not apply glue to the outline of the sketch, but directly to the twine itself.  It is folded into curls with tweezers and tightly laid on an adhesive base.  With a thin metal knitting needle, the thread is straightened according to the drawing.  Thus, the entire field is filled. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Jute Filigree Schemes" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11768/397768.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <p>  After processing the entire sketch, the jute filigree is not yet ready.  Spend drying.  To do this, the workpiece is placed under the press.  After six hours, the glue will dry well.  Remove the press and carefully separate the craft.  For this purpose, you can use a knife or other sharp object.  Now the work is done.  Depending on the creative idea, the finished craft can consist of several fragments made using the technique of jute filigree.  In this case, all parts of the craft are being worked out.  Each part is sequentially worked out in the same sequence.  Then the finished parts are fastened together.  In schemes, very often, apart from twine, various decorative materials are used, which are attached to the sketch with glue.  More complex volumetric work is performed on metal or glass frames. </p><h2>  Graceful crafts in everyday life </h2><p>  Jute filigree will help to decorate the <span>interior of an office</span> or apartment.  Flowerpots and caskets can serve as a decorative component.  Not be superfluous will be panels and frames for paintings or photographs.  In any form, jute filigree is beautiful. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Jute filigree master class" class="if" height="436" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11768/398590.jpg" width="485"></div>  Schemes for performing all kinds of drawings for panels and crafts can be found in the literature.  But very often, masters of this technique come up with them on their own.  Starting from the simplest drawings, gradually moving to more complex intricate sketches, they create delightful masterpieces.  There is no limit to the flight of fantasy.  Fans made in this style or lampshades for table lamps are incomparable works of art.  The most ordinary material turns into beautiful products that will always be a great gift for friends.
