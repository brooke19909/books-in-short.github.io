Its predecessor, presented in 2006, for a long time remained the most accessible device for the user.  At the same time, he had good technical specifications, allowing you to take very good pictures.  And now the first "Mark" remains a competitive device for a good price. </p><p>  The output of the Canon Mark 2 5D camera was unexpected news for many.  Users wondered: why the new model, when the past is still not outdated and brings revenue to the company?  The answer here is simple.  The successor was due to the rapid growth of the DSLR market, as well as attention from professional photographers.  ‚ÄúCanon‚Äù could not stand aside when other firms actively flooded the market with fresh models. </p>

    <p>  It is worth saying right away that the "Canon Mark 2 5D" is an expensive "soap box".  The device belongs to the class of professional.  It requires some skills from the user.  It has complicated and incomprehensible controls for a beginner, a bunch of shooting modes.  But the result is excellent pictures.  Simply put, Canon Mark 2 5D is a good option for experienced photographers.  For beginners, it is better to look at the devices easier. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Ergonomics </h2><p>  This is one of the key points of each device, and even more so the camera.  Ergonomics should be addressed first.  Understanding if the camera is right for you or not is very simple.  It lies well in the hand - you can buy, badly - it is better to refuse.  Devices in which ergonomics are "lame" are usually difficult to use.  "Canon Mark 2 5D" stands out from its competitors in a stunningly designed case that allows you to firmly clasp the device with one hand.  It is not heavy, but not quite light - the golden mean.  If you take a Canon Mark 2 5D camera, you understand that this is an ideal SLR camera. </p>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  The case of the model is made of high-quality magnesium alloy, the frame is made of metal.  This structure makes the camera "Canon 5D Mark 2" very light, but durable.  In the cold, a chill is felt at hand.  In places of a grip there are rubber inserts.  The company claims that the camera can withstand up to 15 minutes in heavy rain.  It is worth noting that the hot shoe is fully protected only when the flash is installed.  This feature makes one doubt the full moisture protection.  In addition, a lot of users who lay out about $ 3,000 for the camera can be upset by the creaking cover of the memory card slot.  Firms that produce this class of device are trying to avoid such shortcomings.  Most likely, in the last installments this defect will be corrected. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  <strong>Innovations</strong> </h2><p>  So, the main features of the "Canon 5D Mark 2" are considered.  The automated and manual shooting mode works fine, which was difficult to doubt.  As you know, each new product should demonstrate some changes in one direction or another.  No exception was the new ‚ÄúDSLR‚Äù from ‚ÄúCanon‚Äù, which acquired a number of technological innovations. </p><h2>  Full-format matrix </h2><p>  The updated sensor allows you to shoot wider frames.  Impressions of the photo immediately change in a positive direction.  <span>Lenses "Canon</span> 5D Mark 2" and even allow you to make incredible shots.  It is the full-format matrix that makes it possible to unleash the potential of today's best optics.  The sensor received a resolution of 21.1 megapixels, which allows you to take photos in very detailed and without extraneous noise.  Frames can be taken in the maximum resolution - 5616 √ó 3744 pixels, which is significantly more than in "5D".  Photos are obtained in RAW format and have a size of 22.5 MB (in the same "5D" this parameter was 10 MB less). </p><h2>  DIGIC 4 </h2><p>  Of course, to process such high-quality and volumetric images, a high-performance processor with a high speed of operations is needed.  Canon did not save money here either by installing the updated DIGIC 4 in its brainchild. The chip performs analogue conversion of material at high speed, which gives photos that are amazing in quality. </p>

    <h2>  Focusing </h2><p>  One of the key features of the Canon Mark 2 5D is its quick focus.  This parameter is very important for correspondents who try not to miss a single shot.  In the new Canon model, focusing is implemented very well.  It works in the right places, which increases the speed, and also reduces the percentage of bad photos. </p><p>  The focusing system in "Canon Mark 2 5D" received 15 points.  9 of them are basic, and 6 play the role of additional ones.  In the settings they can be set at your own discretion.  The center uses 3 particularly sensitive points.  They are aimed at working with F2.8 apertures.  In addition, the model was able to fine-tune it to any optics, which many ‚ÄúDSLRs" lack.  Especially the function can be useful for those who work with wide apertures. </p>

    <h2>  ISO </h2><p>  ISO sensitivity plays a special role in the shooting process, especially at night.  Most experienced photographers primarily pay attention to this parameter.  The camera manufacturer promises that the new processor is capable of processing images, eliminating noise from ISO 50 to ISO 26600. In general, many cameras (including Canon Mark 5D) set the sensitivity automatically.  This can be convenient when shooting in places where lighting is constantly changing.  Automatic mode saves the user from constantly adjusting this parameter, which makes it possible not to miss a good frame. </p><p>  It is recommended to turn off automatic adjustment if the lighting is static.  In the settings you can set the most suitable range.  It should be noted right away that there is noise reduction in the camera.  The parameter is enabled in the settings.  Also, the noise can be removed after the shooting process through the program, which comes complete with a ‚ÄúDSLR‚Äù.  By the way, there is no significant difference in noise reduction methods.  Therefore, you can get rid of them the most convenient. </p><p>  It is almost impossible to completely avoid noise.  The smallest amount is obtained when shooting with a tripod.  On the forums devoted to photography, you can find the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the sensitivity ranges in which it is most convenient to conduct this or that mode.  In general, there are a lot of ways to configure.  It is difficult to single out a universal one for each photographer.  Therefore, everyone chooses independently, experimenting with the settings.  Beginners can first shoot in automatic mode, which does not require special knowledge. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  For the "Canon 5D Mark 2" it comes complete.  A special indicator located on the case is responsible for displaying the charge level.  A full charge is indicated by green color, in the future an orange appears, which blinks, indicating an imminent discharge of the power supply.  It takes about 2 hours to fully charge.  The battery capacity is 1800 mAh, which is enough for about 800 shots.  Please note that in the cold this figure is significantly reduced.  Battery information can also be viewed in the viewfinder and on the display.  Conveniently, you can see the battery statistics in a special menu. </p>

    <h2>  Menu </h2><p>  The menu interface "Canon Mark 2 5D" is made in the traditional style for professional cameras.  Each item is divided into several tabs, there are no hidden blocks.  On the screen made as many settings as fit.  For quick access to important functions there is an item "My menu".  In general, Canon pays special attention to tuning speeds.  Many parameters are divided into groups to provide the easiest access. </p><p>  Additional comfort of use is possible thanks to a powerful processor.  It not only provides quick menu operation, but also viewing the footage without delay.  The advantage of the camera was the ability to create additional folders into which you can move pictures.  Of the minuses, we can distinguish only that the photos are displayed on the screen in 9 pieces. </p><h2>  Video </h2><p>  You should not hope that the "Canon Mark 2 5D" will be able to completely replace a professional video camera, on which not only the clips are better, but also more convenient to record.  However, this "SLR" makes decent videos.  You can record in FullHD resolution at a speed of 30 frames per second.  Of course, the model also works with lower resolutions. </p><p>  For FullHD, you need a fast memory card with a minimum of 4 GB.  If its volume is greater - better.  As you know, a lot of money will have to be paid for such a card.  Cheap options do not allow you to record a uniform movie: frame breaks appear and watching videos is not very pleasant.  The indicator on the viewfinder notifies you that the memory is full.  For shooting at lower resolutions, a slow map will do.  In FullHD resolution, a 12-minute movie is 4 GB in size.  Sound is recorded only in mono, an external microphone is required for stereo. </p>
