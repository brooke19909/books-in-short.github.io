One needs to accumulate, the other put and periodically use.  Everyone pursues different goals.  Therefore, banks offer a very wide selection of deposits. </p><p>  Many trust their funds to Sberbank.  He is the most famous among credit institutions.  Anyone will like the terms of deposits at Sberbank, so we will talk about it further. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bbva.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="favorable terms of deposit in a savings bank" class="if uuid-3048941" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/114982/3048941.jpg"></div><h2>  <span>Types of deposits</span> issued in the office </h2><p>  Conventionally, they can be divided according to their purpose.  Let's consider each in more detail. </p><ul><li>  Deposit "Save." </li></ul><p>  Basically, it is drawn up to save funds for a while.  From this, the term of the deposit is selected.  The percentage depends on the term, the maximum - 5%.  The smallest installment is from 1 thousand rubles.  Do not close it ahead of schedule, as all accrued interest will be lost. </p><ul><li>  Deposit "Replenish". </li></ul><p>  A very attractive deposit in Sberbank, especially for the accumulation of funds, for example, for a major purchase or for a down payment on a mortgage.  Here operations to replenish the deposit are allowed, but the ability to make a partial expense is limited.  It is possible to open it in rubles and dollars.  The difference is only in percentage, the maximum here is 4.55%.  The minimum deposit is from 1 thousand rubles.  You can issue for any period up to 3 years.  With early closure or partial withdrawal of funds, all interest is also lost. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Deposit "Manage". </li></ul><p>  It is necessary if a person wants to freely manage their funds, but at the same time receive more interest.  Possible income and expense.  The smallest installment is slightly higher - from 30 thousand rubles.  or 1 thousand dollars.  Validity - from three months to three years.  Depending on it, there will be a percentage, but a maximum of 4.25%. </p><ul><li>  Deposit "Social". </li></ul><p>  It receives periodic credits to orphans and war veterans.  It does not open to everyone.  Documents confirming the receipt of these payments are required.  Conditions of deposit in Sberbank allow you to make a receipt and expenditure of funds.  Percentage - 4.25%.  The term is three years.  The smallest installment is from one ruble. </p><ul><li>  Deposit "Replenish" on a minor child. </li></ul><p>  A great way to save money for a child's majority.  Anyone, even grandparents, can deposit funds on this deposit.  Partial spending is not possible here.  Percentage - 4.55%.  You can open an account in rubles and dollars. </p><div class="photo" data-original="financialpanther.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="deposit conditions record at Sberbank" class="if uuid-3048945" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/114982/3048945.jpg"></div><h2>  Retirement deposits </h2><p>  Sberbank deposit conditions for pensioners are more attractive.  They have the opportunity to issue both all of the above deposits and a pension contribution created specifically for this category.  It is possible to arrange a deposit of "Replenish" and "Save" exactly according to the same parameters, only the percentage is provided much higher. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To receive a pension, employees offer customers to issue a ‚ÄúPension Plus‚Äù deposit.  It is possible to make an income and expense of it.  The percentage is provided in the amount of 3.5%.  An account is opened for three years, but when the period ends it is automatically extended for the same period, but on the terms that will be at that time.  The minimum down payment is from one ruble.  With early expenses, the percentage does not change, so it is considered that this is a very profitable deposit. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.usatoday.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Banknotes and ATM" class="if uuid-3048967" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/114982/3048967.jpg"></div><h2>  Online deposits </h2><p>  Almost all <span>deposits opened</span> in the office can be issued online.  The only exceptions were a social deposit and ‚ÄúReplenished‚Äù per child, since the preparation of these deposits requires the provision of additional documents.  As a rule, registration using the Internet involves increased interest and is more profitable.  So, for example, the ‚ÄúManage‚Äù deposit, issued at the office, will bring the depositor 4.25% (maximum percentage), and when registering online, the rate will be higher - 4.4%. </p><p>  Promotions are held periodically that have a limited duration, but with favorable deposit conditions at Sberbank.  Today it is a ‚ÄúWithout a passport‚Äù deposit, which can be issued both in your personal account, mobile application, or through an ATM.  Very attractive rate - up to 7%.  It can be opened for a period of five months to one year.  The arrival and expenditure of funds is not provided.  The smallest contribution is 50 thousand rubles.  The promotion will last until the end of January 2019.  Therefore, if everything suits, then it is better to hurry up and place a deposit on attractive terms. </p><p>  Earlier there were very favorable conditions for the ‚ÄúRecord‚Äù deposit in Sberbank.  The percentage reached 7.15%.  Unfortunately, the opening of this type of deposit has already ended, the action was until the end of November 2018. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.discover.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank deposit conditions for pensioners" class="if uuid-3048938" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/114982/3048938.jpg"></div><h2>  The necessary package of documents </h2><p>  To make a deposit in a bank, first of all, an identity document is required.  For citizens of the country, this document is usually the passport of the Russian Federation.  For foreign citizens there is a certain list of documents provided for each category separately. </p><p>  A permanent or temporary registration is also needed - a stamp in the passport or a document confirming this fact. </p><p>  For certain types of deposits, relevant documents are required.  So, for the ‚ÄúSocial‚Äù deposit, under the terms of the deposit in Sberbank, a document is required confirming the fact of receiving payments to orphans or war veterans. </p><h2>  Benefits of deposits at Sberbank </h2><p>  Sberbank is one of the largest banks in Russia.  Numerous service offices and a huge number of ATMs are a big advantage among other lending institutions.  Sberbank receives support from the state and is included in the deposit insurance system - this makes it very reliable and inspires confidence among the majority of citizens. </p>
