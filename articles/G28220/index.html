Holidays on Lake Bele</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Bele Lake is one of the most famous places for summer vacations in the territory of Khakassia.  To get to it from the city of Abakan, you will need to overcome 180 kilometers, and this is not so much.  The whole trip takes only a couple of hours.  During the trip, which is important, you can admire the magnificent, bewitching landscapes, in particular the steppes, above which here and there mounds rise - ancient cultural monuments of Khakassia. </p><h2>  East and West Bele </h2><p>  Bele consists of two large lakes - East and West.  They are united by a small channel.  Tourists like the East Lake more, as the conditions here are much better, therefore it is not surprising that its shores are literally strewn with tents and various buildings.  If you see many houses in a separate area, then this is a recreation center.  Bele Lake attracts tourists like a magnet, so residential buildings here are never empty.  Many people come here every year. </p><h2>  The cleanest lake with healing water </h2><p>  The best month to visit Bele is July: at this time it is almost always sunny and cloudless, and the water temperature is 22 ¬∞ C.  The lake is noteworthy in that it is almost not polluted.  The water here is absolutely clear.  The reservoir is also famous for its mineralized composition, in which there is <span>Glauber's salt,</span> famous for its healing qualities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bele Lake" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18955/464386.jpg" width="600"></div>  It is enough to rest on Bele one day to get rid of corns, scratches and minor wounds.  In addition, it becomes much easier for many people prone to headaches, they feel more vigorous and full of strength.  Of course, the best choice for them is some cozy recreation center.  Bele Lake is truly magnificent, so many begin to plan their trip in early spring.  I want to be here as soon as possible.  It is worth thinking in advance about living conditions.

It is recommended to go to the main beach - there is a rental of scooters, motor boats, catamarans, as well as water skis.  Nearby is a disco bar, which hosts daily dance evenings dedicated to a specific topic (house, r'n'b, retro). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="recreation center Lake Bele" class="if" height="391" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18955/464957.jpg" width="600"></div>  This establishment works from 23:00 to 3:00, you will not have to pay for entry.  It is a pity that visitors to the disco bar, having plenty of dancing, cannot get up early the next morning to go to meet the dawn on Lake Bele.  Khakassia is charming, especially in the rays of the rising sun.

    <h2>  "Martian landscape" </h2><p>  A kilometer from the lake there is a hill, climbing on which in the morning, you can admire an incredible, fabulous spectacle.  Locals call it ‚ÄúMartian landscape‚Äù.  The nearby lakes resemble alien plates.  And the hills are like moon craters.  The picture is complemented by red sun rays.  This must be seen with my own eyes.  Particularly impressive, of course, is Lake Bele, spread out below.  Khakassia is an amazing land, and everyone who has ever been here knows this. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Tent or house? </h2><p>  In the vicinity of the lake there are several cafes and retail outlets where you can buy products.  Tourists like the red wine that is sold here.  East Bele consists of two zones.  At the entrance there is a barrier separating them.  One side is intended for ‚Äúwild‚Äù camping, and the second is notable for good tourist camps.  Many people want to rent a cute wooden house near the lake for the weekend.  In this case, it is recommended to think about the trip in advance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake Bele Khakassia" class="if" height="346" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18955/464387.jpg" width="520"></div>  Already in mid-spring, almost all houses are booked.  You can, of course, just put up a tent on the shore and settle in it, but some are confused by the many neighbors and the music incessant until dawn.  Not so many people imagine an ideal holiday on Lake Bele.  Khakassia is hospitable, it is ready to accept everyone without exception, but sometimes people come here that provoke indignation among others.  Better stay away from them.

    <h2>  Khakass Yurt </h2><p>  The cost of the house will depend on the tour operator and the base where you plan to stay.  In addition, you can rent a real national yurt, in which the Khakasses used to live.  Many are attracted to <span>ethnic style.</span>  Four people can fit in a yurt.  The price of such a house on Saturdays and Sundays is 1,500 rubles per day.  Before the trip, you need to find out what kind of tourist camps are here.  Bele Lake is a very popular place, so you need to keep in mind that all places to stay can be occupied. </p><h2>  Tourist base "Wild Coast" </h2><p>  This <span>recreation center</span> is located in the Republic of Khakassia, namely, in the Shirinsky district.  It opens in May, and in September it stops its work.  The conditions here are quite satisfactory.  There are three <span>summer houses</span> built of wood, which are designed for 20 people.  The base also has a tent camp.  The houses have beds, there are cutlery.  If necessary, the tourist can ask for a refrigerator, and he will be immediately provided.  The base has a shower and toilet.  The lighting here is generator.  Of course, almost no one sits in the rooms - everyone gathers on the beach.  Bele Lake, the rest of which is remembered for a lifetime, makes people admire its beauties, no one is indifferent to it. </p><h2>  Food, services, bathhouse, beaches </h2><p>  Tourists feed on their own.  However, you can go to another base located nearby - there is a dining room with a wide range of dishes.  But you don‚Äôt always want to go there.  Well, in this case, you can just look into a nearby store.  Food and household goods are sold there.  The ‚ÄúWild Coast‚Äù pleasantly surprises with some useful services, for example, here you can rent a rowing boat or a catamaran.  Those who don‚Äôt want to <span>wash themselves in the shower</span> can visit the bathhouse located at the neighboring tourist base.  There is an agreement permitting the use of it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays on Lake Bele Khakassia" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18955/464933.jpg" width="600"></div>  Sports fans can play football and volleyball - there are all conditions for this.  There are several beaches on the lake: fine-grained, sandy, and also grassy.  Everyone chooses a place of rest, based on their taste.  There is one site on the lake, which is called the ‚ÄúRiga seaside‚Äù.  This is a shallow water, located quite far from the coast.  Bele Lake sometimes surprises uninformed tourists.

    <h2>  Entertainment, games, excursions </h2><p>  Many vacationers spend all their time on the beach, literally without leaving there.  But lying all day on the sand is quite tiring, so some still ride on boats and catamarans.  Sports games are also very popular.  Tourists are given special brochures with information about excursions, and many are eager to see interesting places nearby. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bele Lake Base" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18955/464964.jpg" width="600"></div>  You need to know that there are no phones based.  But this is not scary.  After all, almost everyone now has mobile phones.  There is no access to the Internet either, but some believe that this is even for the best - there is an opportunity to take a break from the virtual world.  Lake Bele is an ideal place for relaxation, here you can feel the unity with nature.

    <h2>  Big Reach is another good recreation center </h2><p>  This tourist base spreads over 10 hectares.  You can live here in cute summer houses, designed for two, four and six people.  The distance between them is quite large, so people should be comfortable.  The houses are built of timber.  If this option does not suit you, you can settle in a small hotel.  From the base to the lake to go very close - just 100 meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bele Lake rest" class="if" height="219" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18955/464945.jpg" width="600"></div>  You need to know that in each house there is only one room, but there is also a veranda, upon reaching which you can admire the lake and the magnificent local landscape.  In total, 170 people can rest in the "Big Reach".  Check-in here is at 21:00, and check-out is at 19:00.  Many tourists who leave Lake Bele swear that they will return here more than once.

    <h2>  More about houses </h2><p>  The buildings on the base are almost the same.  In the rooms there are beds, hooks for things, a mirror, as well as a shelf.  On the veranda are a table, a washbasin, a bedside table, chairs and a container of water.  Shower and toilet are separate.  Fastidious people, of course, will not like such conditions, and everyone else has a great chance to fully enjoy their holiday in Bel. </p>
