Beam structures are placed around the entire perimeter so that riders and their pets can jump without stopping.  How many obstacles the athletes have in their way: crosspiece, Chukhonets, gate, wall, tee!  By the way, France is considered the birthplace of jumping, and it is included in the program of the Olympic Games. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="horse riding arena in red square how to get there" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43507/2130771.jpg"></div>  These are the most spectacular equestrian competitions.  They require close attention.  From the side it may seem that it is quite easy to jump over an obstacle.  However, it is very difficult to control a horse and make it jump at least a ditch.  It is especially exciting when children do it.  And they succeed!
