Prospects for its development</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  At the junction of such scientific fields as physics and technology, electronics was born.  If we consider it in a narrow sense, we can say that it is engaged in the study of the interaction of electrons and the electromagnetic field, as well as in the creation of devices based on this knowledge.  What are these devices and how is the science of electronics developing today? </p><h2>  Jump </h2><p>  Today is the century of information technology.  The entire <span>flow of data</span> that we receive from the outside must be processed, stored and transmitted.  All these processes occur using electronic devices of various types.  The deeper a person plunges into the fragile world of electrons, the grander his discoveries and, accordingly, created electronic devices. </p><div class="photo" data-original="togelll.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="electronic components" class="if uuid-2343321" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39363/2343321.jpg"></div><p>  You can find enough information about what electronics is and how this science has developed.  Having studied it, you are amazed how quickly technologies have developed, what a rapid leap this industry has made in a short period of time. </p><p>  As a science, it began to take shape in the 20th century.  This happened with the beginning of the development of the <span>element base of</span> radio engineering and radio electronics.  The second half of the last century was marked by the development of cybernetics and computers <span>(electronic computers).</span>  All this stimulated interest in this area.  If at the beginning of its development one computer could occupy a whole room of considerable size, today we have microtechnologies that can turn all our ideas about the world around. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="engineering.leeds.ac.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="molecular self-assembly bionoelectronics" class="if uuid-2343323" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39363/2343323.jpg"></div><p>  Surprisingly, perhaps in the near future about what electronics is, it will be possible to speak in the context of historical basic knowledge.  Technology is minimized every day.  The period of their performance increases.  All this surprises us less and less.  Such natural processes are associated with Moore's law and are carried out using silicon.  Already today they are talking about an alternative to electronics - spintronics.  And also everyone knows the developments in the field of nanoelectronics. </p><h2>  Development and challenges </h2><p>  So, what is electronics and what problems in the development of devices does this branch of science have?  As was said, electronics is an industry created at the intersection of physics and technology.  She investigates the processes of formation of charged particles and control the movement of free electrons in different media, such as a solid, vacuum, plasma, gas and at their boundaries.  This science also develops methods for creating electronic devices for various spheres of human life.  Not the last place is occupied by studies of problems related to the development of science: rapid obsolescence, ethical issues, research and experiments, costs and much more. </p><p>  In the daily life of any modern person, the question "What is electronics?"  will not cause any surprise.  His life is literally stuffed with electronic devices: watches, washing machines and other household appliances, built-in appliances in cars and other vehicles, audio and video equipment, televisions, telephones, robots, medical devices and equipment, and so on.  This list can be continued for a very long time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Field of development and application </h2><p>  Traditionally, electronics is divided into two areas: the development of the element base and the design of electronic circuits.  The element base is <span>electronic devices of</span> various characteristics.  It is divided into a class of <span>vacuum devices</span> and solid-state electronics.  In electrical circuits, the elemental base consists of devices for using, recording and processing electrical signals.  The processed signal is reproduced in a convenient form (monitor screen, TV, sound, and so on).  The signal can be recorded on a storage medium and reproduced at any time, control automatic systems, servos and other devices. </p><p>  Electronic circuits are presented in analog and digital form.  Analog amplify and process the analog signal.  For example, radio waves.  Digital circuits are designed to work with a quantum signal.  These are computers, controllers and many other devices. </p><div class="photo" data-original="english.spbstu.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="development of electronics and photonics with nanoelectronics" class="if uuid-2343326" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39363/2343326.jpg"></div><p>  Electronics and nanoelectronics today are no longer surprising as they were at the very beginning of the emergence of such technologies.  What once seemed fantastic in the modern world has become commonplace.  The development rate is so great that the devices do not have time to grow old, as they already become irrelevant. </p><p>  But such sciences as electronics and nanoelectronics are connected by microelectronics, which dates back to 1958, since the creation of microcircuits with two resistors and four transistors.  Further development took the path of minimizing and simultaneously increasing the number of components, such as transistors.  Nanoelectronics is developing integrated circuits whose topological norm is less than 100 nm. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bio-nano-consulting.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="progress in nanoelectronics" class="if uuid-2343309" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39363/2343309.jpg"></div><h2>  Is there a limit to the development of technology? </h2><p>  As you can see, electronics is a basic science for the development of sophisticated modern technologies.  Already they say that flexible electronics have been developed that make it possible to print using molten metal. </p><p>  It has not yet received wide distribution, but in this area, scientists have achieved significant success.  There is no doubt - soon the consumer market will know what flexible electronics is. </p><p>  Defining the boundaries of technology development, which began in the 20th century, today is hardly possible.  A fusion of the various sciences takes place, electronic biotechnologies, artificial intelligence and much more are being developed.  3D printing is already being successfully applied, and in North Carolina they introduced a very ambitious technology for such printing using molten metal.  New technology can be easily implemented in any production equipment. </p>
