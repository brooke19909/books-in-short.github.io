    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  In hospitable Bulgaria in the resort of Sunny Beach, Iberostar Sunny Beach Resort 4 * hotel is located.  It is built about seven hundred meters from the center and less than a hundred meters from the coast.  In the brochures it is indicated that this is the second coastline, but go to the promenade and the beach even with small children no more than 5 minutes.  Sunny Beach administratively refers to the city of Nessebar, to which you can go by bus in a matter of minutes, and you can slowly walk along the beach on your own.  The resort is located away from major highways and railways, which provides it with perfect ecology.  The largest center of Varna is 90 km from here, and the city of Burgas is only 36 km away.  Sunny Beach is connected with them by bus.  The intercity bus station is very close to the hotel, you can walk to it in 10 minutes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Organized tourists who used the services of travel agencies, buying a tour to Iberostar Sunny Beach Resort 4 *, to Bulgaria (to Sunny Beach) are most convenient to get by air to the airport of Burgas.  There they will be met by representatives of travel agencies and delivered to the hotel by transfer.  For unorganized tourists who have independently booked a hotel room, it is more economical to get from Burgas by intercity buses to the bus station in Sunny Beach, and from there drive to the hotel with local buses.  Travel in total will cost no more than 5 leva (as of the end of June 2017, 1 lev is equal to approximately 34 rubles).  If you take a taxi from the airport, you will have to pay from 5 to 15 leva per km. </p><p>  From Moscow it is very cheap to get to Burgas by train departing from the Kievsky station.  Travel time is almost 2.5 days, but a ticket is much cheaper than a plane. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Review of Iberostar Sunny Beach Resort" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1854314.jpg" width="499"></div>
