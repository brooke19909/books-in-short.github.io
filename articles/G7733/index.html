    <h2>  Coral Sun Beach Safaga 4 *: reviews of Russian travelers </h2><p>  As you know, today when choosing a hotel in a particular country in the world, many people are no longer satisfied with only official information and the advice of tour operators.  So, a modern traveler tries to get acquainted with the opinions of those who have already happened to stay at the hotel in question.  This allows you to make a more complete and reliable picture.  Therefore, to save your time, we decided to offer you generalized reviews of our compatriots regarding their vacation in Coral Sun Beach Safaga 4 *.  It should be noted right away that most tourists were satisfied with the choice made.  In their opinion, the hotel is fully consistent with its category, and also justifies the money spent.  But we learn more about everything. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="coral sun beach safaga 4 reviews" class="if" height="362" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/963338.jpg" width="600"></div>

A big plus is the fact that all apartments have a gorgeous view of the sea.  So many guests enjoyed sitting on the balcony, admiring the scenery, with a glass of wine or a cup of coffee.  The rooms had everything necessary for living.  However, tourists note that Internet access is available for a fee (about 2.5 euros per 1 hour).  All equipment worked properly.  However, sometimes during the daytime the hotel turned off the lights.  But this did not become a serious problem, since during this period the overwhelming majority of guests are on the beach or by the pool.  Cleaning and towel change in the rooms was carried out every day.  Bath supplies were also regularly replenished. </p><p>  As for the location of Coral Sun Beach Safaga 4 * (Hurghada), then on this occasion, the opinions of travelers were divided.  So, someone liked that the hotel is far from city noise.  But some tourists complained about the fact that it was far from here to go on excursions, and in the evening there was nowhere to go outside the hotel.  The very territory of the hotel seemed quite small for the guests.  However, according to many, this is only a plus, since you do not need to spend a lot of time to get from the room to the restaurant, pool or sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel coral sun beach safaga 4" class="if" height="370" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/963337.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Kitchen </h2><p>  The issue of nutrition always causes a lot of controversy among the guests.  And this applies to hotels of various categories, not only in Egypt, but also in other countries.  The hotels of Safaga, including the Coral Sun Beach under consideration, did not escape this fate.  So, some tourists claim that the food here was monotonous and did not correspond to the four-star category of the institution.  However, most of the guests claim that things are not so bad.  According to them, the choice of dishes here, of course, is not as diverse as in five-star hotels, but it is impossible to stay hungry.  The cuisine is mostly European.  There are always fish, meat, poultry dishes on the menu.  In addition, there are a variety of side dishes, salads, fruits and sweets.  In the evenings, guests are invited to try a dish from the chef.  So, some guests recall delicious dishes from ostrich, octopus, seafood. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="coral sun beach safaga 4 hurghada" class="if" height="424" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/963336.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment Comments </h2><p>  The vast majority of tourists come to Egypt for a beach holiday.  Hotel Coral Sun Beach Safaga 4 *, according to our compatriots, is just fine for these purposes.  So, he has his own sandy beach, equipped with sunbeds and umbrellas.  From the main residential building to the sea can be reached in just two minutes.  Near the coast there is a magnificent reef full of a variety of amazing marine life.  Hotel guests claim that they can swim for hours and watch amazing creatures.  A great plus for many vacationers was the fact that the beach is in the bay, so strong waves are extremely rare here.  So during your vacation, you most likely will not have to sit on the beach, waiting for dangerous waves.  Experienced travelers are advised to purchase a mask for snorkeling and special rubber shoes.  It is also nice to have flippers.  You can buy all these items right on the spot, in the store at the Coral Sun Beach Hotel. </p><p>  As for entertainment on the territory of the hotel itself, there are few of them.  So, those who wish can swim in the pool and sunbathe on the terrace.  In addition, the hotel has a team of animators who offer to do water aerobics, gymnastics, take part in fun games and competitions.  According to tourists, all this happens unobtrusively and does not cause irritation.  In the evenings, a beach disco is held. </p><p>  But as for the fun for the youngest guests, in this regard, according to our compatriots, the Coral Sun Beach Hotel can not offer anything, except for an evening mini-disco.  There is no playground, no mini-club. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="safaga coral sun beach safaga 4" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/963335.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Personnel Opinion </h2><p>  As for the employees of the Coral Sun Beach Safaga 4 * hotel, then most of the guests have a positive impression on them.  So, according to them, the staff here are friendly, welcoming and quick.  Many employees speak Russian. </p><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  Summing up, we can say that most of our compatriots claim that this hotel is perfect for relaxing older people who prefer a quiet and measured pastime.  This is probably why the main contingent of Coral Sun Beach guests is German pensioners.  So if you want to spend a vacation sunbathing on the beach, admiring the diversity of marine life, enjoying the peace and sound of the waves, this hotel is perfect for you. </p>
