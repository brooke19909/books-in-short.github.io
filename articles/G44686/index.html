    <p>  Each of the marked categories may reflect the corresponding types of accounting systems.  They can work within the framework of dissimilar methodologies, but at the same time they can be applied subject to common goals.  In addition, in the framework of management, financial and tax areas, as a rule, specific <span>types of activities are</span> determined in accounting.  Work in the relevant fields is usually performed by highly qualified professionals. </p><h2>  Is accounting an economic accounting? </h2><p>  It is believed that concepts such as ‚Äúaccounting‚Äù and ‚Äúbusiness accounting‚Äù can be identified.  This can be either a completely correct approach or a mistake.  What does it depend on? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The fact is that the concept and types of accounting are special cases of business.  That is, the latter is a more global category.  Accounting is a special case of business along with operational or, for example, with statistical.  At the same time, various types of business and accounting are closely related and often have a very conditional border. </p><p>  Thus, how to interpret the ratio of terms?  You can adhere to the following scheme: accounting is always business accounting.  And therefore, the types of business and accounting in this sense can be identified.  At the same time, business accounting is not always accounting; it can be operational or statistical. </p><h2>  Accounting meters </h2><p>  Having considered what are the main types of accounting, we can study such an aspect as the meters used by accountants in the process of their activities.  Among these may be criteria related to the type of natural.  They use the following meters: </p><p>  - mass units (in tons, kilograms, grams, etc.); </p><p>  - quantity (pieces, sets, etc.). </p><p>  Another type of criteria is labor.  They are used if it is necessary to calculate the amount of time spent by company employees on manufacturing products.  The key meters here are days, hours, sometimes minutes.  The practical significance of labor criteria is the ability to calculate labor productivity.  And, as a result, optimize the corresponding item of expenses. </p>

    <p>  Probably the most important criterion reflecting the measuring aspect in accounting is financial.  It is used when the company reflects business processes and their analytical generalization in monetary units.  A financial criterion is a tool that allows company management to calculate the total value of assets.  The main measure here is the currency of the country, that is, in Russia it is rubles and kopecks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Accounting functions </h2><p>  Having studied the main types of accounting, as well as key meters, we can consider what functions are characterized by the phenomenon studied by us.  Experts distinguish their following list. </p><p>  Firstly, it is a function called supervisory.  It is a tool for monitoring the availability and movement of various kinds of funds, objects of labor, financial resources, the correctness and relevance of the enterprise‚Äôs interaction with government departments.  The main types of control that are carried out within the framework of this function are preliminary, current (current), as well as subsequent. </p><p>  Secondly, it is an information function.  Its use involves the timely dissemination of relevant information reflecting the work of the enterprise among its management and employees (as well as for subjects of intercorporate interaction).  The main <span>requirements for information</span> collected through accounting are reliability, verifiability, objectivity, relevance. </p><p>  Third, experts highlight the protective function.  Its essence proceeds from the task associated with the need to ensure the safety of the company's balance sheet property assets.  The main criterion for the quality of the implementation of this function is the presence of a methodology in the enterprise that allows for detailed inventory control. </p><p>  Fourthly, accounting has the function of organizing feedback between the enterprise and various entities related to its activities - investors, buyers, and in some cases also with regulatory authorities. </p><p>  Fifthly, accounting is also characterized by an <span>analytical function.</span>  Its main purpose is to identify flaws, shortcomings, gaps in the management of the company and financial policy and the subsequent development of appropriate optimization mechanisms. </p><h2>  Accounts </h2><p>  What are the criteria for their classification?  What are the types of accounting accounts?  Let's start with the classification criteria.  Their experts highlight a few. </p><p>  <em>1. Economic content</em> </p><p>  The account belonging to one or another type is determined based on the specifics of what is taken into account on it. </p><p>  <em>2. Structure</em> </p><p>  Based on this criterion, types of accounting accounts are divided into: </p><p>  - inventory; </p><p>  - stock; </p><p>  - accounting and settlement; </p><p>  - passive; </p><p>  - active. </p><p>  <em>3. The degree of detail</em> </p><p>  It is considered one of the basic classification criteria.  Based on its essence, accounts are divided into three types - synthetic, analytical, as well as the so-called sub-accounts.  Consider the features of each. </p><p>  Synthetic accounts include sufficiently generalized information about the assets and liabilities of the company, which are expressed in financial meters.  Examples of these are 50 ("Cashier"), 01 ("Fixed assets") or, for example, 80 ("Authorized capital"). </p>

    <p>  Analytical accounts are intended to present information from synthetic in more detail.  They no longer reflect generalized, but rather detailed information on specific types of assets and liabilities.  Moreover, they can be measured not only in financial indicators, but also, for example, in labor. </p><p>  In turn, sub-accounts are a kind of "hybrid" of the first two types.  Their practical application is advisable in cases where it is necessary, for example, to group analytical accounts within a specific synthetic.  Accounting in subaccounts is usually carried out in financial meters, sometimes in kind, in labor almost never. </p><p>  Also, experts identify other types of accounts based on other criteria.  For example, such as operating, costing, regulatory, budget allocation. </p><p>  Having studied the types <span>of accounting,</span> its functions, we now consider such an aspect as accounts.  The practical use of accounts in many cases is carried out through a method called double entry.  It reflects the principle in which <span>business transactions</span> are recorded simultaneously twice - in the debit of one account and in the credit of another.  Closely interact with each other accounts and various types of accounting registers (about this aspect - a little more). </p><h2>  Double Entry Facts </h2><p>  Let's study the method of "double recording" a little more.  Why is it, in fact, needed in accounting?  According to the methodology common in the professional accounting environment, most business transactions are characterized by duality, as well as by such an aspect as reciprocity.  That is, if funds are debited from one account, then, probably, they are simultaneously credited to another.  Thus, the money transaction is always under control. </p><p>  The mechanism of "double entry" is implemented through two main tools - correspondence and posting.  How does this happen? </p><p>  Correspondence is a channel of interaction between two accounts on which an accounting transaction is reflected.  In turn, the posting is, in fact, the practical use of this channel, the correct execution of operations, recording information about the debit and credit.  It can be of two types - simple and complex. </p>

    <p>  The way a double-entry is presented depends on what types of accounting forms are used.  There are several of them.  There is a memorial or fragmented form - within the framework of it, operations are recorded twice in separate registers.  There is an order, or combined form.  In it, the registers are used so that the operation is recorded simultaneously for the debit and credit of the account. </p><h2>  Registers </h2><p>  We said above that accounts are closely related to accounting registers.  What are the latter?  What are the types of accounting registers?  Consider this aspect in more detail. </p><p>  <span>What are</span> accounting <span>registers</span> ?  According to a common definition, they are tools used to systematize and collect information that is contained in primary documents for the purpose of reflection on accounts and reporting.  May constitute a trade secret. </p><p>  Experts name the following classification criteria for accounting registers. </p><p>  <em>1. Based on the design</em> </p><p>  These can be books, cards, tables, registrars. </p><p>  <em>2. Based on the destination</em> </p><p>  In this regard, registers can be chronological or systematic.  Combined options are also possible. </p><p>  <em>3. Based on the content</em> </p><p>  Like the corresponding type of accounts, registers, based on this criterion, are divided into synthetic and analytical. </p><p>  <em>4. Based on the form</em> </p><p>  Experts distinguish four main ones - unilateral, bilateral, made in the form of a table, as well as presented in a chess format. </p><h2>  Costs </h2><p>  Having studied the types of accounting, its functions, accounts, registers, we can determine the means by which the costs are fixed.  What are the types of expenses in accounting?  What are the criteria for their classification? </p>

    <p>  Actually, the organization‚Äôs expenses, based on a common definition, are understood as a decrease in financial and economic benefits due to a decrease in capital on the balance sheet of the company and other forms of cash withdrawal.  Experts distinguish the following main types of expenses in accounting: </p><p>  - associated with profit; </p><p>  - Received outside the income channels; </p><p>  - forced. </p><p>  Regarding the first: this mainly includes costs associated with production and sales, investments.  The second include the costs associated with the payment of bonuses, charitable activities.  Compulsory expenses include taxes, payments to the PFR, FSS, MHIF, and the conclusion of insurance contracts.  Some experts attribute the costs of the third type to those associated with the consequences of economic sanctions. </p><h2>  Income </h2><p>  Speaking of expenses, we cannot ignore the aspect of income.  What are the main criteria for their classification? </p><p>  First, what is income.  In Russian law, they are considered to be resources that determine the increase in the financial and economic benefits of the enterprise and the growth of business capitalization.  The main <span>types of income</span> in accounting are as follows: </p><p>  - from ordinary activities; </p><p>  - related to others. </p><p>  In the Russian legislation there are criteria by which certain money receipts on the balance sheet of the organization are not included in the income.  Among those: </p><p>  - deposits of owners (shareholders); </p><p>  - the amount of taxes and fees; </p><p>  - commissions in favor of the partner; </p><p>  - receipts as part of prepayment, advance payment, deposit; </p><p>  - receipt of payment for the issued loan. </p><p>  Income and expenses of the company in the appropriate manner are recorded on the accounts of the organization. </p><h2>  Documents </h2><p>  Having said a lot about what types of bookkeeping are based on the types of accounts, on the classification of income and expenses, we will simultaneously consider such an aspect as workflow.  What is its structure?  What are the <span>types of documents</span> in accounting?  In Russian practice, the following criteria are adopted. </p><p>  <em>1. Composition of documents</em> </p><p>  According to this criterion, there is a separation of sources into incoming, outgoing, as well as internal corporate ones.  The first are documents that are sent to the company by other organizations.  The second are documents, which, in turn, are characterized by a reverse orientation.  Internal type sources are not subject to withdrawal from the company. </p><p>  <em>2. Purpose</em> </p><p>  Based on this criterion, the documents can be administrative, executive, as well as represent accounting sources. </p>
