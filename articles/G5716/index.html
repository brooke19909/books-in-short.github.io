The increased demand for real estate is due to the many infrastructure facilities available here, excellent ecology, and most importantly, the proximity to Moscow, the center of which is less than 20 km.  In 2017, in Khimki, a new very attractive LCD “Forest Corner” came into operation.  Now there are only a few apartments left for sale. </p><p>  This article provides detailed information about the features of this housing complex, its infrastructure, layouts, transport accessibility and the opinions of those who have already bought housing here. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  In a very picturesque and comfortable place to live is the LCD "Forest Corner".  He has such a mailing address - Opanasenko Street, plot number 5. Leninsky Prospekt passes nearby.  The complex was built on the banks of the Khimki River, the channel of which in this area has expanded so much that it looks like a wonderful little lake.  Immediately after it begins a forest park.  Part of the green spaces beautifully frames the complex, creating a wonderful ecology and a lot of opportunities for its residents not only to admire the beauty of nature from the windows of apartments, but also to take daily walks along shady alleys and paths. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Forest Corner" class="if" height="286" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1639149.jpg" width="504"></div>  Near the complex there are other natural sites.  Moscow Canal is about 200 meters away, and Khimki Forest Park begins 450 meters away.  The closest neighbors of the Lesnoy Corner complex are: a sanatorium, Streletsky residential complex and Dubrava residential complex, and another residential complex consisting of three high-rises is erected across the road.  Also surrounded by the complex are one-story private sector houses.  The nearest industrial enterprises “Energomash” and “Fakel” are located a few kilometers from the “Forest Corner” and are not affected by the ecology of the region.

Khimki is a city, although located near Moscow, but due to frequent traffic jams, it is not possible to get to many of its areas from the capital quickly.  The "Forest Corner" was built near Leninsky Prospekt.  Turning left on it, you can go onto the M11 highway after 600 meters.  Following in the opposite direction, after 2.7 km you can get to the Leningrad highway. </p><p>  <span>A bus stop</span> from the farthest housing of the LCD is 700 meters away, which is certainly convenient.  But constant traffic jams even on all nearby streets create problems for motorists and those who use public transport. </p><p>  The large-scale construction of housing complexes, which unfolded near the "Forest Corner", in the future can only aggravate the situation with transport.  A good option for residents of this area is the railway.  Khimki station, which is about 1,500 meters away.  Subway construction near the complex is not planned. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Forest Corner Khimki" class="if" height="323" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1639144.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Complex infrastructure </h2><p>  LCD "Forest Corner" was built by the construction company "Clover Group".  Although she is not among the ten leaders in Moscow, she tried to make this complex as convenient as possible for its residents.  In total, 9 eight- and nine-story buildings were built here. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The territory of the complex is already fenced and guarded.  Entrances are available both from the side of the river, and from the private sector.  Several playgrounds were built on the territory of the residential complex, lawns and flowerbeds were destroyed.  In buildings No. 1 to No. 3, as well as in building No. 9, apartments are located on the ground floors.  In building No. 4 on the ground floor, HOA offices are equipped; in building No. 5, the first floor is given as a kindergarten for 55 children.

    <h2>  Infrastructure around </h2><p>  LCD "Forest Corner" is located in the "old Khimki", where there are some infrastructure, but most of them were built in the last century.  Closest to the LCD are a dispensary in which everyone can buy a course, undergo medical procedures, and two small grocery stores. </p><p>  The Khimki Central District Hospital is 700 meters from the housing complex, and a clinic is 900 meters away.  You can get here by minibus or walk.  Not far from the clinic is a municipal kindergarten and two schools.  The nearest large shops from the LCD are a 5-10 minute walk if you walk on Leninsky Prospekt.  Immediately beyond the river and the forest park are a church, a stadium and a swimming pool. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lc forest corner reviews" class="if" height="325" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1639156.jpg" width="501"></div>

    <h2>  Architecture and design </h2><p>  It looks elegant and cheerful from the side of the LCD "Forest Corner".  Reviews of those who have already bought apartments here, and those who are still eyeing, are noted by its cute multi-colored cubic-shaped buildings, one look of which lifts the mood.  In addition, they are not built next to each other, but at a considerable distance.  This creates the necessary space.  The design of the entrance groups of all buildings is simple, but their layout is convenient and comprehensively thought out.  Each house has elevators (cargo and passenger), storage rooms, wheelchairs, a place where you can leave a bicycle.  Entrances to the entrances are equipped with intercoms.  Cases erected by a monolithic method.  Facades have an interesting glazing solution.  The flights of stairs in all the houses are unusually wide, with 8-10 apartments per floor. </p>

    <h2>  Purchase of real estate in the residential complex "Forest Area" (Khimki) </h2><p>  The construction of the complex was started in 2012.  At that time, the cost of m2 here ranged from 92,000 rubles.  We worked with the developer on this project: </p><p>  - Sberbank. </p><p>  - "VTB 24". </p><p>  - "Bank Rosgosstrah". </p><p>  - "Revival." </p><p>  - “Delta Credit”. </p><p>  - "Bank of Moscow". </p><p>  Transactions were executed on the basis of DDU.  A mortgage was issued for a period of up to 30 years if the first installment was at least 20%.  Interest rates were from 11.75%. </p><p>  Now there are almost no apartments left for sale.  You can check their availability with the representatives of the developer. </p><p>  At the moment, secondary real estate in the Lesnoy Corner residential complex is offered for purchase.  Since apartments are put up for sale by individuals, prices depend only on the appetites of the apartment owners, on the quality of the repairs already made, on the floor and the final layout.  To date, one-room apartments are offered at prices from 4,900,000 to 5,700,000 rubles, two-room ones - from 6,990,000 to 7,000,000 rubles.
