    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Reviews of the Korona hotel (Crimea, Yevpatoriya), in addition to positive ones, also contain some negative comments.  Going to this hotel, you should be prepared for the following possible negative points: </p><ul><li>  old furniture and rusty plumbing; </li><li>  very cramped bathroom; </li><li>  no hairdryer (neither in the room, nor at the reception); </li><li>  the bathroom has an unpleasant smell of dampness and sewage; </li><li>  on the double bed 2 mattresses are laid, which are always moving apart; </li><li>  there is no elevator in the residential building; </li><li>  inflated prices for accommodation, meals and other services; </li><li>  the rooms practically do not catch wireless Internet; </li><li>  the pool is disgustingly dirty; </li><li>  in some of the rooms air conditioners do not work (by the way, no discount on accommodation in this regard is done); </li><li>  the beach is untidy and dirty, without such necessary infrastructure as showers and toilets; </li><li>  the impression is that the bath has not been cleaned since installation; </li><li>  the pool is not heated; </li><li>  the bartender doesn‚Äôt always have change, and therefore you are forced to leave a kind of tip; </li><li>  holey and moldy bathroom rug; </li><li>  instead of a chandelier, in the room you will see a light bulb hanging on a wire (although perhaps not in all rooms); </li><li>  employees do not fully possess information about prices and rules of accommodation, which often causes confusion and various unpleasant situations; </li><li>  paid parking (although the official website states that use is included in the price). </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  An institution such as Korona (3 * hotel, Yevpatoriya) causes a rather mixed impression.  At first glance, the hotel is quite modern and comfortable, located in a convenient location that combines silence and proximity to the resort infrastructure.  Nevertheless, a closer look reveals a lot of flaws. </p><p>  The first thing to which claims arise is the dilapidation of both the number of rooms and the hotel as a whole.  It can be seen that cosmetic repairs are regularly carried out, but ‚Äútinting‚Äù, ‚Äúgluing‚Äù and ‚Äúcoating‚Äù is not enough.  The hotel needs major restoration and replacement of furniture, as well as plumbing.  Given the high prices for accommodation, such requirements of the guests are quite justified. </p><p>  Reviews about the hotel "Crown" Evpatoria put forward serious complaints about the beach.  The hotel rents a coastal zone, but practically does not care for it.  There is no infrastructure on the beach, but there are some obscure structures and abandoned building materials.  Swimming in the pool will also not give you pleasure, because no one cleans it (except for children, in which the water is crystal-clear). </p>
