Officially, it is uninhabited, but the rich nature, unique climate, white sand beaches and calm warm sea during the holiday season attract thousands of tourists. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  Archaeological finds discovered on the island indicate that its territory was inhabited during the Neolithic and Bronze Ages.  The island of Dzharylgach is mentioned in many works of ancient authors, such as, for example, Ptolemy and Herodotus, and the myth of the emergence of the Dzharylgach spit, which connects the island to the coast, arose during the Trojan War.  There is also an assumption that the island where Odysseus and his soldiers were captured by the one-eyed Cyclops, this is Dzharylgach.  This is evidenced by the texts of Homer, which describes the deserted Goat Island, located near the coast and covered with dense forest, where many wild goats are found.  In the northern part of the Black Sea, where, as you know, these events took place, there is no other such island.  As for the forest, which is currently not on the island, then translated from Turkic as ‚Äúdzharylgach‚Äù means a scorched forest or burnt trees.  There is also a version that the island became a prototype of Buyan, described by A.S. Pushkin in a famous poem. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dzharylgach island" class="if" height="411" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/459026.jpg" width="595"></div>

    <h2>  Nature </h2><p>  Due to the fact that, starting in 1923, the island of Dzharylgach was part of the Askania Nova Nature Reserve, and since 1927 it became part of the Primorsky Nature Reserve, there it was possible to preserve the amazing, almost untouched nature.  Today, there is a national natural park created to preserve the historical, cultural and natural values ‚Äã‚Äãof the northern coast. </p><p>  Despite the fact that almost the entire territory of the island is a steppe, its flora is very rich.  About 500 species of plants grow here, 50 of which are endemic, that is, found only in a limited area.  Among them, 7 species from the orchid family. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The fauna of the island is even more impressive.  Here you can find 15 species of mammals, including <span>wild horses,</span> red deer, mouflon, roe deer, fallow deer, raccoon dogs.  The island has an incredible variety of insects, ranging from colorful butterflies to frightening tourists karakurt, not to mention the clouds of mosquitoes and midges. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dzharylgach island reviews" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/459024.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Marine life is rich in shrimp, crabs, mussels, various species of fish, as well as the ubiquitous jellyfish.  From the shore you can often see dolphins, of which there are 3 species: bottlenose dolphin, guinea pig and white cask. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  The climatic conditions on the island are perfect for families with children.  In winter, the temperature does not fall below -2 <sup>0</sup> C, and in summer it does not exceed + 25 + 28 <sup>0</sup> C. The air humidity, given the marine environment, is quite high, but the cool air flows coming from the continent in the warm season do not allow the climate to be too hot .  It rains rarely, the average rainfall per year does not exceed 400 mm.  Sea air is saturated with iodine compounds released by seaweed, as well as ozone and oxygen.  Mixed with the scents of local herbs, it creates an indescribable, memorable aroma. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dzharylgach island, Kherson region" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/459023.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  One of the features of the island is its versatility in terms of recreation.  The bay separating the Dzharylgach island from the coast is shallow, which allows the water to warm up on the hottest days to 30 <sup>0</sup> C. Thanks to sunlight and shallow depth <span>, seaweed</span> form entire underwater meadows at the bottom, attracting numerous marine life in the form of fish and mollusks.  There are never big waves on this side of the island.  Long sandy beaches of coarse white sand and a shallow depth make swimming in the sea as safe as possible, so this site is the best suited for families with children.  Photos of the island of Dzharylgach, with its azure calm sea and white sand on endless beaches, taken in fine sunny weather, resemble images of the beaches of Thailand.  On the opposite side, the island is washed by the cool waters that bring underwater currents.  The sea is deeper and more uneasy, which attracts fans of surfing, diving, fishing and other entertainment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="photo of dzharylgach island" class="if" height="377" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/459022.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Rest on the island Dzharylgach </h2><p>  On the island itself there are no tourist centers, sanatoriums and private pensions, but in the summer there are enough tourists.  They come from the coast to sunbathe on deserted beaches, admire the beauty of the Dzharylgach Bay, see animals in their natural environment or simply relax in the bosom of almost wild nature.  Some camp for a long time, setting up tents right on the beach.  This place has attracted and continues to attract nudists from the countries of the former USSR.  They have their own beaches, traditions and rules.  Knowledgeable people come here to improve their health with the help of medicinal mud, which they themselves produce near salt lakes. </p><p>  Those who decide to relax on the island with a savage should take into account that there is only one source of fresh water from the ‚Äúamenities‚Äù, a fire can not be made without firewood brought with you due to the lack of trees, and mosquito hordes after <span>sunset</span> will not allow you to enjoy the sunset calmly .  But even such inconveniences do not stop those who want to enjoy the pristine nature and visit the island of Dzharylgach.  Reviews about this vacation are very diverse, but most agree that the impressions of such adventures will remain for life. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  The only attraction of the island, excluding the sea, beaches, flora and fauna, is the old lighthouse, installed on the east coast of the island in 1902 with the money of S. Skadovsky.  It is known that the lighthouse was designed in France by one of the students of G. Eiffel and brought here disassembled.  What is surprising is that in appearance it resembles the famous Eiffel Tower.  Not far from the <span>old lighthouse</span> is a new one, installed in 1997.  Some tourists who come to the island settle down to spend the night in a new lighthouse. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays on the island of Dzharylgach" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3663/460825.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <h2>  How to get </h2><p>  Do not worry too much if you come to Skadovsk or Lazurnoe, but don‚Äôt know how to go to Dzharylgach island by transport.  A friendly local population will tell you how to get there and how, some representatives of which earn money on organizing such excursions.  You can get there yourself.  It‚Äôs easiest and safest to catch a ferry in Skadovsk and after an hour calmly sunbathe on the beach.  You can also walk through the spit from the side of Lazurny, but you have to go all day, and this route is quite dangerous, since the scythe sometimes rinses. </p>
