    <p>  The search for connectivity usually begins with the subscriber learning the instructions for the model of his mobile phone.  If there is such a service in the device options, then the connection occurs without the participation of a telecom operator.  Typically, the procedure takes a matter of seconds. </p><p>  If there is no option in the phone, then you can install a special application program.  After its installation, the creation of a list of banned subscribers will be possible. </p><p>  Several of the following ways to activate the service will help answer the question of how to add to the black list in MTS. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="connect black list pay" class="if" height="383" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16531/349327.jpg" width="413"></div>

You need to dial the sequence * 111 * 442 # (call) on your mobile phone, after which you will receive instructions that the subscriber must follow.  In case of its error-free actions, the service is connected immediately. </p><p>  You can activate this offer by sending an SMS with the text 442 * 1 to number 111. </p><p>  You can use the Internet assistant to activate the call barring service.  To find it, first you need to go to the MTS official website.  You can configure the service from your personal account, into which the user enters after authorization. </p><p>  The company‚Äôs website has the opportunity to contact the personal manager and get comprehensive information from him about the activation of this offer to bar calls. </p><p>  If the subscriber does not fit all the recommendations listed above for some reason, then you can just go to the MTS mobile phone salon, contact a consultant, and he will activate the service at the client‚Äôs request. </p><h2></h2><h2>  How to disable this offer </h2><p>  Disabling the Black List service (MTS) is possible in the same ways as connecting it.  Only the combination of signs for the call and SMS will change: </p><p>  - * 111 * 442 * 2 # (call) - a combination for calling the operator. </p><p>  - 442 * 2 - SMS text message for number 111. </p><p>  The bans activated by the Black List service can be canceled all at once. </p><h2></h2><h2>  How to block SMS </h2><p>  How to add messages to the blacklist in MTS?  It turns out that you can block not only calls, but also SMS.  Sometimes this is true when a person wants to protect himself from the endless advertising that distribution networks send.  In order for the lock to start working, it is necessary, firstly, to activate the emergency service, and secondly, to activate SMS Pro by sending a free SMS to number 232. In the text, you must write one of these combinations: ‚ÄúReg‚Äù or ‚ÄúON‚Äù. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Subscribers for whom the ban is established, after sending their SMS will stop receiving information about the delivery of the item. </p><p>  A person who has installed the SMS blocking service, if desired, can see from whom, when messages were received, but it will not be possible to read the text. </p><h2></h2><h2>  How to use the service </h2><p>  For subscribers from your blacklist, you can select and set any of the types of blocking: either calls, or SMS, or both.  A variety of options makes communication as comfortable as possible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="disable mts blacklist service" class="if" height="389" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16531/349221.jpg?1394206690233" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The person whose number is covered by the prohibition will hear information in response to the call that the subscriber is outside the coverage area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe network, or the busy signal. </p><p>  The subscriber can change the blacklist by dialing * 442 # on his phone.  By sending SMS to number 4424 with the message "22 * number", it is also possible to remove restrictions. </p><p>  It is convenient to edit your blacklist directly from your MTS account.  Here you can set the schedule for blocking messages, for example, setting the days of the week when calls from the subscriber are undesirable.  This makes it possible to spend a relaxing weekend.  Or set a time period to block all shipments, for example, during the nighttime, etc. </p><p>  You can connect the black list (MTS) through the operator to any modern phone model.  Installation of additional applications in this case is not required.  You can list not only mobile numbers, but also home and international phones. </p><h2></h2><h2>  How does the access code work? </h2><p>  Sometimes situations arise in which the content of the blacklist becomes available to other people.  What to do to prevent this from happening?  If the subscriber does not want to delete the black list (MTS) or announce it, then you can set the access code for the call barring service.  In this case, viewing, editing and all other actions will be possible only after entering the received access code.  It needs to be remembered or written down.  It is allowed to enter the wrong code only 4 times, after which the service is blocked.  It will need to be reinstalled. </p><p>  To set this code itself, you need to dial the combination * 442 # or send SMS with the text 5 to 4424. As you can see, everything is very simple. </p><p>  The ‚Äúaccess code‚Äù service is disconnected for free by dialing * 111 * 442 # or sending SMS to number 111 with the message text 442 * 3 </p><h2></h2><h2>  Are there any restrictions? </h2><p>  Blacklist (MTS) undesirable for communication people can subscribers of any tariff.  But there are limitations.  These include: ‚ÄúMTS Connect‚Äù, ‚ÄúMTS iPad‚Äù, ‚ÄúOnline‚Äù.  All modifications of these tariffs are also deprived of the ability to connect to the service.  So for those who want to keep calm, they should stop their choice on other offers of the company. </p><p>  Owners of tariffs ‚ÄúMTS Connect‚Äù, ‚ÄúOnline‚Äù, ‚ÄúCool‚Äù, ‚ÄúMTS iPad‚Äù and all their modifications do not have SMS blocking capabilities. </p><p>  There is a limit to the number of rooms that can be entered in an emergency.  Blacklist (MTS) is allowed no more than 300 subscribers. </p><p>  The service does not apply to MMS blocking. </p><p>  How to add subscribers of other countries to the black list in MTS?  The answer to this question may sound like this: the service is valid only on the territory of those states where a special agreement is concluded. </p>

And for using the service a daily amount of 1.5 rubles is charged. </p><p>  Sending a text message to numbers 111 and 4424 in the home region is free, and in roaming the price corresponds to the cost of SMS according to the tariff plan. </p><p>  Management of your social circle sometimes becomes a prerequisite for a comfortable existence, psychological balance.
