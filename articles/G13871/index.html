Toropets is one of them.  The city was founded in the XI century.  About 13 thousand people live in it today.  About the <span>sights of Toropets</span> and the surrounding area will be discussed in this article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.toropets.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãof toropets" class="if uuid-2538538" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2538538.jpg"></div><h2>  History </h2><p>  Between the upper reaches of the Western Dvina and the Toropa River there was once a small principality.  It bordered with the lands of Novgorod, Smolensk and Polotsk.  The center of this principality was Toropets, which was first mentioned in chronicles in 1074.  Mstislav Mstislavovich ruled here then, and later his son David Mstislavovich, who died in 1226 in a battle with the Lithuanians. </p><p>  In Toropets, attractions that relate to the Middle Ages were gone.  But in the center of the city there were preserved ancient ramparts, which were probably covered with princes Toropetsky Mstislav the Brave. </p><div class="photo" data-original="smolbattle.ru" data-author=": " data-source="http://smolbattle.ru/threads/%D0%A2%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%86-%D0%BF%D1%83%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%88%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D0%B2-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%88%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B5.31584/"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãtoropets history" class="if uuid-2538519" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2538519.jpg"></div><p>  In the XVII century the city was captured by the Poles.  Residents quickly got rid of the invaders, but the Ukrainian Cossacks arrived in time, who managed to fight off the onslaught with difficulty.  Toropets by that time became a trade and craft center.  Not surprisingly, he attracted the attention of unfriendly neighbors and militant Cossacks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the beginning of the 20th century, seven and a half thousand inhabitants lived in the city.  There were 18 churches, one and a half thousand residential buildings and more than 20 factories. </p><div class="photo" data-original="smolbattle.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Epiphany Church" class="if uuid-2538530" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2538530.jpg"></div><h2>  List of Toropets sights </h2><p>  On the territory of this small city there are more than forty cultural monuments.  Among the buildings of high historical value, it is worth highlighting the Korsunsky-Bogoroditsky Cathedral. </p><p>  The ancient fortress has not been preserved.  The Kremlin, built in the 11th century, has been destroyed for a long time, only bulky shafts remained from it, from which, by the way, an excellent view of Toropets opens.  The list of the best attractions of this ancient city includes the following objects: </p><ul><li>  Epiphany Church. </li><li>  Monument to the teacher. </li><li>  Museum of Local Lore. </li><li>  Monument to Admiral Peter Rikord. </li><li>  Trade area. </li><li>  Transfiguration Church. </li><li>  St. Tikhon Monastery. </li></ul><h2>  Korsunsky-Bogoroditsky Cathedral </h2><p>  The most beautiful ancient temples in Russia are located near water bodies.  The list of such buildings is quite extensive, one of them is the Korsunsky-Bogoroditsky Cathedral, located on the shores of Lake Solomeno.  True, it is difficult to call it an old building.  He is a little over two hundred years old, which is not an age for an Orthodox church.  But, of course, this is one of the most beautiful temples in the Tver region.  It is designed in the Baroque style, built by the architect Osip Spirkin. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Korsunsky-Bogoroditsky Cathedral" class="if uuid-2538553" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2538553.jpg"></div><h2>  Epiphany Church </h2><p>  The temple was erected in the second half of the 18th century.  Funds for the construction allocated local merchant Fedor Gundarev.  The Epiphany Church is one of the main attractions of Toropets.  Connoisseurs of Russian architecture claim that there are no similar buildings in other cities of Russia.  This temple is an example of the Toropetsk architectural school.  An interesting detail of the building is the unusually located bell tower.  Now within the walls of this temple there is a local history museum - another attraction of Toropets, which you should definitely visit. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mapio.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Epiphany Church" class="if uuid-2538559" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2538559.jpg"></div><h2>  Trade area </h2><p>  In the middle of the XVI century, shopping arcades appeared on the territory of the historical center of the city of Toropets, Tver Region.  They were opposite the Big Bridge.  Then there were about forty shops. </p><p>  Lively merchants offered cloth, silk and other haberdashery goods.  Closer to the Spasskaya Church was a bread row.  Trade was also conducted in the central square, where peasants came from villages.  They sold hay, firewood, straw and other products of rural industry.  On the shore of Lake Solomeno was a "fish sale."  Brisk trade in the square is a thing of the past.  But this Toropetsk attraction is a must-see. </p><h2>  Monument to the teacher </h2><p>  In the seventies of the last century a monument was erected in Toropets, dedicated to all those who "sow the rational, good, eternal."  Today it is one of the attractions that invariably attract tourists.  The monument was designed by the Moscow sculptor Orekhov.  The grand opening took place on the day of the celebration of the 900th anniversary of the city.  The sculpture is located on Komsomolskaya Street, opposite the secondary school No. 1. This sculpture is the first monument to the teacher, installed in Russia. </p><div class="photo" data-original="photogoroda.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="monument to teacher" class="if uuid-2538566" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2538566.jpg"></div><h2>  St. Tikhon Monastery </h2><p>  The history of this monastery began recently.  Convent located in Toropets, founded in 2005.  But, of course, this attraction of the Tver region has a background. </p><p>  Around the second half of the 11th century, a monastery was founded on the outskirts of the city, on the banks of the Zalikovia.  In the first third of the XIV century, the city suffered two troubles - a flood and fire, which destroyed almost all buildings.  These disasters were so vast that Toropets had to rebuild. </p><p>  About the monastery, which was located on the site founded in the two thousandth female monastery, it is known thanks to the scribe book, compiled under Ivan the Terrible.  In the XIV century, the building was restored.  In the XVII century a stone monastery towered here, which played an important role in the cultural life of Toropets.  Under Catherine the Great, a manifesto was signed, according to which the land was withdrawn from the monastery property and transferred to the state. </p><p>  In 2005, the Holy Synod approved the creation of an Orthodox convent in the city of Toropets.  In 2006, divine services began.  On the territory of the monastery are St. Nicholas and Pokrovsky churches.  The first was founded in the 16th century.  The second - in the XVIII century.  These churches are preserved, but in very poor condition. </p><div class="photo" data-original="oldboy.icnet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Tikhon Monastery" class="if uuid-2538570" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2538570.jpg"></div><h2>  Tours and museums </h2><p>  Holidays in Toropets will suit lovers of peace and tranquility.  There is only one museum here - local history.  It presents a unique exposition that allows you to get acquainted with the history of the city.  About monasteries and temples mentioned above.  But the charm of this village is not only in the sights, but also in its location.  The city is located in the western part of the Valdai Upland.  Where previously stood dense forests, bringing death to strangers.  Today in the vicinity of Toropets there are many tourist centers. </p><p>  There are no excursions that include exclusively the attractions of this city.  However, Toropets is included in many tourist routes in the cities of the Tver and Novgorod regions.  So, one of the most popular multi-day tours involves visiting cities such as Velikiye Luki, Polybino, Vitebsk, and, of course, the settlement discussed in today's article.
