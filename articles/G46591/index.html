    <p>  How to <span>fill out a</span> VAT <span>tax return</span> for tax agents for whom the second section of the document is provided?  Consider an example.  The VAT return is as follows: </p><ul><li>  line 010 is intended for affixing a code of the reason for registration with a branch of a foreign organization that monitors the payment of tax fees and submits financial documentation; </li><li>  line 020 displays the full name of the subject of foreign business, which is not considered in the tax authority; </li><li>  in line 030 enter the TIN of the subject; </li><li>  line 040 sets the code according to the budget classifier; </li><li>  line 050 is the code for the classifier of territories of municipalities; </li><li>  in line 060 write the final calculations for VAT, intended for payment by a tax agent; </li><li>  line 070 is used to affix the code of activities carried out by the entity, which must calculate and pay tax fees; </li><li>  line 080 shows the amount of VAT calculated by the agent in the current tax period; </li><li>  line 090 records the amount of tax deductions that are calculated against future transactions for the sale of goods (services, works). </li></ul><p>  There is a point at which it is necessary to focus attention when formulating a VAT return for 2014. The form may be filled out with changes in some cases.  If there is no data on column 080, then the value of column 090 is written to 060. If there is no data on column 090, a value from 080 is written to 060. <br><br>  The third section shows the rates of the tax itself, its base, the amount of tax already accrued, the volume of all refunds.  The submission of a VAT return implies only the correct execution, which should look as described below. </p><ul><li>  the payer must indicate his checkpoint and TIN; </li><li>  010-040 displays data on the amount of tax at a certain rate and on the tax base determined by Articles 153-157 and 159 of the Tax Code; </li><li>  010, 020 - lines for amounts taxed with 18% and 10% rates.  The data is calculated by multiplying the numbers c.  3 of the third section by 10 or 18 and dividing the total by 100. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="VAT declaration tax period" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21985/472651.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Section plan for the third section </h2><ol><li>  To calculate 030, 040, the values ‚Äã‚Äãof paragraph 3 of Sec.  3 by 18, then divided by 118 (if necessary, 18 is replaced by 10, 118 - 110). </li><li>  050 - the tax base and the calculation of VAT are put down here when the company is sold as property. </li><li>  060 - this item records data on the tax base and its amount accrued during the installation and construction works for personal purposes. </li><li>  070 - here the amounts of payments are entered into account of upcoming trade transactions;  here the successors record information on various payments in respect of the planned implementing operations. </li><li>  080 - contains information on accruals related to the payment of proposals, which contribute to an increase in the tax base (Article 162). </li><li>  090 - the amount of VAT that must be restored.

    <h2>  In what cases can responsibility for the clarification be avoided? </h2><ul><li>  The taxpayer managed to submit the updated information before the tax inspectorate informed him of the fact of the discovery of the process of understating the tax amount that was established as payment, or before the notice of the beginning of the financial audit of the situation. </li><li>  The residual amount and interest were paid prematurely until the moment when the clarification was submitted to the tax authorities. </li></ul><h2>  Features of filing revised declarations </h2><p>  First of all, it should be noted that the "clarification" must fully confirm the correct information.  It is also necessary to take into account the fact that the VAT return tax period for each payer does not provide for the same amount of time. </p><p>  All data must comply with legal standards.  Tax agents may reflect the data of those taxpayers who have found errors or distortions. </p><p>  In general, there are two main reasons for the need to submit specified information: underpayment or overpayment.  In case of underpayment of tax by the organization, it is obliged to enter clarifying information.  But if the error was discovered by the taxpayer after the submission of the declaration and did not lead to an underestimation of the tax base, then the obligation to correct information from the organization is removed. </p><p>  For a refund to the tax authority in case of an overpayment, there is also no need to submit a clarification.  This is regulated by article 78 of the <span>tax law.</span>  But at the same time it must be said that the tax authorities are very responsible in returning funds, and seek to confirm the fact of overpayment by an updated declaration.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Therefore, in the event that the organization intends to regain the overpaid amounts, it is better to submit the clarification to the tax service. </font></font></p><h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> How to confirm tax deductions </font></font></h2><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If the organization performs the functions of a tax agent, such deductions are subject to particularly rigorous verification (they are indicated in line 210 of the third section). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">These data are filled in by the taxpayers themselves.</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> At the same time, there is a list of organizations for which a tax deduction is not provided: </font></font></p><ol><li> ,         145  <span>    .</span> </li><li> ,      . </li><li> ,     (   )      ,         . </li></ol><p> <span> </span>                ,         . </p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The list of documents to confirm the legality of the deduction requirement is small. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">These are all payment documents containing information that the withheld VAT has been paid to the state budget; </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">invoices must also be submitted by the taxpayer. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A deduction can only be calculated when the acquisition is planned to be used for activities subject to VAT.</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Regarding invoices, some important points need to be mentioned. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the case where the deduction is "agent", it is confirmed by documents that were made directly by the agent himself. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The organization in this option independently draws up invoices in duplicate. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">One copy is stored in the journal for the control of issued invoices, it is recorded in the sales book by the date of the final preparation of the document.</font></font></p>

    <p> Another copy is sent to the control book of received invoices and recorded in the purchase journal.  These rules are established by a decree of the Government of the Russian Federation adopted in December 2000 (No. 914). </p><p>  It is necessary to pay attention also to the fact that in the above version the invoice is not issued by the selling entity, therefore, an application for deduction from the advance amount that has been transferred is not allowed.  You can only use your tax advantages when the advanced products are finally registered. </p><p>  We hope that our information will help you calculate the VAT correctly and correctly fill out the declaration. </p>
