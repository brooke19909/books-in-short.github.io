    <h2>  Rybinsk Museum-Reserve: History </h2><p>  In October 1910, the first science museum was opened in Rybinsk, which was created in the building of the Commercial School.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a museum was made by the local intelligentsia, which united in the department of the Yaroslavl Historical Society.  It included A.A. Mikhailov, N.N. Rozov, B.G. Verdi, L.A. Albitsky and other prominent figures of the city. </p><p>  By 1913, the museum had five departments: </p><ul><li>  geological; </li><li>  mineralogical; </li><li>  botanical; </li><li>  zoological; </li><li>  anthropological. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rybinsk Historical Architectural and Art Museum Reserve" class="if" height="419" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1322609.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><p>  His collection by this time totaled several thousand interesting exhibits.  At the initiative of D.A. Ushakov, which was supported by A.A. Zolotarev, A.V. Burov, L.A. Albitsky and others, with the assistance of the city leadership, in December 1919, an art-historical museum was founded in Rybinsk.  The center of his collection was the exhibits provided by the surrounding noble estates.  After some time, the exposition was supplemented by arrivals of artworks from museums and art galleries in Moscow and Petrograd. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The first real professional in museum business at the Rybinsk Museum was E.V.Sosnina, who came to the museum after the collection of applied art, which was confiscated from her relatives by the Rybinsk Cheka. </p><h2>  Museum in the 30s </h2><p>  The thirties of the last century began with the mass arrests of museum employees who were accused of reactionary ideology.  Since 1935, the development of the Department of Nature, led by the writer, artist G. Lesovik, became its head.  Around the same time, the museum received hundreds of exhibits from the disbanded small museums (Poshekhonsky, Mologsky, etc.). </p><p>  At the beginning of World War II, the museum was suspended, and all exhibits were packed and prepared for evacuation.  However, already in May 1942, the museum again met visitors in some departments. </p><h2>  Museum after WWII </h2><p>  Since the mid-fifties, the museum began to replenish its collection with the works of modern Soviet and foreign artists.  During this period, the heyday of the complex.  In February 1959, he received the status of a historical and art museum.  In addition to creating an exposition telling about the life of the region, museum specialists began to restore exhibits already in existence.  So the Rybinsk Museum-Reserve was created.  Exhibitions of folk art, glass and porcelain, icon painting began to work on an ongoing basis. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rybinsk State Museum Reserve" class="if" height="411" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1322608.jpg" width="600"></div>

During this period of time, <span>exhibition activity</span> intensified <span>.</span>  The tradition includes collective and personal exhibitions of Rybinsk artists, young local painters.  In turn, exhibits from this Volga city began to appear frequently at exhibitions in metropolitan museums. </p><p>  In January 1989, the museum received its current status.

It is located on the banks of the Volga.  Bread exchange is a historical and architectural monument of the city.  The building was built in 1912 by the Moscow architect A. Ivanov.  Curly roofs with openwork crests, facades lined with tiles and irrigation tiles - all this splendor resembles the chambers of fairy-tale heroes, though built using modern technology at that time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rybinsk Museum Reserve Exhibition" class="if" height="383" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1322606.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Today, most of the decoration of that time has been preserved inside: stucco molding of ceilings, openwork wrought iron railings of stairs, etc.  The building is built of brick and tiled with German tiles.  In the decoration of the beautiful building was used over two hundred colored tiles.  They depict double-headed eagles, herbs and flowers.  The foundation is made of rubble stone and deepened by four meters.  This is to ensure that the structure withstands the spring flood of the river. </p><p>  The building of the bread exchange in the XIX century embodied the strength, power and wealth of the Rybinsk merchants.  Traders and industrialists from all over Russia gathered in this building.  In the XX century, this building served as a military hospital, as well as a military headquarters, and a city hospital until it was transferred to the museum.
