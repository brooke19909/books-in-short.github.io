The number of inhabitants exceeds 50,000.  The basis of the economy are the enterprises of the electrical complex, textile and food industries, tourism is developed. </p><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  The first documented references to the city of Alytus in Lithuania relate to historical chronicles dated 1377.  To limit the expansion of the Teutonic Order, the fortress of Olita was built on the banks of the Neman.  However, archaeologists have established that as early as the 6th-9th centuries there was a large mixed Lithuanian-Yatvyag settlement.  Excavations also showed that in the XIV century in the historical center of the city were a church and town hall. </p><p>  After the Battle of Grunwald, the crusader raids ceased, and Alytus began to develop dynamically.  On October 15, 1581, the Grand Duke of Lithuania <span>Stefan Batory</span> granted the Magdeburg Law and coat of arms to the settlement.  This date is celebrated as City Day. </p><p>  Significant adjustments made XVII century.  Due to the intervention of the Swedes, the city lost a lot of people.  In 1798, as a result of the division of the Commonwealth, the right bank went to the Russian Empire, and the left bank - to Prussia.  Unification occurred only in 1915. </p><p>  During the Second World War, Alytus became the site of the first tank battle between German and Soviet mechanized units on June 22-23, 1941, which ended in heavy losses on both sides.  During the years of occupation, there was a concentration camp for Jews and a camp for exiles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.alytus-tourism.lt" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City Alytus, Lithuania" class="if uuid-2564138" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2564138.jpg"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Today Alytus in Lithuania is known as the cultural, administrative and economic center of the historical Dzukiya region, which occupies the southern part of the republic.  The city is located in a picturesque hilly area on the winding banks of the Neman River.  From all sides it is surrounded by forests and green pastures.  The architecture harmoniously combines old quarters with low-rise buildings, modern neighborhoods and the private sector. </p><p>  Alytus is divided into two unequal parts by the Neman.  The main housing estates and attractions are located on the left bank (Alytus I), on the right is the local airport, industrial areas and private buildings (Alytus II).  Both halves are connected by two automobile and one pedestrian bridges. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hotelroomsearch.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Alytus, Lithuania" class="if uuid-2564120" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2564120.jpg"></div><h2>  Demography </h2><p>  At the peak of its development, in 1989, the population of Alytus in Lithuania exceeded 73,000 people.

Before the war, almost a quarter of the population were Jews, but most of them were destroyed by the Nazis in the Alytus concentration camp.  Lithuania during the years of occupation was subjected to serious ethnic cleansing.  A significant outflow of people of other nationalities was observed in recent history.
