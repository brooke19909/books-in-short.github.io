    <p>  The VHI document costs are fully or partially covered, then they are valid only in paid clinics.  An agreement is concluded with each client, according to which a certain range of services is applicable. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  VTB Medical Insurance chooses many clients due to the advantages of working with the company: </p><ol><li>  Large selection of programs.  The client gets the opportunity to choose the range of services that he needs.  Thanks to the selection of the program, the payment of services that are unnecessary to the client is excluded. </li><li>  The constant help of the dispatcher.  Medical assistance to a person may be required at any time, so the work of a round-the-clock call center minimizes risks.  With it, you can make an appointment, find out the necessary information, which is very important for busy people. </li><li>  With an increase in the number of employees indicated in the contract, the tariff decreases.  <span>This benefit</span> applies to enterprise programs.  The employer is given a discount with an increase in the number of insured persons. </li><li>  Family members of the employee can benefit from services benefits.  This is beneficial because the insurance is provided by the employer, and the benefits are enjoyed by employees and their families. </li></ol>

This is a significant minus, since assistance to a person is often required on a business trip or on vacation, but the policy will be valid only where it is issued. </li><li>  Compensation can only be obtained with inpatient treatment.  Most drugs are bought outside the hospital, so they don‚Äôt pay for them. </li><li>  There are many conditions in the contract, in case of non-fulfillment of which there may be a refusal of compensation in case of occurrence of the cases indicated in the policy.  It turns out that having an agreement does not guarantee compensation, since it is important to fulfill all the conditions. </li><li>  In addition to payment for rehabilitation, there will be no other compensation. </li></ol><h2>  Programs </h2><p>  Previously, the company was called VTB Medical Insurance CJSC.  Now it has the form of an organization - OJSC.  Many customers choose voluntary insurance.  This service is provided in the following programs: </p><ol><li>  Classic VHI.  The program is considered standard, it provides employees of the organization with high-quality medical care, including diagnosis and treatment. </li><li>  GMS Global Medical Solutions.  Under this program, diagnostics and treatment are performed in large clinics of the world.  It involves a large amount of coverage, the limit is 3 billion US dollars. </li><li>  Accidents.  Under the terms of the program, with the occurrence of an accident that has caused harm to health, including death, the insured person or his heir receives the compensation laid down under the contract. </li><li>  <span>Employee Insurance.</span>  The program allows you to get help with business trips abroad. </li></ol>

    <p>  If the employer provides VTB Insurance medical policy, then this increases its credibility in the eyes of employees.  With the occurrence of an insured event, you must contact the company by providing personal documents.  If it is confirmed, compensation is provided to the client, provided for by the terms of the contract. </p><h2>  VHI for migrants </h2><p>  VTB Medical Insurance in Moscow and other cities allows migrants to use the services.  The policy is issued to citizens who are temporarily in the country.  This will allow them to avoid adverse effects on life and health. </p><p>  The policy is designed to receive health care in outpatient organizations, clinics, hospitals.  With the execution of the document, in addition to help, a person is provided with indemnification upon the occurrence of an insured event. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  The price of the policy for each client is different, because it depends on several factors: </p><ol><li>  The term of the contract.  It can be annual, but can last 3 months.  A short-term document is beneficial for workers working in seasonal jobs. </li><li>  Client age  The higher it is, the greater the risk of seeking help, and also the wider the list of services. </li><li>  Package list.  This is a list of services, which is included in the terms of the contract. </li></ol>
