    <p>  Holidays in Pattaya are often chosen because of the abundance of excursion programs.  Indeed, the tour necessarily includes both the spiritual part and acquaintance with a diverse Thai cuisine.  Thais know how to organically combine the process of cognition and entertainment in the process of relaxation.  Each program necessarily contains an entertaining component - shows, swimming, elephant riding. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The hotel has a restaurant with a capacity of 80 seats.  The bar offers cocktails and refreshments.  Food in Thailand is not a big deal.  The availability of cheap eateries and numerous cafes, the variety and cheapness of tropical fruits, an abundance of protein foods - all this allows you to easily organize your own meals.  Some of the hotel rooms include a separate cooking area.  Therefore, one restaurant in the hotel completely solves the issues of providing meals to guests of PK Resort 3 * (Thailand).  Pattaya <strong> </strong>  It is famous like no other Thai resort with an abundance of cafes, restaurants, nightly entertainment.  Therefore, food issues in hotels do not attach too much importance.  This is the difference from the concepts of rest in Turkey, where most of the time guests actually spend in the hotel. </p><p>  Tourists who appreciate the variety of food on the C grade, however, note the taste of dishes and the size of the servings.  However, the standards of perception of relaxation and habits of the all-inclusive system often provoke unlawful requirements for catering in hotels in Thailand. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  For the three-star hotel PK Resort Villas Jomtien Beach 3 * (Pattaya, Thailand), a rating above 3 points indicates the level of service of the declared category. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pk resort villas jomtien beach 3 thailand" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/801402.jpg" width="600"></div>
