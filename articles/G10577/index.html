    <h2>  Hibiscus Beach Hotel &amp; Villas: reviews of Russian tourists </h2><p>  Many travelers do not need to talk about how important it is to start ahead of time to plan any trip abroad.  After all, this will not only save money on early booking of the tour, but also avoid a number of difficulties and problems during the holidays.  With special attention, according to experienced tourists, you should approach the choice of the hotel where you plan to stay during your vacation abroad.  Indeed, the quality of your relaxation and impressions from it will depend a lot on this.  According to travelers, a lot of valuable information can be found by studying the reviews of those who have recently stayed in a particular hotel.  After all, former guests try to talk about both the advantages and disadvantages of hotels, which will allow you to get a better idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat you will expect during your vacation.  To save your time and effort, we offer you the generalized comments of Russian tourists who have already visited the Hibiscus Beach Hotel &amp; Villas.  Immediately, we note that the vast majority of our compatriots in their choice were not disappointed.  They were satisfied with the hotel and were ready to advise it to their friends and relatives.  But we learn more about everything. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hibiscus beach hotel villas 4" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1093989.jpg" width="600"></div>

According to them, the rooms here are spacious, bright, clean.  They are furnished in a simple, national style.  However, no one expected chic furniture and modern technology from a three-star hotel.  After all, the cost of living is appropriate.  According to our compatriots, the main thing is that the furniture in the rooms is of high quality and comfortable, and all the equipment is in working condition.  If something went wrong, then, as the guests noted, it was worth reporting the problem to the reception, and the hotel staff eliminated it as soon as possible.  As for problems with insects, almost none of the travelers came across them.  And if someone noticed a spider or a small cute lizard in their apartments, then this did not become a problem.  According to the guests, every night the hotel employees install insect repellent devices in the rooms. </p><p>  As disadvantages, some tourists note the lack of Wi-Fi in the rooms.  Free internet is available only at the reception and in the bar. </p><h2>  Cleaning </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews of our compatriots, the maids of the Hibiscus Beach Hotel &amp; Villas completely coped with their duties.  According to the guests, their rooms were always clean.  Despite the fact that this hotel is three-star, linen and a towel here are changed every day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hibiscus beach hotel villas reviews" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1093990.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Check in, departure </h2><p>  In accordance with the internal rules of Hibiscus Beach Hotel &amp; Villas 3 *, check-in of new arrivals is carried out after two in the afternoon.  However, as noted by our compatriots who have been here, if you arrive at the hotel early in the morning, in order to quickly get the room keys, it makes sense to offer the administrator at the reception 10-20 dollars.  In this case, you will almost certainly be populated very quickly, and you will not have to wait several hours. </p><p>  As for the day of departure, you should leave the occupied room before 12 noon.  Moreover, if your departure from the hotel is planned only in the evening, then you can extend the apartment for an additional fee or leave things in the luggage room and continue to use the hotel infrastructure. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hibiscus beach hotel villas" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1093992.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The opinions of our compatriots regarding this issue were largely similar.  So, Russian tourists believe that in general the level of food in Hibiscus Beach Hotel &amp; Villas (Sri Lanka) corresponds to the category and cost of the hotel.  When booking, you can choose the option that involves only breakfast or half board.  Most vacationers opted for the first option and did not regret it at all. </p><p>  According to the guests, breakfasts are the same every day.  You will be offered a lot of fresh fruits, pastries, porridge, fried eggs, etc.  However, tourists are advised not to rely on meat dishes.  During the day, you can also have lunch and dinner for a fee in the hotel restaurant.  According to the guests, they cook here very well, and there is an opportunity to try delicious national dishes.  However, the prices of both the restaurant and the hotel bar seemed too high for many travelers.  Therefore, most vacationers preferred to eat in cafes and restaurants outside the hotel.  According to our compatriots, there are several excellent establishments with good cuisine, reasonable prices and Russian-speaking workers.  Therefore, you will not have any problems with food during your vacation. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  An indisputable advantage of Hibiscus Beach Hotel &amp; Villas 4 *, according to many tourists, is the fact that the hotel is located on the beach.  Therefore, its guests can walk to the beach in just a couple of minutes.  The shore is sandy.  The beach is quite large and wide.  The sea is most often, as travelers say, restless.  Therefore, you will often see a red flag here.  By the way, tourists warn that you should not go into the water directly in front of the hotel.  The fact is that in this place you will immediately go to the depths, which may be unsafe.  It is best to walk towards about fifty meters.  Here, according to travelers, entering the water is gentle and more convenient. </p><p>  In general, our compatriots do not advise choosing this beach for those who come to rest with children.  Indeed, because of the constant strong waves, swimming with kids here can be very unsafe. </p>
