    <p>  Of course, for many travelers, the location of the hotel is important.  And the Club Hotel Mira 3 * hotel complex in this regard has some advantage, as it is located in the very center of Kemer, close to all shopping, entertainment venues and interesting sights.  The distance to the sea shore is only 250 meters - this distance is easy to overcome on foot. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The equally popular resort town of Antalya is located 45 kilometers from the hotel complex.  It is on its territory that the nearest international airport is located, the exact distance to which is 55 kilometers.  Nevertheless, you should not worry about such a long distance, since almost all travel agencies, as well as the hotel itself, provide a shuttle service. </p><h2>  Hotel complex Club Hotel Mira 3 * (Kemer): description of the territory and infrastructure </h2><p>  This hotel complex stands out with its thoughtful and convenient infrastructure.  Its total area is not so big and is 6500 square meters.  Along the perimeter are residential buildings, restaurants and office buildings.  The courtyard is reserved for swimming pools.

    <p>  By the way, the hotel was opened in 1998.  But not so long ago, in 2013, a complete reconstruction was carried out - the complex fully meets all international standards.  This is a great place for a comfortable and cozy stay. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Description of rooms at the hotel </h2><p>  The hotel complex Club Hotel Mira is considered relatively small - in its territory there are 52 rooms.  These are standard spacious rooms, designed for 1-2 adults and a child. </p><p>  Naturally, the rooms have the necessary set of furniture and household appliances.  The floors are carpeted.  Some rooms have a balcony or terrace.  The air conditioning system, which, by the way, works properly, will be indispensable in the midday heat.  You can watch satellite channels on TV, including some Russians.  There is a telephone, but the cost of international and intercity calls is not included in the total cost of living - you will need to pay extra separately. </p>
