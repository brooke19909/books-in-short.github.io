    <p>  <strong>Street - a cultural monument of the city</strong> </p><p>  Very often, Andreevsky Descent in Kiev is compared with the famous Arbat in Moscow or <span>Montmartre in Paris.</span>  And there really are similarities.  The fate and creativity of many cultural figures who lived and worked in houses located along the descent is associated with this place.  Some of them are museums and galleries today, where you can see the works of famous artists, objects that previously belonged to writers or actors.  Let's find out more about these places. </p><p>  <strong>The story of the creation of the famous descent</strong> </p><p>  Andreevsky descent in Kiev was built by periods.  Its upper part appeared in the 9-10th centuries, and in the 18th the street was expanded.  The descent began to be actively built up from the 19th century.  It is interesting that it connects two historical parts of the city: the upper and lower (Podil), which is called the city of artisans.  Today it is one of the most beautiful streets in Kiev, which is a meeting place for local residents, an obligatory part of sightseeing tours for city guests, and there is also an active trade in works of art. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Luxurious St. Andrew's Church</strong> </p><p>  The main attraction that decorates the St. Andrew‚Äôs descent in Kiev is the St. Andrew‚Äôs Church, located on St. Andrew‚Äôs Mountain.  And the names of these objects do not coincide by chance, they all come from the name of the Apostle Andrew the First-Called, who, according to legend, stopped to sleep here during his wanderings.  The temple was erected in the 18th century, and the first stone in its foundation was laid by the Empress Elizabeth herself.  The beauty and grandeur of this building, which is called the most picturesque masterpiece of Shoot, is amazing, according to the design of which the church was built.  Inside, the interior is made in <span>the rococo style,</span> and its luxury makes a strong impression on visitors. </p><p>  <strong>Other attractions</strong> </p><p>  There are other places that will be interesting to visit for those who come to Kiev.  St. Andrew's Descent will take you to various museums, art galleries, theaters and souvenir shops.  On this street is <span>the Church of the Tithes, the</span> Castle of Richard the Lionheart, as well as the monument to Prone Prokopovna and Golokhvastov.  There is something to see, how to be inspired and what to get as a keepsake. </p>
