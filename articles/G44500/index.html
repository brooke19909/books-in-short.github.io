    <h2>  What is an iPhone? </h2><p>  This section is not about the history of the device or about what operating system it works on, the conversation will be about the phone itself and the controls on it.  Initially, you should deal with the keys.  Being a device with a Multi-Touch screen, focused on touch control, iPhone 5s (original) has a very small number of hardware buttons.  The Home button is located on the front panel (part-time fingerprint sensor Touch ID).  At the top there is a power / lock button (the first one you will use).  On the left side is sound control, on the right is a tray for a SIM card. </p><h2>  First inclusion </h2><p>  As soon as you launch the ‚Äúfresh‚Äù gadget, you will be greeted by a <span>white screen</span> with a suggestion to start the setup.  In principle, the built-in assistant quite intuitively walks through the setup process, but still it‚Äôs worthwhile to analyze a number of points. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Language selection and Wi-Fi connection.  The language will be offered automatically based on the place of purchase of the device, but the user has the right to choose any other.  A Wi-Fi network may require a password.  Alternatively, you can use a mobile network, if one is supported.  To do this, you must initially insert the SIM card into the dedicated tray. </li><li>  The next step is to connect an Apple ID account, if one already exists, otherwise create a new one (Apple ID allows you to use a lot of phone features, including data synchronization, iMessage services, Apple Music and others). </li><li>  Create a short password to lock your smartphone (or scan a fingerprint). </li><li>  Initial setup of iCloud storage and Keychains (storage of passwords and credit card data). </li><li>  Enabling the definition of geolocation and the Find iPhone function (the Find iPhone function allows you to protect, and possibly find, the missing phone). </li><li>  Activating a smartphone with a communication provider. </li></ul><p>  This is how the iPhone 5s is set up from scratch, for those who have already used such a gadget, it will be enough to recover from the previously created copy of the device. </p>

    <h2>  Introducing iTunes </h2><p>  It is not always possible to activate the device via the Internet, sometimes for this you need to use the multimedia center from Apple, called iTunes.  This application allows you to not only activate the gadget, but also manage the data that is stored on it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To activate, you need to connect the iPhone to the computer using the supplied USB cable and press the ‚ÄúTrust‚Äù button on the phone.  This is all that is necessary to activate the iPhone 5s, settings and further bringing to mind can be done already on the device. </p>

    <p>  Also, using iTunes, you can install applications on your smartphone and synchronize multimedia content (music, movies, books). </p><p>  Setting up ‚ÄúiTunes‚Äù on the iPhone 5s is made with the Apple ID.  Once the <span>account</span> is created <span>, the user</span> will have access to all the content distributed in the iTunes Store. </p><p>  In iTunes, you can find a wide variety of content.  In it you can purchase music, films, books, download podcasts.  Even iPhone ringtones can be purchased there. </p><h2>  Interface </h2><p>  After activating the device, the first thing a new user will meet is the start screen with applications.  The phone already has preinstalled programs, such as a web browser, email client, notes, phone, and so on. </p><p>  Applications on the screen can be moved, deleted and organized using folders, just hold your finger on one of the icons, and then move it to a free position, to another program (to create a folder).  To delete, just click on the cross to the left of the icon.  Applications can be located on several screens (depending on their number). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

"Swipe" from top to bottom in the center of the screen opens Spotlight - the Apple search service that allows you to search for content on both the device and the Web. </p><h2>  IPhone 5s Features: Touch ID Settings </h2><p>  One of the core features of this <span>iPhone model is</span> <span>a fingerprint scanner.</span>  Its setup does not take much time and usually occurs before activation.  During the setup process, the phone will require you to put your finger on the Home button (it is advisable to wash your hands before) a dozen times in order to capture every angle at which you can touch the scanner (this was done for the most accurate data processing and quick unlock of the phone). </p><p>  The smartphone is capable of storing up to five prints at a time (you can make prints of your loved ones if you want them to use the device). </p>

    <h2>  Communication </h2><p>  An iPhone is primarily a means of communication, therefore, it has all the necessary tools for communication.  Applications "Phone" and "Messages", which are classic methods of communication.  Apple also has tools to establish communication over the Internet, such as iMessage (a tool for transferring messages between devices) and FaceTime (video calls, similar to those that can be done using Skype). </p><p>  In addition to already built-in applications, you can use third-party ones, which means that any social networks (Twitter, Facebook, VKontakte) and instant messengers (Viber, WhatsApp, Telegram) will be transferred to the iPhone with the user. </p><p>  Access to communication using other VoIP services is not prohibited, that is, you can download and start using Skype on an iPhone. </p>

    <h2>  Multimedia </h2><p>  The operating system on which the iPhone runs is fundamentally different from other systems.  The main difference between iOS and other platforms is a closed file system.  Because of this feature, the iPhone has a lot of haters, who were deprived of the ability to freely download any content to the phone.  Apple sells multimedia content: they sell movies and TV shows on the iTunes Store, apps on the AppStore, and music through the Apple Music service.  If you are willing to pay and be satisfied with these services, then there will be no further problems, all three services work fine and abound in content. </p><p>  If you plan to download your own movies and music, then again you will have to face iTunes and the synchronization function.  In order to add media content to your iPhone, you first need to add it to the iTunes library, and then synchronize it with your phone. </p><p>  Immediately, users will face another problem - melodies.  Ringtones for iPhone have long been a cause for ridicule, because while Android users download and cut ringtones directly on their phones without any problems, Apple users must do this on a computer, and then add them to the phone‚Äôs library using the synchronization method (works according to the same principle as adding audio, the main thing is that the track lasts no more than 15 seconds). </p><h2>  Appstore </h2><p>  A feature of the platform from Apple is the app store.  One of the main applications that distinguish the iPhone 5s original is the AppStore.  At first, the AppStore icon on the desktop will be the most frequently clicked, because there you can find all the necessary applications: clients for social networks, replacement for standard applications, services for navigation, tools for increasing productivity. </p><h2>  Set up Apple ID </h2><p>  We should also consider the process of creating an Apple ID with and without an account.  If you are ready to buy applications and pay for various services built into the system, you should indicate your payment details (credit card).  If you are ready to get by with free programs and services, you should skip this step during device activation, and try to download a free application from the AppStore after activation (if you act this way, the "Missing" item will appear in the payment data attachment menu, and you need it who don‚Äôt want to credit their credit card with Apple ID). </p><h2>  Battery Optimization </h2><p>  One of the features of all modern smartphones is the work with GPS.  This function allows you to determine the location of the device, which helps to navigate the terrain, calculate the road to work or find the device in case of loss. </p><p>  The disadvantage is a significant reduction in the operating time of the gadget on a single charge.  Therefore, although the geolocation detection function is necessary for the iPhone 5s, it‚Äôs still worth setting up to optimize its work.  First of all, go to "Settings&gt; Privacy&gt; Location Services", here you can disable all unnecessary programs that require access to GPS, as well as system services, such as: compass calibration, collection of diagnostic data and frequently visited places. </p><p>  Another way to reduce power consumption is to turn off background updates, go to Settings&gt; General&gt; Content Update and turn off unnecessary programs (those that, in your opinion, can do without constant work in the background).  These two simple procedures for optimizing the operation of the iPhone 5s, setting the geolocation and turning off the background services, will significantly extend the life time of your smartphone. </p>

    <h2>  Reset and recovery </h2><p>  In this part of the article, we will talk about how to reset the settings on the iPhone 5s.  Despite the stability and reliability, any technological product has imperfections, not without these in a smartphone from Cupertino. </p><p>  When using, installing updates, and downloading a large number of programs from the AppStore for a long time, often there are problems associated with the gadget's performance, autonomy, or some system functions.  In order to fix them, you can contact service support or try to clean the system manually, but the best method is global cleaning and return to the original settings.  Before returning to the factory settings, iPhone 5s should make a copy of all important data, as well as disable the "Find iPhone".  Next, go to "Settings&gt; General&gt; Reset".  Select the desired item and enter the password.  After a few minutes, all settings will be returned to those that were on the phone by default (upon purchase), the setting will have to be performed again (all the basic data will be saved in the cloud or in your copy on iTunes, after which you can restore everything). </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  As you can see, setting up an iPhone 5s from scratch does not take much time and does not carry any difficulties.  Moreover, this is the only more or less complicated procedure that the owner of this gadget will face.  That's all you need to know about how to set up your iPhone 5s. </p>
