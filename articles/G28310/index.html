    <p>  Under the method refers to the totality of operations and techniques with which you can practically and theoretically study and master reality.  Thanks to the method, a person is armed with a system of rules, principles and requirements, using which he can achieve and achieve his goal.  Possessing one method or another, a person can figure out in what sequence and how to perform certain actions to solve a particular problem. </p><p>  For a long time, a whole field of knowledge has been studying methods, the methodology of scientific research.  In Greek, the concept of "methodology" is translated as "the doctrine of methods."  The foundations of modern methodology were laid back in modern science.  So, in Ancient Egypt, geometry was a form of regulatory requirements, with the help of which the sequence of procedures for measuring land allotments was determined.  The methodology was also studied by such scientists as Plato, Socrates, Aristotle. </p><p>  Pursuing the study of the laws of human <span>cognitive activity, the</span> methodology of scientific research develops on this basis methods for its implementation.  The most important task of the methodology is the study of various <span>characteristics of</span> research <span>methods</span> , such as origin, essence, effectiveness, etc. </p><p>  The research methodology consists of the following levels: </p><p>  1. Concrete scientific methodology - focuses on research methods and techniques. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  2. General scientific methodology - is a doctrine of the methods, principles and forms of knowledge that operate in various sciences.  Here, <span>empirical research methods</span> (experiment, observation) and general logical methods (analysis, induction, synthesis, etc.) are distinguished. </p><p>  3. Philosophical methodology - includes philosophical principles, methods, ideas that can be used for cognition in all sciences.  Speaking of our time, this level is practically not used. </p><p>  The concept of scientific research, based on modern methodology, includes the following: </p><p>  ¬∑ The presence of the object of study; </p><p>  ¬∑ Development of methods, identifying facts, formulating hypotheses, finding out the reasons; </p><p>  ¬∑ A clear separation of hypothesis and established facts; </p><p>  ¬∑ Prediction and explanation of phenomena and facts. </p><p>  The purpose of scientific research is the final result obtained after it.  And if each method is used to achieve certain goals, then the methodology as a whole is designed to solve the following problems: </p><p>  1. The identification and comprehension of moving forces, foundations, premises, patterns of functioning of cognitive activity, scientific knowledge. </p><p>  2. Organization of design activity, its analysis and criticism. </p><p>  In addition, the modern methodology of <span>scientific knowledge</span> pursues such goals as: </p><p>  3. The study of reality and enrichment of methodological tools. </p><p>  4. Finding a connection between a person‚Äôs thinking and his reality. </p><p>  5. Finding communication and interconnection in mental reality and activity, in the practice of cognition. </p><p>  6. The development of a new attitude and understanding of symbolic systems of knowledge. </p><p>  7. Overcoming the universality of concrete scientific thinking and philosophical naturalism. </p><p>  The methodology of scientific research is not just a set of scientific methods, but a real system, the elements of which are in close interaction with each other.  On the other hand, she cannot be attributed a dominant position.  Despite the fact that the methodology includes the depth of imagination, and the flexibility of the mind, and the development of fantasy, as well as strength and intuition, it is only an auxiliary factor in the creative development of a person. </p>
