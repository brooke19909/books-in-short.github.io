    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  Evpatoria is an ancient city located along the <span>Kalamitsky Bay of the</span> Black Sea.  Conventionally, the city is divided into several zones, where there are almost all hotels in Evpatoria on the seashore: </p><ul><li>  Simferopolskaya street is located at the entrance to the city, on one side there is a strip of sandy beaches, on the other, the salt lake Sasyk borders; </li><li>  Tereshkova embankment - the historical part, the so-called Old Town, where the main attractions are concentrated; </li><li>  Gorky embankment leads along the beach line to the center of Yevpatoriya, most of the health resorts and children's sanatoriums are located here; </li><li>  In recent years, many modern hotels have been built around the salt-water healing lake of Moinaki. </li></ul><p>  Depending on the desire to undergo treatment in a sanatorium, to explore local attractions or just relax, it is worth choosing one of the city areas. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Rest in <span>Evpatoria: hotels</span> by the sea </h2><p>  To make your vacation a success, it is better to book hotels in advance, as  in July-August in good hotels, sometimes there are no rooms available.

All sorts of little things often spoil the vacation, and to prevent this from happening, you should pay attention to such points: </p><ol><li>  The location of the hotel.  Having decided in which area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city you want to live, you need to check the address of the hotel on the map. </li><li>  Hotels in Yevpatoriya by the sea can offer additional services such as breakfast, a swimming pool, animator services for children, etc. However, often such a service is paid separately. </li><li>  Check if the rooms have air conditioning, refrigerator, TV, Wi-Fi and other necessary amenities. </li><li>  It does not hurt to make sure that the hotel has its own beach or nearby municipal free. </li><li>  Specify the price.  Room rates vary depending on the season. </li></ol><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotels in Evpatoria by the sea with its own beach" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58159/1983448.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Hotels on Simferopolskaya Street </h2><p>  Simferopolskaya street is the 1st coastline.
