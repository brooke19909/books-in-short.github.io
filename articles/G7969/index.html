    <h2>  Features of the drawings </h2><p>  The drawing method, which is actively used in the modern construction industry, is based on a conventional image of objects and space on a plane using the basics of descriptive geometry.  Its specificity is that the analytical process of considering the design task, as well as the creative machinations of ideas for the future building, the technical part of the project, are necessarily accompanied by graphic drawings, tables, texts, diagrams, sketches.  Each design stage has its own graphic techniques. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Graphic projects </h2><p>  It has certain <span>design stages.</span>  Such a technique is used to create industrial enterprises, architectural objects, indoor planning.  What are the challenges of such a design?  With it, you can get smaller copies of future large buildings without using complex tools and equipment.  Design methods such as graphic sketches are available to all technically competent specialists.  The range of drawings varies from a large microdistrict to the smallest details of structures and buildings.  It was graphics that became the international language in the implementation of projects in various fields of human activity.  If we consider the basic design methods, then it was the drawings that became the main tools for the work of engineers and builders.  They have been successfully implemented in the design practice of industrial organizations. </p><h2>  Model breadboard technique </h2><p>  The model layout, which takes into account all the structural features of the created project, involves serious and long-term work of a whole team of engineers.  Considering the many diverse options, choose the only correct version.  Moreover, the scale of the model is chosen depending on which particular points should be highlighted by the developers.  Modeling helps to solve various problems at the stage of theoretical development of the building, to avoid problems in the process of transferring them to real construction work. </p>

    <h2>  Layout Graphic Method </h2><p>  Practice shows that if it is necessary to solve modern construction problems, an integrated approach is important.  It fully satisfies the creative process of architectural design in the modern construction industry.  Design technology involves a rational combination of graphic and artistic skill with compositional thinking, large-scale modeling.  In addition, the civil engineers apply the volumetric method.  It helps to analyze the specifics of the created drawings, the purpose, as well as carry out the necessary calculations. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sketch method </h2><p>  Such design methods are required when searching for a volumetric layout and image, as well as when performing work on a large scale.  The use of high-quality artistic study of all the nuances of the model, preservation of proportions, guarantees perfect reproduction of the future architectural structure.  The layout-graphic technique, which includes the volumetric method, spatial modeling, is a universal weapon in the architectural <span>design of industrial facilities.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Photo and film projection </h2><p>  These modern technologies have opened up great opportunities for architects to analyze the created model of the building by simulating the existence of people in the space of the proposed construction.  Thanks to design, modern architects create perfect compositions, reduce the likelihood of errors that occur when transferring a ‚Äúpaper project‚Äù to reality.  The laws of mathematics, logic, office equipment, automated machines simplify the procedure for preparing documentation, accelerate the design of office buildings and domestic objects. </p><p>  Design systems and methods involve processing a large amount of information; therefore, it is important to seek additional resources in order to optimize the process and meet the requirements dictated by a rapidly changing society. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  All methods used in modern construction are based on <span>design activities.</span>  They are impossible without the use of modern electronic means and automated equipment.

    <h2>  Design challenge </h2><p>  The desired method is aimed at developing projects based on the optimal summation of aesthetic, social, scientific, technical, natural, construction and other conditions in order to obtain ready-made and correct solutions.  With the help of automation and modeling on electronic machines of the latest generation, it is possible to support the processes of systematization, accumulation, processing of information flow.  Design involves an analytical comparison of ready-made options with the programmed parameters and the choice of the best solution, its technical and graphical fixation, as well as obtaining the necessary amount of project documentation.  Photographic telegraph equipment, movie cameras, holographic devices, storage devices, copy centers, control panels became integral parts when creating projects of buildings and office premises.  All these elements are accelerating tools in the work of any designer. </p><h2>  Features of architectural graphics </h2><p>  It is a direction of fine art, which covers the creative process of images and ideas in the design with architectural design.  A detailed development of a plan for the future structure in a drawing with a certain scale is being carried out.  For this, certain designations of pylons, walls, foundations, columns, marks for the location of doors and windows are used.  The general plan shows the location of the ensemble of structures or a separate building in a specific area with the location of the cardinal points.  The architectural drawing is interconnected with mathematical calculations and indications of the real dimensions of the created building, demonstrates the ratio of its components.  Currently, the division of architectural graphics into digital and classic is supposed.  In classical graphics, objects such as paints, pencils, paper are used as the main tools.  Digital graphics are not possible without the use of modern computing systems. </p>

It consists in choosing the best option for organization in production management, which will increase the efficiency of personnel, increase the volume of products.  Risk in the managerial aspect is defined as the level of uncertainty in predicting the result.  It is always associated with the choice of alternatives and the calculation of the probability of the result for each individual alternative. </p><p>  The design of structures in a production and economic organization is considered as a complex object, including economic, administrative, organizational, informational, economic interactions that lend themselves to direct study and rational design, as well as socio-psychological relationships and characteristics.  They are directly related to the skill level and abilities of employees, leadership style, attitude to their official duties.  The peculiarity of the problem of <span>designing the structure of organizational</span> management is that it should not be adequately presented in the form of the task of formal selection of the ideal version of the organizational structure according to the formulated, mathematically justified optimality criterion.  The problem involves several criteria at once, therefore, to solve it, combine the scientific methods of modern analysis, modeling, evaluation of organizational systems with the functioning of the leader, expert and specialist in the selection and evaluation of ideal options for organizational solutions. </p>

    <p>  Organizational design involves a consistent approach to the model of the optimal management structure, in which design methods have an auxiliary role in assessing, considering, and adopting the most effective ways of organizational decisions into reality.  Management structures are being designed based on methods that complement each other: </p><ul><li>  analogies; </li><li>  structuring; </li><li>  expert analytical approach; </li><li>  organizational modeling. </li></ul><p>  The method of analogy consists in the use of management mechanisms and organizational forms that have paid off in companies with similar organizational parameters, namely goals, sizes, in comparison with the designed organization.  To the methodology of analogies include the development of standard methods for managing production and business organizations.  What are the design challenges?  The analogy method is applied on the basis of two approaches that are mutually complementary.  The first is to identify certain values ‚Äã‚Äãand patterns of change in the main organizations of management mechanisms that will be effective under certain initial conditions.  The second position involves a set of general decisions on the relationship and nature of individual management units and positions, taking into account the activities of the organization, its activities, as well as the creation of special regulatory parameters of the management apparatus for organizations of this type. </p><p>  The expert analytical method involves examination and a detailed study of the company.  For this, qualified specialists are involved, the selection of tools for design depends on their conclusion. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Any human activity is closely related to the use of design technologies.  In addition to the construction industry, design techniques are widely used in educational institutions.  Individual entrepreneurs starting their own production, first carefully study the theoretical foundations of design in order to increase the efficiency of the company, minimize unnecessary costs, and reduce the cost of production.  Any action upon the completion of which a new interesting business can be developed is called design technology.  The Ministry of Education of the Russian Federation has developed second-generation educational standards in which design methods are a prerequisite for the formation of a harmoniously developed personality. </p>
