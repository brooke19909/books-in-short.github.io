    <h2>  Neoline Company </h2><p>  In 2006, a little-known company began production of electronics designed for cars and focused exclusively on the Russian market.  Navigators became the most successful direction, and just 3 years after the start of production, the company released its first car DVR, which is gaining popularity with incredible speed, which brings a lot of money to the creators.  The devices were tested by many people on various expeditions.  As a result, the company has won the trust of customers and has become a true professional in the manufacture of automotive devices. </p><p>  Today, one of the best production models is the Neoline X-COP 9000 DVR. Both ordinary customers and experienced drivers who really know a lot about such devices left reviews about it.  Advantages and disadvantages, according to these people, are provided at the end of the article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="neoline x cop 9000 specifications reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42731/1437588.jpg" width="563"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Priorities </h2><p>  A team of professional workers are putting all their efforts into creating high-tech equipment that can satisfy all the needs of Russian motorists.  World modern technology has become the basis for new models.  The constant task of the company is to take a step forward, following modern standards and translate all creative ideas into reality. </p><h2>  Development </h2><p>  The modern consumer electronics market is developing quite rapidly.  Neoline's production provides customers with a huge assortment of electronics, which has already become an unrivaled classic.  This number includes: </p><ul><li>  parking systems; </li><li>  universal devices for charging; </li><li>  rear view cameras; </li><li>  DVRs </li><li>  radar detectors. </li></ul><p>  Creative ideas are received and implemented daily, and the most unusual of them was the option of accommodating several functions necessary for the driver in a single device.  The authors realized their own idea and created a car video recorder Neoline X-COP 9000. Owner reviews about it can not be negative, because a video recorder with a radar detector is not only a convenient device, but also quite affordable. </p><h2>  Warranty </h2><p>  As with any device, Neoline provides a guarantee through which the owner of the DVR, in case of problems, will be able to return it to a service center where they will fix any malfunctions. </p><p>  In addition, reliable assistance can be obtained from the support service.  Its representatives will help the user deal with personal settings and answer all questions.  The company takes care of its own customers, because it was not for nothing that they chose this production. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Neoline X-COP 9000 radar detector (reviews and photos can be found below), fortunately, breaks extremely rarely, so its owners do not have to worry about the safety of a new purchase.  And having examined this device in more detail, everyone will find out about its capabilities and make sure that it really is a leader in the list of modern DVRs and radar detectors. </p><h2>  Appearance of the device </h2><p>  This is not to say that the size of the gadget is small.  Although it is worth noting that this is only the first impression, which is often misleading.  In fact, this hybrid is the most compact of all modern models.  Visual deception is obtained due to the elongated shape of the body.  Therefore, the driver sees only the rear panel, buttons and screen when the device is mounted on the windshield. </p><p>  On the left side is a special connector designed to connect a power adapter.  In addition to it, there is a button that performs a forced reboot, and a small hole in the microphone built into the device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="car dvr neoline x cop 9000 reviews" class="if" height="348" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42731/1437586.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  On the opposite side there is a power button and a pair of slots designed for memory cards, which also indicates the possibility of recording information in large volumes.  You can also quickly move or copy a recording from one medium to another.  The benefits of this unusual addition are not appreciated by every owner, but you can truly understand the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe creators during an accident.  Indeed, in such situations, one drive is given to the inspector, and the second remains with the driver.  This will greatly alleviate the problem if it comes to court and some evidence is needed of who is injured and guilty of the accident. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The Neoline X-COP 9000 dashcam cannot have negative reviews on this subject, since the process of transferring recordings from one card to another is carried out at an incredible speed, which is also what the well-thought out file system also shows itself from the best side. </p><p>  About branded mount is also worth knowing some information that is important for many drivers when choosing such a device.  The unique Smart Click system is able to firmly hold the DVR on the windshield, despite its small size.  The suction cup adheres firmly to the surface, sticking the first time.  Even with strong shaking, it will not come off and the device will remain intact.  And when leaving the car, taking the DVR with you will be quite easy - just a couple of simple movements and all the necessary information in the hands of the owner, protected from the hands of scammers, are enough. </p><h2>  Display and interface </h2><p>  Often, before buying, users are interested in professionals, what they would leave feedback.  Neoline X-COP 9000 customer reviews and experts on similar devices has good.  Thanks to the opinions of other people, car enthusiasts can choose the perfect model for themselves that will last them a long time.  An important criterion when choosing is the display.  The X-COP 9000 has a diagonal of two inches - this is quite enough for use. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="neoline x cop 9000 reviews" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42731/1437585.jpg" width="562"></div>

    <p>  In addition, do not forget that this model is built on the basis of the IPS matrix.  This fact indicates the presence of wide viewing angles and the absence of glare in sunny weather.  The screen is controlled by buttons, and the Easy Touch interface makes the task easier.  Only 4 buttons are provided to the user to control the device.  Their peculiarity lies in the fact that it is practically impossible to accidentally click on them, but a 100% hit on the button, if necessary, is guaranteed even while the car is moving. </p><p>  Going to the menu, the owner will see 4 points: </p><ol><li>  Video setup. </li><li>  Firmware update. </li><li>  Watch the video. </li><li>  Detection Settings. </li></ol><p>  In a separate menu there are all the necessary functions: </p><ul><li>  adding a GPS point to the drive or to the memory of the DVR; </li><li>  stop video recording; </li><li>  turning on and off the microphone; </li><li>  sound notification management; </li><li>  change of operation mode. </li></ul><p>  High-quality interface and eye-friendly fonts cannot but please buyers.  In these trifles, reliable, high-quality and thorough work of masters is manifested. </p><h2>  Radar detector </h2><p>  Police radars are perhaps the most common driver problem on the road.  Therefore, the addition of a radar detector to recognize all types of police radars will be an excellent function of the video recorder.  This is what the developers did, introducing customers to the perfect device.  Neoline X-COP 9000 is capable of recognizing not only radars, but also low-power speed-fixing devices.  In addition, a GPS module is built into the DVR, notifying the driver even of complexes that do not emit any signals.  Despite modern technological progress, a device with such capabilities is still not so easy to find.  The hybrid quickly compares the received data with the database and notifies the owner of the approach to the speed control area. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reviews neoline x cop 9000" class="if" height="436" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42731/1437587.jpg" width="600"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

      <p></p>
    <p>  The detector has four operating modes: </p><ol><li>  "Town".  In this mode, the device switches to a lower sensitivity and cuts off all false positives. </li><li>  "Track".  Sensitivity, on the contrary, increases. </li><li>  "Turbo".  Thanks to him, you can receive a warning about approaching the radar at high speed. </li><li>  "Intellectual".  The hybrid independently changes the sensitivity, given the speed of the car. </li></ol><h2>  Video recording </h2><p>  The photofixing function is quite a rarity in modern DVRs.  Some do not cope well with her, while others do not have it at all.  But this model does not fit any of these criteria.  Neoline X-COP 9000 copes with the function of photographic fixation - it is capable of recording videos in a fairly high resolution (1920x1080) and at a speed of about 30 frames in one second.  The settings menu provides for the adjustment of brightness, contrast, sharpness and activation of the dynamic range expansion algorithm, which is a really necessary opportunity. </p><p>  As a result, the driver can see a high quality image.  When viewing the recorded video, all the smallest details will be noticeable: for example, it will be possible to clearly see the car numbers of a car moving nearby, all road signs falling into the field of view of the DVR, as well as the faces of people passing by. </p><p>  During night shooting, the final image will be no worse.  Here, too, vehicle numbers, roadsides and the nearest lighting sources will be clearly visible.  The only minus is the not too loud noise that is constantly observed when shooting video at night.  Although people usually don‚Äôt need sound recording, the main goal is to capture certain objects.  At a distance of about 20-25 meters, all the necessary little things will be visible, and the light coming from lamps, windows or traffic lights will not interfere with shooting. </p><p>  In addition to all of the above advantages and features, it is also necessary to note one more interesting function.  The fact is that the DVR can also perform the alarm operation.  That is, if you leave the device in the car at night and turn on the corresponding mode, then the motion sensor will work instantly, and the hybrid will start recording.  This is not only a fairly reliable protection against theft, but also a temptation for attackers.  After all, with knowledge of such information, the owner of the car and the DVR can detect broken glass and the absence of a radar detector in the morning.  Therefore, before leaving the device overnight in the car, you should find a place for it where it will not be noticeable from the outside, but you can still shoot.  In this case, protection is guaranteed and you can sleep peacefully, without thinking about losses. </p><p>  And another small advantage is the battery built into the case.  Thanks to him, the DVR will be able to shoot while not only within the car, but also at a certain distance from it.  For example, in an accident, in addition to the collision of the car itself, you can record a conversation with the inspector, which in the future may come in handy. </p><h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  In general, Neoline X-COP 9000 after the acquisition and the first days of use leaves only a positive impression.  Buyers are often surprised even by the characteristics of the Neoline X-COP 9000 itself. Owner reviews about them simply cannot be negative. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="neoline x cop 9000 reviews and photos" class="if" height="448" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42731/1437583.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Of course, people highlight some of the disadvantages, but they are in the details - for most, it simply does not matter.  For example, drivers do not like the size of the device, but, as mentioned above, this is only the <span>first misleading impression,</span> and a person draws hasty conclusions in vain.  Others are not quite happy with the price, because it is really higher than other models.  But you should not forget that several devices can fit in one device at once.  If you purchase them separately, much more money will be spent. </p><p>  Otherwise, users are happy with everything.  Nice appearance, convenient mounting method, radar detection - all this makes the Neoline X-COP 9000 a universal device.  Some drivers even claim that having bought it, all their wishes came true instantly and now they have absolutely no need for any other car accessories. </p><h2>  Opinions of professionals </h2><p>  Undoubtedly, manufacturers of Neoline X-COP 9000 user reviews never hide from the rest.  And their number includes the opinions of not only ordinary buyers, but also those people who have already tried many similar devices and are well versed in them.  It is their advice that helps beginners to choose the best model for themselves. </p><p>  About Neoline X-COP 9000 professionals speak out positively.  First of all, they note the combination of the two most important functions (DVR and radar detector).  The ideal screen size is also noted, where a person can easily examine all the inscriptions and select the desired item.  After analyzing the day and night shooting, experienced users came to the conclusion that this device has the best recording quality of both image and sound. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="neoline x cop 9000 owner reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42731/1437582.jpg" width="453"></div>
