    <p>  Speaking about the attractions of Yelets, one can distinguish a huge number of residential estates of the 1st half of the 19th century, as well as memorial museums - Tikhon Khrennikov, Ivan Bunin, as well as Nikolai Zhukov.  Of particular interest will be the history of the museum of local lore.  Initially, it was a museum of visual aids at the school, created thanks to Mikhail Prishvin in 1918.  After some time he was plundered by the Mammoth workers, only after that he became a specialist in local history.  Many unique exhibits are stored here, for example, paintings by Vereshchagin and Aivazovsky, personal belongings of Bunin. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Considering the rest of the <span>attractions of Yelets,</span> you can highlight the Orthodox Cathedral.

    <p>  Russia is rich in many historical sights.  The city of Yelets was no exception.  For example, the Governor‚Äôs House was built in the old Russian style with embossed platbands and rusticated pilasters.  And, of course, having been here, one cannot help but go to <span>Red Square.</span>  Historians argue about the origin of this name.  In ancient times, a red place (or square, angle) was called something very honorable and beautiful.  Although there is an opinion that it was called that because of the amount of blood spilled on it - the city too often had to fight. </p><p>  To our days, various attractions of Yelets have been preserved, among which many examples of architecture of the VIII-XIX centuries.  - merchant houses, temples, buildings of commercial and public institutions.
