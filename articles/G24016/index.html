Some come here to work or study, others for treatment, and others for sightseeing.  And of course, many visitors primarily try to find affordable and decent housing in the capital. </p><p>  You can stay in Moscow at a hotel or choose a cheaper option - a hostel.  There are simply a huge number of such mini-hotels in the capital.  For example, the Vinaigrette Hostel can be a very good option for travelers.  In Moscow, many tourists choose it for living. </p><h2>  What is the difference between a hostel and a hotel? </h2><p>  People usually rent a bed in such mini-hotels in a foreign city in order to save money.  Hostels differ from hotels primarily in lower prices for accommodation.  Even in hotels of this type located in the center of the metropolis, they usually don‚Äôt charge too much from guests.  Therefore, such mini-hotels, among other things, are just a great option for tourists who come to see the sights. </p><div class="photo" data-original="moscow.zagranitsa.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="One Bed Room" class="if uuid-2953086" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11465/2953086.jpg"></div><p>  The price of accommodation in hostels is less than in hotels.  But they are also inferior in terms of the convenience of living to real hotels.  In this regard, the hostel differs from the hotel in the first place in that much more people occupy the rooms here.  In ordinary hotels, rooms are designed for a maximum of 2-4 people.  In hostels, guests in one room can be accommodated up to 6-8, and in very cheap ones - up to 12-20 or more.  In most cases, rooms in these mini-hotels have bunk beds. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Hostels provide almost the same amenities as inexpensive hotels to their guests.  Such establishments usually do not have their own restaurant or even just a dining room.  However, guests have the opportunity to cook their own meals on their own specially equipped kitchens.  The bathroom, smoking room and shower in hotels of this type are usually large and designed for all guests living on the floor.  Many hostels provide their residents with additional services such as free WiFi, discounts for stays longer than a week, two or a month (you should definitely ask), free parking, etc. </p><h2>  Number of rooms and price for accommodation </h2><p>  In Moscow, unfortunately, there are many very cheap hostels with uncomfortable shaking beds, old inoperative appliances, and even bedbugs and cockroaches.  Living in such institutions can cost from 4.5 thousand rubles.  per month.  Live in cheap hostels and dormitories are usually workers who have arrived in the capital to work. </p><p>  Mini-hotel "Vinaigrette" is designed for a slightly different category of visitors, namely - for tourists.  The price for accommodation here is for 2018: </p><ul><li>  in a dormitory for 8 people - 560 rubles .; </li><li>  for 6 people with full payment of the reservation - 626 rubles., with payment on arrival - 712 rubles .; </li><li>  for 4 people - 658/749 rubles .; </li><li>  for 2 people on a bunk bed - 987/1124 rub. </li></ul><p>  This hostel also has ordinary hotel rooms with 1 double bed and shared bathroom.  Living in such rooms costs about 2500 rubles.  per day. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="vinegret-hostel-moscow.nochi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hostel Beds" class="if uuid-2953080" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11465/2953080.jpg"></div><h2>  Where is the hostel </h2><p>  For tourists who come to Moscow for sightseeing, this hostel can be an excellent option.  Too much can afford the payment for a bed 550-700 rubles.  in a few days will not hit.  This mini-hotel can also be a good option for applicants entering the capital‚Äôs universities or even business travelers. </p><p>  Where is Vinegret hostel located in the capital?  The address of this mini-hotel is as follows: st.  Arbat, house No. 4, p. 1. That is, this institution is located directly on the most popular historical pedestrian boulevard of Russia in the very center of Moscow. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mskhotels.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Entrance to the Vinaigrette Hostel" class="if uuid-2953081" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11465/2953081.jpg"></div><p>  The easiest way to get to this hostel is by metro.  You should go to Art.  Arbatskaya metro station.  The house in which the hotel is located is at the very beginning of the boulevard.  So, going to the place of visitors who rented rooms here will take no more than 5 minutes from the metro.  The only thing that tourists who have already stayed at this hotel are advising travelers who have booked a bed here to be more attentive.  The door to the hostel overlooks Arbat, but is practically not marked.  The entrance to the hotel looks inconspicuous against the background of cafes and shops, and it is very easy to miss it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Attractions nearby </h2><p>  The advantages of this hostel, therefore, include the proximity to the main attractions of the Russian capital: </p><ul><li>  Kremlin and Red Square. </li><li>  Arbat. </li><li>  Alexander Garden. </li></ul><p>  From the Arbatskaya metro station, it will not be a problem to get to any other sights of the capital. </p><p>  Choosing this hostel for living in Moscow will be convenient for people traveling by train or by plane.  To the Belarusian station from the station.  "Arbat" go only 4 stops.  Then, if necessary, you can transfer to the aeroexpress train and get to Sheremetyevo. </p><p>  Travelers who choose the Vinaigrette hostel (Moscow) for a walk can simply walk down the room onto the street.  The road to Red Square on foot will take the hotel guests no more than 20 minutes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.foursquare.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Room view" class="if uuid-2953088" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11465/2953088.jpg"></div><h2>  Hostel "Vinaigrette": description of rooms </h2><p>  The rooms of this mini-hotel provide guests with a standard set of amenities.  That is, there are: </p><ul><li>  air conditioners; </li><li>  heating; </li><li>  TV sets </li><li>  personal safes; </li><li>  tables with ottoman and mirror; </li><li>  bedside tables. </li></ul><p>  Thanks to the availability of safes, tourists can not worry about the safety of their belongings.  The beds in the rooms are mostly bunk metal.  Curtains provide an individual space for each guest. </p><div class="photo" data-original="otzovik.com" data-author=": Amaryllis, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Staircase at the entrance" class="if uuid-2953089" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11465/2953089.jpg"></div><p>  Even in cheap hostels in Moscow, a renovation is usually done.  Of course, rooms in a mini-hotel of the middle price category Vinaigrette also look quite attractive.  The rooms in most hostels of the capital, even very inexpensive, are divided into female and male.  In Vinaigrette, they, unfortunately, are designed to live together guests of both sexes.  This is not very convenient, but apparently the separation in this hotel is not provided because travelers usually stay here not for too long. </p><h2>  Kitchen </h2><p>  Showers and bathrooms in the hotel are shared and are located on the floor.  The same goes for the kitchen.  Unfortunately, guests who have chosen the Vinegret hostel (Moscow), as in many other mini-hotels in the capital, cannot use the electric stove.  However, the kitchen in this hotel still has a microwave, as well as a dishwasher. </p><p>  The hostel guests can eat while sitting at comfortable tables.  A widescreen TV is available in the hotel kitchen.  The showers provide everything you need for guests and even pleasant music plays.  Hot water is always at this hostel and there are usually no lines from those who want to take water procedures here.  Of course, it is provided for tourists who choose the Vinaigrette hostel and free Wi-Fi directly on its territory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vinegret-hostel-moscow.nochi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="TV in the dining room" class="if uuid-2953083" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11465/2953083.jpg"></div><h2>  Other amenities </h2><p>  In addition to the lack of stoves for cooking, a rather large drawback of Vinaigrette is that it has no parking.  However, this is most likely determined by the position of the hotel itself.  The streets in the Arbat area are quite narrow and it is often simply impossible to equip a parking lot here. </p><p>  Among the other advantages, this hostel can be considered the fact that its guests have the opportunity to rent laundry for only 100 rubles.  Things decided to take advantage of this service to the residents will subsequently be brought already ironed. </p><h2>  Population </h2><p>  Tourists arriving at the Vinaigrette Hostel in Moscow on Arbat need to ring the door that opens onto the boulevard, after which it will immediately open.  Reception at this hotel is open around the clock.  The Vinaigrette Hotel is located in the house number 4 on the 2nd and 3rd floors.  Therefore, tourists who have booked rooms here will first need to climb up the usual staircase. </p><p>  Checkout time in this hostel, as in most hotels in the capital, is 14.00.  However, as many guests staying at this mini-hotel note, tourists who arrived earlier have the opportunity to leave their things here for free until two in the afternoon or use the kitchen and toilet. </p><p>  Upon check-in, guests fill out standard profiles and leave a deposit for the electronic key to the room in cash.  Actually the accommodation in Vinaigrette is allowed to be paid, including with a card. </p><p>  Check-in time at the Vinaigrette Hostel on Arbat is thus 14 hours.  His guests must evict at the end of their stay at 12.00. </p><h2>  Contingent and employees </h2><p>  The majority of Russian citizens who live in the Vinaigrette hostel on Arbat in Moscow are those who come to the capital for sightseeing or who transit through it.  But quite often foreign tourists check into this hotel.  Therefore, many employees of Vinaigrette are able to speak English. </p><p>  This hostel, as in most others, can only be accommodated by adult guests.  Unfortunately, children under 14 cannot be accommodated in Vinaigrette, even with their parents. </p><p>  Among the shortcomings of this hostel, among other things, it can also be attributed to the fact that its administration reserves the right to relocate guests from the room that was booked to another at its discretion without giving any reason. </p><h2>  Opinion of the guests of the capital about the hotel </h2><p>  The Vinegret hostel in Moscow from the travelers earned reviews mostly very good.  Of course, the main advantage of this hotel guests consider its unique location.  The opportunity to live in Moscow for at least a few days right on the Arbat, and even for only 600-700 rubles.  per day, for many citizens of Russia can be a very tempting offer. </p><p>  Also, its guests include rather comfortable and cozy interiors to the advantages of this hotel.  Beds at Vinaigrette Hostel are equipped with metal stairs.  So the tenants, of course, do not have to pull up from the nightstand.  In addition, convenient handles are provided on the ‚Äúsecond floor‚Äù to facilitate lifting. </p><p>  The advantages of this hostel, many guests include the presence, in addition to lighting and shelves, sockets near each bed.  It is therefore not necessary to take an extension cord with you to tourists who have booked a place here. </p><p>  The beds in this hotel themselves are not wooden, but there are no negative reviews on the Web regarding their convenience.  Moreover, the mattresses in this mini-hotel are orthopedic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hotel-inn.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bathroom in Vinaigrette" class="if uuid-2953079" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11465/2953079.jpg"></div><p>  A very big plus of the Vinaigrette Hotel, many tourists also consider that the maids here are cleaned not only in the corridors and common areas, but also in the rooms, and daily.  The linen in this hotel, as noted by its guests, is quite clean.  There is, of course, no unpleasant insects in this not too cheap hostel.  The guests also have no complaints about the cleanliness of the showers and bathrooms equipped in Vinaigrette. </p><h2>  Cons of the hotel </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews, Vinegret service hostel offers its guests a very good one.  Perhaps the only drawback of this mini-hotel guests of the capital consider the lack of stove in the kitchen.  There are certainly many cafes and restaurants in the Arbat area.  However, the food in these establishments is, unfortunately, very expensive. </p>
