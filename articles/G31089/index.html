The study involved more than 20 <span>popular smartphones</span> that run on the operating systems Android, iOS, Windows.  It should be noted that the best test was the phone ‚ÄúLumiya 640‚Äù from Microsoft.  During the experiment, the reception quality was evaluated in two versions: when the device lies on the surface or in the hand, when it is brought to the ear. </p><p>  According to the results of the study, it was revealed which phones have the <span>best</span> signal <span>reception</span> .  The first three places were devices from Microsoft, Sony and Samsung.  It should be noted that the top ten includes devices with plastic and glass cases. </p><p>  According to the results of the second test, other applicants were identified in the TOP-5.  In principle, all devices correspond to their positions, as in the first list, however, HTC and Doro are among the leaders. </p><p>  Some university professors point out that many smartphones that have a metal case need a signal many times more than any other device made of plastic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="best reception phone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2175301.jpg"></div>
