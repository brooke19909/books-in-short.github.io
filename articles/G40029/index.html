This year became the main one for future events, laid the foundation for the final expulsion of the Poles.  Currently, it is believed that in honor of this event, the festival of national unity is celebrated in November.  The history of 1612 cannot be considered without an analysis of previous events.  This is logical, since in many respects this time is the final period of a certain stage in the development of the state.  Like all key years in history, the 1612th was far from easy. </p><h2>  1612: how it all began </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the times of Troubles were marked in many textbooks by 1605-1612, the seeds of the problem were sown immediately after the death of Ivan the Terrible, the last representative of the Rurikovich dynasty. </p>

    <p>  After the death of a strong leader, who did not leave an equally strong successor, the country began to suffer under the yoke of civil strife in the circle of boyars and the frequent raids of numerous neighbors.  Ivan the Terrible had heirs, but they died, so the power passed to Godunov.  This was a difficult time, because at the turn of the 16th and 17th centuries a famine broke out, which was accompanied by a riot of gangs and high mortality among the common population.  In combination with the constant Lithuanian and Polish invasions, this makes the time of Troubles a really dark time in the history of Russia.  Against this background, the circle of boyars overthrew Godunov from the throne, announcing that he had seized power illegally, and that his rule was contrary to the will of God.  After that, the alleged descended and surviving descendants of Grozny, the False Dmitry, appeared twice, but they did not reign for long.  In the wake of an unstable political situation, Russia has become easy prey for foreign invaders.  Poland did not miss the opportunity to seize power in a weakened country without a ruler. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Liberation Spirit </h2><p>  A few years before the events of 1612 unfolded, liberation uprisings against foreigners began.

    <p>  This combined army was defeated largely due to the betrayal of German mercenaries and their transition to the side of the enemy.  This opened the way to Moscow. </p><h2>  Heroes from the people - Minin and Pozharsky </h2><p>  Minin was elected to the role of senior in organizing the militia of Nizhny Novgorod.  He raised a large sum for the needs of the army - each farm was obliged to contribute about 20% of its value.  Pozharsky became a military leader.  He was not associated with foreign interventionists, so people rallied around him.  Perhaps this decided what 1612 will remain in history.  Leaders sent letters urging them to join the uprising.  The people responded to the call.  People from all over the country began to come to Yaroslavl to prepare for the campaign.  The militia stood there until the end of summer.  Pozharsky was engaged in military affairs, and Minin took over economic management.  The army marched on Moscow in the second half of August. </p><h2>  Siege of Moscow </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the siege of the militias began in August, it ended only in October according to the old style.  So, the Poles settled in the city.  For them, the year 1612 was far from the best - the provisions were ending, and the arrival of the carts was a long wait.  The day after the approach of the rebels, the long-awaited convoy arrived.  Contrary to expectations, the militias won in this battle.  They owe much of their victory to Minin, who acted as a brave warrior and competent strategist.  The remnants of the broken convoy retreated, and the Russians received at their disposal the provisions so needed by the starving Poles and the boyars outside the Kremlin walls. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The complete lack of food caused not only high mortality, but also numerous cases of cannibalism in the garrison. </p><h2>  The assault on Moscow </h2><p>  The assault on the weakened garrison began on October 22, and the Poles were knocked out of Kitai Gorod.  The Russians entered the Kremlin on October 24th.  It was November 1612, namely, the 4th number in the new style.  This date is today celebrated as a holiday of national unity in Russia. </p><h2>  Zemsky Cathedral </h2><p>  The year 1612 laid the foundation for further events.  After the siege, Minin and Pozharsky convened the <span>Zemsky Sobor,</span> whose goal was to choose a new king.  According to the decision made, in addition to the clergy, people from different classes from different cities will participate in the Council.  The decision to choose a king was to be taken unanimously, and the date of the election itself was determined on February 21, 1613.  According to the results of the Council, <span>Mikhail Romanov</span> became the king <span>,</span> who praised the merits of Pozharsky and Minin.  So, the first was granted the boyar title, and the second was elevated to the rank of Duma boyars. </p>

    <p>  Minin at the new post collected taxes until his death, and Pozharsky continued to lead troops in liberation campaigns against the Poles.  The year 1612 became crucial for them and for the whole state.  Thus ended the Time of Troubles, which brought a lot of suffering to the Russian land. </p>
