Features, accurate description, price</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The coin of 20 kopecks in 1989 is one of the last monetary units that were minted on the territory of the Soviet Union.  However, its cost is not as high as the sellers of old money would like.  We will understand today the features, varieties and, of course, determine the approximate price for these coins. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ay.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="coin 20 kopecks 1989" class="if uuid-3168982" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3168982.jpg"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  20 kopecks 1989 refers to coins that are called "money in wide circulation."  The coinage was made by two mints (Leningrad and Moscow).  The exact number of copies made is unknown.  Material is the nickel silver chassis of the time.  It is an alloy composed of nickel, copper and zinc.  The coin weighs no more than 3.3-3.4 g (in different sources different data and photo weights). </p><p>  The color of the coin of 20 kopecks 1989 resembles "gray hair", it is a light gray color with a patina.  Sometimes patina reflections give greens, sometimes coins are just "gray".  Money does not possess any magnetic characteristics. </p><h2>  Reverse </h2><p>  The upper part of the disc coin is given under the numbers, show the face value of the coin.  Under "20" is the inscription "cents", even lower is the year of coinage.  To the right and left of the main images are beautiful thin wheat branches.  They originate from two oak leaves.  Several spines emerge from each spikelet; they begin at the top of the second oak leaf. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Obverse </h2><p>  The central part of the composition of the coin of 20 kopecks 1989 is, of course, the emblem of the Soviet Union.  The main image is planet Earth, against which a sickle and a hammer flaunt.  A little lower, warming the planet, is half the sun.  Long and thin rays come out of it, which practically go to the image of the globe. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.raritetus.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Coin 20 kopecks 1989 photo" class="if uuid-3168984" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3168984.jpg"></div><p>  On both sides are bunches of ears of wheat collected using a wide ribbon.  A total of seven turns on each side.  In the center of the composition, the ribbon is collected in a small bow.  In total, fifteen ribbon bandages are obtained, each of which symbolizes a union republic. </p><p>  If you look closely at the left side of the coin of 20 kopecks 1989 from the obverse side, you will notice an additional spine that passes between the third and second spikelets.  In the upper part of the coin disk, at the place of convergence of the ears of wheat, there is a five-pointed star.  The rays have a sharp shape, the star itself is not cut. </p><p>  The lower half of the disk is reserved for the abbreviation of the state.  The letters "USSR" are printed almost from left to right.  The letter "C" on some coins will be slightly omitted and closer to the edge on the left. </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  In total, there are two varieties of coins of 20 kopecks in 1989.  The first is the so-called junction of three cents.  In the manufacture of these coins, a stamp from the 1981 cents coin was used.  Such a monetary unit is very rare.  It was made exclusively for sets of the State Bank of the Soviet Union. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Features: </p><ol><li>  The spikelet, which is located on the left, has three awns. </li><li>  A small spine separating the third and second spikelets is absent. </li><li>  If you look closely at the image of planet Earth, you can see a well-traced Gulf of Guinea in Africa.  In addition, the image of the union coat of arms is slightly down. </li></ol><p>  The second "junction" (Fedorin 167) is even less common.  She was also minted for the annual set of the Mint.  It was made from an alloy of zinc and copper.  The color is golden.  Weighs 2.9 g.  Extreme rarity and great luck for numismatists. </p><div class="photo" data-original="auction.violity.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="20 kopecks 1989" class="if uuid-3168983" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3168983.jpg"></div><h2>  Marriage </h2><p>  At auctions and in catalogs, coins of 20 kopecks 1989 with marriage were often found.  These were chips, bites, stamp splits, iris, mirror field and others. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  Coins that belong to the standard of coinage are valued at amounts from one ruble to 75 rubles.  If there is a coin with an incuse marriage, then it can be sold for 900 rubles. </p><p>  The most expensive will be coins that belong to the "junction".  A standard alloy (option one) will cost from 955 rubles to 75,000 rubles.  But for a non-standard golden-yellow coin, made according to the stamp of three kopecks in 1981, it will be possible to gain from 6 thousand to 160 thousand rubles. </p>
