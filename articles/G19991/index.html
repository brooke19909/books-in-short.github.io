    <h2>  Puppet workshop </h2><p>  In the doll workshop of the village of Upper Mandrogs, there is an opportunity not only to find out what herbal toys are, but also to try to make them yourself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Vepsian belongs to the oldest doll, which the Podporozhsky district boasts.  It is deducted from a woman whose image is cheerful and bright, of a mother-woman.  This is the first of the dolls to have a clearly defined chest line.  <span>The Vepsian doll</span> belongs to the pagan cult of the mother and is performed using the ‚Äúno sewing‚Äù method.  One of its varieties is the "wench girl."  This is a ritual doll, which in old times was always given to newlyweds. </p><p>  Herbalist - another of her hypostasis.  In the doll‚Äôs clothes, as well as in her hair, the needlewoman laid various fragrant herbs - mint, thyme, oregano, and then laid them at the patient‚Äôs bedside. </p><p>  A lot of toys were made before church and other holidays: on Palm Day - a girl-in-law, to Filippov's post - filipovka.  The craftswomen did not forget about decorating the houses with dolls, symbolizing the housewives: with brooms and grips, buckets and cast-iron. </p><h2>  Icon painting </h2><p>  He lives in the village of Upper Mandrogs as an icon painter: draws paintings on a tree dedicated to religious subjects.  The basis of creativity lies in Christian subjects.  If the master draws an icon, then afterwards he must draw it into salary. </p><h2>  Kozulnitsa </h2><p>  What an interesting word!  Think something about goats?  Only partly ... Holidays in Mandrogs provide an opportunity to enjoy the magnificent gingerbread (roe), which is prepared by the craftswoman.  They owe their name to the ancient stucco figures from rye dough, which the housewives performed in the form of pets.  Then the figures participated in the ritual actions that took place during the holidays of agriculture.  The rites were designed to increase productivity, encourage rains and favorable weather. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Today, the <span>Arkhangelsk roe</span> is traditionally baked for the New Year and Christmas, so that later with good wishes to be presented to relatives and friends.

    <h2>  Forge </h2><p>  In the forge, in the midst of heat and metal, the blacksmith reigns.  Getting to visit him, everyone can buy something for himself.  It can be either a small souvenir or a magnificent knife, whose handle is crowned with a mammoth tusk.  The blacksmith forges all his work equally well and with soul.  Each of the visitors can learn the basics of blacksmithing.  Men note that the lessons made the most positive impression on them. </p><h2>  Seamstress </h2><p>  Pavloposadsky shawls, which form the basis of things manufactured by a seamstress, are the pride of Mother Russia.  The things that come from them are easily recognizable by a variety of motives and colors.  Every year they are more deeply rooted in the women's wardrobe.  Clothing made from natural material is practical, warm and unique. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Sewing from flax </h2><p>  The tourist village never ceases to amaze!  A seamstress is adjacent to a seamstress who makes linen, table and bed linen.  The experiments carried out by scientists proved that each of the natural materials has its own energy, and flax has the strongest.  Such things are able to give their owner calmness and poise, concentration and regularity. </p><p>  This material is able to partially neutralize electromagnetic radiation, which is exposed to people who spend a lot of time at the computer.  And for them, the best solution would be to buy a linen shirt or trousers. </p><h2>  Birch bark grass </h2><p>  Holidays in Russia can be active!  And proof of this is a birch bark man who lives in the village with his wife.  Under his sensitive and attentive guidance, each of the guests is given the opportunity to apply the old Russian craft.  Tourists weave various objects from birch bark, the creation of which takes from 1 hour to 2 days.  Among the master‚Äôs works, you can see real birch bast shoes, wicker salt shakers, children's toys, sharkunks (a baby rattle woven from birch bark and filled with peas or apple seeds) or feet (similar in shape to summer slippers, they can be used in dachas and in villages )  The birchman carries out his work without thread and glue, and many are wondering: why are the products very durable?  The answer to this is skill. </p><p>  The wife of a birch bark painter draws on clay, birch bark or wood.  The traditional northern painting gives her works a unique author's charm, as many have noted. </p>

    <h2>  Potter </h2><p>  The village of Upper Mandrogs boasts a craftsman in ceramics.  A lot of people who want to learn how to work with clay come to the potter‚Äôs master classes.  And the age range is really huge: from a year and a half to 80. Visitors to the village spoke warmly about the time spent in the workshop. </p><p>  The main thing a beginner should get used to is clay, its structure, understanding how to work with this material.  In the first lesson, the master tells and helps his students to correctly form the blank so as not to break the conceived form.  In his demonstration classes, the potter demonstrates his craft by teaching visitors to the village.  The master performs one half of the work, and the student will finish it. </p><p>  The master mainly sculpts his work from white clay.  Some products must be dried for a month, so that later they become refractory and durable. </p><h2>  Jeweler </h2><p>  Engaged in the manufacture of pendants, bracelets, earrings and rings.  The jeweler first performs more complex models from wax, and then embodies it in metal.  If the product is simple, then it is immediately made of metal. </p><p>  Jewelry work is a multi-step process that requires a huge amount of time.  But not every job is easy - some products must be performed in several stages, so that after you connect the disparate parts into a single whole. </p><h2>  Guilloche </h2><p>  The recreation center ‚ÄúUpper Mandrogs‚Äù offers its guests such interesting contemporary art as guilloche, or burning on fabric. </p><p>  This type of fabric art appeared less than 40 years ago in Russia, when in 1980 the architect Zina Kotenkova, being late, burned a hole in her favorite blouse with an iron. </p><p>  Guilloche is the welding and cutting of artificial fabrics (crepe satin, gabardine, brocade, <span>rayon) of</span> various ornamental details.  Work is carried out using a thin hot needle, which is inserted into the device for <span>burning wood.</span> </p><p>  Today, the master has a patented manufacturing technology on wooden volumetric blanks of works in the guilloche technique.  Caskets and dolls, Easter eggs and cutlery - all this is decorated with semiprecious natural stones or Swarovski crystals.  Many of the master‚Äôs works are in collections in Russian homes and abroad. </p><h2>  The appearance of the village </h2><p>  The first ancient settlements on the Svir River appeared in the distant past, during the Veps.  This is a small nationality that has traditionally lived in certain areas of Russia.  The Vepsians helped maintain the trade route through <span>the Svir River.</span>  Gradually, the village became prosperous.  Here they began to extract granite, produce iron, build ships and trade.  But in the war of 1941-1945, the village, which included 29 yards, was burned to the ground, and people were forced to seek refuge in other villages. </p>

    <p>  In 1996, the village of Upper Mandrogs of the Leningrad Region was recreated by artists who were able to turn it into an open-air museum of Russian architecture.  About 100 people are constantly living in the village, and from the time of its restoration the inhabitants have increased: there were indigenous people aged from 1 year to 7 years.  The village has a kindergarten and a school.  Here they bake bread on their own according to old recipes and, probably, therefore it turns out so delicious. </p><p>  The <span>Museum of Vodka</span> has about 2800 copies.  Each visitor has the opportunity to exchange their bottle of vodka for the same, but produced in the city of St. Petersburg. </p><p>  Numerous entertainments are designed for families with children, employees of companies traveling on corporate vacations for several days.  Many noted that the kids really like it in Mandrogs.  One-day tours are also provided, starting at 8 in the morning and ending at 9 in the evening. </p>
