Getting scholarships, salaries - all this requires a bank card.  It was for them, for young customers of Sberbank PJSC, that the Molodezhnaya debit card was issued with a low annual service cost.  Below you will find information about receiving a card, validity period, daily limits on a Sberbank Molodezhnaya card, as well as a possible commission for accepting or withdrawing cash. </p><h2>  General map information </h2><p>  Molodezhnaya debit card can be issued for Sberbank clients aged 14 to 25 years.  The cost of annual maintenance is only 150 rubles.  Moreover, it is important to indicate that the cost of maintenance does not change in the second and subsequent years.  If upon reaching 25 years its validity has not yet expired, it will not be blocked.  However, re-issuance of the card will no longer be possible. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.autism.org.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Young customers" class="if uuid-2935515" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92610/2935515.jpg"></div><p>  It is worth noting that increased bonuses ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù from partner companies of the bank are accrued on it.  The card allows payment through the services of Apple Pay, Google Pay and other analogues.  It can be issued in the following payment systems: MasterCard, VISA.  An additional card is not issued. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="vc.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Apple pay" class="if uuid-2935517" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92610/2935517.jpg"></div><h2>  Individual design </h2><p>  Sberbank offers young customers the opportunity to choose their own youth debit card design.  To do this, go to the site in the "Debit Cards" section and go to the design order menu. </p><p>  For the convenience of customers, Sberbank offered more than 200 options for coloring the front side, in addition, you can send your own design for approval. </p><div class="photo" data-original="creditozor.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Design for card" class="if uuid-2935522" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92610/2935522.jpg"></div><p>  To do this, upload the image, place it on the card through a special form and send it for approval.  If the design is approved, then you will receive an individual sample.  The cost of ordering a card with its own design is 500 rubles.  Maintenance will cost <span>150</span> rubles per year. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sovets.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Custom Design Card" class="if uuid-2935514" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92610/2935514.jpg"></div><h2>  Limits for operations </h2><p>  What is the limit on a Sberbank youth card for operations such as paying for purchases in online and offline stores, restaurants, and other expenses?  There are no restrictions in this case.  In other words, the client can make purchases for any amount, however, for large expenses, the bank has the right to request confirmation for debiting funds in order to make sure that the actions are performed by the client and are not fraud. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="ugra-news.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="PJSC Sberbank" class="if uuid-2935519" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92610/2935519.jpg"></div><p>  The limit on the transfer of a Sberbank youth card through the Sberbank Online service is 1 million rubles.  However, it is important to clarify that when transferring more than 100 thousand rubles, a manager will contact the client to confirm the operation. </p><h2>  Limit on crediting cash to the card account </h2><p>  The limit for replenishment on a Sberbank youth card, or rather, the limit on cash acceptance operations for crediting to an account through a bank employee per day, is 10 million rubles. </p><p>  There is no commission for receiving cash at Sberbank ATMs.  In other words, the client can independently deposit any amount of money on the card. </p><p>  Also, there is no commission for receiving cash and crediting it to the card account in the branches of Sberbank PJSC.  Payment for cash in another territorial bank is 1.25% of the amount deposited, but not less than 30 and not more than 1000 rubles. </p><h2>  Cash withdrawal limit </h2><p>  The withdrawal limit on Sberbank Molodezhnaya card at ATMs and branches of Sberbank is 150 thousand rubles.  This is the amount a client can receive without a commission.  The monthly limit on Sberbank Molodezhnaya‚Äôs card is 1.5 million rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If the client tries to withdraw a large amount, the ATM will refuse to perform this operation.  In this case, you will have to contact the bank branch. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.soel.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank for youth" class="if uuid-2935518" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92610/2935518.jpg"></div><p>  It is worth noting that the client can also transfer funds between their cards without commission using the mobile application or in the personal account of Sberbank Online.  As a matter of fact, if the limit on cash withdrawals on a card without a commission has already been exhausted, then if you have another Sberbank card, you can initially transfer funds to it and withdraw them later. </p><p>  It is important to note that if you want to withdraw funds from an ATM of a third-party bank, you will have to pay a commission equal to 1% of the withdrawn amount.  Moreover, the commission cannot be less than 100 rubles.  The same thing happens when withdrawing funds at the cash desks of third-party banks.  The commission also amounts to 1% of the amount, but not less than 150 rubles. </p><p>  It is not possible to withdraw from the Sberbank ATM an amount exceeding the limit on the Sberbank Molodezhnaya card.  The device simply does not allow to complete the operation.  If you want to withdraw the amount over the limit on the Sberbank Molodezhnaya card, a fee equal to 0.5% of the excess amount will be withdrawn at the bank's cash desks.  It is not possible to conduct transactions at ATMs, as well as at cash desks of third-party banks. </p><p>  The daily limit of the Sberbank youth card for the issuance of funds without using the card through the cash desks of territorial banks outside the place of the account is 50 thousand rubles. </p><p>  In case of urgent need to receive cash, a commission equal to 6,000 rubles per transaction is charged. </p><h2>  Differences between MasterCard and VISA </h2><p>  As mentioned above, the ‚ÄúYouth‚Äù bank card is issued both in the VISA payment system and in the MasterCard payment system.  For people who more often travel to countries where the dollar is the currency, it is better to choose the first option, and for those who prefer countries where the currency is the euro, the second.  It is also important to note that all the limits described above on the Sberbank Molodezhnaya card are completely identical for both payment systems. </p><p>  However, there are still differences.  Each payment system offers its bonuses to card users.  For example, discounts on taxi rides from MasterCard and much more.  And all this in addition to the bonus program from Sberbank. </p><h2>  The cost of various services on the card </h2><p>  Scheduled re-issuance of the card is automatic and is free for the client.  However, for such a service due to loss, as well as due to a change in personal data, you will have to pay 150 rubles.  Checking the cash balance at Sberbank ATMs, as well as at a bank branch, is absolutely free.  If you try to make the same operation at an ATM of a third-party bank, you will have to pay 15 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kudago.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank Youth Branch" class="if uuid-2935525" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/92610/2935525.jpg"></div><p>  The same amount of money will be withdrawn from the account for receiving an extract containing information on the last ten transactions at a Sberbank ATM.  Receiving the same report via SMS or e-mail is free of charge. </p><h2>  Card blocking and reissue </h2><p>  The validity period of the Molodezhnaya card from Sberbank is 3 years.  As soon as the deadline expires, the card will be automatically reissued and delivered to the bank branch.  You can get it in the very department in which it was originally ordered. </p><p>  If the client wants to block the card for personal reasons before the expiration date, he must either call the customer support service or write an application to block the card in the bank branch.  You can also block the card in your Sberbank Online account or through the mobile application in the ‚ÄúCards‚Äù section. </p><p>  If the card was lost or stolen, the owner must immediately call customer support, tell about the incident and block the card.  In this case, fraudsters will not be able to use the funds in the account.  Also, the card may be unilaterally blocked by the bank if a financial institution suspects fraudulent activities. </p><p>  It is important to note that the reviews on this card are positive.  Parents of minor children note the convenience of using the card, as well as the fact that they can transfer funds to a child without a commission.  Older card users especially note the ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù program from Sberbank.  Bonuses allow young people to receive discounts on the purchase of airline tickets, payment for movie tickets and much more.  Customers also note the low cost of card service. </p>
