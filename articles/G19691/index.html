New buildings of Tyumen</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Now throughout Russia, the construction of beautiful modern residential complexes is actively conducted, in which it is convenient and pleasant to live.  Do not lag behind the general indicators and new buildings of Tyumen.  At the moment, more than forty LCDs are being prepared for delivery or are at the stage of the planned construction.  Here are just a few of them - Plekhanovo, Komarovo, Neighbors, Preobrazhensky, Central.  The price of apartments in them is from 1 850 000 rubles.  Begin to build "Quiet Pier", "Clover Park", "Watercolor" and others.  With such a variety, it is very difficult for a buyer to decide in which project he should invest his money.  In this article we offer detailed and truthful information about a very interesting LCD "Horizon".  Tyumen is clearly visible from the windows of his apartments.  It should be noted that there are about a dozen housing complexes with the same name in the vastness of Russia.  We offer information only about being built in Western Siberia, in the glorious city of Tyumen.  This complex has a number of important advantages regarding the layout of apartments and building technology, but people are in no hurry to buy apartments in it.  Let's see how justified the doubts of potential equity holders and how right are those who have already purchased real estate here. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  LCD "Horizon" (Tyumen) is being built in the river part of the city, across the Tura River.  You can get to the center from here in ten minutes, a maximum of a quarter of an hour.  If you cross the river and the next railway line, you can get into a dense urban area with many noisy and gassed streets with dozens of shops, pharmacies, offices and other infrastructure.  But in the district, the picture is different.  Here everything is more calm, there are few buildings, which is why the air is cleaner and less fuss.  Address at LCD "Horizon" - st.  Melnikayte, 2. Some indicate the address Druzhby Street, because the complex is being built just at its intersection with Melnikayte.  To the left of the fork is the Vatutinsky Grove, to the right of the forest park named after Gagarin.  In the immediate vicinity of the complex are located the houses of Zarechensky microdistrict No. 5, Vatutino, as well as the popular lake of Alebashevo and the Church of the Three Great Saints. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Horizon Tyumen" class="if" height="308" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1598363.jpg" width="495"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  Concerning transport interchanges LCD ‚ÄúHorizont‚Äù is quite conveniently located.  Tyumen is a large developed city, along the streets of which many bus routes are laid.  In particular, buses No. 20, 31, 19, 75, 77, about 10 routes in total go to the complex under consideration from the center. </p><p>  It will also be easy for car owners to get home, because there are two major roads near the Horizon - along Druzhby and Melnikayte streets.  Convenient access is possible from the street Alebashevskaya.  Traffic jams can become the only problem, but they are short-lived and only during peak hours.  Also for those who travel towards Omsk and further north, it is convenient that the <span>Siberian highway</span> begins right next to the complex <span>.</span> </p><h2>  Ecology Pros </h2><p>  There is no consensus that the place where the Gorizont residential complex (Tyumen) is being built meets environmental requirements.  Nearby are chic natural places.  One of them is Lake Alebashevo, to which residents of the Horizon need to walk only 300-400 meters.  The same can be said about Lake Krugloy.  True, it is located a little further from the complex, 800 meters, but this distance can also be overcome on foot.  There are good conditions for fishing, which will surely be appreciated by lovers of such a holiday. </p><p>  A big plus of the LCD "Horizon" are two natural areas that can be admired from the windows of apartments.  One of them is Vatutinsky Grove, a wonderful piece of nature in the city center.  A little further is the Garden of Friendship.  Very close to the "Horizon" and the beloved by the townspeople Gagarin Forest Park.  To get to it, residents of the complex only need to cross Melnikaite Street. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="new buildings of Tyumen" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1598341.jpg" width="497"></div>

But potential buyers complain of unpleasant odors that are felt at the intersection of Druzhba and Melnikayte streets, just where the complex is being built.  The reason is the KNS-2, infamous in Tyumen, and, in a simple way, the sewage discharge from the whole city is located nearby.  That is why a beautiful residential complex is not in demand.  Regarding KNS-2, a question was raised at the level of the city administration.  He was engaged in by deputy A. Chepik, deputy.  Mayor A. Shpirenko, deputy  prosecutor <span>M. Smirnov.</span>  As a result, the construction of a sewer station in the village of Kopylovo was begun in order to close the KNS-2.  So, the future residents of the Gorizont residential complex will already be from 2018, although it is unclear from which quarter they will be able to breathe fully. </p><p>  The same can be said about Lake Alebashevo, which is now overgrown with grass and is not of great value as a resting place.  The mayor's office allocated a large sum for the restoration of this reservoir, so there is a hope that here everything will be normal.  Putting the lake in order should also be completed in 2018. </p><p>  The third point, which alarms some Tyumen, is the cemetery, which is only 800 meters from the Horizon.  It will not expand, because there is nowhere, so here you can be calm.  There is no point in worrying about the sad landscape either, since a number of houses and household facilities were built between the cemetery and the complex. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Horizon Tyumen layout" class="if" height="317" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1598348.jpg" width="479"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  LCD "Horizon" (Tyumen): developer </h2><p>  The complex is being built by the Aqua company, which has been working in Tyumen in the construction services market since 2004.  Specifically, little is known about her activities.  But Aqua is part of the ARBIS holding, which has existed since the days of the USSR.  This holding in the Tyumen region is trusted.  Its assets include the Continent, Universalny, Tyumen shopping centers, the Columbus shopping center, and the dairy.  In addition, ARBIS is involved in charity work.  All this gives confidence that the LCD "Horizon" will be built and successfully completed, as well as that the quality of work will be acceptable.  Aqua is currently busy with the implementation of two projects at once, one at Melnikayt, the second at Shirotnaya.  There is no information that the company does not rent out its facilities and deprives real estate investors. </p><h2>  Complex infrastructure </h2><p>  Designers tried to create comfortable conditions for the residents of the LCD "Horizon" (Tyumen).  Reviews of interest holders note that on its territory there will be 19 seventeen-story houses.  They will be arranged so that calm cozy courtyards are formed, where, according to the improvement plan, playgrounds will be equipped, trees and flowers will be planted, benches and gazebos will be installed, sports grounds constructed and, very importantly, a private boiler room.  The construction of a school, kindergarten, and other social facilities for residents of the Horizon is not planned. </p><p>  Taking into account the interests of car enthusiasts, an on-site parking zone will be equipped in the territory, as well as an underground parking, in which, according to the assurances of the developer, there should be enough space for cars of all residents of the complex. </p><h2>  Infrastructure nearby </h2><p>  LCD "Horizon" in Tyumen is being built near the Vatutino district, where a school and a lyceum, two kindergartens are already operating, the nearest of which is a maximum of 750 meters, a clinic, a hairdresser, a post office, several shops.  To the most popular, called "Pyaterochka", from the "Horizon" is also about 750 meters.  Other stores are a little further.  Among them are three large shopping centers.  Therefore, additional construction of such facilities is not planned near the complex. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Horizon Tyumen one-room apartment" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1598384.jpg" width="476"></div>

    <h2>  Construction technology </h2><p>  Of course, it is very important for equity holders how warm the apartments in the Horizon residential complex will be.  Tyumen is located in the zone of sharply continental climate, where frosts can reach more than 30 degrees.  Therefore, all residential buildings are being built here using special technologies.  In this complex, the supports are made monolithic of reinforced concrete, and the external walls are built like sandwiches.  The first layer (inner) is ceramic brick, the second is mineral wool, the third (outer) is facing brick.  The width of the outer walls is 550 mm.  They have increased strength, and most importantly, high thermal insulation qualities. </p><p>  Internal walls and partitions are made of expanded clay concrete, considered the most environmentally friendly among building materials.  The supporting structures in the houses are located around the perimeter, which makes it possible to redevelop the apartments at the discretion of the residents. </p><p>  For greater heat saving, all buildings will be rented with glazed loggias, and it is planned to install euro windows with triple glazed windows in the rooms.  Before renting the house, tenants can agree with the builders and also install similar double-glazed windows on the flats of their apartments. </p><p>  Entrance to any building will be only from the yard.  From the side of the road, no entry is planned.  Each building will have a spacious hall and two elevators of the Belarusian brand ‚ÄúLiftmash‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="residential complex Horizon Tyumen" class="if" height="276" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1598351.jpg" width="467"></div>

    <h2>  Quartography </h2><p>  Only one and two bedroom apartments are planned to be built in the LCD "Horizon" (Tyumen).  Their layouts are different.  The footage is as follows: </p><p>  - one-room, rounded total area - from 40 m <sup>2</sup> to 53 m <sup>2</sup> ; </p><p>  - two-room apartments - from 58 m <sup>2</sup> to 59 m <sup>2</sup> . </p><p>  Moreover, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãkitchens in the complex will be from 10 m <sup>2</sup> to 21 m <sup>2</sup> . </p><p>  The height of the ceilings in the final version (with suspended ceilings) is 2.7 meters. </p><p>  The apartments will be rented both with full decoration (wallpaper, linoleum, tiles in the kitchen, in the bathroom and the bathroom, ceilings), and with partial decoration (plastered ceilings and walls, all communications, Internet, television, telephone, window sills, floors are finished). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD horizon Tyumen deadlines" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1598480.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Steel radiators are installed in each apartment, thermo-seams are made along the walls that prevent thermal expansion, in the bathroom and the bathroom the screed is made with hydro and sound insulation, plus, water meters are installed.  The layout of the heat pipes here is horizontal, so for the residents of some apartments a warm bonus will be warm floors. </p><h2>  Apartments design </h2><p>  All new buildings in Tyumen have some zest to attract investors in projects and get good housing sales.  In the LCD "Horizon" such a highlight are really very spacious and comfortable apartments.  Among the one-room apartments there are those where the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe kitchen is from 15 m <sup>2</sup> to 21 m <sup>2</sup> .  In the latter embodiment, two spacious windows are provided.  In such kitchens it is quite possible not only to cook, but also to equip the dining area - the guest. </p><p>  There are bedrooms in the complex with two large windows, which makes them as bright as possible.  The loggias in the apartments are also different.  Their area can be from 5 m <sup>2</sup> to 8 m <sup>2</sup> .  In some apartments, for greater convenience, closets, dressing rooms are equipped, and where they will not be, very spacious halls are built. </p><p>  On the floors of the project, there are 9 apartments - 4 from one wing, 4 from the other and one in the center.  The decoration design (where it will be) is classic - in the rooms and in the hallway there are wallpapers of pleasant colors and tones, in the bathroom and in the kitchen there is beautiful tile, in the toilets there is also tile, but with more strict shades. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Horizont St. Melnikaite" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1598347.jpg" width="485"></div>
