On it towers a bell tower, a cathedral, a cemetery and a baptistery.  Italy (Pisa in particular) is known to many thanks to the ‚ÄúLeaning Tower‚Äù, which was created in 1173.  Its height is 56 meters, although it was planned to build a building up to seventy meters.  The creator of the unusual structure was Bonanno Pisano.  His idea was that inside the structure he wanted to conduct research on the force of gravity.  Later, Tommaso Pisano continued his work.  Today, the building consists of six tiers of loggias with columns that encircle the building.  The leaning style of Pisa is very interesting and unique; tourists will not be able to see anything like this anywhere else. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the city of pisa in italy" class="if" height="461" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/271612.jpg" width="454"></div>

    <p>  Italy (Pisa in particular) is also known for the cathedral, the construction of which began back in 1064.  In a unique structure several styles were combined, namely: Romanesque, Byzantine, early Christian, Norman and a little Arabic.  <span>Pisa Cathedral</span> was dedicated to the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary.  The construction was completed only in the seventeenth century thanks to the famous architect Rainaldo.  Today people from different parts of the world come to see the cathedral; it has been restored several times and looks great.  Various works of art are collected inside the building, which is why it is often called a museum.  Each tourist can see the city of Pisa on a map of Italy, plan their route in such a way as not to pass this beautiful place. </p>
