This phrase no longer defines something of poor quality or unreliable when it comes to mobile devices.  A large and bright display, a metal case, a stylish design, a 13-megapixel camera, and all this at an indecently favorable price.  At least, according to the manufacturer UMI, offering its device, a smartphone UMI Rome X. User reviews will help to figure out whether this is so. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  As a package, the UMI Rome X smartphone has a small white box, on the lid of which the UMI company logo is applied, and on the basis of which a brief list of technical characteristics of the device is indicated.  Under the cover, the upper tier is occupied by the device itself, and under it all its accessories are neatly laid.  Among them: a protective film on the display, a 1A charger, a data cable and instructions. </p><p>  But for some reason, nobody cares about the meager equipment that the UMI Rome X smartphone boasts. Customer reviews mostly describe other elements of the Chinese device. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Maybe a smartphone and a budget, but he still has something from the flagship models.  The fact is that he has a pretty respectable appearance, given the fact that its cost is about 5000 rubles.  Its body is made of solid metal, and the back cover is made of plastic, texture similar to metal.  The plastic is soft, smooth, practically does not scratch, and it is difficult to leave fingerprints on it. </p>

Under the display are three touch buttons.  On top of the speaker, light sensors and proximity, as well as the "eye" of the front camera.  At the top end is the headphone input, and the bottom end is decorated with speakers and a microUSB connector.  On the right sidewall there are two controls at once - a volume rocker and a smartphone start button.

Under the plastic cover, two slots for SIM cards and one for a memory card are built-in.  The smartphone is found in two colors: gold and black.  In general, the device looks much more expensive than its price.  Yes, and users have no complaints about the appearance of UMI Rome X. Customer reviews indicate the strength, quality and attractiveness of the case. </p><h2>  Screen features </h2><p>  The display is now considered almost the most important element in mobile devices.  This, for example, is equipped with a 5.5-inch HD display with a resolution of 1280 √ó 720 and a pixel density of 267 ppi.  Such parameters should be enough for comfortable work.  There is also an interesting Miravision on-screen display feature.  The display, which is able to respond only to two simultaneous clicks, is covered with a protective glass <span>Gorilla Glass,</span> which should save the screen from minor damage. </p>

But many praise the large screen size and good viewing angles.

Only 8 GB of memory is provided for data storage, but as usual, less will be available to the user.  But an additional slot is able to accept a card up to 64 GB.

Some users claim that this smartphone is not intended for demanding applications, if only because during a long game the processor of the device becomes very hot.  It is also difficult for him to work with several applications at the same time.  In general, gamers will have to take a closer look at more productive models.

    <h2>  Software and Wireless Modules </h2><p>  The smartphone from the Chinese manufacturer is running the Android 5.1 OS, the shell of which is slightly redone.  For example, the menu button is made in the style of UMI.  Functions such as contact and non-contact control are available.  There is nothing more unnecessary in the system, which is probably why the interface is fast and smooth.  Unnecessary third-party applications the user also can not find.  All that is needed can be downloaded and installed from the Play Market. </p><p>  The good news is that the smartphone supports OTG-function, designed to connect peripheral devices, which is slightly unusual for such a budget model.  It is also possible to connect via Bluetooth, connect via Wi-Fi and navigate using the GPS module. </p>

It is also noted that the device without problems catches Wi-Fi, and GPS quickly finds satellites.  True, some reviews written about the UMI Rome X gold smartphone speak of software problems.  For example, many programs installed from the mobile application service are unstable.  Also spontaneous shutdown of some applications is noticed.

    <h2>  Camera features </h2><p>  Now it is worth paying attention to another important feature of this device.  According to the technical specifications, the Chinese smartphone is equipped with a 13-megapixel main camera with autofocus, developed by Sony.  Some special settings or functions are not attached to it, but given the cost of the device, they should not be there.  The front camera is not of interest, its resolution is only 2 megapixels. </p>

Their reviews vary greatly.  Some argue that the camera is good and capable of taking fairly detailed and rich pictures.  Also, the advantages include autofocus and dual flash.  On the other side are users who believe that the camera resolution is much lower than the declared one, the flash is very weak for shooting in the dark, the focus is slow, and the front module is generally worthless.

    <h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  Despite the large display under the back cover lies the battery, which has a rather modest capacity of 2500 mAh.  Nevertheless, if you don‚Äôt particularly burden the smartphone with work, the charge will last about 20 hours.  In the endless video viewing mode, the device can last three times less.  And the user will have about 7 hours to browse the Internet.  True, he always has a "trump card in the sleeve" in the form of an energy-saving mode.  If you activate it, then at 10% charge the phone will last about another day.  Then you have to put the device on charge, which lasts about 3 hours. </p>

Some of its capacities are categorically not enough.  And according to the tests, the capacity was overestimated by the manufacturer.  However, many say that calibrating the battery can fix the situation a bit.

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Summing up, we can say that the biggest plus of a smartphone is its price.  Although there are other positive points.  Strengths include a metal case, a stylish appearance, a good camera and a smart interface. </p><p>  Unfortunately, there are also enough weaknesses.  Here, users mainly attribute a short battery life, a cheap touchscreen designed for only 2 touches, a weak front camera and low performance for demanding games. </p>
