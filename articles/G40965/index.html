However, everything is changing rapidly.  In recent years, the development of the project "Great Ustyug - the homeland of Santa Claus" has allowed everyone to plunge into a winter fairy tale.  In our country there are not many places where you can relax with your child, and even in the middle of winter.  A visit to the estate of Santa Claus is a great opportunity to spend time with the whole family and have fun from the heart.  And you can come here only for one day, which is very important for parents who are always busy. </p>

    <p>  This is another great hotel that is pleased to open its doors to you.  The Iceberg Hotel (Veliky Ustyug) is a new hotel, which is located near the city center, the homeland of Russian Santa Claus, at the address: ul.  A. Uglovsky, d. 3. It offers a four-story landscaped brick building with shops on the ground floor.  For a pleasant pastime there is a cafe with 24 seats, decorated in the style of the old city. </p><h2>  Everything for guests </h2>

    <p>  The number of rooms gives tourists the opportunity to choose the most suitable living conditions.  Economy rooms are small in size but very comfortable.  Maximum they are designed for two tourists.  The room has a bed and a TV, a set of dishes and bedside tables.  On the floor there is a carpet, which immediately creates an atmosphere of comfort and warmth.  The bathroom is combined.  The cost of living - from 800 rubles per day in a room.  The double junior suite is designed for 3 people, but the basic suite remains the same, so we will not list again.  Cost 0 from 1,200 per day.  Finally, a suite is a family type room that can accommodate a maximum of 6 people.  The cost starts at 2,000 rubles. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, this is a very comfortable hotel, which at any time of the year is ready to offer you to stay in one of the rooms and have a good time.  The staff is ready to do everything possible to make you like it here. </p><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  Of course, we did not consider all the hotels of Veliky Ustyug.  Prices allow you to calculate your vacation budget.  Compared to many winter resorts, you can have a great time for a fairly modest amount.  The town itself is very quiet, cozy, a real province.  Indeed, in a noisy metropolis, Santa Claus has nothing to do.  Be sure to come here with the children and give them a winter fairy tale. </p>
