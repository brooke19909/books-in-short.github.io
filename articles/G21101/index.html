However, due to errors, the old part of Kalyazin was flooded.  The St. Nicholas Cathedral was dismantled, and they decided to leave the bell tower as a lighthouse.  Around the building they created a small island and even built a pier. </p>

    <p>  In addition, the Kalyazin Hotel has its own restaurant serving Russian, Georgian and European dishes.  A great complement to dinner will be a fresh draft beer or dessert from a pastry shop. </p><p>  The hotel‚Äôs administration cooperates with the Kalyazin Yacht Club.

This is a great one-night economy. </p><p>  A big advantage is the availability of a restaurant on site.  However, the opinions of the guests on this score were divided - the expectation of service and not very tasty food spoiled the whole impression. </p><p>  Hotel guests also lacked additional lighting in rooms, Wi-Fi, the ability to pay by credit card and a more thorough cleaning. </p>

    <p>  You can get to the ‚ÄúDeck‚Äù by water - there is a mooring zone on the territory.  No less popular entertainment are boat trips. </p><h2>  Guest opinions </h2><p>  Kalyazin hotels are unlikely to be able to compare with the magnificent country hotel ‚ÄúDeck‚Äù.  It has everything you need for a comfortable stay for families with children, couples in love and single travelers. </p><p>  According to guest reviews, the ideal time to travel is July and August.  In the remaining months, especially the winter months, the hotel is not fully operational.  Guests complain about problems with heating and hot water, drowsiness of staff and poor cleaning.  In addition, the comments relate to a weak Wi-Fi signal and antenna, lack of towels and toiletries, as well as very modest breakfasts, location near the highway and poor soundproofing. </p><p>  Despite these shortcomings, the Hotel Deck is one of the best in the vicinity of Kalyazin.  The magnificent concept of the park hotel and work on bugs will certainly affect the opinion of vacationers. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúGuest yard‚Äù </h2><p>  Until recently, the Volga Hotel (Kalyazin, Karl Marx St., 21a) was considered the most inexpensive, which at the moment does not work.  If you do not have time to take care of the overnight stay in advance, take note of another option.  ‚ÄúGuest yard‚Äù is located in Vasilevo (10 km from Kalyazin). </p><p>  A large village house awaits travelers.  On the second floor there is a shared kitchen and eight small rooms with bathrooms and showers, equipped with a refrigerator and a TV.  On the ground floor there are four rooms with a separate entrance and a kitchen with the necessary set of dishes.  The cost of accommodation is from 600 rubles per day. </p>

    <h2>  Pros and cons </h2><p>  It‚Äôs not so easy to find Kalyazin hotels - it is a small city in which tourists rarely stay longer than several hours.  However, in the cozy ‚ÄúGuest Yard‚Äù reviews of guests are advised to spend more than one day. </p><p>  Benefits: </p><ol><li>  Hospitable hosts. </li><li>  Fenced area with parking. </li><li>  Russian bathhouse on wood. </li><li>  Pergolas for barbecue.  Free breakfast with pancakes and tea. </li><li>  Table tennis. </li><li>  Pets are welcome. </li></ol><p>  However, among the positive reviews there were several negative ones.  For example, among the shortcomings mention the large distance to the nearest reservoir and video surveillance.  The presence of cameras in the territory is justified by security, but in the house ‚Äúsurveillance‚Äù confuses the guests a little.  The ‚ÄúGuest Yard‚Äù is primarily suitable for travelers with personal transport, but even a taxi ride to Kalyazin will cost about 200 rubles. </p><p>  The village of Vasilevo also houses the Rendezvous complex, which has a cafe-bar with home cooking, a billiard room and a mini-hotel. </p><p>  As you might have guessed, finding Kalyazin hotels on a map is not so simple.  There is only one accommodation option in the city, three kilometers away is the Hotel Deck, and even further - the Guest Courtyard and Rendezvous.  If you intend to stay in Kalyazin for a long time, then you can look for offers for renting rooms and apartments, which are always in the local newspaper ads. </p>
