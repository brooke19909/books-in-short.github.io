    <h3>  <strong>What can i buy?</strong> </h3><p>  The most profitable purchases are Thai cotton and silk products, as well as jewelry with precious <span>stones: rubies,</span> sapphires, diamonds. </p><p>  In the <span>capital of Thailand,</span> as in other places in this country, there are two where you can make purchases: street shops and shopping centers.  In many supermarkets and plazas, the <span>product range is</span> almost no different from the European one.  The service here is also at a decent level, in addition to shops in shopping centers there are restaurants, cinemas and other entertainment venues. </p><h3>  <strong>10 best places to shop</strong> </h3><ol><li>  Many tourists claim that it is very profitable to shop in Bangkok at Chatuchak Market.  Here you can buy pretty high-quality items at a low price. </li><li>  A very famous <span>shopping center in Bangkok</span> is considered the "MVK".  On the eight floors of this shopping mall you can find almost everything: household appliances, handicrafts, mobile phones, dishes, clothes.  If you want to know what is the most luxurious shopping in Bangkok, be sure to check here. </li><li>  In the capital of Thailand, there is one rather unusual shopping complex - Terminal 21.  This place is like an airport: screens hang on the walls, staff wears <span>stewardess costumes, and</span> there is a lot of glass everywhere.  The center presents both the most <span>famous brands</span> and local brands. </li><li>  You can also go shopping in one of the capital‚Äôs oldest shopping centers, Central Cheadlom.  In this complex you can buy cosmetics, electronics, books, clothes and many other goods. </li><li><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="shopping bangkok reviews" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/301579.jpg" width="320"></div>  If you are interested in expensive brands, then it is better to go to the "Gason Shopping Mall."  This luxury shopping complex is made of glass, marble and metal.  There are luxury stores here. </li><li>  You can shop in Bangkok at Siam Discovery Shopping Center.  This place is not as luxurious as the "Gason Shopping Mall", but there is an excellent selection of women's and men's clothing of American and European brands.  "Siam Discovery" is very popular with foreign and local youth. </li><li>  Also, Pantip Plaza is considered to be a popular and profitable place to buy household appliances.  Here you can find everything - from a mouse to an ultramodern computer of the latest model.  At the same time, among such an abundance of goods, there are many pirated software and counterfeit products.  Stay away from such products, as buying pirated software is considered a crime in Thailand. </li><li>  Where else can you best do shopping in Bangkok?  Traveler reviews say that you can buy pretty high-quality clothes, shoes, books and even a car in the huge Siam Paragon shopping center. </li><li>  Centralworld is also a fairly profitable place for shopping.  They offer to buy the latest technology, designer furniture, clothes - and all this at the best prices. </li><li>  Platinum Fashion Mall is 1600 stores with a wide range of bags, evening dresses, underwear and children's clothing.  Here, by the way, you can safely bargain. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bangkok shopping prices" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/301578.jpg" width="505"></div></li></ol><p>  As you can see, you have another great reason to visit Bangkok - shopping.  Prices for goods are quite diverse and are designed for a wallet of any thickness.  Well, wear comfortable shoes, and go on the hunt for beautiful and useful things! </p>
