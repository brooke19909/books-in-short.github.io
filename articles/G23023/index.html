  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Methods and basic functions of sociology.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In this article we will consider the basic methods and functions of sociology. </p><p>  The functions of sociology determine its role and modern social purpose.  In general terms, the following basic functions of sociology are distinguished: </p><p>  1. Theoretical and cognitive.  It consists in the accumulation of knowledge about society, about its processes and structural elements.  The importance of this function is determined by the acceleration of the pace of <span>development of society.</span>  This function acquires the most important value in our country, since it is Russia that is characterized by very quick and profound transformations.  Only objective knowledge about the changes in our society, their orientation and nature, which provides sociology, can overcome the crisis and ensure the development of the country. </p><p>  2. <em>Informational.</em>  Sociology is largely based on <span>empirical research,</span> during which the collection, accumulation and grouping of sociological information is carried out.  In modern society it is impossible to implement effective and sound management if decisions that are made do not have the necessary information support.  Sociologists, based on the collected and objective information, develop recommendations and suggestions for practice and policy. </p><p>  3. Practical.  Certain manifestations of <em>such a function of</em> sociology are quite diverse.  It manifests itself, for example, in the fact that sociology, exploring society from the perspective of a holistic system, can develop reasonable predictions regarding the development trends of specific <span>social processes</span> or phenomena.  This is of great importance for the development of society, especially in the transition period.  Such a function of sociology include the following specific activities such as social counseling and public services.  At the same time, the manifestation of such a function of sociology found itself in <span>social studies,</span> for example, opinion polls, marketing, etc. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  4. Worldview.  Sociology, studying modern society, creating a complete picture of social processes and relations, forms a system of views on the world as a whole and a person‚Äôs place in it, as well as the person‚Äôs attitude to himself and to social reality, conditional on these ideals of people‚Äôs ideals, their life positions. </p><p>  5. <em>Humanistic.</em>  <em>It finds its manifestation as a result of the fact that</em> sociology clarifies what conditions are necessary for a person to realize himself, showing how to fully realize his own social essence. </p><p><em>&nbsp;</em></p><p>  <em>These are the main</em> basic functions of sociology.  Now it is necessary to analyze the basic methods of this science. </p><p>  The sociological method is a collective concept that includes specific cognitive orientations, techniques, approaches, tools and methods that are used in <span>sociological research.</span> </p><p>  All <span>sociological methods</span> can be combined into the following groups: </p><ul><li>  General science, which includes methods used by all sciences, but applied in sociology, taking into account its specificity.  These include the following methods: comparative-historical, comparative, critical-dialectical, structural-functional, genetic, experiment, observation, etc. </li><li>  Private scientific methods, which include methods used only by this science, for example, the biographical method, the survey, the method of sociometry, etc. </li></ul><p>  Since the methods of sociology are necessarily based on empirical data in the study of reality, it is possible to distinguish in addition to the above methods of collection, as well as analysis of the collected information about the facts.  The main methods of collecting information in sociology are surveys, the study and analysis of information, observation, etc. The relevance and reliability of the data determine the methods and functions of sociology. </p>
