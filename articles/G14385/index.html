    <h2>  Internet projects </h2><p>  In 1998, interest in the World Wide Web grew significantly.  And since Boguslavsky already had good experience in the field of computer networks, PwC added him a leadership function in the countries of Eastern and Central Europe.  After some time, Leonid Borisovich began to independently invest in various Internet projects.  At the end of 1999, the hero of this article met Charlie Ryan (UFG), David Mixer (Rex Capital) and Mike Calvey (Baring Vostok).  At that time, these three were planning to create a company that would specialize in investing on the Internet. </p><h2>  Holding ru-net </h2><p>  Boguslavsky Leonid founded it in 2000 with the participation of two funds - UFG and Baring Vostok.  ru-Net became the first holding company to invest in Yandex (35% of shares for $ 5.27 million) and Ozon.ru ($ 3 million for a controlling stake).  In 2006, all assets (except for the share in the search engine) were transferred to ru-Net investors.  At the moment, Boguslavsky owns 20% of Ozon.ru. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 2007, Leonid Borisovich created the ru-Net II fund.  The company has become an investor in such projects as ‚ÄúiConText‚Äù (contextual advertising), ‚ÄúMobileDirect‚Äù (mobile advertising), ‚ÄúAimobilko‚Äù (selling digital content) and ‚ÄúDigital Access‚Äù (streaming video from ivi.ru).

    <h2>  Own company </h2><p>  In 2006, Leonid Boguslavsky, whose family is described below, founded his company under the name ru-Net Limited.  Immediately after that, negotiations began with startups Vkontakte and Odnoklassniki.  But no agreements were reached.  But Leonid Borisovich invested in HeadHunter and iConText. </p><p>  In 2007, the entrepreneur met <span>Alisher Usmanov.</span>  The latter asked Boguslavsky to develop an investment strategy for him.  A year later, Leonid Borisovich introduced Usmanov to Yuri Milner. </p><h2>  Leaving Yandex </h2><p>  In 2008, Boguslavsky left the Board of Directors of this company.  This happened because the businessman began to invest in companies that could potentially create a conflict of interest with the search engine.  The entrepreneur also bought the company Digital Akcess from Leonard Blavatnik, creating on its basis, together with Oleg Tumanov, the largest online movie theater ivi.ru in Russia. </p><h2>  international market </h2><p>  In 2011, Boguslavsky Leonid significantly expanded the scope of his activities.  He began to actively invest in international markets.  For these purposes, the businessman created a subsidiary of ru-Net in the USA. </p>
