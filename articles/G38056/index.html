Riga architect Johann Daniel Felsko</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the center of the Latvian capital, at the intersection of Gertrudes and Baznicas Streets, stands an unusual religious building with a high spire.  This is the Old Church of Gertrude.  It was built in the 19th century. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.smartriga.lv" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Riga, Latvia" class="if uuid-2557687" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2557687.jpg"></div><h2>  Background </h2><p>  This Riga Lutheran church was first mentioned in 1413.  There was already a temple here, but it had little in common with the attraction that guests of the Latvian capital admire today.  According to another version, the first church appeared here in 1418.  One way or another, the first temple burned down in the middle of the XVI century.  Later, a wooden building was erected in its place, which also did not survive - it died during the Swedish-Polish campaign. </p><p>  It is believed that the Old Church of Gertrude was founded in 1413.  However, the construction of the temple, which can be seen today in the center of the capital of Riga, began only in 1864.  How many buildings in this place have been replaced in four hundred years is unknown. </p><h2>  Construction </h2><p>  The author of the project, on which the Old Church of Gertrude was built, was a graduate of the Imperial Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg.  The name of the architect was Johann Daniel Felsko.  According to the designs of this master, several buildings were constructed in the capital of Latvia, visits to which today are included in tours in Riga. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The construction was completed in 1866.  Consecrated the temple in 1869.  Due to its features, this building has long played the role of a building dominant. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.redzet.lv" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="old gertrude church riga" class="if uuid-2557659" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2557659.jpg"></div><h2>  Architecture </h2><p>  Gertrude's old church is an example of an eclectic style.  Felsko created many of his works in this architectural direction.  In the appearance of the temple there are many elements characteristic of the neo-Gothic style.  Gertrude's old church is a three-nave pseudo-basilica decorated with arches.  Almost all parts are cast in concrete.  The exterior was red brick.  The height of the temple is 63 m. The spire is covered with a layer of copper. </p><h2>  The New Church of Gertrude </h2><p>  Until the beginning of the 20th century, the temple, which was described above, was called a little differently.  Just the church of Gertrude.  In 1903, the construction of a new church according to the design of Wilhelm von Strick began in Riga.  They decided to erect the construction on the site of the Alexander Market, not far from the Bolshaya Vodokachka. </p><p>  The new church of Gertrude, namely this name was given to this temple, has much in common in its architectural appearance with the building erected according to the project of Felsko.  This building is the latest example of eclectic architectural style in Riga.  In the guise of the New Church of Gertrude there are neo-Romanesque forms.  The height of the structure is 69 meters.  The main feature of the composition is asymmetry. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At the New Church of St. Gertrude, divine services are conducted in both Latvian and Russian.  In this sense, the temple is unique.  In Riga, the Russian-speaking Lutheran liturgy is not performed anywhere else. </p><h2>  Johann Daniel Felsco </h2><p>  Anyone who is going on a tour of Riga will certainly hear the name of this person from the guide.  Johann Felsko has long held the position of chief architect of the city.  Riga was the architect‚Äôs hometown.  After completing his studies at the St. Petersburg Academy, Felsko returned to the capital of Latvia.  In 1849, he received an order to create a project for a new bell tower for the church of St. John.  The temple is located in the Old Town.  This is one of the main attractions of Latvia. </p><div class="photo" data-original="riga.lv" data-author=": " data-source="https://riga.lv/lv/ampnews/kas-radits-rigas-kinoteatros-pirms-100-gadiem?11080"><img itemprop="image" alt="Riga 19th century" class="if uuid-2557681" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2557681.jpg"></div><p>  There are many interesting historical monuments in Riga.  For example, St. George's Hospital is an empire-style building that also appeared thanks to Felsko.  In 1852, the architect designed the temple, which is located on Slokas Street - the church of St. Martin. </p><p>  After Felsko gained a reputation as the best architect in the city, orders poured on him like a cornucopia.  The master was approached by members of the local Anglican ward.  The architect developed a project according to which a temple was built in the Old Town in the late fifties.  Today it is one of the most significant architectural monuments in Riga.  It's about the Anglican Church, located at: Anglicanu Street, 2. </p><p>  Before the conclusion of the Paris Peace Treaty, Riga had the status of a disputed walled city, which hindered economic development.  After the city acquired significance.  It was decided to change the face of Riga.  Some of the old buildings were demolished, new buildings appeared in the center.  Felsko worked on Riga Boulevard Ensemble together with another famous architect of that time - Otto Dietze. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.iksd.riga.lv" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="st martin church" class="if uuid-2557678" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2557678.jpg"></div><p>  The buildings erected by the designs of Johann Daniel Felsco include: </p><ul><li>  City gymnasium. </li><li>  Real school. </li><li>  Gas factory. </li><li>  Greenfeld Mansion. </li></ul><p>  The architect also designed the tower of the Church of St. John and the main entrance of the Lesser Guild. </p>
