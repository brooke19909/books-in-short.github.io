    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  For the construction of a new complex, an ecologically clean area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city, freed from harmful industries, was chosen.  A plot of 50 hectares outside Nizhny Novgorod was allocated for construction.  The attention of the developer was attracted by the Kstovsky district, the village of Ankudinovka.  Clean air, an abundance of greenery, excellent opportunities for organizing leisure in the fresh air - this is exactly what Ankudinovsky Park residential complex is now imagining.  The developer has developed a plan for a new neighborhood, trying to preserve the beauty of the natural landscape as much as possible.  The result is a modern, high-quality complex, surrounded on all sides by a forest belt.  The city is very close - it is only 6 km away. </p><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  The remoteness about the city scares potential buyers, because not every family has a car with which you can get to work, take children to kindergarten and school.  To ensure the necessary transport accessibility, the developer provided for the construction of bus stops, additional public transport routes will be launched in the direction of the new microdistrict.  Getting to anywhere in the city will be quick and easy, even for those who do not use personal transport. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Ankudinovka railway station is a 10-minute walk from the new buildings. From it, you can reach the Moscow railway station in an hour or so.  Car owners in just 20 minutes in the absence of traffic jams will be able to get to the city center. </p><h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  The apartments of Ankudinovsky Park residential complex have, perhaps, the main advantage that will distinguish them from the rest - the environmental friendliness of the place where they are built.  Next to the complex is a huge Ankudinovsky park, after which the project was named, as well as the Botanical Garden with rare plant species.  In this regard, the residents of the complex will have an advantage over those who live in a dusty and crowded city. </p><p>  Near the complex there are clean forest lakes, a forest park.  All major highways with heavy traffic are located at a sufficient distance from the complex, due to which they will not disturb the peace of the inhabitants. </p>

    <h2>  Landscaping </h2><p>  All car owners will be able to use the underground parking: you can go down to it directly from the floor of your apartment using a high-speed elevator.  Due to the underground parking, it was possible to isolate the yards from the accumulation of cars and arrange modern playgrounds and sports grounds for children and adults.  The project provides for the creation of walking areas, bike paths. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  When planning the construction of a distant, albeit not essential, from the city of the microdistrict, it is important to consider access to all necessary infrastructure facilities.  The own infrastructure of the microdistrict is represented by several kindergartens, a comprehensive school, a business center, a fitness center and a shopping and entertainment center.  The first floors of the houses will be reserved for commercial infrastructure: as the object is commissioned, bank branches, beauty salons, cafes and shops will appear here. </p><p>  The village of Ankudinovka is very small, infrastructure is not represented in abundance and diversity, but in 10 minutes you can drive to the village of Fedyakovo, where the largest <span>shopping and entertainment center Mega</span> operates <span>.</span> </p><h2>  Apartments, layouts </h2><p>  How comfortable was the property in Ankudinovsky Park residential complex?  Reviews of apartments, of course, primarily cover a variety of planning decisions.  The developer offers buyers apartments from 1 to 4 rooms ranging from 18 to 89 square meters.  The apartments are not impressive in spaciousness, quite compact, but due to modern and rational layouts, it is possible to provide comfort to each member of the family. </p>

    <p>  All apartments are rented turnkey.  It is represented by a laminate on the floor, washable wallpaper on the walls, entrance and interior doors, balcony glazing, high-quality European-made sanitary ware, porcelain tiles in the bathroom and the bathroom.  In addition, the kitchen of all residents is waiting for a modern kitchen set with built-in appliances. </p><h2>  Price policy </h2><p>  Surely many are interested to know what the price of comfort and clean air is.  The cost of one-bedroom apartments with decoration starts at 1.6 million rubles, a four-room apartment for a large and friendly family can be purchased for 4 million rubles.  For an apartment ready to receive tenants - this is a great price. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Residential complex "Ankudinovsky Park" is an example of a modern complex where all living conditions are created.  The project will definitely attract the attention of families with small children and those who pay great attention to the quality of their life, want to hide from the hustle and bustle of the metropolis without losing access to the necessary infrastructure. </p><p>  Take a closer look at the project, its final commissioning is planned for the 4th quarter of 2017, while there is still the opportunity to purchase an apartment on favorable terms. </p>
