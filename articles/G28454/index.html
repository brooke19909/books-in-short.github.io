It is charged for each overdue day at the end of the time stipulated by the contract.  And its size is set according to one three hundredth part of the refinancing rate of the Central Bank of the country, valid on the day of payment.  The violator of his obligations will be released if he can prove that the delay was not due to his fault, but because of the intervention of a third party, natural disasters and other unforeseen circumstances.  In addition, the provisions on the penalty in the contract are necessary elements of it, since they are stipulated by the legislation of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  <strong>Temporary measurement of accrual for breach of contract</strong> </p><p>  Days of delay are calculated at the end of the last day of compliance with obligations under the contract.  After their implementation, the delay is no longer counted from the moment specified in the act on the fulfillment of obligations.  If the obligations have not been fulfilled, and the party due to which a violation of the agreements occurred is ready to pay the invoice for the penalty, then the date on which the invoice is drawn up is the final term for the payment of the penalty. </p><p>  <strong>Calculation of the penalty at the refinancing rate</strong> <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="calculation of the penalty at the refinancing rate" class="if" height="247" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11926/129822.jpg" width="200"></div>

In cases where the contract is partially executed, the calculation of the penalty at the refinancing rate is carried out according to the difference in the price of the contract and the size of the services or goods received.  That is, unfulfilled obligations are measured in their material conformity (in units, pairs, kilograms, etc.) with the price expression provided for by the contract, whether it is a goods not fully received until a certain moment of cooperation or a few minor clauses of the contract that are not fulfilled. </p><p>  <strong>How to calculate the penalty at the refinancing rate</strong> </p><p>  To carry out the operation of determining the exact amount of the payment of the penalty according to the refinancing rate, it is necessary, taking into account the period of unfulfilled obligations, to take into account the rate from the first day to the last, as well as any changes throughout the entire time.  Thus, if the penalty period is 100 days, for which the rate was 6.5% in the first 25 days, 7% for the next 50 days and 7.2% for the remaining 25 days, then the average rate will need to be calculated as follows: </p><p>  (6.5 √ó 25 + 7 √ó 50 + 7.2 √ó 25) / 100 = 6.92 <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bank rates" class="if" height="288" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11926/131256.jpg" width="460"></div>

    <p>  Elements in the formula are extremely clear and logical for most members of modern society who have the ability to conduct business relationships.
