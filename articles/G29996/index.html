  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tashkent: history of origin, culture, architecture</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The huge (2.5 million people) city is located on a plain in the valley of the Chirchik River.  Now it is the largest city in the CIS.  From a bird's eye view you will see stone houses drowning in greenery.  In Tashkent, 69 green square meters per inhabitant.  The history of this city goes deep into antiquity, where the first farmers sowed barley, and from China to Europe there were kilometer caravans along the Silk Road. </p><h2>  Capital of Uzbekistan </h2><p>  Uzbekistan is a republic in Central Asia, once part of the USSR.  Mostly Uzbeks live here, but there are also Russians.  Religion of the majority of residents is Islam.  Now it is an independent state with its own characteristics.  The modern <span>territory of Uzbekistan</span> has a 10-thousand-year history!  Today, about 33 million people live in Uzbekistan.  The territory of the state is vast, but most of it is not suitable for living.  Terrain - deserts and mountains.  The country has 7 major cities, the most populated is Tashkent, the history of the state began with it. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="41.2994958" data-lng="69.24007340000003" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="10"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/3/4/9/4/3494.png"></div><h2>  Ancient Tashkent </h2><p>  The capital of Uzbekistan - Tashkent, was originally an oasis in the desert, a transit point for all travelers of the famous Silk Road.  The city grew rapidly and changed its owners.  The Chinese called him Uni, the Persians - Chach, the Arabs - Shash.  But the usual name for the city was given to the Turks in the 9th century.  The remains of ancient cities are still found on the territory of modern Tashkent.  Most of them were located in the Yun River Valley.  The history of Tashkent as a trading city made it recognizable in the East.  It was home to wealthy merchants and artisans. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The history of Tashkent from ancient times was filled with wars and conquests: </p><ul><li>  In the 14-15th centuries, the city was part of the empire of Timur.  The capital of the empire was Samarkand. </li><li>  In the 16th century, Tashkent passed to the Uzbek ruling Sheibanid dynasty. </li><li>  In 1586, the city was conquered by the Kazakhs. </li><li>  From 1557 to 1598, Tashkent was again subordinated to the Uzbek Sheibanid dynasty, the ruler of Abdul.  At this time, the first coins appear. </li><li>  From 1598 to 1604, power passed to Keldi Muhammad, who also issued his coins. </li><li>  Since 1630, the city passes to the Kazakh Khanate. </li><li>  In 1784, an independent Tashkent state was created under the leadership of Yunus Hodge.  However, after his death, the Kokand Khanate conquered this territory in 1807. </li><li>  In 1865, Tashkent passed the Russian Empire after the battle. </li></ul><h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  Tashkent became the capital of Uzbekistan only in 1930. Prior to this, the history of the city of Tashkent was associated with the tsarist regime.  The Russian Empire tried to capture all spheres of life of the settlement, up to its religious component, which caused a reasonable protest among the local population.  Already in Soviet times, Leninist ideology fell upon Tashkent. </p><p>  During World War II, many Soviet citizens, as well as factories, cinemas and entire factories, were evacuated to the city.  Soviet civilization was mixed with traditional Muslim culture.  The thousand-year history of the Asian oasis was filled with modern ideals of communism.  Tashkent lived a mixed life, and when in 1991 it became the capital of independent Uzbekistan, a new round of history began in the city. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Cultural Tashkent </h2><p>  There are many educational institutions, scientific institutions, as well as theaters, cinemas and parks in Tashkent.  Everything has been created in the city to receive a decent education and cultural pastime.  There are more than 30 higher educational institutions alone, including 7 scientific academies and 7 military institutes.  But I would like to focus on theaters, there are 12 of them. They are cultural centers, architectural monuments and have their own unique stories. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pix.uz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Academic Theater" class="if uuid-2488001" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85765/2488001.jpg"></div><ul><li>  One of the most beautiful theaters is the Bolshoi Opera and Ballet Theater named after Alisher Navoi.  It was built in 1939.  Its uniqueness is in the architectural structure.  Six halls of the theater have their own style, each of which reflects the amazing <span>culture of Uzbekistan.</span> </li><li>  Uzbek National Academic Theater.  The oldest hall, with 540 seats, was founded in 1914.  Now it is completely renovated, it has a huge dome with an image of blue sky, glass chandeliers give it a majestic and luxurious look. </li><li>  The Russian Drama Theater, created in 1934, was also reconstructed in 2001.  He acquired a more modern look with a mirrored facade. </li><li>  Drama Ilkhom is the first independent theater in Uzbekistan.  It was created as an experimental studio of Uzbek youth and is not a state project. </li></ul><h2>  Museums </h2><p>  To date, 22 museums operate in Tashkent.  Consider the most interesting of them: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  Museum of History.  The State <span>Museum of the History of Uzbekistan in Tashkent is the most interesting and oldest museum in Central Asia.</span>  <span>More than 250 thousand exhibits will tell you about the rich history of the state!</span>  <span>Here the rarest objects of architecture, numismatics, household items of the most ancient civilizations are collected.</span>  <span>The Museum of the History of Tashkent today is the largest in Uzbekistan.</span>  <span>He is often visited by guests of this wonderful country.</span> </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="yandex.kz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum of the History of Uzbekistan" class="if uuid-2488009" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85765/2488009.jpg"></div><ul><li>  State Museum of the History of the Timurids in Tashkent <span>.</span>  <span>This is a young museum opened in honor of Amir Temur, which played an important role in the development of Uzbekistan.</span>  <span>A whole era of an outstanding ruler is displayed here, the building itself is represented in the image of the eastern architecture of that time.</span> </li><li>  <span>The State Museum of Art is no less unique, starting with a magical oriental-style building.</span>  <span>Here is a huge collection of works of the Foreign East: China, Japan, India, Korea, Iran.</span>  <span>There is also a Russian hall with a unique collection of 15-20 centuries.</span> </li><li>  Museums in Tashkent will satisfy every taste.  Fans of reading will discover the wealth of Uzbek literature at the Alisher Navoi Museum of Literature.  Here are collected unique compositions of the material and spiritual culture of the people. </li><li>  The Scientific and Educational Museum of Nature of Uzbekistan will tell its visitors about the flora and fauna of the country, take you through the geographical landscapes of the republic and make you startle from the plots of hunting for a mammoth. </li><li>  Also in Tashkent there is a museum of astronomy, the armed forces, cinema, Olympic glory, a planetarium and a museum of railway equipment. </li></ul><h2>  Religious Tashkent </h2><p>  Given the thousand-year history, many cultures, a mixture of eras and powers, one cannot fail to say about the delightful religious monuments of architecture born in these historical confrontations.  The largest of them: </p><ul><li>  The Khazret Imam complex was erected in parts at different times: the Barakhan madrasah - in 1532, and the Muslim temple - in 2007. The complex can rightfully be called the visiting card of the entire Muslim world of Tashkent. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.rutraveller.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hazret Imam Complex" class="if uuid-2488007" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85765/2488007.jpg"></div><ul><li>  An equally significant architectural monument is the Sheikhantaur Complex.  Today it is a memorial complex where the remains of the great rulers of Uzbekistan rest in the mausoleums. </li><li>  In the past, the educational institution, fortress and caravanserai of Kukeldash Madrasah is now the center of culture of Tashkent. </li><li>  The modern snow-white Minor Mosque was built in 2007, fascinates with its fragility and oriental flavor.  Now it is the largest prayer hall, designed for 2400 people. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.zastavki.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Minor Mosque" class="if uuid-2488004" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85765/2488004.jpg"></div><ul><li>  In Tsarist time, the Assumption Cathedral was built in Tashkent.  The baby blue church was completely restored in the 90s. </li><li>  Catholic Church - The Cathedral of the Sacred Heart of Jesus is a historical monument.  This Gothic cathedral is very different from the fragility of eastern architecture. </li></ul><h2>  sights </h2><p>  In addition to religious architectural monuments, as well as museums and theaters, the city has unique places that are interesting to visit.  One of them is Independence Square.  In the very center of the city, on an unusual arch, the Independence Monument sparkles, surrounded by cool fountains. </p><p>  The neat square of Amir Temur is more like a giant park with fountains, monuments and green lawns. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelmastersindia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amir Temur Square" class="if uuid-2488002" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85765/2488002.jpg"></div><p>  Palace of Prince Romanov is another attraction in the heart of Tashkent.  The palace was built in the 19th century. The Art Nouveau style clearly stands out from the usual architecture of the city.  The building is surrounded by greenery, it is impossible not to notice it. </p><p>  Alisher Navoi National Park was opened in Soviet times.  At the entrance to the park you will be met by Stella with a typical blue dome, under which a monument of the same name is erected.  The park was created for cultural leisure and recreation of citizens, it can rightfully be considered a cultural attraction of the city. </p><h2>  Modern Tashkent </h2><p>  In addition to the ancient and historical structures of the tsarist, Soviet past and very early historical eras, Tashkent cannot be called ancient.  The city keeps up to date.  One of the main means of transportation is the <span>Tashkent metro.</span>  One of the most beautiful metro in the Soviet Union can rightly be called a local attraction. </p><div class="photo" data-original="metrotashkent.narod.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tashkent metro" class="if uuid-2488010" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85765/2488010.jpg"></div><p>  It is impossible to imagine a center of oriental culture without a bazaar.  Chorsu Market has gained a modern setting, while preserving the uniqueness of oriental architecture. </p><div class="photo" data-original="uzbekshop.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bazaar in Tashkent" class="if uuid-2487995" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85765/2487995.jpg"></div><p>  We have long been unable to imagine our life without a TV, and the <span>Tashkent TV tower</span> reminds us of this.  The height of the tower is 375 meters, there is an observation deck and a two-level restaurant. </p><p>  Water parks are another feature of the city.  There are more than ten of them in the city.  In modern Tashkent, it is now possible to deal with constant heat in a pleasant way. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In conclusion, I would like to say about the difficult fate of the city, which, despite everything, continues to develop and delight its citizens with green parks, restored mosques and cathedrals, restored streets.  Residents of the city will never forget about the terrible earthquake of 1966, which greatly destroyed the central part of the city, then it took 3.5 years to recover.  Also, the terrorist act was not forgotten in 1999, when 5 explosions inflicted huge damage on the city and the peace of the population.  People remember the demolitions of architectural monuments in 2009, which are now replaced by modern monuments that pay tribute to their predecessors.  For centuries, the city rose from ruins, becoming even more beautiful and interesting. </p><p>  This is a city worth visiting at least once in your life.  To know the history of Tashkent, you should come here for a long time. </p>
