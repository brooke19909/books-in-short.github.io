    <p>  But in order to provide a consumer loan with a low interest rate, the bank must be sure of the borrower.  This is risky for the lender, so strict requirements are put forward to customers.  Usually people have to collect income and seniority certificates.  A positive credit history is also needed.  The latter factor is important in assessing reliability: the financial attitude to other banks and MFIs is analyzed, and then a decision is made. </p><p>  Banks that provide loans with a negative credit history sometimes make an exception for regular borrowers whose income avoids the risk of non-payment.  Consumer loans with a low interest rate are usually offered to get payroll card users.  Only a passport is required. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Other customers need to leave a request on the site.  The decision is made faster than in the office, and the necessary documents can be provided after the application.  When choosing a bank, one should pay attention to the presence of branches in the region of the loan.  Thanks to the terminals, loan servicing is facilitated, since it will be possible to withdraw and deposit funds quickly and without commission. </p><p>  When choosing a bank, you must take into account the terms of the contract.  There should be a possibility of early repayment without fines.  Such subtleties are indicated in the contract.  The document also outlines sanctions for late payments.  In order to avoid difficulties with paying a loan, you need to pay attention to all the nuances. </p><h2>  "Alfa Bank" </h2><p>  Where is it more profitable to take a loan for consumer needs?  Acceptable conditions are offered at Alfa-Bank, which has a wide terminal network to attract many borrowers.  Loans are issued online for about 15 minutes, and after half an hour the solution will be known. </p>
