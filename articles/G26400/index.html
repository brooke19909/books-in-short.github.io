    <p>  The resort town has hotels, motels, many shops and, of course, attractions.  Here the climatic conditions suitable for rest and treatment are not only in summer, but throughout the year. </p><h2>  A bit of history: how did the popular resort form? </h2><p>  Sandanski (Bulgaria) has existed for a long time, but the city did not always bear this name.  A few hundred years ago, in its place there was a settlement Medius, founded by the ancient people - Thracians.  Then the Romans appropriated these lands, forming the city of Desudawa.  They began to ennoble the area, finding here healing mineral springs.  First, the temple of Asklepion was built, then the terms that have survived to this day gradually began to appear.  After some time, the settlement was again renamed the Holy Doctor, and after that the city began to be called Sandanski - in honor of the Bulgarian revolutionary Yana Sandansky. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Weather in Sandanski </h2><p>  The city has ideal climatic conditions.  We can say that thanks to them he became so popular as he is now. </p><p>  In Bulgaria, Sandanski is the sunniest resort, since a bright luminous person warms with its rays tourists a total of a little less than three hundred days a year.  There are no sudden changes in temperature, an excess of precipitation, lightning-fast weather changes and other natural "joys".  <span>Humidity</span> does not exceed 60%.  The average temperature is 14 degrees (throughout the year).  That is, it is neither hot nor cold: in the summer it is approximately +26 ° C, and in the winter - +3 ° C. </p><p>  More importantly, in Sandanski (Bulgaria) there are no strong winds due to the surrounding mountains.
