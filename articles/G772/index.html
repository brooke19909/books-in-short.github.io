If you want to buy a wooden house, but are limited in budget, then you need to prefer frame technology.  It provides for the possibility of self-construction of a home in a relatively short time.  When did the technology of frame housing construction come to Russia?  This happened relatively recently: in the nineties.  It gained the greatest popularity only in the central part of the country.  However, if you firmly decided that this particular technique will form the basis of the work to create your home, then it is important to familiarize yourself with its nuances and secrets.  They will allow you to create a strong and durable construction. </p><h2>  Preparation for the construction of the foundation </h2><p>  Canadian frame house building technology does not require a heavy and too deep foundation.  Before starting this work, it is necessary to level the territory.  Only after this is the marking carried out.  For a house with a width of 10 meters and a length of 15, you will need a trench with a depth of 0.75 m. It is not worth digging further for the reason that the future construction will have little weight.  Depth depends on climatic conditions, as well as the coefficient of freezing of the soil layer. </p>

    <h2>  Work on the formwork </h2><p>  If you are interested in the technology of frame housing construction, the step-by-step instructions presented in the article will allow you to understand what work needs to be done when preparing the formwork.  For example, you need a second-rate or third- <span>grade edged board, the</span> length of which can be equal to the limit of 3.4 to 6 meters.  Its thickness can vary from 20 to 25 millimeters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Prepare a square bar with a side of 50 millimeters.  As fasteners, you can use 70 mm nails.  The battle of slate and brick, as well as stones, is laid at the bottom of the trench.  The thickness of such a layer should not be more than 1/3 of the depth of the trench.  After the surface is covered with a 20-cm layer of sand and watered with water.  You should wait until the liquid is completely gone.  Then the layer is again filled with water.  These actions will help to seal the pillow, and they need to be repeated about 3-5 times.  Then you should start laying the reinforcing cage. </p><h2>  Pouring </h2><p>  Today, frame house building is very popular among a private master.  The technology of the work must be respected, otherwise, it will not be possible to achieve a positive result.  For the preparation of the mixture, cement of the M-500 brand, sand, fine gravel, and also water should be used.  Mass preparation can be carried out using a concrete mixer.  As proportions, it is necessary to use the following ratio: half a 25-kilogram bag of cement, 75 kilograms of sand, 13 liters of water, as well as 125 kilograms of gravel.  The frame technology of house building provides for the need to prepare such a volume of solution that you can develop in a certain time.  If you do not fulfill the specified condition, then the funds will be wasted.  The composition, having lain for some time, will not be unsuitable for further use. </p>

    <h2>  Wall construction </h2><p>  The frame technology of housing construction provides for the next stage of the construction of walls, which should be separated from the foundation by an insulating substrate.  It can consist of the most inexpensive and simple material - roofing material, which is neatly laid between the embedded beam and the foundation surface.  After completing these works, you can proceed to laying the foundation for the wall frame. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <span>The joining of the beam to each other</span> in this case is carried out by cutting out half the thickness of the element at its ends.  The width of the selection will correspond to the width of the beam.  To ensure the rigidity of the connection between them, a pin made of dry wood, called a nail, should be driven in.  First you need to make a hole in the place of future fastening.  Nagel must come in with effort.  This connection can be used as an angular or internal fastening of a bar to a partition. </p>

    <h2>  Base formation </h2><p>  The frame technology of house building is accompanied by the laying of the foundation for the frame, which will be equal to the height of two bars.  After the mortgage elements will be in place, in the top you need to make a cut.  Its depth should be ¬Ω timber.  The sample width should also be appropriate.  It is equal to the width that the timber used for the racks has.  The number of seats should correspond to the number of racks.  These elements will need to be installed and fixed with jibs, which are brackets connecting the two nodes of the frame. </p><p>  Once all the racks are installed, you can proceed to fasten the upper beam.  It cuts out grooves in advance, which are necessary for mounting the upper ends of the racks.  The step between them should equal the size of the grooves that are selected on the main bar.  Using the <span>building level</span> and plumb, it will be possible to analyze if there are distortions and inclinations.  Rigidity can be ensured by fixing the struts with jibs.  After that, temporary elements can be removed.  Further, the master can proceed to fix the longitudinal jumpers.  In this case, the principle of "groove in groove" should be used.  But when tightening, you need to apply construction 100-mm nails.  After all the above work, you can proceed to trim the trim boards, so that you get a solid shield.  The door and window openings should be left unfinished. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Wall insulation </h2><p>  As a thermal insulation material, organic or inorganic materials can be used.  It is permissible to use expanded clay or slag.  At the same time, you should be prepared for the fact that backfill will sag over time and the insulation level will become lower.  That is why, at the stage of the work, it is carefully rammed.  The selected material for the insulation of the walls of the frame house should have a density of not more than 600 kilograms per cubic meter.  The most effective insulation is polystyrene and mineral wool. </p><p>  If in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãresidence the average daily temperature in cold weather does not fall below -20 degrees, then expanded clay or slag can be used.  Frame technology of house building before insulation provides for the implementation of waterproofing.  It should be laid between the insulation and the outer wall.  You can use a film for this.  However, this material is not so effective.  Instead, parchment paper may be preferred.  It is cut into separate strips and fixed to the wall with the help of rails.  The material is overlapped, and for corner joints of the walls you need to make a lap of 20 centimeters. </p><h2>  Use of board materials </h2><p>  The use of bulk materials increases the complexity of the work, while slab insulation like mineral wool allows you to achieve a positive result in a much shorter time.  Mineral wool is fixed with bars, the cross section of which is 15x20 centimeters.  They are stuffed vertically.  After completion of the insulation, the internal walls of the house are hemmed with a <span>grooved board.</span>  It is located horizontally to previously fixed racks of the frame.  The inner wall, or rather, the lining, should reach the floorboards, so that when the floor is installed, they go under the wall. </p>

    <h2>  How to make ceiling overlap? </h2><p>  Frame housing construction, the technology of which is presented in the article, provides for the ceiling to be closed at the next stage.  To do this, you need bars or logs for ceiling beams.  Coniferous wood will do.  Logs should be well-dried for several months.  Prepare edged tongue-and-groove boards made of coniferous species, the thickness of which varies from 25 to 28 mm.  For racks, a beam is useful, the cross section of which is 100x80 centimeters.  In the role of fixing material, you can use <span>building brackets,</span> as well as nails, the length of which is two times the thickness of the ceiling plate used. </p><h2>  Installation of ceiling beams </h2><p>  The technology of frame housing construction has many advantages.  With your own hands, for example, to build such a house is quite simple.  When installing <span>ceiling beams</span> at the ends of the bars, you need to make a quarter sampling along the entire length.  After that, it is recommended to proceed with the installation of beams.  This must be done in such a way as to be able to navigate the first and last elements that are installed as beacons.  The correctness of their installation is checked by the building level.  Fixing the beams to the beam, which connects the frame of the house, is carried out with metal or wooden spikes.  You can use 150 mm nails or construction brackets. </p><p>  The technology of monolithic-frame housing construction was created by almost the same principles as the frame.  For the installation of the ceiling by these methods, it is best to use beams that have an integral length.  They should not have joints.  As beams, you can use 50 mm twin boards.  They are fixed among themselves by bolts or any other fixing element. </p>

    <h2>  Installation of supports </h2><p>  Considering the features of the technology of frame housing construction, you should remember that the supports will be located depending on the proposed layout.  This is required so that in the future it is possible to use them for the construction of interior partitions.  Before proceeding with the installation, markings should be made on the floor.  On it, the laying of the beam is carried out, which will become the lower base of the partition.  Grooves are made in it for connection with the uprights, in which the connecting element should be provided.  After the lower beam is fixed to the floor, you can proceed with the installation of supports.  They must be made of timber. </p><p>  The connecting element will be a construction bracket.  The advanced technology of frame-panel housing construction provides for the creation of the most durable floor structure for installing partitions.  Remember that you need to start attaching the boards to the beams from the wall.  Only in this way will it be convenient to install a screw of one board in the groove of another.  This indicates that such elements are inside the house.  Fixing the boards to the beams is done using nails.  If the thickness of the board is 30 millimeters, the length of the nail should be 60 mm. </p><h2>  Roof mounting </h2><p>  The technology of <span>frame-panel housing construction is</span> practiced today in the construction of housing quite often.  If you also decided to follow the example of many, then you need to know how the roof is installed.  The rafters are initially installed, then the insulation is laid and a crate is arranged, as well as a counter-crate.  Then the master must carry out the installation of the roofing material and complete the work by installing the finishing elements of the structure. </p>

    <h2>  Work on the rafter system </h2><p>  Rafter legs should be installed after the ceiling beams can be securely fixed.  They are also called Mauerlat.  In the role of rafters, you can use a bar, the cross section of which is 50x150 millimeters.  Size 50x200 millimeters is perfect.  To begin with, a template of rafters is prepared.  To do this, use two boards that are overlapped at right angles.  In the upper part they should be attached with a nail.  The template rises to the roof and is mounted on the Mauerlat.  The location of the boards can be adjusted.  The edges of the elements should extend beyond the wall level by 40-60 centimeters, so that after it is easier to arrange a drainage system. </p><p>  As soon as the slope of the ramps is obtained, a crossbar is nailed between the rafters.  It allows you to fix the angle.  Two pairs of rafters are assembled to the resulting template, which are installed at the edges.  The connection of the elements is carried out in half the tree with thick bolts.  On the ground, you can collect the required number of rafters, which rise up and are installed with a certain step around the perimeter.
