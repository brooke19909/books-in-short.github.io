We are talking about the Lumia 735 smartphone. This model appeared on the market of modern technology relatively recently (about a year ago).  Only since then, this particular smartphone is often advertised.  And everywhere: on the Internet, and in newspapers, and on television.  However, it is very difficult to judge what a particular phone is by using one of the commercials.  After all, there all models, even the most insignificant, are presented as magnificent smartphones with incredible qualities.  Therefore, today we will try to figure out what is really good (or bad) in Nokia Lumia 735. Reviews about this technique, in truth, have recently become extremely popular.  What are they talking about?  And are the opinions left by many buyers true on the World Wide Web? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lumia 735" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/952970.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  System and processor </h2><p>  Perhaps a pretty important indicator when choosing a smartphone is the processor and operating system on the phone.  The thing is that it depends on how powerful, fast, and convenient the navigation of the phone will be.  <span>Lumia 735,</span> like most Nokia products, is one of the pretty good options.  After all, such phones are fast, powerful and high quality. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Inside our smartphone today is a good processor.  It is 4-core, with a clock frequency of 1.2 GHz.  In truth, this is an average indicator for the phone.  However, in terms of speed, Lumia 735 is not inferior to models with a more powerful processor.  In principle, this indicator is enough for simultaneous work with the Internet, a music player, as well as several applications and games (about 10 pieces).  So you can rest assured that the Lumia 735 LTE is just what any modern user needs. </p><p>  Also, a huge advantage of the model is that the operating system there differs from the usual smartphones.  After all, it is based on Windows.  And it is called short and clear - Windows Phone.  Lumia 735 has version 8 of this operating system installed.  If you take the phone in your hands, you can see that the interface of the ‚ÄúOS‚Äù is practically no different from the computer analogue of ‚ÄúWindows 8‚Äù.  This allows the smartphone to remain multifunctional and powerful at any time. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The second important indicator that must be taken into account is the display of the smartphone.  Indeed, it is often he who is responsible for the quality of the picture, as well as for the transmitted colors on the screen.  Plus, a good display can extend the life of the phone for a long time.  Indeed, in touch smartphones, it plays an important role.  We can say the main navigation in the operating system. </p><p>  The <span>Nokia Lumia</span> 735 is equipped with a pretty good screen.  In principle, like most Nokia phones.  The transmitted colors are simply magnificent - smooth, bright and saturated.  Our smartphone supports 16 million colors.  This is a standard indicator for any new product, but nevertheless, most buyers still use phones that are not capable of such quality and variety. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia lumia 735 price" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/952971.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The diagonal of the Lumia 735 screen is also decent - 4.7 inches.  In principle, you can even call this model shallow.  After all, most smartphones are now available with a diagonal of 5 inches.  Nevertheless, this does not prevent Nokia from being a convenient telephone.  The resolution of the OLED display is also high - 1280 by 720 pixels.  It is a good option for watching high-quality films in Full-HD format.  Perhaps this is an opportunity in many modern smartphones. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  For a Lumia 735, a review usually begins with a description of the design and appearance of the device.  And, no matter how strange it may sound, this indicator plays an important role in choosing a phone.  Everyone wants to keep up to date, and also follow fashion.  Therefore, you have to look for a beautiful and original smartphone. </p><p>  Fortunately, our current model is considered quite stylish.  And, of course, bright.  The thing is that the color scheme of the Lumia 735 is diverse.  Here you can find the usual colors (white, black, gray) and original (from orange to acid pink or acid yellow).  So such a phone can always attract the attention of customers. </p><p>  In addition to the bright colors, the overall design is also tastefully selected.  A kind of minimalism (without pretentiousness and other "bells and whistles") with streamlined corners.  In truth, not everyone likes this moment.  After all, the corners of the Lumia 735 Windows smartphone can be called slightly protruding.  This is not very convenient.  Especially if you are used to carrying the phone in your pants or pants.  But, to be honest, sometimes you can make small sacrifices for the sake of acquiring a high-quality smartphone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  In addition, the Lumia 735 gets quite positive reviews about the design and the fact that this phone has the ability to change panels.  You can easily and simply create your own design - find the socket with a print or photo, replace the one already set with Nokia, and then delight the result.  Silicone options are especially appreciated - they are usually bright and beautiful.  Yes, and they can <span>protect the phone</span> from unnecessary damage. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  It is also important to pay attention to the amount of memory on the phone.  It can be of two types - operational and ordinary.  The first type is responsible for the operability of the system, and the second for the amount of information and data stored on the smartphone.  The more these indicators, the better. </p><p>  True, Nokia Lumia 735 reviews regarding RAM gets mixed.  The thing is that this model has only 1 GB of RAM.  And, as a rule, this is not enough for the modern buyer.  More popular are smartphones with 2-4 GB of RAM.  Nevertheless, even such a volume, combined with a powerful processor, makes the Lumiya 735 smartphone no worse than other, more powerful brothers. </p><p>  With ordinary memory, everything is much better.  After all, initially in Lumia 735, an overview of which is presented to our attention, includes 8 GB of free space.  True, only 7 gigabytes will be available to the buyer of them.  The rest goes to the operating system and its resources.  In principle, this is enough to start. </p><p>  Only with time, however, the moment will come when you have to feel the shortage of space.  After all, music, films, applications and games are now quite "heavy."  And so you have to think about how to expand the free space.  Memory cards come to the rescue.  Fortunately, the <span>Lumia 730/735</span> has a slot for the most popular type of additional memory - microSD.  And you can insert a card up to 128 GB into your smartphone.  This is certainly enough for many years.  And you don‚Äôt have to constantly clean the phone from unnecessary files, applications, photos and games. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  The main function of a smartphone is to keep in touch.  So, this factor greatly affects the popularity and quality of the product.  Lumia 735, the price of which pleases many consumers, to be honest, is considered a pretty good device that perfectly catches the signal even in the most remote places. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lumia 735 review" class="if" height="353" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/952973.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  But what kind of connection does this phone support?  To begin with, there is GPS and GPRS.  Also, you can easily and simply connect to a 3G network.  The quality of communication here is simply excellent.  This is easily verified - just go out of your mobile phone to the World Wide Web.  And you will notice that the 3G signal catches the Lumia 735 extremely well. </p><p>  In addition, in this model there is support for 4G-connection.  This feature is not present in all smartphones.  Nevertheless, now manufacturers are trying to release their phones with 4G support.  This type of signal is considered the fastest, highest quality and most reliable.  Just what you need to constantly stay in touch with family and friends. </p><p>  Plus, in addition to these connection types, the Lumiya 735 has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth support.  The latter, by the way, has the newest version - 4.0.  With it, you can quickly and easily transfer data from one phone to another wirelessly.  Of course, do not forget about the USB connection.  As standard, you will be provided with a cable for synchronizing equipment with your computer. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Modern smartphones are multifunctional devices.  They are able to replace the camera, alarm clock, camera and many other equipment.  But it‚Äôs quite difficult to find a really high-quality and decent phone in all respects.  Often, poor picture quality or a complete lack of a camera can inflict a huge blow on the reputation of the smartphone manufacturer. </p><p>  Fortunately, the Nokia Lumia 735 receives quite positive reviews in this regard.  The thing is that in this model there are two cameras - rear (rear) and front.  The first serves to shoot video and take pictures in the usual mode, familiar to many buyers.  But the front was made for selfie and video calls.  The quality on both cameras is not bad, but it can be better.  For example, the rear camera has 6.7 megapixels, and the front camera has 5 megapixels.  To be honest, the front camera is really very high quality.  And this fact pleases potential buyers.  Only here the normal mode is not very high quality.  No, the pictures taken on the rear camera will be very beautiful, bright and unforgettable.  Only in megapixels is this option inferior to some other gadgets.  Now you can find smartphones with a rear camera of 13 megapixels.  However, if you compare the photos taken on such a gadget, and on the Lumia 735, the difference is simply impossible to see. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lumia 735 lte" class="if" height="464" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/952974.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Among other things, in "Lumiya" there is a flash and autofocus.  This helps to make high-quality pictures, as well as shoot good clips without streaks, vagueness and other flaws.  Yes, you will not get Full-HD quality, nevertheless, you will get pretty bright and high-quality amateur videos. </p><h2>  Battery charge </h2><p>  The eternal problem of modern phones is battery life.  In smartphones, as a rule, the battery runs out quite quickly and at the wrong time.  Therefore, many buyers pay great attention to this indicator.  The longer the phone is in a state of active use, the better. </p><p>  In principle, this is correct.  Only here, far from every manufacturer can achieve such a result.  Nokia has always been famous for high-quality phones that work for a long time.  And the Nokia Lumia 735, the reviews of which we are currently studying, is no exception. </p><p>  A bit of specificity.  In standby mode, this device works for about 2 months.  But this is provided that you will not work with the phone, answer calls, use the alarm clock, and so on.  Pretty rare, isn't it?  Therefore, often buyers use a smartphone only for its intended purpose - they call and answer people.  In this case, Lumiya will work for 3 weeks.  Well, if you will be extremely active in using this device, you can only count on a week of work without recharging.  In principle, very good performance for a modern phone model.  Yes, and so versatile and powerful. </p><p>  Another feature of the Lumia 735 is its charger.  Most smartphones now have a standard charging port.  But not on our phone.  After all, Nokia Lumiya has <span>Qi wireless charging.</span>  To be honest, only Lumiya 735 has this especially.  No analogues of a wireless charger on other models of smartphones have been noticed.  In truth, it is very convenient.  Yes, and our current model is fully charged for about an hour.  And then you can reuse the phone for its intended purpose and not only. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  The price tag is another important indicator when choosing a technique.  Nobody wants to overpay for goods.  Especially if you can choose a cheaper analogue.  Only now Nokia Lumia 735 gets mixed reviews in this regard.  Some buyers claim that the model is extremely expensive and not worth the money.  And someone claims the opposite.  And this is quite normal behavior for a modern buyer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lumia 735 price" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/952975.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Nokia Lumia 735 has an average price.  This is not to say that it is extremely high or too low.  In other words, within reason.  You can find Lumiya in stores for about 14,000 rubles.  For a phone with such a range of features and capabilities, this is a normal price tag.  So do not listen to those who embellish reality.  However, sometimes it can be considered that the Nokia Lumia 735 has a slightly lower price.  Indeed, in this smartphone there are so many useful and interesting things! </p><h2>  Features and equipment </h2><p>  For example, it is worth learning about some of the non-standard features of the smartphone and the package bundle.  Indeed, it is additional functions that often attract many buyers. </p><p>  It is worth noting that Lumiya has, like in all phones, a clock and an alarm clock.  Nothing special, except for a loud ringer sound.  Also in this model there is a calendar with a daily routine and a notebook.  Also quite standard features.  In addition, the Lumia 735 smartphone has a navigator, maps, as well as the ability to control voice, compass, gyroscope, accelerometer, proximity and lighting sensor, as well as a flashlight.  Sometimes all this is very useful. </p><p>  Now a little about the configuration.  By purchasing Nokia Lumiya, the buyer receives a whole range of different accessories.  For example, in the box, you will usually find a charger, a <span>warranty card,</span> as well as instructions and a cable for connecting to a computer (USB cable).  But in addition to this set, the Lumia 735 often comes in the standard package: a cover, a phone stand, a stylus, as well as a protective film on the screen and headphones. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  What do we get in the end?  According to numerous reviews, it is now clear that the ‚ÄúNokia Lumiya 735‚Äù is a rather powerful and stylish smartphone.  Most buyers notice that this is an extremely high-quality model that is well protected from moisture and shock. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone nokia lumia 735" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/952976.jpg" width="600"></div>

In other words, if you decide to buy a Lumia 735, you can be sure that you will have a really powerful and durable phone that will last a long time. </p>
