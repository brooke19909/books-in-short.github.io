  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What can be done from new and spent cartridges</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For various reasons, sleeves can accumulate in the house, either spent (after firing), or new and unused.  Previously, they could be massively collected in quarries.  Today, they are also not difficult to get, and for some they have been lying for several years and it is even impossible to remember where they came from, but it is a pity to throw them away. </p><h2>  Ornaments made of sleeves </h2><p>  It would seem that what can be made of sleeves?  Small dense vessels, they can only be deformed with a blow.  But some individuals came up with a more original solution.  One Kiev family makes jewelry, but they are different from the rest.  All of them have elements from weapon shells in the design.  They make cufflinks for men's shirts, rings, pendants and bracelets.  In the overall composition, the sleeve may become the eye of an owl or the shell of a turtle, as well as the lens of a camera on a suspension.  Marta Romanovskaya and her husband work with both modern and old cartridges.  Use spent cartridges and those that have whole capsules.  The main place for the extraction of raw materials is landfills. </p><p>  Masters working with cartridges for creating jewelry are in Israel and the USA, but each has his own ideas, and therefore there can be no repetitions, each master has his own style. </p><h2>  A difficult hand made </h2><p>  To create products from such material, a male hand does not hurt.  There are different options for what can be made from spent cartridges and new ones, but this is not paper work.  Here you need to drill and file.  These are not products made on the machine, but always manual work.  Even if the master makes such a decoration repeatedly, it is impossible to repeat the heat and energy, so each product can be considered unique.  Mauser sleeves are unique and are not found so often, and therefore you need to carefully consider the idea to give this sleeve a second chance at life. </p><p>  Working with such small parts is quite complicated, in addition to making considerable physical efforts, it is also necessary to work with a mini-drill and many nozzles.  Sleeves need to be manually cut, and then polished almost to a mirror surface. </p><h2>  Killer beauty </h2><div class="photo" data-original="fineartamerica.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What can be done from shells" class="if uuid-3115105" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56678/3115105.jpg"></div><p>  Virginia Vivier also realized that you can make beautiful jewelry from the sleeves, original and non-standard.  But she puts in her work not only her skill and aesthetic understanding, but also something sacred.  The craftswoman creates amulets and talismans that will protect their masters from troubles.  She also selects materials for work at landfills. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wideopenspaces.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What can be done from shells" class="if uuid-3115127" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56678/3115127.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, not only exquisite jewelry is made from shells, but also a lot of other things.  It all depends only on the imagination of the master and sleight of hand. </p>
