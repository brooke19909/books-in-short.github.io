    <p>  The new Lenovo smartphone differs from the previous model primarily in design and internal filling.  Although the smartphone has become more powerful, the price remains the same, which is clearly a big plus.  The company released a flagship in three variations, which differ in the modes of SIM-cards.  The first version of Lenovo works in dual SIM mode, WCDMA + GSM, the second option in TD-CDMA + GSM mode.  The latter option works in LTE networks. </p><h2>  Specifications smartphone Lenovo K910 </h2><p>  You can find out the main parameters of the phone from the table below. </p><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  Display / Extension </td><td>  Touch, 5.5 d / 1920 x 1080, 400ppi </td></tr><tr><td>  RAM phone </td><td>  2 GB </td></tr><tr><td>  Phone internal memory </td><td>  16 GB </td></tr><tr><td>  Memory card </td><td>  Does not contain </td></tr><tr><td>  Operating system (OS) </td><td>  Android 4.3 </td></tr><tr><td>  Battery </td><td>  3050 mAh non-removable battery </td></tr><tr><td>  Dimensions / Weight </td><td>  149 x 77 x 7.9 / 147 g </td></tr><tr><td>  Additional built-in functions </td><td>  Internet 2G, 3G, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPS, camera (rear, front) </td></tr><tr><td>  Price </td><td>  From 11 000 rub. </td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  Smartphone Options </h2><p>  The package bundle of the new smartphone is no different from its predecessor, this is perhaps their only similarity.  The delivery set includes a standard set: USB cable, charger, headphones with helium pads, a scraper for removing the SIM card, and an instruction manual.  All this fits into a black box on which the name has changed to Vibe Z. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Many buyers complain about the sound quality of the stereo headset of the smartphone.  But this is not at all surprising, the company has always put more emphasis on the filling of the device.  So music lovers will have to buy an additional high-quality headset. </p>

    <h2>  Design and usability </h2><p>  The front panel is standard for Lenovo: the front camera and sensors are located on top, and three touch keys are located under the display.  The frames around the screen are a bit big, the display is not so big as to need them.  The case is assembled quite tightly, and only with a strong pressure is a slight play of the parts felt. </p><p>  The non-removable back panel is made of textured plastic, which means that the smartphone does not slip in the hands.  In the hand, the Lenovo k910 mobile phone is located very conveniently, because the body of the smartphone is small in thickness.  All shiny elements made of metal can be erased over time, so it would be wise to purchase a cover for your favorite device. </p>

    <h2>  Display </h2><p>  The Lenovo K910 smartphone has an amazing chic display.  The screen is made of third-generation glass <span>Gorilla Glass,</span> which means that it is not afraid of scratches.  Due to the fact that there is no air gap between the sensor and the IPS matrix, the colors are saturated and bright.  Even in the sunniest weather, the screen is clearly visible.  The viewing angles are just great. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On a large display (5.5 inches) it‚Äôs very convenient to watch movies and videos on YouTobe.  Speakers cope with their daily task.  The <span>Lenovo K910</span> phone has only positive <span>reviews</span> regarding the screen.  To watch video on a smartphone, you can buy a case with a small additional stand.

    <h2>  Sound </h2><p>  For three with a plus in terms of sound, the Lenovo K910 smartphone pulls.  The review showed that there‚Äôs nothing to praise him for, there aren‚Äôt enough low frequencies, and the "wheezing" at maximum volume is very noticeable.  The speaker is not clearly transmitting sounds, distortion of voices is heard, but on the other side of the wire the interlocutor hears quite well. </p><p>  The phone has a built-in radio and voice recorder.  To listen to your favorite radio stations, you will have to connect headphones, they will act as an antenna.  The recorder allows you to record conversations from the call line, but numerous reviews insist that only one side is heard, that is, your own voice is practically not recognized. </p><h2>  Software and Performance </h2><p>  Out of the box, the smartphone has the Android 4.3 operating system.  But this can be fixed both independently and with the help of specialists.  It is possible to upgrade to the latest version via the Internet.  The interface is quite familiar for the latest Lenovo models.  There is also the ability to change the interface themes to any other. </p><p>  Lenovo in its new flagship has added additional settings that are not entirely important, but in any case pleasant.  For example, a smartphone changes its own volume level if it is in your hands.  Also, multi-window mode appeared, when you click on any empty space on the screen, you can open the application or launch the folder.  The size of the windows can now be adjusted, as well as made completely transparent. </p>

    <p>  Qualcomm SnapDragon processor, copes with all the latest games.  The smartphone can compete with phones such as the LG G2, Samsung <span>Galaxy Note 3</span> and many other brands.  Tests have shown that all games have a high FPS.  Applications do not slow down actions, but rather, everything happens very smoothly and elegantly.  If you like to play, then, undoubtedly, you can look at the Lenovo K910 Vibe Z. Reviews of many owners say that with a long load of the smartphone, the battery heats up a lot.  But this is the problem of many flagships of the latest generation due to installed processors. </p><p>  Attention!  With the frequent and long work of games or gaming applications, the battery loses its quality after 1.5-2 years.  As a result, it will be discharged in half a day. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  Summing up, we can say that the smartphone turned out to be amazing in almost all respects.  The Lenovo K910 phone meets almost all the requirements for high-end devices.  Great screen with high resolution, good camera, powerful processor - and that's all in one phone.  The only drawback here, of course, is the battery.  But it is enough for the daily operation of the smartphone. </p><p>  The phone is quite light and thin and will suit even the female half of humanity.  The price tag is impressive, in stores you can buy starting from 11 000 rubles.  Of course, those who use online stores will be cheaper to order from them. </p><p>  The reviews of the owners of the K910 smartphone showed that the phone has been improved, and at the same time not as bright as its predecessor.  Many people think that plastic instead of aluminum looks beautiful, but not interesting, since the edges can peel off.  Also, the lack of a memory card slot affected fans of K 900 series smartphones. </p><p>  However, despite criticism, the Lenovo K910 phone has taken a leading position in sales in the Russian market.  And many are happy to replace the old Lenovo model with a new one. </p>
