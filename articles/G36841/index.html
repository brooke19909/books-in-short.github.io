    <h2>  <span>IPhone does not turn on.</span>  What to do first? </h2><p>  So, you took out your iPhone and found that it was turned off.  All attempts to turn it on have failed.  Then I suggest you the following: </p><ul><li>  Inspect your gadget for physical damage.  After all, perhaps in <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why iPhone doesn‚Äôt turn on" class="if" height="456" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15299/326210.jpg" width="600"></div>  them lies the reason.  If there are none, move on. </li><li>  Pay attention to weather conditions.  After all, if the phone has been in frost or heat for quite a while, then it can automatically turn off.  If so, then let it cool / warm up a bit and it will work again. </li><li>  Try charging the device.  After all, most often the iPhone does not turn on after discharge. </li><li>  If the phone doesn‚Äôt react at all to the fact that you connected it to the network, <span>do not worry!</span>  Allow it to stand on charge for at least 30 minutes.  Most likely, he will come to life.  This happens when the phone has been without recharging for a long time, or the battery has overheated.  It may also happen that the charger is out of order.  This is the most common problem, because in this case the phone does not react to anything at all.  Try changing the failed s / y to working. </li></ul><p>  These were the most common reasons why the iPhone does not turn on.  And if the above methods did not solve the problem?  And your iPhone still doesn‚Äôt turn on.  What to do next? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Other reasons </h2><p>  It may also happen that when you connect to the network, your gadget will be safely charged, but you will not be able to turn it on.  This may indicate that: </p><ul><li>  The on / off button is out of order.  In this case, a trip to the service center to you <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone does not turn on after discharging" class="if" height="346" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15299/326211.jpg" width="520"></div>  will help.  Having replaced the button, specialists will quickly solve this problem. </li><li>  There is an error in the firmware.  In order to find out whether this is so, press two buttons at the same time: Power and Home - and hold them until the bullseye appears on the display.  But look do not overdo it!  If you press these two buttons at the same time for more than 30 seconds, then your device may go into reboot mode.  So, if the bullseye appeared, the phone booted, then the problem can be considered resolved.  Use your gadget further. </li><li>  The problem is with the hardware, that is, the battery, board, etc. are out of order. In this case, available methods and tools will not help you.  Bring your iPhone to a service center, only there they can repair it. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  As you can see, most often the reasons why the iPhone does not turn on are not so scary.  In most cases, you can solve them yourself.  But I hope that your gadget will never let you down and will always work like a clock.  But even if you encounter a problem when the iPhone does not turn on, what to do, you will already know thanks to this article. </p>
