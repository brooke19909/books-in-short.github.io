Residents of the region like to come to its shores in order to get closer to nature, relax from the bustle of the city and gain energy.  Here you can spend several busy hours, or you can rent a small house at the recreation center and spend several unforgettable days. </p><h2>  Where is located </h2><p>  Lake Torbeevo is located in the Sergiev Posad district near the Yaroslavl highway.  The lake is separated by a distance of 6 km from Sergiev Posad.  Many residents of the city regularly come to rest on this pond. </p><h2>  Description of the lake </h2><p>  Among the low hills is Lake Torbeevo.  Previously, there was a small pond in its place, but after a dam was established on the Wondige River, this was a great place to relax.  A shallow lake stretches from the northwest to the southeast and its area is 1.5 km <sup>2</sup> .  At the same time, the coastline stretched almost seven kilometers.  As already mentioned, the lake is shallow, only 5 meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lake Torbeevo" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1091874.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In summer, the surface of the water warms up well, but the bottom is cool.  Most likely, this phenomenon is associated with submarine keys. </p><p>  The lake is picturesque because it is surrounded by hills, on which a noble forest rises.  There are <span>reed thickets</span> on the shore <span>,</span> but for people there are good sandy beaches that were made artificially. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Rest on a reservoir </h2><p>  On the shore there is a well-organized children's camp.  Hikes are held here, visits to monuments located in the city, and a good rest is provided, which is possible on Torbeevo (lake). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Torbeevo Lake recreation center" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1091875.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The recreation center includes equipped beaches with sunbeds, trestle beds, cottages, <span>summer cafes.</span>  On the shore you can rent a boat or a catamaran.  Also popular here are volleyball, tennis, badminton, soccer, basketball.  There is an opportunity to ride a buggy.  If desired, vacationers book a sauna and stay overnight at the base.  To get to the equipped beach, a small fee is required. </p><h2>  Where to go for a walk </h2><p>  If you came to Lake Torbeevo for a few days, you will definitely want to walk around its surroundings.  If you go in the direction of p.  Wondigi, after 6 km near the village of Vlydzhnevo, you can see <span>the Gremyachiy</span> Klyuch <span>waterfall</span> .  And on the other side opposite this cascade is a wooden temple.  You can also go to the hills that are visible from the shores of the lake.  In these forests you can pick up delicious berries and edible mushrooms. </p><h2>  Fishing on the lake </h2>

Also for this purpose, you can specially come to Lake Torbeevo.  Many people enjoy fishing in these waters, as large crucian carp live here.  Although the entire territory is private property, lovers of sitting with a fishing rod are loyal.  Some catch carp, especially if you go to a small bay and use a donka for fishing.  You can catch both from the shore and from the boat.  Also in the lake live undergrowth, ruff, roach, pike, perch.  In these waters, fishermen come to ‚Äúhunt‚Äù not only in summer but also in winter.

    <h2>  Local fishing reviews </h2><p>  In past years, there really were a lot of fishermen, but recently they are becoming less and less.  Increasingly, they choose other bodies of water for their leisure.  But why has everything changed? </p><p>  According to the reviews of fishermen, it becomes obvious that every year the lake more and more overgrows with aquatic vegetation.  Also, the pond is gradually becoming smaller, because of this fishing from the shore is not available in all places.  To stay with at least some catch, you must use a boat.  In addition, mostly crucian carp is found.  The predator comes across very rarely. </p><p>  Also recently, the coast is filled with vacationers and recreation facilities.  And in the vicinity there are fishing farms that set up their nets.  For these reasons, most fishermen look for more suitable ponds for their leisure time. </p>
