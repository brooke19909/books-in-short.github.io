    <h2>  Equipment for weaving a cover </h2><p>  Keep in mind that for such a serious matter as weaving, first of all, you need to stock up on great patience.  After all, this will take some time - the result will not appear instantly.  After all, weaving a case on the phone from rubber bands is a rather laborious task.  First of all, for its creation it is necessary to determine the pattern and method of weaving.  Then get those same rainbow rubber bands - the basis of our cover.  There should be a lot of them - at least a thousand pieces.  In addition to irises, you will need directly the weaving scheme itself, drawn on a sheet of paper (it will be easier to cross out what has already been done with it), and, of course, the device itself for creating a masterpiece.  You won‚Äôt make such a thing on your fingers, so you will need to take care of the presence of a special machine or hook.  Of course, you can try to weave <span>a phone case</span> from rubber bands on a slingshot, but it will be just a waste of time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  How to weave a rubber phone case </h2><p>  There are quite a variety of ways to weave products from Rainbow Looms - it all depends on the complexity of the product and the skill (respectively, and age) of the artist.  But if we talk about a rubber phone case, then there are only two affordable and convenient ways to weave. </p><ol><li>  <em>On the machine</em> .  This method, of course, gives a wider range for the flight of fantasy, since it allows you to more interestingly vary both the available pattern and shape.  A lot of schemes that can be brought to life, and a huge number of patterns will please you. </li><li>  <em>Crochet</em> .  Here, of course, there will be fewer options, but if you have enough skill, you can create an amazingly beautiful phone case made of rubber bands. </li></ol>

    <h2>  We make the product on the machine </h2><p>  Having a set of rubber bands, a machine tool and a little patience, you can do an exclusive thing.  A phone case made of rubber bands on the machine is easy to do.  On the columns of the machine (the upper and lower row) is put on each under the eraser eight.  The main task is to ensure that the output is a kind of letter X, occupying the entire perimeter of the machine.  The amplitude of weaving is this - the first lower column and the second upper braid around the first iris.  The next clings to the second lower peg and is hung on the first upper.  Then everything is simple - not twisted elastic bands are put on the corresponding pairs of pegs in the bottom row. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Repeat the same for the top row.  By means of a hook the lower elastic bands are pulled together to the middle.  Then all actions are duplicated in accordance with the required length of the cover.  Do not forget about the technical holes - they are made simply with the help of passes.  To complete the weaving, all loops are removed on the first row - and then on the iris, which is then tightened. </p><p>  This is a completely general scheme, if you wish, you can always dilute it with some of your personal know-how - for example, use various color variations of elastic bands, weave patterns and ornaments, even letters can be woven - in short, use everything your imagination allows you to do. </p>

    <h2>  Crochet rubber phone case </h2><p>  Of course, at first glance, it might seem that weaving a phone case with rubber bands using a hook is much harder and longer.  In fact, this is absolutely not the case - both methods have their own charms and conveniences.  For weaving with a hook, it is necessary to acquire directly the very tool of labor - a hook.  Further, everything is simple - weaving is a "chain" method.  At the same time, keep in mind that the chain link is about 1 cm, so it‚Äôs easy to calculate exactly how long the product is needed for you and how many elastic bands it will take. </p><p>  To get started, take the first gum, fold it with an eight and put it on a hook - that‚Äôs the first loop.  Next, take the next one and thread through the double loop - four loops are already obtained.  The extreme two loops all the time stretch through new irises and return back to the hook.  Thus, we get the whole cover - elegant and beautiful. </p>

    <h2>  Open case </h2><p>  In order to weave an interesting phone case from rubber bands, you do not need to have any unusual knowledge.  It‚Äôs enough to have a machine at hand.  Do not try to <span>knit a phone case</span> from rubber bands on forks - this will take an insane amount of time and does not guarantee a good result, because after all, a phone case is not a bracelet at all. </p><p>  If you don‚Äôt like that your phone is closed all the time, you can weave a case with an open screen.  This will not require anything new - a machine (preferably double) and rubber bands. </p><p>  The beginning is fairly standard - eights are stacked on the columns.  Then, on every second pair of pegs it is put on with an elastic band.  Do not forget to leave a distance for the screen.  After that, irises are put on each column around the perimeter (already a different color).  Erasers from eights from below rise up and are reset.  Then again, rubber bands are put on the perimeter - and everything repeats.  That, in fact, is all wisdom. </p>

    <h2>  A small bonus - accessories </h2><p>  The most standard case can always be distinguished from other similar products with the help of accessories.  A variety of patterns is excellent and bright, but the product will look much brighter, for example, with a bright flower made of elastic bands.  In order to do it, you will not need so much time and gum.  About 15 gum will be used for this product.  Weaving itself occurs with the help of a slingshot, since the flower will be quite small. </p><p>  On one horn of a fork the elastic band in three rows is wound.  Then two irises are put on both horns, and the triple elastic band is removed from underneath to the center of the double.  Then the <span>double gum</span> is removed on the opposite horn.  Everything is repeated five times.  Thus, on one of the horns of the fork, five double elastic bands are obtained with an inner row of triple wound ones.  After that, another iris is put on both horns, and all the elastic bands are removed from its center in its center.  The result was an elastic band on the horns, and in the middle of the flower.  The end of the connecting gum extends, threading through the other.  All that remains is to spread the petals - and the flower is ready.  It can be put on the cover during weaving - and you will get a wonderful accessory. </p><p>  In the same way, you can decorate your future rubber phone case with various stars, figures - everything you want to stand out from. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  As you can see, it‚Äôs quite easy to figure out how to weave a phone case from rubber bands.  In the presence of patience, desire and a small fraction of imagination, something will surely turn out that will distinguish you in the crowd of the same gadget users.  At the same time, the phone model or its sophistication does not matter - with such a cover made by yourself, you will always be at the very peak of fashion trends and, importantly, you will never merge with the crowd.  Such an exclusive thing will only be with you and no one else. </p><p>  Of course, the cover is far from the only thing that can be created from these wonderful Rainbow Loom.  Bracelets, rings, toys, key rings are a great opportunity to express yourself in creativity, and not just yourself.  Children will be happy to join you in this useful fun, and you will have fun and productive time together.  After all, beauty is a terrible force! </p>
