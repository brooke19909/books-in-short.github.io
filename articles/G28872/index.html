  <section class="page js-page"><h1>On-board computer - an indispensable assistant on the road!</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>Scientific and technological progress</span> never stands still: constantly there are some electronic innovations that are firmly in our everyday life.  These developments include the on-board computer.  Now we will try to figure out what it is, and also why it is needed. </p><h2>  First look <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="On-board computer" class="if" height="430" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17427/316757.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  An on-board computer can be compared to a home PC, which helps you perform complex tasks.  It looks like a liquid crystal screen, the size of which you can choose for yourself.  The first on-board computer appeared back in 1981, when it was launched for BMW car models.  Then, in Europe, many motorists began to put on their "iron horses" such high-tech innovations, the price of which, it is worth noting, not weak beat afford.  In our country, these devices have gained popularity relatively recently - at the beginning of the XXI century, and now many drivers use them, because an on-board computer is really a necessary thing. </p><h2>  Functionality <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Trip computer price" class="if" height="358" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17427/316862.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  After we familiarized ourselves with the appearance of the on-board computer, we can proceed to its functions.  The technological novelty was primarily intended to combine a wide range of capabilities in one device, and the developers quite successfully achieved their goal: the on-board computer perfectly replaces the navigator, parking sensors and DVD.  The device has access to the World Wide Web, which allows you to constantly keep your finger on the pulse of events.  In addition, you will be able to quickly assess the condition of the car: monitor oil pressure, fuel level, etc.  You will also be notified immediately if there is any breakdown in the vehicle.  Simply put, an on-board computer is the brain of a car that can control all the components of the car - air conditioning, radio, etc. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Types </h2><p>  Now there are various modifications of on-board computers, since there are a lot of companies that produce them.  But there are only two types: those that are installed only under one model of the car, and those that are universal.  Connecting an on-board computer, which is universal, is simpler than one that was specially made for a particular model, because you only need to update the software, after which the installation of an automobile "brain" can already follow.  However, specialized BCs look more attractive in the sense that they ideally sit in the “native” nest. </p><h2>  Summary <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="On-board computer connection" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17427/316864.jpg" width="323"></div></h2><p>  For you, a technological invention such as an on-board computer will become a real helper and friend on the road.  The price of such an invention varies depending on the manufacturer and its capabilities (it starts from three thousand rubles), but the functionality and comfort that will be provided to you will fully pay off the money spent, because you do not have to buy various devices that the on-board computer combines: navigator, DVD and much more, as these devices will be replaced with just one fully.  I wish you a successful shopping! </p>
