This is explained by the fact that, regardless of the economic situation in the country, the relevance in obtaining loans always exists.  Someone draws them up in order to make a purchase, someone needs money to pay off debts, and so on - this is not so important. </p><p>  And as part of the writing of this article, it is worth noting that in the field of lending, the main subjects, it would seem, are: the creditor (bank) and the debtor (person borrowing funds).  Nevertheless, ordinary citizens often complain that in their relationship ‚Äúmeets‚Äù another element.  We are talking about collection companies, which have their own interest in civil law lending. </p>

    <h2>  Who are the collectors? </h2><p>  You have probably heard this term and, most likely, you know what they are doing.  Perhaps some of you also have experience interacting with these people, and you know how the representatives of the collection agency behave, what they achieve, what leverage they use. </p><p>  In short, such a company is engaged in the repayment of debts (debt repayment) purchased from banking institutions.  In those situations where the debt is not repaid in a simple way, the creditor may transfer the right to demand the return of previously issued funds to collectors who, from a legal point of view, become a creditor.  And then it‚Äôs the turn of such an agency to use all its means to force the client to fulfill obligations. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For the reason that such companies often use immoral, unethical, even illegal means from their arsenal, carrying out psychological, and sometimes moral pressure on the debtor, not the most favorable rumors are circulating among the people. </p><p>  In this article we will talk about how one of the representatives of this market works.  We are talking about "Creditexpress Finance" LLC.  Feedback from customers and employees, descriptions on the official website and other information from the Web will allow us to make as accurate a picture of what this agency really is and how it conducts its activities. </p>

    <h2>  About company </h2><p>  To begin with, CreditExpress Finance (collection agency, Moscow), whose reviews are numerous, is one of the market leaders in debt collection.  Of course, it is absolutely impossible to say this with certainty, since we did not compile any ratings and did not make comparisons of the services of this entity with other companies conducting the same kind of activity.  However, as indicated on the website, the agency was founded in 1999.  Over these 17 years, it has managed to build a fairly solid reputation for itself, interacting with large banking institutions and companies issuing loans.  As stated here, the main goal of its partners - the search for effective solutions to repay debts - is fully implemented by the agency.  Moreover, it relies solely on administrative influence, without resorting to other forms. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  With regard to the geography of the company, then, according to the same information on the website, Creditexpress Finance LLC (Moscow), reviews of which we will provide later on, conducts its work in 10 European countries.  Due to this, we can safely say that the company has rich experience in performing such tasks.  Of course, it also includes the Russian sphere of their business - repayment of debts from domestic borrowers. </p><h2>  Mission </h2><p>  It is also important to clarify what mission the organization "Credit Express Finance".  The collection agency (Moscow), of which we are interested in reviews, sets as its main goal to receive refunds on previously issued loans as efficiently as possible, simply and efficiently.  The agency achieves this result exclusively through administrative pressure on the debtor.  At the same time, what some of the reviews of borrowers describing Creditexpress Finance LLC do not agree with, the company does not work through illegal means of influence, fully respecting the rights of the people with whom the recovery is carried out, and ensuring the protection of their rights and interests.  It is also said here that the company maintains the confidentiality of all transactions by not disclosing information about the credit and currency relations of its partners with debtors. </p>

    <h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  In terms of partnership, the agency has a number of key advantages that are described on their official website.  Of course, this, as we have already emphasized, is a rich experience.  Since the Creditex Finance Agency (collection agency, Moscow) reviews indicate that the company has been operating outside of Russia in 10 more countries for 17 years, it is not difficult to conclude that there are a large number of clients who have come here for collection services.  This information is confirmed by the number 3000 - the interests of so many customers were defended by the company, seeking a loan return. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  At the same time, the regional factor should be taken into account: in order to work in so many countries, it is necessary to take into account the specifics and understand the preferences of people.  It also, to some extent, characterizes the agency on a positive side.  The long term of activity, the mass of customers and the branched structure make it possible to think that the customer reviews describing the activities of the Credit Express Finance agency are positive, recommendatory in nature.  Indeed, otherwise, these collectors simply would not have been able to attract so many partners for cooperation.  Here, as they say, the numbers testify to themselves. </p>

    <h2>  Services </h2><p>  So what exactly will help Kreditexpress Finance (collection agency, Moscow)?  We could not find customer reviews on the activities of this company, and there is nothing surprising in this.  After all, she is engaged in servicing banks and large centers for issuing loans, and for such organizations it is not common practice to leave feedback on the Internet.  All the information that can be found regarding the practice of the company "Credit Express Finance" (feedback on what the company is) is written directly by the debtors, who are served by the agency.  Of course, they note other points in their experience of interacting with representatives of this company, so we will talk about this later.  A separate section of our article will be devoted to this. </p><p>  And regarding the services that the agency provides, they are described on the corresponding page of the official website.  Here the list indicates such areas as loan servicing (the company seeks repayment of debts as soon as possible, increasing the percentage of repaid loans);  debt monitoring (the agency ‚Äúmonitors‚Äù the property status of borrowers in order to understand their ability to repay funds as quickly as possible over a long period, up to 10 years);  purchase of bad debts (assignment of the right to demand a return from borrowers). </p><p>  The company conducts all this with the help of individually designed levers of influence on the debtor.  About it - further. </p>

    <h2>  The mechanisms </h2><p>  First of all, they include: the impact on the debtor, conducting explanatory consultations with him regarding his obligations.  This includes, for example, developing ways to pay off debts and familiarizing a person with such a return plan, informational assistance. </p><p>  Also, in the course of working with a partner, Credit Express Finance (reviews would confirm this) carries out a number of activities regarding the formation of the policy and strategy of the creditor itself.  For example, these may be: analysis of all issued loans, monitoring the policies of such a company, advice on what measures should be taken in a particular situation.  That is, in practice, we see that the company uses a set of various tools and mechanisms that help to achieve the desired result.  The number of partners of the company suggests that this approach is quite effective. </p><h2>  Debtors reviews </h2><p>  The efficiency of the work of collectors can be judged by the statistics of their customers, the number of partners working with the company, and market behavior.  However, the ways in which debts are returned (if you do not take into account the above information taken from the official website) are best understood if you read reviews describing the company.  There are a lot of such people on the Web: people describe what form and why the representatives of this company turned to them and talk about their personal experiences.  Naturally, for someone it is positive (if loan officers really helped to efficiently settle debts), and for someone it is not quite (if the debtor does not want to return the money). </p><p>  Therefore, of course, and comments on the activities of the company can be found completely different.  They depend on the specific situation in which their author found himself. </p><p>  Of course, the most negative comments are written by those to whom the collection agency requested to repay the debt.  Therefore, there is nothing surprising in how much negativity about the company users leave on various sites. </p>

    <h2>  Work in the agency </h2><p>  But what will the <span>reviews of</span> employees tell us about Creditexpress <span>Finance</span> LLC <span>(Moscow)</span> ?  First of all, I would like to note that, if you believe the information from the description on the official website, collectors operate in 10 countries - and this is a large number of offices and many employees involved in various fields of activity.  However, in Russia we only know about three addresses of the company's location - these are Moscow, Astrakhan and Krasnodar.  There is no data on in which other countries the agency operates. </p><p>  As for the Russian representative offices, information on open vacancies is available on the official website in the corresponding ‚Äúcareer‚Äù section.  This includes such positions as a contact center operator, a debt recovery specialist, and a lawyer.  On the same page, you can read in more detail the requirements and functions of each employee in these positions. </p><h2>  Jobs and requirements </h2><p>  So, the job of a specialist in debt recovery is to convince the debtor to return the funds borrowed by him.  The <span>reviews of</span> employees describing Credit Express <span>Finance (Moscow)</span> call this work rather problematic due to its specificity.  The task is clear - you need to communicate with the borrower, telling him the ways by which he can quickly return the funds to the bank.  As indicated on the site, such activity is paid as a percentage of how much the company will receive from the debtor.  Of course, such a person should be able to competently and convincingly conduct a conversation, know the psychological subtleties of interacting with different people, be able to work with a PC and have a special education. </p><p>  Another vacancy is the contact center operator.  The function of such an employee is also to communicate with customers about the return of their debt, but this is done by outgoing ringing.  The purpose of it (as described by Credit Express Finance staff reviews) is not only to advise debtors, but also to remind them of the due dates.  In fact, both described vacancies have one goal, but employees use different approaches. </p><p>  The third position is a junior lawyer.  This is a person who works with pre-trial settlement of the conflict.  In fact, he also communicates with the debtor, referring to the legislation and using legal norms to explain to a person his rights and obligations.  It describes in detail the state of affairs of the borrower, offers different ways out of the current situation with accumulated debt.  In this matter, instructions for it are provided by Creditexpress Finance (Moscow).  The feedback from our employees about the agency that we found confirms that all of the company's activities are aimed at recovering debts serviced or acquired by this company.  From this follows the entire structure of the activities of the agency ‚ÄúCredit Express Finance‚Äù. </p><h2>  Collection Agency: Employee Reviews </h2><p>  The Internet presents a lot of information from those who have already managed to work for the benefit of this company.  There is nothing surprising in this - such a large-scale structure as this agency should have an extensive network of posts, a large staff of people, and diverse specialists.  All of them, working with the company or leaving for another place of work, leave feedback on specialized Internet sites.  We find and bring them to you for a broader understanding of the organization. </p>

    <p>  The reviews of Credit Express Finance (collection agency) of those who managed to work here are both negative and positive.  As a rule, employees complain for various reasons.  Negative recommendations often arise due to personal relationships and some minor troubles in the team.  It should be noted that this happens at any job, so there is nothing to be surprised at. </p><p>  They praise the experience that was obtained during the service in the ranks of the collectors of this institution and recommend that they do the same to test their own abilities.  As a result, one can grow here both professionally and as a person, if one has sufficient aspiration and desire. </p><p>  Critics of Credit Express Finance (collection agency) reviews of employees negatively note perhaps the very scope of the organization: lending and debt recovery.  It is difficult to work in this segment. </p><p>  It is not surprising that very often employees have to deal with careless borrowers who behave, to put it mildly, inadequately.  As noted by user comments, you really need to have nerves of steel in order to sometimes communicate with the most ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù cases in banking practice.  But then again, this is all an experience that is so priceless.  Especially if you settle here at the very beginning of your career. </p><p>  The workers here are apparently in demand: often vacancies are open in a constant mode, very rarely their complete absence on the site.  It‚Äôs hard to say what this trick is connected with, perhaps the company is operating too dynamically, expanding its structure and opening new organizational centers. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  The company ‚ÄúCredit Express Finance‚Äù can be confidently called a serious player in the market.  On the one hand, she has a fairly large experience in the domestic market.  Given its availability, it can be argued about a certain basis for employees, their training "on the spot".  Because of this, the company can safely be called an ‚Äúideal textbook‚Äù for young professionals planning to conduct their activities in the field of banking and finance. </p><p>  As for negative comments, they should be guided by a single, universal rule.  Since the company has been successfully operating in the market for a long time and does not experience financial difficulties, continuing its growth, it can be considered more successful than what the reviews write about.  Therefore, it is not worth it to believe all written information so easily.  In this case, you should take a look at the facts.  They will say much more. </p>
