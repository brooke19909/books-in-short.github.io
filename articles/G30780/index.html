The promenade is one of the main attractions. </p><h2>  Ancient Anapa and its embankment </h2><p>  The history of this city is inseparable from the development of the Black Sea.  Anapa, Naberezhnaya Street in particular, preserves the thousand-year history of this sunny place.  The first settlement on the territory of present Anapa is the Greek settlement of Sind, dated to the 7th century <span>BC.</span>  From the 4th century BC until the 3rd century AD, this territory under the name Gorgippia began to belong to the Bosporus kingdom. </p>

    <p>  Then comes a period of several centuries, when there was no permanent population on the coastal line of modern Anapa - only nomadic tribes.  By the 8th century, a supposedly Adyghe or Circassian nationality settled here, which gave the place the name Anapa - "the edge of the table", by the similarity of the ledge in the rock to the table.  There is a version that the name of the city is Abkhazian and means "a place near the mouth of the river." </p><h2>  The formation of the resort </h2><p>  The territory near the Black Sea is Anapa, the embankment line of which was ruled by Italians-Genoese, then Turks for several centuries, and in the 17th century began to be developed by the Russian Empire.  Under the terms of the Adrianople Peace Treaty, Anapa became Russian in 1829.  By the middle of the 19th century, Anapa acquired the status of a port city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãAnapa began to be considered by the end of the 19th century, after outstanding observations by the doctor V. A. Budzinsky and the discovery of a mud bath by him.  His merit is the development of mineral springs and the construction of the sanatorium "Radiant".  For over a hundred years, Anapa has been considered a resort where people come not only to enjoy the wonderful beaches and the gentle sun, but also use the services of balneotherapy. </p><h2>  Embankment of Anapa </h2><p>  The central <span>embankment of Anapa</span> is the longest street of the city, running along the <span>Black Sea.</span>  <span>The coastline of the</span> city ‚Äã‚Äãis several kilometers long.  The main promenade area begins at the Marine Station.  Anapa port carries passengers and cargo all year round throughout the Azov-Black Sea coast.  There are border, customs and migration controls at the port.  The embankment ends when the Anapka River flows into the Black Sea.  This place is of particular value.  Here Anapa floodplains are located - this is a unique creation of nature, which is an estuary overgrown with reed and cattail.  The historical value of the mouth of the Anapka River lies in the fact that floodplains formed at the place where the harbor was located in the ancient period. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Anapa embankment and tourism </h2><p>  In the summer season, additional flights, bus and train routes are introduced to Anapa from other cities of the country.  For example, the route Naberezhnye Chelny - Anapa is one of the most popular.  About four million tourists from all over Russia and not only visit such a resort city as Anapa.  The embankment, modern, two-story, is a favorite place for walking and entertainment. </p>

    <p>  The long sandy beaches run in parallel, so in the summer season there is a large concentration of tourists who are received by the sunny city of Anapa.  The embankment (photos and videos of the resort is impressive) was created taking into account the preferences of residents and tourists.  For the convenience of city guests, a quality service is organized on the waterfront: restaurants, cafes, dance floors, hotels, spa salons, souvenir shops and more. </p><p>  Tourists are attracted by numerous attractions located on this street.  Anapa, the embankment, the photo of which is unthinkable without the image of the city symbols on them, delight visitors with funny places. </p>

    <p>  Near the mouth of the Anapka River, where the entrance to the Central Beach is located, there is a monument to the Vacationer.  This is one of the symbols of the city, which is a tanning tourist with a white hat on his torso (this is another symbol of the resort).  In Anapa, there is a White Hat monument in the <span>Central Park of the</span> 30th anniversary of the Victory. </p><h2>  Embankment and History </h2><p>  Naberezhnaya Street attracts tourists with places related to the history of the city and its inhabitants.  Here is a monument to Mother Mary, erected to the centenary of the birth of the Anapanka Elizabeth Yurievna Skobtsova (Pilenko) - the holy Martyr Mary.  In the world, Elizaveta Yurievna was engaged in social activities, literature.  In exile in France in her life comes a tragic period.  Her daughter Nastya is dying.  After this tragedy, Elizaveta Yurievna takes monastic tonsure and becomes known as mother Mary.  Upon returning to Russia, her second daughter dies.  During the Second World War, mother Maria helped those in need, was part of the anti-fascist Resistance movement, survived the death of her son, and was killed in a gas chamber.  In 2004, Mary was counted among the saints. </p><p>  Walking along the coastline, you can not pass by the ancient open air museum of Gorgippia.  The museum is a dig of an ancient settlement, which stood on the spot where the modern resort Anapa is located.  The embankment has preserved the thousand-year history of this settlement.  Excavations prove that Gorgippia was a highly developed city.  Here, trade was in full swing, wine was produced, fish was processed, in a word, it was a prosperous side.  Gorgippia is the only <span>open-air museum</span> in Russia <span>.</span> </p><p>  The Russian gate is another place transferring to the past.  The remnants of the Turkish fortifications erected during the Russo-Turkish War began to be so named in memory of the Russian wars that had fallen and stormed the fortress. </p><h2>  Coastline and parks </h2><p>  Tourists who prefer walking in the shade of trees are invited to visit the parks and squares of the city.  Having received the necessary portion of sunshine, you can plunge into the coolness of the Central Park of the 30th anniversary of the Victory.  Various attractions, a Ferris wheel, a stage, live music, a cafe, various vegetation - all this pleases tourists for many years.  More quiet places are squares - Central and Glory. </p>
