  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Knitting poncho: how and why</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the year there are periods when the weather changes dramatically during the day, and leaving the house in the morning, it is very difficult to understand what to wear, because at that time the temperature can be very low, but by noon it will rise almost to the summer mark.  First of all, it is, of course, about spring.  In such insidious weather, you will either have to wear an unnecessary jacket with you all day, or freeze in the morning in a light windbreaker.  Unfortunately, few people recall such a wonderful option as a poncho.  Nevertheless, it was invented by South American Indians precisely in connection with such features of the mountain climate.  Of course, modern ponchos differ from Native American ones - they are lighter, smaller, more convenient, and only the basic principle connects them with the prototype - the absence of sleeves and a cutout for the head.  Due to their shape, they protect against wind in cold weather and allow you to feel comfortable in warm weather.  But the poncho can be not only warm, but also openwork, having a purely decorative character. </p><p>  There are several options for how to make a poncho.  The most common way is to <span>crochet</span> or <span>knit a poncho</span> .  Knitting a poncho is the easiest.  As a rule, it is chosen if a warm product is needed.  It can be multi-colored, with braids, bumps or openwork pattern.  Typically, such a poncho is decorated with fringe or tassels, performed in ethnic style and most of all resembles a prototype.  The simplest option is a poncho of two rectangles, and even a beginner can master it.  Also, with the help of knitting needles, a whole poncho can be knitted, from the neck, with a gradual increase in the number of loops.  It's a little harder, but also pretty easy.  Crocheting a poncho is somewhat more complicated, although it may seem easier to someone, since crocheting is still faster.  As a rule, these are openwork models for summer or simply decorative, even evening ones.  Using a hook you can create incredibly beautiful products. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Knitted poncho can be long and warm - often such products are equipped with a hood.  It is rather an option for outerwear.  There is also the option of short warm ponchos - they are used as a cape or scarf and often have a warm collar.  Also, knitting a poncho can imply the creation of light flying silhouettes, rather to give the image a romanticism, rather than for some practical purposes - basically, of course, this is crocheting a poncho.  Such a product can serve as just a cloak, as well as a top and even a dress if worn under the belt.  Such a dress is very unusual and beautiful: it helps to hide the imperfections of the figure and emphasize the advantages, and the uneven hem of the hem will visually make the <span>legs longer.</span>  This option is also possible with trousers; jeans are usually preferred.  In general, any poncho and jeans are the perfect combination.  It refers us to the era of the 60s - this is a classic <span>of the hippie style,</span> recently very relevant. </p><p>  Knitting a poncho is a very fun and usually uncomplicated process.  Many who just want to learn how to knit can start to master the skill with a poncho.  Why start with a scarf, which later may not be useful, when you can tie a stylish, relevant and practical thing, which certainly will not gather dust in the closet for years?  For experienced craftswomen there will also be interesting, complex models, knitting which can take many evenings, but in the end you will get a thing of fabulous beauty.  The selection of poncho models is truly huge.  By the way, ponchos are not only feminine - it can be very appropriate for a child, because sometimes the weather is warm, but windy, which is especially dangerous, and the poncho will be an ideal solution: it will not let the baby sweat, but protect it from the wind.  Recently, men's fashion has turned to this element of the wardrobe: initially it was men's clothing, and now the stronger sex is gradually returning to this. </p>
