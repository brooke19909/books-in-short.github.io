There are many models from different manufacturers that attract with their price and supposedly excellent characteristics, but in reality, alas, not everything is always so rosy.  Samsung has been manufacturing not only smartphones, but also tablets, which are very popular for a long time.  In today's article, we will talk about the very best Samsung tablets, which you should definitely pay attention to when buying this type of equipment.  It will be interesting! </p><h2>  Introduction </h2><p>  Before moving on to considering tablets, I would like to make a small digression.  The fact is that Samsung has a fairly large lineup of tablets, and for completely natural reasons, even half of it cannot be fit into this article.  We will choose only a few of the most affordable options at different prices, which are 100% recommended for purchase. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.popularelectronics.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab A SM-T285 tablet" class="if uuid-2659421" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2659421.jpg"></div><p>  The basic requirements for tablets are quite simple: more than 1 GB of RAM, the presence of LTE (4G), a capacious battery and an Android version of at least 5, since tablets on Android 4.4 ... are already outdated and lack most of the useful and necessary functions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Well, let's finally move on to our rating and consider which Samsung tablets are the best and what is interesting about them.  Go. </p><h2>  Samsung Galaxy Tab A SM-T285 </h2><p>  Opens the rating model called Galaxy Tab A SM-T285.  This tablet is an entry-level device, but despite this, it has quite good characteristics, and it meets the requirements described earlier.  Actually, this is perhaps the best Samsung <span>tablet model</span> in the budget segment, which is definitely worth paying attention to.  Let's take a closer look. </p><h2>  Description and specifications </h2><p>  The tablet looks very interesting, but at the same time it is standard for Samsung.  The case is completely made of plastic.  The back cover has an interesting texture in the form of small squares.  The build quality of the tablet is excellent, without any squeaks, punching and play. </p><p>  On the left side of the device is a slot for a SIM card, on the right - a volume rocker and a power button.  At the bottom there is a hole for the microphone, and at the top there is a headphone jack and a port for a charger. </p><div class="photo" data-original="welectronics.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab A SM-T285 tablet review" class="if uuid-2659422" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2659422.jpg"></div><p>  On the back there is an external speaker and a camera lens, without flash.  The front part is almost completely given over to the display.  Above the screen is the earpiece, front camera and sensors.  Below, traditionally for Samsung, there are 2 touch keys and one mechanical Home button. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The screen has a diagonal of 7 inches.  The type of matrix here is IPS, resolution 1280x800.  The pixel density of 216ppi, which is not very much, but for HD-resolution is enough.  Nevertheless, if you look closely, you can notice a slight pixelation. </p><p>  The quality of the transmitted picture on the screen is not bad, but the imagination is not amazing.  The colors are bright, saturated, but the contrast is a little lacking.  The margin of brightness of the screen is also small, in the sun the image fades greatly and it is difficult to consider it.  Viewing angles are very good, but slight inclinations of colors are noticeable when tilted.  In general, the display can be rated 4 with a minus. </p><p>  Now it‚Äôs worth going through the specifications of one of the best Samsung tablets - SM-T285.  As a processor, a 4-core Spreadtrum SC9830A with a clock frequency of 1.3 GHz is installed here.  Also on sale there is a version with a <span>Snapdragon 410 processor,</span> but it is very rare.  The video accelerator here is from Mali, model 400MP2.  The amount of RAM 1.5 GB, internal memory 8 GB, there is support for memory cards.  The device runs on the Android 5.1 operating system.  As a proprietary shell installed TouchWiz. </p><p>  If we talk about performance, then the tablet of stars from the sky is not enough, but it works very smartly.  Slowdowns in the interface are extremely rare, but basically everything works very quickly and smoothly.  The RAM here is at least 1.5 GB, but this is enough for an entry-level device. </p><p>  As for games, most of the "titles" go without any problems.  Even the same tanks can be launched, however, at low settings. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="androidxda.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab A SM-T285" class="if uuid-2659423" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2659423.jpg"></div><p>  The cameras have a resolution of 5 and 2 megapixels.  The front-facing camera is suitable only for video calls, you can‚Äôt do a selfie with it.  The main camera also does not shine, for the most part here it is for show. </p><p>  Communication standards The tablet supports everything: GSM, 2G, 3G, 4G.  Wireless technology is also in full order - Bluetooth, GPS and Wi-fi in place. </p><p>  The battery on the tablet costs 4000 mAh.  From a full charge, the device is able to work for about a day in an average load.  With more active use, charging will be required later in the evening. </p><p>  Together, in all its characteristics and capabilities, the SM-T285 can be safely called the best Samsung tablet in the low price segment. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Reviews of this model show that the Galaxy Tab A SM-T285 tablet is a very good, high-quality and balanced device.  By cons, users mainly attribute a weak margin of brightness on the street, poor cameras, a small amount of internal memory, a quiet sound from an external speaker and a long charging time. </p><h2>  Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 SM-T825 LTE </h2><p>  The next in the list of best tablets is Samsung Galaxy Tab S3, model SM-T825 LTE.  This is a more expensive device than the previous one, you can even say that this is the flagship model of the company.  It has everything you need: excellent features, a chic screen, cameras that you can really shoot, a capacious battery and much, much more. </p><h2>  Description and characteristics of the model </h2><p>  The design of the tablet is excellent.  The device looks exactly the same as befits a flagship.  The frame of the case is made of metal, and the back is covered with Gorilla Glass 5. Honestly, glass is not the best material for the tablet, and for the phone too.  Glass gets very dirty, it is easy to break when the device falls, it can slip out of wet hands, etc. </p><p>  On the top of the tablet are 2 speakers.  At the bottom there are also 2 speakers, a Type C connector for charging and a 3.5 mm headphone jack.  On the left side of the device there are contacts for the docking station and other additional accessories, for example, a keyboard cover.  On the right side of the tablet there are 2 microphone holes, a power / lock button, a volume rocker and a SIM card slot. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.sabkura.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 SM-T825 LTE Tablet Review" class="if uuid-2659435" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2659435.jpg"></div><p>  The back side is practically empty.  All that is here is the main camera lens and flash.  On the front side, in addition to the display, there is a front camera, sensors, an event indicator, two touch buttons and one mechanical Home key, in which a fingerprint scanner is built-in. </p><p>  The display on the tablet has a diagonal of 9.7 inches, a resolution of 2048x1536 and a pixel density of 264 ppi.  In general, with such a diagonal and resolution, the density could be higher, but the benefit of pixelation is not visible under any conditions.  The matrix of the Super Amoled tablet, which, in general, is not surprising, since Samsung really loves this type of matrix. </p><p>  The color rendition of the screen is simply gorgeous.  All colors look bright, rich and rich.  The viewing angles are maximum, there is no distortion during tilting.  There is a margin of brightness, in the sun the display remains fully readable.  Also in the settings there is the possibility of fine-tuning the image quality and several ready-made presets.  If you generally evaluate the screen - then this is perhaps the best offer on the market. </p><p>  Now consider the characteristics of one of the best Samsung tablets - SM-T825 LTE.  The device is running a Snapdragon 820 processor. The clock frequency is 2.15 GHz, the number of cores is 4. The RAM is installed 4 GB, internal memory 32 GB, there is support for memory cards.  As for the video accelerator, the top-end Adreno 530 is installed here. The version of the Android 7.1 operating system is followed by an update. </p><p>  There are no complaints about the speed of the tablet.  The interface is very smooth, transitions are fast, without twitching or delays.  Applications and games also launch quite quickly.  By the way, about the games.  Thanks to a powerful processor and a very high-quality video accelerator, the device copes with all modern ‚Äútitles‚Äù without any problems, and at maximum settings.  Drawdowns of frames or brakes are not observed. </p><p>  A set of wireless interfaces is standard: Wi-fi, Bluetooth, GPS.  The tablet works without problems with GSM, 2G, 3G and 4G networks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.techadvisor.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="specifications of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 SM-T825 LTE tablet" class="if uuid-2659436" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2659436.jpg"></div><p>  The tablet has two cameras installed: a front camera of 5 megapixels and the main one of 13 megapixels.  The quality of the cameras is quite good, as for tablets, and you can really take pictures of them.  Of course, a masterpiece will not work, but it will be possible to make a perfectly suitable photo. </p><p>  The battery on the tablet has a capacity of 6000 mAh.  A full charge with an average activity of use is enough for a day or a little more.  If you use the device to the full, then recharging will be required after only 7 or 8 hours. </p><p>  Thus, the SM-T825 LTE can be safely called one of the best Samsung Galaxy tablets, not only in its lineup, but in the entire market as a whole.  There are not so many direct competitors for this model.  Only iPad can compete, but it costs much more. </p><h2>  User reviews </h2><p>  Reviews of this model show that the tablet turned out really cool and truly flagship.  Here are excellent speakers, which are already 4 pieces, good cameras, cool hardware, the latest version of Android with subsequent updates, an excellent Super Amoled screen, a capacious battery and much more. </p><p>  The only drawbacks of users are the price, only 32 GB of internal memory and the glass back of the case.  Well, it is also worth noting that the cover on the tablet can not be found everywhere. </p><h2>  Samsung Galaxy Tab A SM-T580 </h2><p>  Another very good and definitely one of the best Samsung tablets with a 10-inch screen is the Galaxy Tab A SM-T580.  This is a middle class device, which for its price offers quite a good ‚Äústuffing‚Äù and meets almost all of our requirements, described at the very beginning.  Consider it. </p><h2>  Description and characteristics of the tablet </h2><p>  The tablet case is made of plastic, and very high quality.  There are also no complaints about the assembly, all parts are very tightly fitted to each other and do not creak. </p><p>  On the right side are a slot for a memory card, a power button and a volume rocker.  At the upper end are the headphone jack, microphone and charging jack.  At the bottom there are only two speakers.  The left sidewall is empty at all. </p><p>  On the back is a camera lens with flash.  In front, in addition to the screen, there are three control buttons (2 touch and one mechanical), a front camera and several sensors. </p><p>  The screen on the tablet has a diagonal of 10 inches, a resolution of 1920x1200 and a pixel density of 224 ppi.  The matrix is ‚Äã‚ÄãIPS.  The picture quality is very good, the colors are bright, saturated, with the correct color rendition.  The stock of brightness is decent, in the sun the display is fully readable.  There is no problem with contrast either.  Of course, the display does not reach the flagship model, but in its class it is one of the best. </p><p>  Now let's go through the characteristics of one of the best Samsung tablets. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab A SM-T580 Tablet Review" class="if uuid-2659448" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2659448.jpg"></div><p>  The processor is branded here - Exynos 7870 with 8 cores.  The clock speed of the CPU is 1600 MHz.  The video accelerator in the tablet from Mali - T830.  The amount of RAM is 2 GB, and the internal memory is only 16 GB.  The operating system of the tablet is Android 6. Updates to version 7 and above are not planned. </p><p>  The device works smartly, smoothly, without brakes and braking.  Sometimes, of course, there are small "friezes", but they are rare.  As for the games, then everything is a little worse.  You can play all the popular and modern ‚Äútitles‚Äù on the device, but in some cases the graphics settings will have to be set to medium or low. </p><p>  Nothing special to say about cameras.  The resolution of the front camera is 2 megapixels, and the main camera has 8 megapixels.  The quality of the pictures is very mediocre, like all tablets, although there are just a lot of modes for shooting. </p><p>  Wireless interfaces are all in place: Wi-Fi, bluetooth, GPS.  But the tablet does not have a GSM module, and therefore the use of 3G and 4G is impossible.  This is the only point on which the device does not pass according to our requirements. </p><div class="photo" data-original="homeshopping.pk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab A SM-T580 specifications" class="if uuid-2659450" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2659450.jpg"></div><p>  The battery on the tablet is 7300 mAh.  A full charge lasts about a day and a half with an average load.  If you use the device more actively, then in the evening the device will have to be charged. </p><p>  In general, here the situation is completely similar to the very first device in today's list.  By the combination of capabilities and characteristics, the Galaxy Tab A SM-T580 is the best Samsung tablet in its class.  It has everything: a high-quality screen, good hardware, excellent performance and speed, a capacious battery that demonstrates good autonomy, etc. The only drawback is the lack of a GSM module, but the benefit is Wi-fi, which means not everything is so bad.  In addition, the GSM module does a good job of planting a battery. </p><h2>  Model reviews </h2><p>  Reviews of the best Samsung tablet - Galaxy Tab A SM-T580 - show that the device for its money has everything that a modern user needs: a large and high-quality screen, nice design, good features and more.  The disadvantages of this model, many users include poor cameras, the lack of a SIM card slot, which is why the tablet does not have 3G and 4G, a little heavy weight and a lot of pre-installed unnecessary applications that are not deleted.  The rest is a great device for the money. </p><h2>  Samsung Galaxy Tab A SM-T585 </h2><p>  Well, the last on today's list of the best Samsung tablets is the 10-inch Galaxy Tab A SM-T585 tablet.  In fact, this is an improved version of the previous device, which collected all the same characteristics, but with one addition - there is a slot for a SIM card.  And although both tablets are almost identical, there are still minor differences between them. </p><h2>  Description and Specifications of SM-T585 </h2><p>  There is no point in stopping in appearance, since the T585 is the same T580.  The only thing that should be mentioned is on the right side, next to the memory card slot, there is also a nano-SIM slot. </p><p>  Technical specifications here are also, in general, identical: Exynos 7870, 8 cores, 2 GB of RAM, 16 GB of internal memory, Mali-T830 video accelerator.  Version "Android" 6.0.  The device works as fast as the T580 model. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.easycallphone.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet Samsung Galaxy Tab A SM-T585" class="if uuid-2659467" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2659467.jpg"></div><p>  The screen also retains all the same characteristics, that is, a resolution of 1920x1200, a 10-inch diagonal, etc. But the paradox is that on this version the image quality is slightly better than on the T580.  The difference is almost imperceptible, but it is.  Perhaps just different batches of displays are installed. </p><p>  It makes no sense to talk about cameras, they are the same "none" as the T580.  But as for the wireless modules, a GSM module has been added to the common piggy bank, which supports working with 2G, 3G and 4G, and in all the popular ‚Äúbands‚Äù - B7 and B20. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tabletowo.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab A SM-T585 Tablet Review" class="if uuid-2659469" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2659469.jpg"></div><p>  Small changes have affected autonomy.  While maintaining the battery capacity of 7300 mAh, the T585 "lives" on a full charge slightly less - the presence of a GSM module affects.  Nevertheless, with an average activity of use, it is quite possible to extend 1 day of work.  If you use it to the maximum, you will need to recharge in the evening. </p><h2>  Tablet Reviews </h2><p>  Reviews about this tablet are mostly positive, which is not surprising.  Users praise all the same features that the owners of the regular version, T580, like: high-quality screen, good features, speed, performance, autonomy, loud sound, as well as work in 3G and 4G networks, etc. </p><p>  The disadvantages include mediocre cameras, the weight of the device, the proximity of the touch keys, and that‚Äôs all, in fact. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, which is the best Samsung Galaxy Tab tablet to choose from today?  Well, here everyone has to decide for themselves, since each of the devices is very interesting and has both its pros and cons.  If you need a high-quality and inexpensive tablet, then the Galaxy Tab A SM-T285 will be an obvious choice.  If you need better specifications and more features, but you don‚Äôt have to pay too much, then you should look towards the Galaxy Tab A SM-T580 and T585. </p><p>  And finally, if you need a flagship device, which is enough for the next 6-8 years, then the Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 SM-T825 LTE would be an ideal choice. </p>
