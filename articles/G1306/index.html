    <p>  You can fall in love with the <span>Nokia X7</span> only by looking at it once.  The appearance of the phone is surprisingly bright and unusual.  The body of the device is monolithic, and, given the assembly of the manufacturer, no creaks and gaps will arise.  An interesting solution was the use of not only plastic, but also aluminum.  The combination of materials created an amazing harmony. </p><p>  Although the <span>Nokia X7</span> smartphone weighs pretty well, as much as 146 grams, this does not cause problems.  The manufacturer has visually reduced large dimensions by rounded edges.  Do not forget that there is metal in the case. </p><p>  External elements came out quite interesting.  The front side has got a display, control button, sensors, speakers and is completely covered with tempered glass.  This solution gave good protection against scratches and prints. </p><p>  The back side got the company logo and main camera.  The corners of the smartphone are ribbed, and two speakers are hidden behind them.  The left side panel became a "haven" for a SIM card and flash drive, and the right side for a camera button and volume control.  At the bottom of the device is a microphone, and on top is a USB jack and a headphone jack. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The design of the device has not only a style, but also a piece of solidity.  The manufacturer has always been distinguished by interesting solutions, and on the X7 it is noticeable.  The only problem is speaker placement.  When working with the device, the user partially covers the speakers. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  On the front part sheltered a four-inch screen.  The small display of the Nokia X7 received only 640 by 360 pixels.  This is definitely not enough for a good image, but the manufacturer has found a way to get out. </p><p>  They equipped the device with an AMOLED matrix, unfortunately, only the name is common with Samsung technology.  The matrix definitely does not reach the creation of Korean masters.  However, it is enough for a bright and saturated image. </p><p>  The disadvantage of <span>Nokia X7</span> was the inability to independently adjust the brightness.  The device automatically adjusts it.  Also in sunlight, the device noticeably loses in terms of brightness. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The device received only eight megapixels.  An interesting feature of the camera was the use of EDOF technology, which allows objects at close range to obtain the necessary sharpness.  Naturally, there is a drawback.  Items that are closer than half a meter are obtained in the picture unsuccessfully.  The photos taken by Nokia X7 do not differ in special quality. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hardware </h2>

    <p>  The device is definitely cheated by performance.  The smartphone received an ARM11 processor with a small frequency of 680 GHz.  This is clearly not enough for the device on Android, but enough for the Symbian platform. </p><p>  There are also problems with the memory in the device.  The company installed only 256 MB of RAM.  Native memory is much larger, a whole gigabyte.  This is definitely the weakest point of the device.  The only good thing is the expandability to 32 GB flash drive. </p><p>  The smartphone has become the pioneer of the Symbian Anna system.  This is the first representative working on this platform. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  Stylish, although not very productive device X7 will cost about 4.5 thousand rubles.  For the same price, you can choose a more powerful device on Android.  Naturally, if you buy a device for the image, this model will be a great choice. </p><h2>  Disassembly </h2><p>  The monolithic case puts the owner in a delicate position if you want to replace some part.  The answer to the question of how to disassemble the Nokia X7 is pretty simple. </p><p>  First you need to remove the covers by unscrewing the screws.  Then we disconnect the top plate and unscrew the screws.  After this, it is necessary to unfasten the sensor cable.  On both sides of the apparatus, we pull out the rods, and then pry off and remove the front part. </p><p>  We turn off the display and disconnect the screen lock.  After that, the screen is removed, the card trays are removed and the screws are loosened.  This allows you to remove the remaining panels.  Now the owner got to the battery and the system board.  By disconnecting the last loop, the user can remove the chip. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  The main advantage is the appearance of the Nokia X7 00. Reviews report a high durability of the device, the quality of its materials and high protection.  The design is very unusual and very many owners liked it. </p><p>  Low cost - also attractive quality.  Perhaps now it will be problematic to find a device, but it is definitely worth the money. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2>

    <p>  Users are unhappy with the low performance.  The "stuffing" copes with everyday tasks with a bang, but sometimes braking occurs. </p><p>  The system does not cause enthusiasm.  Using Symbian is completely irrelevant due to the lack of many necessary programs on it. </p><p>  Image quality also leaves much to be desired.  A good diagonal of the device is corrupted by low resolution.  Depressing and the behavior of the apparatus in the sun. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  Released in 2011, the X7 even now looks interesting.  For users who put the appearance of the device in the first place, this is a good choice.  Although the "filling" and the system are irrelevant, for most tasks they will be enough. </p>
