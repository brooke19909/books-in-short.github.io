Comparison of a projector and a TV</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  You can argue for a long time which is better: a TV or a projector.  However, at the same time, many do not quite understand the essence of these two things, or they themselves have not tried both devices, but are fixated on only one.  In this case, the time has come to learn more about the fundamental differences between the two devices.  Then it will be possible to understand whether to use a projector instead of a TV or not. </p><h2>  TV </h2><p>  The TV appeared relatively recently - in 1929, the creator of the time was the American company Western Television, its cost was slightly less than $ 100.  The image was such that it was necessary to use lenses.  Without lenses, the picture was a rectangle the size of a matchbox.  The clarity and quality were terrible.  In 1934, mass production of televisions was established in Germany.  The cost of equipment then amounted to $ 445 per diagonal of 30 centimeters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.philips.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="4K Smart Led TV" class="if uuid-2564019" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93890/2564019.jpg"></div><p>  And after a long time, in 1974, an infrared remote control appeared.  In the 1980s, consoles and computers came into fashion, and now the TV still played the role of a monitor.  Plasma panels and LCD televisions appeared in the 2000s.  Kinescope models have sunk into oblivion. </p><p>  A modern television is a television receiver of image and sound television signals, displays the image on the screen and provides sound through the speakers.  Receives signals using an antenna or playback device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.digit.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Xiaomi TV" class="if uuid-2564017" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93890/2564017.jpg"></div><p>  It features a built-in tuner for receiving high-frequency signals, converts the signals into an image and sound suitable for the viewer. </p><p>  TV content: </p><ul><li>  Power Supply; </li><li>  radio; </li><li>  sound amplifier path with loudspeakers, video amplifier, scanner, deflecting system and picture tube. </li></ul><h2>  Types of TVs </h2><p>  By function: </p><ul><li>  Smart  Internet access, media player and browser. </li><li>  3D  Do not support the Internet.  They have only volumetric image technology. </li><li>  Universal.  The symbiosis of Smart models and 3D TVs. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.cnet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Apple TV 4K" class="if uuid-2564022" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93890/2564022.jpg"></div><p>  Depending on the received signal: </p><ul><li>  Analogue  React to interference, lossy quality. </li><li>  Digital  Better quality, transmission is via cable or satellite broadcasting. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.crutchfield.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung Curved TV" class="if uuid-2564014" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93890/2564014.jpg"></div><p>  Appearance: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  CRTs - cathode ray tube televisions.  Relate to analog technology.  At the moment, morally and technically outdated.  They have a convex shape (but there are also flat ones) that distort the picture. </li><li>  Projection - project a picture onto a matte display.  Provide excellent sound quality and a large supply of diagonal.  RPTV technology consists of a projector, screen, sound system and control panel. </li><li>  Flat panel. </li><li>  Curved. </li><li>  With a changing screen. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="variety.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Program Guide" class="if uuid-2564016" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93890/2564016.jpg"></div><p>  Flat panels are divided into three types: </p><ul><li>  Liquid crystal or railway.  These are LCD TVs, where the picture consists of millions of pixels, while liquid crystals transmit light from the lamps.  Low power consumption, good color rendering.  Service life - from 50 to 100 thousand hours. </li><li>  Plasma  A screen of cells that are filled with gases.  Current creates voltage, and the cell begins to glow.  Greater power consumption with a larger diagonal and lower brightness.  Service life - 100 thousand hours. </li><li>  OLED  Technology originates in 2012.  The matrix, consisting of diodes, transmits black color well, has better brightness and contrast due to the independent emission of light by diodes.  They are very expensive.  The main companies producing such televisions are Samsung and LG.  Service life - 10 thousand hours. </li></ul><h2>  Projector </h2><p>  Many are interested in the question: is it possible to use a projector instead of a TV?  The first projection device appeared in the 17-18th centuries.  In the 19th century, the Lumiere brothers created a kinetoscope.  They are especially common in establishments such as a movie theater and at home for watching tapes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="720P LED LCD PROJECTOR" class="if uuid-2564026" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93890/2564026.jpg"></div><p>  Starting from the naming "magic lantern" and ending with multimedia projectors, and in addition there are DLP projectors from InFocus and LSD, we can see a clear and colorful picture.  You can also connect another device to it to output images through the <span>projector.</span>  <span>A projector</span> is an optical device that displays images on flat objects. </p><h2>  Projector Types </h2><ul><li>  Overhead projectors, or slide options - they were used when it was necessary to display a static picture, such as a presentation. </li><li>  Bishops - for displaying opaque projects such as books, magazines and photographs, as well as three-dimensional models. </li><li>  Kodoskopy - with their help it is possible to examine special transparent films. </li><li>  <span>Multimedia projectors</span> - project an image on a large screen.  Have a good picture, suitable for everything. </li><li>  Pocket. </li><li>  Ultra-portable. </li><li>  Portable. </li><li>  Stationary </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="miroirusa.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Smart HD Mini Projector" class="if uuid-2564030" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93890/2564030.jpg"></div><p>  A projector instead of a TV is suitable for those who like pocket projectors. </p><h2>  Features and disadvantages of the TV </h2><p>  Positive points: </p><ol><li>  Habit and confidence in technology, ease of use. </li><li>  The lineup is constantly being improved. </li><li>  New technologies are being introduced for a clearer broadcast. </li><li>  A wide range of prices, a variety of models. </li><li>  Stable picture quality in any light, brightness, contrast, color. </li><li>  Always ready to go. </li><li>  All in one.  Like smart TV and the Internet, a large number of ports for external additional devices. </li><li>  The TV mount on the wall is quite simple. </li></ol><p>  Minuses: </p><ol><li>  Bulky.  The TV lacks mobility.  Of course, you can take a small TV, but this is of little use. </li><li>  Three-dimensional image is found only in some models, and the standard image is only in 2D-format. </li><li>  The size of the image depends on the diagonal of the screen and cannot be changed up or down. </li><li>  Higher diagonal - higher cost model.  If you compare the projector and the TV with the need for a diagonal of more than 2 meters, then the price will be significant. </li><li>  Long viewing adversely affects vision due to the eye's focus on the radiation source, and not on the reflected light. </li></ol><h2>  Features and disadvantages of projectors </h2><p>  Firstly, they differ in image output technology.  Only three technologies: </p><ol><li>  DLP - is a leader in the ratio of image quality, color rendering and price.  But when buying inexpensive models with one chip, the picture quality is much worse.  Artifacts may appear: on the edges of the "rainbow". </li><li>  LCD - uses a liquid crystal matrix with a lens system.  Reproduce a high-quality image.  The price corresponds to the quality, but does not reach the DLP. </li><li>  LCoS is a hybrid of DLP and LCD.  They are expensive, but they can compete with modern TVs for a place in your apartment. </li><li>  CRT - very high image quality and a long service guarantee.  However, there are drawbacks, including a weak stream of light.  Difficult to mount, very expensive. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.richersounds.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Epson EHTW5600" class="if uuid-2564024" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93890/2564024.jpg"></div><p>  Benefits: </p><ol><li>  Choosing the optimal image size without loss of clarity. </li><li>  Almost minimal eye strain. </li><li>  Sufficient mobility. </li><li>  Takes up little space. </li><li>  Cheaper. </li><li>  Improving technologies that lead to better quality and lower prices. </li></ol><p>  There are some problems if you want to buy a projector instead of a TV, but do not forget about the pros. </p><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ol><li>  You need to adjust a certain level of lighting.  Otherwise there will be a sharp decrease in contrast. </li><li>  Watching TV shows in the dark is not for everyone. </li><li>  If the video turned out to be of poor quality, then all the flaws are visible. </li><li>  Need a projection screen or a plain white wall, a <span>large screen</span> for the projector. </li><li>  Additional purchase of speakers and other components as necessary. </li><li>  Replacement of lamps. </li></ol><h2>  TV installation </h2><p>  TV installation methods: </p><ol><li>  Hang on the wall.  <span>The TV mount to the wall is</span> carried out using the bracket, you can position it as you like. </li><li>  Place on stand. </li><li>  Embed in a wall or decor. </li></ol><h2>  Projector Installation </h2><ol><li>  Find a flat surface or buy a projection screen. </li><li>  Buy speakers to make sound. </li><li>  Put the projector so that the image suits you, but usually you need a few meters, so you have to provide ten meters to the wall. </li><li>  Hang the projector from the ceiling.  Thus, it will be in a conditionally fixed place, not to interfere with the inhabitants of the house and enter the ceiling, if equipped with a moving structure. </li></ol><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  We compared the projector and the TV.  The TV is really more familiar and easier to install, and the projector is more suitable for moviegoers who will have to download or buy a Blu-ray disc, otherwise the quality will not be as chic as it should be.  Do not forget about the technical <span>specifications of the projector.</span>  Which projector to choose for a home instead of a TV?  It should be using DLP technology, look at the degree of image enlargement to precisely fit the screen. </p>
