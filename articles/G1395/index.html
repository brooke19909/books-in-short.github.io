Masters especially like to make do-it-yourself roses from ribbons using satin, crepe and nylon strips of fabric.  There are many ways to make them, and completely different.  Some flowers are collected from separate petals, others are sewn from long strips.  To work on small parts, use thread or candle fire.  It is interesting to complete the task of folding the tape in a certain way. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider in detail how to create do-it-yourself ribbon roses for beginners.  The photographs presented will help to better understand the way the crafts are made, from which elements it was sewn into a single whole.  Detailed step-by-step explanations will make it possible to cope with the manufacture of a beautiful flower independently and without errors. </p><p>  Before you start working on any kind of ribbon roses with your own hands, prepare the material.  Consider the size of the craft, where it will be located - either on the fabric, or in the form of a brooch on clothes, a wall panel or a flower on the stem for setting in a vase.  Depending on the chosen option, the width of the tape, the quality of the fabric, thread and needle are selected, if necessary, a candle or a lighter may be needed to melt the edges.  If the craft will be sewn with threads, then select them in accordance with the color of the tape.  If the flower is going to glue, it is more convenient to use hot melt adhesive.  If you decide to make a brooch, then you need a basis for attaching the finished product.  Usually, for this purpose, a felt sheet of a given shade and a metal fastener are purchased.  You can decorate a flower by attaching a small bug, such as a ladybug, on one of the petals, it is interesting to glue a shiny pebble. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Little roses </h2><p>  With your own hands, you can create a small flower from the ribbons by bending the fabric.  This is a simple task that even a student can handle.  The photo below shows a step-by-step master class for manufacturing this version of the craft.  The tape is not wide.  Start work from the middle of the segment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="simple rose" class="if uuid-3105861" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3105861.jpg"></div><p>  They turn one part to the other at a right angle, then the bends do it from one side, then from the other side alternately.  When 10 to 12 bends are laid out in a stack, the rose is collected by tightening.  To do this, hold one edge of the tape with your fingers and pull it to the other until it stops.  Both ends are tied with a strong knot.  It turns out a small rose, which has many identical petals.  Bottom, you can attach green leaves and sew it on the main fabric of clothing. </p><h2>  Combined crafts </h2><p>  Lush roses with their own hands from ribbons can be assembled by combining different manufacturing methods in one craft.  In our sample, the flower is made for decoration on an elastic band for hair.  A circle is cut out of pink felt, the size of which should be smaller than the flower so that the fabric is not visible from below.  A satin or crepe ribbon is laid on it with loops. </p><p>  You can cut short segments and collect them with a needle with a thread in the center, or you can collect the lower opposite petals from one segment.  It is desirable to melt the edges of the fabric so that the threads do not split.  The shiny front of the tape is located on the outside, pay attention to this when folding the hinges on the base. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="krasa-zdorovie.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lush rose in a combined way" class="if uuid-3105834" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3105834.jpg"></div><p>  This method draws all the lower parts.  The central part of the flower is performed by folding the tape alternately at an angle.  The bud is wound around the middle of the rose towards the edge.  From below, this element is restrained by stitches in the center so that the workpiece does not fall apart.  It remains only to sew the two parts together and attach the finished flower to the elastic.  You can complement the rose with leaves of green satin ribbon. </p><h2>  Assembling a flower from pieces of tape </h2><p>  Let's look at how to make roses from ribbons with your own hands from individual parts.  To form a central bud, cut a length of 10 cm, bend one corner of the strip to the opposite side, as shown in the photo above.  Then wrap the remaining fabric in a bud and grab the bottom with stitches.  Then the painstaking work on the preparation of each petal.  The cuts are cut in different sizes, the farther from the center of the rose, the longer they should be. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="step by step photo making roses" class="if uuid-3105857" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3105857.jpg"></div><p>  The step-by-step photograph shows how to lay the fabric of each element.  You can fix the petal with pins, but it‚Äôs safer to make a couple of stitches.  The last step is to put all the details of the craft together.  Petals are shifted so that all elements are clearly visible and do not overlap one another. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  A plain rose looks beautiful, but you can collect it from pieces of different shades.  At the end, add 2 or 3 leaflets and a thin green satin ribbon for beauty. </p><h2>  Using candle fire </h2><p>  The next option for making do-it-yourself ribbon roses is using a candle.  Fire is needed to melt the edges of each petal, it, firstly, prevents the threads from crumbling and spoiling the crafts, and secondly, adds naturalness to the edges, creating beautiful wavy bends. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="candle petals" class="if uuid-3105877" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3105877.jpg"></div><p>  Before work, cut the tape into different sized circles.  The inner petals are created small, and the extreme ones are large.  Each row is made up of elements of the same size.  The flower is collected either with hot glue, or with a needle and thread, selected in the same shade as the ribbon fabric.  Parts are placed, starting from the central bud, with a shift by half of the petal.  A rose made in this way is unusually airy and light. </p><h2>  The easiest and fastest option </h2><p>  Do-it-yourself roses from satin ribbons with a few hand movements. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hand-woven rose" class="if uuid-3105866" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3105866.jpg"></div><p>  This quick method consists of three operations: </p><ol><li>  It is necessary to wind several layers of tape on the palm of your hand.  Set the edge aside so that it stands out from the background of other turns. </li><li>  The end of the tape is pushed under all layers and a tight knot is tied, pulling all the turns together. </li><li>  It remains only to distribute all the loops alternately to the left and right side and beautifully bend the edges of the ribbon to make rose petals.  The last turn of fabric remains in the center. </li></ol><h2>  Rose from frill </h2><p>  To create such a delicate ribbon rose with your own hands, select a chiffon or nylon thin fabric.  Prepare a long strip of tape and, on one side, sew two stitches at a small distance from each other (approximately 0.5 cm).  Moreover, the fabric must be slightly tucked up to get a frill. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="soft rose" class="if uuid-3105874" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3105874.jpg"></div><p>  It is recommended to use the processed edge of the tape for the top of the workpiece so that the threads do not have to be melted.  In this case, the edges are deformed, and the rose will no longer be as airy as in the photo in the article.  It remains only to carefully fold the craft into a roll and sew the bottom edge with stitches. </p><h2>  Craft in half folded fabric </h2><p>  Having a sewing machine, you can make an original rose in a couple of minutes.  To do this, purchase a wide satin ribbon and fold it horizontally in half.  The edges are not aligned exactly, but with a shift of a few centimeters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="satin ribbon crafts" class="if uuid-3105875" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3105875.jpg"></div><p>  After the entire side is sewn, the thread must be tightened to form small fabric assemblies.  It remains to tightly wind the strip into a skein and sew the bottom edge with stitches.  If you do not have a sewing machine, this work can be done manually.  Spend a little more time, but this will not affect the quality of the finished product, since the seams will be hidden inside.  It turns out a rose with soft sides. </p><h2>  Craft from kapron tape </h2><p>  The wider the tape used, the larger the crafts will be.  Do-it-yourself ribbon workshop with ribbons read on in the article.  The work consists of two stages.  First you need to fold the edge of the ribbon and sew the bud along the bottom edge with a few stitches.  The remaining long strip of fabric is folded with loops with a shift of half its width. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="nylon rose" class="if uuid-3105870" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3105870.jpg"></div><p>  From below, immediately grab the folded part with small stitches, advancing the needle only forward, so that you can pull the end of the thread and make a small frill.  It remains only to wrap the ribbon around the central bud and secure the rose with a needle and thread. </p><h2>  Original way </h2><p>  At the end of our story, we dwell on another interesting method of making roses from satin ribbons.  This work will take a lot of time, since each petal will first have to be folded with a triangle, and then sew on the outer edge with small stitches manually.  The seam is applied only by moving forward, since at the end of the work the thread will have to be pulled over to form folds. </p><div class="photo" data-original="moovieton.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a strip with petals" class="if uuid-3105911" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3105911.jpg"></div><p>  The first turn of fabric is twisted into a tight bud, and after that the main folding of the tape is made.  In order to make a beautiful rose, starting with a bud, the fabric is wound tightly around the center.  Fasten the crafts with threads along the lower edge of the fabric.  You can complement the design of the flower with green leaves or fasten to a wire covered with tape.  In this case, it will be possible to put the flower in a vase and make a beautiful bouquet for decorating the room or present it to a loved one. </p><p>  In the article, we examined in detail how to make a rose from a ribbon.  A review of the methods will give you the opportunity to choose from a variety of options you like.  The step-by-step photographs presented in the article will help to cope with the task much easier and faster to master the methods described in the article.  Have a good start! </p>
