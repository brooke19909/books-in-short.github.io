Rethymnon (the more correct name Rethymnon) is not the last among the attractions of the country.  And why?  Yes, thanks to the wonderful beaches.  A golden strip of sand stretches for thirteen kilometers.  And this is just a city municipal beach!  And there are others.  The coast in the resort of Rethymnon is unique in that it is diverse.  Landscapes are changing, like in a kaleidoscope.  Do you miss the wide sandy beaches like in Bulgaria?  Or dream of small bays hidden from prying eyes that God himself created for lovers?  Would you like to feel if not Adam and Eve, then at least Robinson Crusoe on a deserted and wild shore?  Or do you want a European service, so that the sand is sifted with a rake, and at the water's edge there are sunbeds and awnings?  All this can be found in one and rather small resort.  But what does not happen here is crowds.  In this article we will look at the best beaches of Rethymnon.  Reviews mention that some tourists vacationing at other resorts in the northern part of Crete (for example, in Chania), however, went there every day.  In addition to describing the beaches and their infrastructure, we will give some practical advice that we hope will be useful to you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beaches rethymno crete reviews" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1400653.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is equally in demand by both lovers of excursions and connoisseurs of a relaxing (or fun) beach holiday.  The city center is a real museum under the sky.  The magnificent Byzantine heritage, medieval Orthodox churches, Catholic churches, Turkish mosques - all this fits in the narrow streets of ancient Rethymnon.  The city has long expanded its borders along the sea and included in its orbit the nearby coastal villages, which have turned from fishing villages to resort villages.  Rethymnon is well located on the island in relation to other <span>attractions of Crete.</span>  It is not far from Heraklion, to <span>the Samaria gorge, the</span> Balos lagoon, <span>Lake Kurna, the</span> springs of Agriroupoli.  But the main treasure of the resort are the wonderful beaches of Rethymnon.  Crete is called the island, the beloved of God.  Everything here is of the highest level: wines, cuisine, historical and cultural attractions, picturesque nature.  And, of course, beaches.  And in this area, Rethymno can rightly be called the capital of Crete.  Where to go to sunbathe and swim in this resort? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Weather in Rethymnon" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1400662.jpg" width="600"></div>

The northern coast of Crete, where Rethymno is located, lies in a comfortable climate zone for a vacationer from Russia.  The rest of Greece, especially its mainland, is too dry and is characterized by large temperature differences between seasons.  Crete has a Mediterranean climate.  This means that almost the entire annual rainfall occurs in winter.  The temperature in January rarely drops below + 10 degrees.  In summer, the weather in Rethymnon pleases beach vacationers with a cloudless sky, plenty of sun and a warm calm sea.  The temperature in the shade even in September reaches twenty-nine degrees.  But the heat on the beach is not felt, the effect of the fresh sea breeze.  Water at the end of summer warms up to twenty-seven degrees.  All of the above causes a fairly long swimming season.  The first tourists descend on beach loungers in April.  But not everyone decides to swim.  The deep Mediterranean Sea warms up slowly.  Already in May, the beach season is in full swing.  And it continues until the end of September.  By the way, the first month of autumn is considered the most successful for relaxation.  In October, resorts start the discount season in the hope of catching the latest tourists.  But do not expect super low prices: Crete, due to its rich historical heritage, is in demand all year round. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beach beds" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1400654.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Rethymnon city beach </h2><p>  We are used to the fact that the coast, which is located within the boundaries of the village, is crowded with people, and therefore its cleanliness leaves much to be desired.  This is the situation in the Russian resorts of the Black and Azov Seas.  But this is Greece!  Rethymnon (municipal beach) was repeatedly awarded the Blue Flag.  And not only for arrangement, service and developed infrastructure.  At the presentation of this high award, environmental safety is paramount.  The main city beach of the resort, which is called ‚ÄúRethymnon‚Äù, begins immediately behind the historical landmark, the Venetian port.  A wide strip of golden sand stretches for thirteen kilometers.  Naturally, in the center of the resort there are a lot of people.  But since the beach of Rethymno is so vast, this is not at all noticeable.  Lifeguard towers are evenly spaced along the entire length, there are showers and changing cabins.  Young people love to come here, because on this beach there are so many entertainments on the water.  And here it is very clean.  Absolutely clear water rolls on a <span>gentle coast.</span>  Ecological cleanliness is evidenced even by the fact that turtles of the caret type are laying eggs on the beach.  So if you see a place fenced with ropes, know: this is a masonry that is protected by law.  The city beach is popular in the evening.  Indeed, along it runs the embankment Eleftherios Venizelos - a party place in the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Greece Rethymno" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1400656.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Coombes </h2><p>  This beach will appeal to those who want to sunbathe amid historical sights and architectural beauties.  From here you can see the fortress museum Fortezza, which, by the way, is recommended by tourists to visit (a ticket costs three euros).  The sandy beach of Kumbes is located two kilometers from the center of Rethymnon.  It is not very inferior in length to the city.  It is loved by vacationers with young children because of the gentle approach to the sea and the lack of waves.  And besides, it is quite close to the resort of Rethymnon.  How to get to Coombes?  Walking will take you a maximum of half an hour.  You can drive to the beach by city bus.  And for the very lazy in Kumbes there is the opportunity to rent housing (apart-hotels and hotels).  This beach is equipped, as well as urban.  But toilets and showers are paid (fifty cents).  Kumbes is famous as a place of entertainment on the water.  There is a center of sea sports.  On the Kumbes promenade, vacationers will find many taverns serving delicious Greek cuisine.  Lunch for two with wine will cost thirty euros.  There are also sports and playgrounds, exercise machines in the open. </p><h2>  Bali </h2><p>  We mentioned that there are rocky beaches of Rethymnon (Crete).  Reviews characterize this coast as wild.  Bali (like its namesake island) will appeal to couples in love and lovers of a secluded relaxing holiday alone with nature.  The beach is located thirty kilometers east of Rethymnon.  Every day you can‚Äôt train, tourists complain.  But regular buses run regularly, and the opening view is worth the money spent on the road.  The four bays that make up Bali Beach are nestled between high coastal cliffs.  They visibly extinguish the wind, which is always fresh on the northern coast of Crete.  And the sea unrest is less noticeable here.  In fact, Bali is a small village.  In it, as in any resort, there are taverns, restaurants, shops, and housing is for rent.  But tourists there are immeasurably less in comparison with Rethymno.  Therefore, reviews and call the <span>beaches of Bali a</span> place for secluded relaxation.  By the way, they will satisfy lovers of both pebbles and soft sand.  These beaches are not so wild.  There are tents, sunbeds, umbrellas.  In one of the four bays there is a pier from which you can go on a boat trip on a tourist boat, stylized as a pirate gallery.  But what‚Äôs important - there is no hiding place and motorized types of water entertainments. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The best beaches of Rethymnon" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1400657.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <h2>  Gerani Beach (Crete) </h2><p>  Most vacationers traveling from Rethymno in search of a place in the sun and crystal clear water, rush east.  Only a little away from the city, as if you find yourself in another world: the sandy beach is replaced by majestic rocky cliffs, and beyond them stretches a fertile valley full of fragrant greenery.  But Gerani is located west of Rethymno.  The beach is only six kilometers from the city center, which is easy to overcome on a regular bus for euros and sixty cents.  What are the reasons to come to Gerani?  Swimming enthusiasts recognize only him.  Rocks protrude far into the water, where diverse Mediterranean living creatures live.  This circumstance requires vacationers and some caution.  In order not to be unbearably painful from an injection of a sea urchin, it is better to purchase <span>coral slippers.</span>  Geraniums will equally please lovers of sand and pebbles.  A river flowing into the sea divides the beach into two halves.  One of them, western, sandy, the other - pebble.  Reviews note that in Gerani beach beds and umbrellas are slightly cheaper than in Rethymnon (six euros against seven).  Reviews are recommended for lunch in a typical Greek tavern nearby.  Tourists are also advised to visit the church of Panagia Kamarianis.  Geraniums are not for small children.  Immediately from the shore, depth begins. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beach geranium crete" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1400670.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Beach in Adelianos Kambos </h2><p>  This resort village is the largest eastern satellite of Rethymnon.  And, suggest reviews, the most popular.  Adelianos Kambos is separated from Rethymno by seven and a half kilometers.  It is not necessary to wait for a special regular bus to get there.  You can take the routes further east, for example, No. 20 (to Panormo).  The bus stops near the beach.  The coast is lined with umbrellas and sunbeds (the set will cost five euros per day), there are changing cabins, showers and toilets.  Describing the beaches of <span>Rethymnon (Crete),</span> reviews call Adelianos the greenest.  From the coast covered with golden sand, a bewitching view of the fertile valley opens, where cypresses, pines and chestnuts grow, and the aromas of flowers reach the vacationers.  There is a diving school on the beach in Adelianos Kambos.  But if you are not enthusiastic about scuba diving, you still have a wide choice of entertainment on the water.  Here you have jet skis, parachute flights, and gliding on a board under a sail.  On the waterfront of the village there are a lot of fairly cheap taverns.  In addition to traditional gyros or moussaki, here you should try grilled seafood and fried red mullet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Adelianos Kambos" class="if" height="313" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1400680.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  A calmer beach with the necessary infrastructure </h2><p>  If you go all the way to Adelianos cape, you find yourself in Pianos Kambos.  It is optimal for those who seek comfort and at the same time unity with nature.  The people here are much smaller than in Adelianos Kambos.  The specificity of this beach is that almost all sunbeds and umbrellas belong to taverns located right on the shore.  Therefore, to rent them, you need to take drinks or some dish in the bar.  You can swim with a mask and snorkel on the cape.  In general, it is a fully equipped beach, with changing cabins, lifeguard towers, a first-aid post, showers, and toilets.  For a bite to eat or lunch there is also where.  Since Pianos Kambos and neighboring Adelianos are considered family-friendly destinations, children's portions can be ordered at these taverns.  They are also quite voluminous, but they are cheaper.  Reviews are advised to order a "family menu" in beach restaurants.  So a dinner for four with wine for parents and a fresh for children will cost no more than forty euros.  Covering the beach Pianos Kambos - small pebbles.  But right after the narrow surf, sand begins.  Caution should be exercised: sometimes boulders come across. </p><h2>  Scaletta </h2><p>  Describing the beaches of Rethymnon (Crete), reviews greatly praise this small satellite village, which is located twelve kilometers from the city.  And if you came to the island with children, then you can not find a better place to relax than Scaletta.  Noisy youth goes around this quiet and sweet village with a couple of restaurants and hotels side.  Scaletta's beach stretches for just over a kilometer.  But how convenient it is for children!  The sand is soft and clean, and the entry into the sea is very gentle.  You can not worry about the safety of the baby, who will flounder in shallow water or build their castles.  Tortoise eggs crawl out to the beach of Scaletta.  They are watched by ecologists who enclose these places in the sand with rope fences.  The village of Skaletta has a surprisingly beautiful promenade, full of green spaces.  Maybe there are not many shops and restaurants there, but there are plenty of activities for children.  There are hotels in Scaletta.  You can rent a house in a private apartment.  The atmosphere in the village is quiet and peaceful.  Even the restaurants do not close very late. </p><h2>  Episkopi Beach </h2><p>  The reviews told us where in the vicinity of Rethymnon it is good to relax with young children.  What about adults who want to sunbathe topless, or even completely naked?  And for nudists there should be a beach and a sea.  Rethymno gave them a plot of the coast fifteen kilometers west of the city limits.  The beach is located half an hour walk from the resort village of Episkopi.  A strip of golden sand stretched for four kilometers.  Episkopi beach is conditionally divided into two parts.  Western - very well-maintained.  It is not customary to sunbathe topless, this part is chosen by vacationers with children because of the shallow bottom.  Sunbeds and umbrellas are installed in the sand (the set will cost from five to seven euros per day), lifeguards work, there are showers, toilets, and changing cabins.  There is no shortage of catering.  The eastern part of Bishop's Beach, which starts from the Petres Bridge, is more wild.  Reviews claim that nudists settled here.  But they will not forcefully undress you here - not Nice, after all.  Kids do not go to this part of the beach, the difference in depths is quite serious.  But the recreation infrastructure is present here.  If you want, you can sunbathe not in the sand, but on a sunbed. </p><h2>  Travel tips </h2><p>  Reviews say that beach ammunition in Crete is paid everywhere, even in hotels on the first line.  How can I save?  Rather than spreading five to seven euros daily for sunbeds, beach umbrellas, it is better to buy a mat for 6 –Ñ and rest yourself calmly.  In Crete, sea urchins hide in sand in some places.  It is better to go into the water in coral slippers.  They can be purchased locally, but it will be more expensive. </p>
