    <p>  In order to make it easier to navigate in the city, at the reception at the hotel you need to take a free map of the city with all the marked attractions, restaurants and shops. </p><h2>  Cost of the tour at Red Sun </h2><p>  If you are planning a vacation in <span>Nha Trang (</span> <span>Red</span> <span>Sun</span> <span>Nha</span> <span>Trang</span> <span>Hotel 4),</span> then it will be useful to know the estimated cost of accommodation and flight. </p><p>  The approximate price for a ticket for 12 days for two adults is 70 thousand rubles (departure from Moscow).  This price includes accommodation, meals (breakfast), transfer and medical insurance. </p><p>  This is an approximate price, which can vary up or down depending on the city of departure, airline and date of vacation. </p><p>  As for the visa to Vietnam, provided that the tourist will stay in the state for less than 15 days (including the day of arrival and departure), it is not needed.  If your vacation is designed for a longer period, then you should take care of obtaining a visa. </p><h2>  The opinion of the guests about the place of rest </h2><p>  So far, there are few reviews of <span>Red</span> <span>Sun</span> <span>Nha</span> <span>Trang</span> <span>Hotel 4</span> , as the hotel is brand new and began to receive guests only this year.  But still, several reviews have already appeared on the Internet. </p><p>  Judging by the words of vacationers, the hotel is very beautiful and has an excellent location.  Opposite the hotel is a central park, near a huge number of inexpensive cafes.  The rooms are chic, very large, all the furniture and appliances are new.  Check-in to the rooms takes place almost immediately.  A responsive girl with knowledge of the Russian language works at the reception, you can contact her for any questions - she will help to solve them </p><p>  The hotel has a beautiful pool located on the sixth floor, which is very impressive.  Three minutes to the sea with a calm step.  The beach itself, despite the fact that it is public, clean enough, there is enough space for everyone.  On the road to the sea on the street there are dots with ice cream and delicious pancakes, everything is prepared with you. </p>

    <p>  As for the cuisine, the reviews are also positive, the breakfasts are excellent: every day they serve different soups of foil, pancakes, omelettes, cakes, several types of fruits.  The only negative - the hotel has a lot of Chinese, who are very loud and "greedy for food." </p><p>  High-quality service, daily and high-quality room cleaning, towels and shower accessories are changed every day. </p><h2>  A few words about Nha Trang </h2><p>  Nha Trang - the most popular resort in South Vietnam, has long been loved by tourists.  Here, vacationers are provided with equipped beach areas, a clear sea, numerous SPA procedures, a huge selection of nightlife, massage parlors, cafes and restaurants.  Sea water is clear, warm, turquoise, ideal for scuba diving.  The city offers tourists many exciting excursions and places for shopping. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, <span>it is better to organize a</span> vacation in Nha Trang from February to May.  At this time, there are more comfortable conditions, the sea is calm, warm, azure in color, there is no sweltering heat, rainfall is rare.  It is during these months that children need to be introduced to Vietnam. </p><p>  From October to December, the city begins the rainy season, and although the temperature of the air, like the water, remains warm, for some the rest at this time can be spoiled.  Rather large waves rise to the sea, debris nails to the shore, and often a cool wind blows. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  To summarize, we can say the following: judging by the description, Red Sun Nha Trang Hotel 4 is the best option for a vacation in Nha Trang for both young people and couples who come with children. </p>
