    <p>  It's all about the ‚Äústuffing‚Äù, because the new (and expensive) processors of the Tegra 3 class have become much less voracious compared to the previous generation of chipsets.  The device is able to work for more than a day in the basic mode: reading books, surfing, music and videos. </p><h2>  Memo Pad HD 7 </h2><p>  Asus Memo Pad HD is a 7-inch tablet with a powerful 4000 mAh battery.  The device is perfect for home use, as well as for various trips and business trips.  Moreover, good assembly and high-quality material give the whole construction reliability, which means that the gadget can be taken on more extreme trips. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  "Stuffing" is not distinguished by originality and enviable speed, therefore, a set of chipsets can be called ordinary for its class.  ‚ÄúHeavy‚Äù games and high-resolution video will drain the device‚Äôs battery in about 7 hours.  If you work in a gentle mode, such as reading books and surfing, then the battery will last for a day with a small one. </p><h2>  Galaxy Tab 7.7 </h2><p>  Galaxy Tab series are <span>7-inch tablets</span> with a powerful 5100 mAh battery.  According to the manufacturer‚Äôs tests, the gadget confidently overcame the autonomy mark of 12 hours at the basic load mode, that is, mixed surfing, ‚Äúlight‚Äù games, videos and reading. </p>

    <p>  The company did not deprive its brainchild of the ‚Äústuffing‚Äù, having placed on board the fast dual-core processor "Kortech" of the A9 series and the sensible graphic controller, which feels great in the AMOLED display company. </p><h2>  Xperia Tablet Z2 </h2><p>  Equipment from Sony has always been distinguished by high-quality assembly and stable operation.  The 10-inch Tablet model of the Z2 series features a powerful 6000 mAh lithium-ion battery.  The manufacturer guarantees a smooth operation of the device in basic modes for 13 hours.  If you watch high-resolution video or load the tablet with modern games, the battery life will be reduced by 2-2.5 hours. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Also, the model was distinguished by a very good "stuffing": a quad-core processor "Snapdragon" series 801, 3 GB of RAM and an intelligent graphics system "Adreno 330".  Such characteristics allow you to work seamlessly with any modern applications.  In addition, the platform interface has a quick response, without any friezes, brakes and other subsidence, even if all the tables are loaded to capacity. </p><h2>  iPad mini 3 </h2><p>  Almost all "apple" gadgets are characterized by good autonomy.  This was also an 8-inch tablet with a powerful 6340 mAh ‚ÄúiPad mini 3‚Äù battery.  The brand on its official website assures users that the device is capable of playing high-resolution video for 10 hours.  <span>Bench tests</span> revealed a slightly lower indicator - about 9 hours, but the result is still impressive. </p>

    <p>  In basic modes, the device‚Äôs battery lives quietly for more than a day without recharging.  And if you read books, surf the Internet and listen to music, you can stretch the battery for a couple of days.  Moreover, many users in their reviews called the gadget as an "indestructible tablet with a powerful battery", in view of a well-designed design.  Therefore, the device is perfect for travelers and outdoor enthusiasts. </p><h2>  Mediapad 10 </h2><p>  ‚ÄúHuawei Media Pad 10‚Äù is a 10-inch tablet with a powerful 6600 mAh battery, where, according to the manufacturer, the battery life in active mode varies within 10 hours.  Naturally, the duration of use depends on the selected mode, display brightness level and program optimization.  But assurances and user reviews show that even with the most active use of the battery lasts at least 8 hours. </p><p>  In addition, the model was distinguished by a very attractive filling for its segment and good design characteristics that allow you to take the gadget almost anywhere without fear of scratching it or breaking it.  But to sit on the device or hammer nails with them, of course, is not worth it. </p><h2>  iPad Air 2 </h2><p>  Another ‚Äúapple‚Äù brainchild, which has not only extremely attractive battery life, but also many additional useful features, such as a fingerprint sensor and a ‚Äúretina‚Äù display.  The Air 2 Series is a <span>rugged tablet</span> with a powerful 7340 mAh battery and a 9.7-inch display. </p>

    <p>  The company first implemented in this line of 2 GB of RAM.  The rest of the "filling" is also up to par, so there will be no problems with performance.  In addition, thanks to the technological Lightning connector, charging takes about four hours.  Bench tests showed that when watching a video in HD-resolution, the tablet with the powerful iPad Air 2 battery normally works up to 10 hours, which means that in basic modes it will quietly last up to a couple of days without recharging. </p><h2>  IRU B1003GW Atom Z3740 </h2><p>  The gadget's rechargeable battery has a good capacity of 7900 mAh, which is quite enough for progressive work both at home and at work, and all day long.  The manufacturer guarantees at least 7 hours of active use of the device in the basic mode (Internet, music, videos). </p><p>  The Z3740 IRU model from the Atom series is a tablet with a powerful battery that runs on the Windows 8.1 operating system.  The display of the device has a diagonal of 10.1 ‚Äùand an expansion of 1280 by 800 pixels.  In addition, the reviews of the owners note the presence of an intelligently designed structure, thanks to which it is very difficult to scratch or break the main elements. </p><h2>  Nokia Lumia 2520 </h2><p>  This model is more likely to work than to entertain, because the gaming potential of the platform is slightly below average.  But on the other hand, the battery life, due to a modest set of chipsets, has been significantly increased. </p>

    <p>  Moreover, the capacious 8000 mAh battery clearly contributes to longer battery life.  In basic modes, the gadget calmly plays and glows up to 14 hours in a row (surfing, music, reading), but if you watch high-resolution video or play ‚Äúheavy‚Äù games (in the case when they normally start), then the battery life is reduced by approximately half, that is, up to 7 hours.  One of the notable features of this model is the quick charge of the battery, which is powered by a standard 220 V outlet in just an hour and a half. </p><h2>  YOGA Tablet 2 from Lenovo </h2><p>  At one time, the Yoga series was a real flash in its segment, overtaking sales of venerable Samsung, Apple and other competitors.  The second version of the gadget was no worse than the first, where users got an excellent tablet with the most powerful battery at 9600 mAh. </p>

    <p>  The set of chipsets ‚ÄúTablet 2‚Äù is not so different from its predecessor, but the main argument for the purchase has remained the same - the battery life.  Moreover, the gadget is able to work on the most ‚Äúheavy‚Äù applications and watching videos in Full HD-up to 15 hours.  Using standard modes and the base load will significantly extend battery life - up to about 3 days. </p><p>  In addition, the device was distinguished by a very good assembly and interesting design solutions in terms of protection, so the model feels great both in the portfolio of a business person and in a backpack of a traveler. </p>
