To escape from the dank dampness of the middle latitudes and get from gray landscapes into the world of the sun, tropical palm trees and the warm Arabian Sea - is this not a dream?  Goa is the only state in India where there is a strong raid of Portuguese and Christian culture.  This administrative unit also holds the palm by the number of tourists.  Goa is divided into North and South.  The border between them is rather arbitrary and runs along the Zuari River.  With similar climatic characteristics and nature, vacation in North and <span>South Goa is</span> radically different.  This state was “discovered” by hippies in the seventies of the last century.  Then they were joined by rastamans and downshifters.  But all this informal public from the beginning of the two thousandth has been squeezed from the south.  Now for hippies and trans-music fans, only North Goa has survived.  The southern territories have become a haven of wealthy European pensioners and those who love a chic vacation.  In this article we will talk about one such hotel called Alila Diwa 5 *.  We built the description of rooms, infrastructure and the beach solely on the reviews of tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alila diwa 5" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1468830.jpg" width="600"></div>

Many complain that there is not a trace of “real India” in this part of the state.  Yes, outwardly, the <span>resorts of South Goa are</span> not much different from Salou, Ibiza or Hawaii.  But Alila Diwa 5 * is located in the resort of Majorda.  This place is famous for its excellent (reviews claim - the best in the state) thirty-kilometer sandy beach.  The entire coast along it is built up with chic hotels.  So the guests of “Plila Diva” will not be surrounded by “poor neighbors”.  But it should be noted that the hotel is on the third lane.  The notorious Majorda Beach is six hundred meters away.  But many tourists say that it does not matter.  After all, a free bus runs every fifteen minutes to the beach during the day.  Since there are no shocking European slums, you can safely and safely travel.  Majorda unites eleven resort villages - from Betalbatim to Velsao.  An excellent bus service is established between them.  Goa International Airport - Dabolim is also located nearby.  It takes about twenty minutes to get from the exit of the air harbor to the gates of the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alila Diwa Goa 5" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1468832.jpg" width="600"></div>

It seems like you have crossed the gates of paradise.  “Alila Diva 5 *” is part of the Design Hotels hotel chain, and therefore they pay great attention to the design of the territory.  By the way, it is huge - forty-eight thousand square meters.  The hotel was built in 2009.  Now it is divided into two unequal halves.  One big one is Alila Diwa 5 *.  The second, smaller, is called "Diva Club Wing."  Tourists call this part of the hotel complex an “exclave enclave”.  In the tropical garden towers three sleeping buildings, built in the neocolonial style.  These houses are not high.  One building is two-story, the rest is three-level.  The buildings surprise with their original design: porticos and columns are everywhere.  But inside the hotel and in its rooms you feel like you are in India.  The design is intertwined with Asian and European motifs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Last Minute Goa Tours" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1468813.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel Alila Diwa 5 *: room description </h2><p>  All guest rooms have spacious balconies or terraces.  And this is a huge plus, because you can sunbathe without leaving the room.  The most popular category is the standard, which the hotel calls the "terrace rooms".  These rooms are located both in the basement and on the upper levels of the buildings.  If you really choose a standard, then you should ask in the southern building - suggest reviews.  There the view from the windows is prettier.  There is also a loft room.  These guest rooms are located in the attic and delight guests with beautiful wooden finishes.  These rooms have large private balconies.  “Alila Suite” is twice as spacious as the “terrace rooms” (88 versus 44 square meters).  At the same time, the room is designed for two guests.  The Family Terrace Room is located in the basement and has its own patio (patio).  The pride of the hotel are family suites.  In a separate building, guests of the Diva Club live.  This is a real island of luxury.  This building also has a “room” and a “suite”. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alila Diwa 5 room description" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1468825.jpg" width="600"></div>

The design combines Indian motifs with modern European ones.  The technical equipment of the rooms is impeccable.  There is a TV with satellite channels, air conditioning, a minibar (its contents, except for drinking water, paid), telephone, free safe.  In all rooms and at the reception in free Wi-Fi.  Tourists say that the rooms are equipped with brand new furniture, there is even a desk.  The bathroom is particularly impressive.  It is simply huge, beautifully designed, conducive to bath delights.  Guests are provided with not only a variety of hygiene items, but also bathrobes with slippers.  Still lodgers were pleased with sets for independent preparation of coffee and tea.  Sachets were replenished as they were used. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Alila Diwa Goa 5" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1468831.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  “BB” - this is how you can characterize the type of boutique hotel Alila Diwa Goa 5 *.  This means that breakfast is included in the price.  And in terms of nutrition, the guests of the “Diva Club” have a greater preference.  They have their own restaurant, where breakfast lasts from early in the morning (the establishment opens even after dark) and actually until lunch.  They serve an à la carte menu.  You can get to this restaurant only once a day.  The guests of the “Terrace Room” eat buffet in the “Vivo”.  The hotel complex has a luxurious à la carte restaurant Spice Studio.  It serves Indian cuisine.  Food not so generously seasoned with spices is served in a small but cozy Breeze.  The hotel lobby has a stylish Z Edge bar with soft sofas and an extensive wine list.  The hotel has an outdoor area for organizing banquets and wedding receptions. </p><h2>  What tourists say about food </h2><p>  Guests of Alila Diwa Goa 5 * were satisfied with the breakfast.  The food is very satisfying, varied.  Reviews say that breakfast is quite suitable for baby food.  There are granola, milk, sausages.  A large number of baked goods and fruits.  In recent years, an all-inclusive system has been introduced for Russian tourists.  But this program is used only by those who are interested in "free" alcohol.  As for food, there are a lot of cafes around the hotel with huge portions and ridiculous prices.  Reviews urge you not to be afraid to visit local catering establishments.  This is South Goa!  You will not find any unsanitary conditions there, and the kitchen is simply wonderful.  Many cafes have a menu in Russian.  Tourists say that having an electric kettle with tea bags in your room is a big plus.  Reviews suggest dining on the beach.  If you take something in such a restaurant, then sunbeds and an umbrella are free.  Tourists recommended "Chip" and "Martin." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alila Diwa 5.

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Tourists really liked the warm and mostly calm Arabian Sea, on the coast of which the Alila Diwa 5 * hotel is located.  The beach, however, is located six hundred meters from the hotel.  But a free hotel bus runs from morning to evening to the stretch of coast called Sun Set (Sun Set).  Sunset at sea is very comfortable, smooth, which is good for bathing children.  There are no stones and corals, you can do without beach shoes.  The sandy coast is very long.  All beaches in Goa are municipal.  Sunbeds and umbrellas are owned by cafes and restaurants.  The use of beach equipment can be called shareware.  You order food or drinks - and recline on a sun lounger under an umbrella.  Although the beach is municipal, it is regularly cleaned.  The coast can be reached on foot in seven minutes. </p><h2>  Pools </h2><p>  Almost all photos of the hotel taken by tourists, one way or another, show these tanks.  And there is a reason for this.  Under the hot tropical sun, the water warms up so much that there is no need to swim to keep warm.  What about lying in the water?  There is nothing easier.  The pool is equipped with shallow water, where sun loungers are installed.  Above the surface rises only the head of a resting person.  The guests of the "Diva Club" have their own pool.  Other guests are not allowed there.  But club VIP clients can use both tanks of the Alila Diwa 5 * hotel.  A children's pool is also available.  Around these freshwater lagoons is a spacious sunbathing terrace.  It is lined with sunbeds with mattresses and umbrellas. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alila Diwa 5 Hotel Infrastructure" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1468833.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel Facilities </h2><p>  What level of service does Alila Diwa 5 * meet?  The hotel infrastructure is fully consistent with the declared status.  Although reviews say that the stardom of hotels in India does not reflect the level of service in them.  But Alila Diva belongs to the international network, and therefore they hold the bar high there.  They clean the rooms twice a day.  In the evening, the maids beautifully make the bed, slide the curtains and light a candle in the bathroom.  The latter, by the way, is right in the bedroom.  But with the help of a sliding wooden screen, it is easy to turn it into a separate room.  Despite the fact that the hotel has few tourists from the Russian Federation, a Russian-speaking employee works at the reception.  You can park your car for free at the hotel.  Your baggage will be delivered to the room by the porter.  There is a currency exchange, a tour desk.  Welcome guests with a welcome drink.  Wi-Fi is free throughout. </p><h2>  Vacation with children </h2><p>  Of course, every tour operator will say that with a very young child it is not worth going to India.  The flight Moscow - Goa will be too long, and the acclimatization of a small organism will be long.  But if you start your journey from the eastern regions of Russia and plan a trip for at least ten days, then a vacation in Alila Diva 5 * promises to be wonderful.  The hotel attracts families with children with a price policy: all kids who have not yet reached the age of five stay at the hotel for free.  At your request, a cot will be installed in the room.  The hotel offers a professional babysitting service. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Hotel Alila Diwa Goa 5 * is trying to diversify the beach holidays of its guests with interesting events.  Board games are free at the reception.  There is a cinema that can be visited by those who know English.  There is a small library with beach reading, where you can find books in Russian.  Of the paid services, most reviews recall yoga classes and a luxury spa.  In the last oasis of bath pleasures, you can not only take a steam bath in the sauna and hammam, soak in the jacuzzi or relax under the fingers of a masseur, but also take a wellness course to cleanse your face, body, and all kinds of wellness procedures.  Tourists, especially women, highly recommended visiting this spa.  It is possible to rent bicycles, freely visit the gym.  And for the smallest guests the hotel organized a mini-club. </p><h2>  Excursions to Goa </h2><p>  Reviews strongly recommend using the advantageous geographical location that the Alila Diwa 5 * hotel has.  Goa is a true tourist mecca that attracts more travelers annually than the rest of India.  There is still a great cultural influence of Portugal.  And this is easy to see if you take a one-day excursion "Colonial Goa."  The shortest trip, distracting you from a beach holiday for only half a day, will be a jeep ride to Dudhsagar Falls.  In the lake at its foot you can swim.  The price of the excursion also includes a visit to the plantations where spices grow.  To the pearls of Karnataka - to the sacred land of Gokarna and the temple inside the highest sculpture of Shiva in the world in Murudeshwar - you should get out for a whole daylight.  But the tour, which costs about sixty dollars, includes not only lunch, but also relaxation on <span>Palolem beach.</span> </p><h2>  Last Minute Hotels in Goa </h2><p>  The period from October to April in India is a high season.  Therefore, the cost of a holiday in Goa cannot be low.  But a huge amount in ticket pricing is a flight.  Therefore, you should plan a trip for ten days or more.  The cost of food in India is very low.  There are a lot of offers, so the all-inclusive program is not popular in Goa.  Hotel Alila Diva also offers breakfast only.  It should be noted that the cost of tours to South Goa is higher than to North.  The stardom of the hotel also matters.  Two people can fly to North Goa for ten days when placed in a guest house with breakfast for forty thousand rubles.  But if you want a truly luxurious vacation, in the "five" and in the south of the state, then this pleasure will already cost one hundred and fifty thousand rubles. </p>
