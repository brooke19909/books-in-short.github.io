    <h2>  Unusual hare from plasticine </h2><p>  There is nothing complicated in sculpting a bunny.  From a malleable soft mass, it is necessary to mold ears, a fluffy tail, a head, paws and a body.  All children know that bunnies change the color of a fur coat: in summer it is gray, in winter - white.  Therefore, choosing plasticine for making hares, you need to focus on gray or white. </p><h2>  How to mold a plasticine hare </h2><p>  Give your child joy and introduce him to the fluffy animal, which is the character of many fairy tales and cartoons. </p><p>  Young children find it difficult to create complex shapes and large compositions.  The task of adults is to keep the kids interested, and in the future, interest in the manufacture of plasticine figures is preserved.  In this case, you do not need to chase beauty and quality. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Of the materials for work, you will need a block of white or gray plasticine, a little plasticine in black to decorate the muzzle, a board and stacks.  In this work, the main elements are a ball, a roller and a tortilla.  You will also need additional decorative elements: eyes and nose. </p><p>  <em>Plasticine hare in stages:</em> </p><ol><li>  First of all, you need to knead plasticine until it becomes plastic.  The soft lump should be divided into three parts: the big one - the trunk, the two smaller parts will go to the manufacture of the head, legs, tail and ears. </li><li>  It is necessary to roll balls from the plasticine for the head, trunk and upper paws. </li><li>  For the lower legs and ears, it is necessary to roll up the details in the form of an oval and pull them on one side.  The ears should be flat, so they are a little flattened.  Particular attention should be paid to the size of the details: the ears are long, the tail is short, the hind legs are long and the forelegs are small. </li><li>  The parts are connected by pressing them tightly to each other.  If the parts cannot be joined, matches or toothpicks can be used for fastening. </li><li>  In the end, make eyes, nose and attach them to the muzzle. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to mold a plasticine hare" class="if" height="473" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44175/1470326.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ol><p>  When simple animals will be mastered, you can begin to manufacture other animals.  Having made many different characters, you can try to make a composition.  But do not rush, because every simple detail will help to perfect the child‚Äôs modeling skills.  The better he will master the basic techniques and forms, the easier it will be for him to engage in creativity on his own in the future. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hare from "Well, wait a minute!"  plasticine </h2><p>  Hare from "Well, wait a minute!"  children and adults love.

    <p>  Understanding how to mold a rabbit from plasticine, you need to do everything carefully and in stages.  To connect the parts, use matches or toothpicks. </p><h2>  Tips for Moms </h2><p>  To work with children 3-4 years old, plasticine hares must be simple in execution.  This is due to such reasons: </p><ul><li>  Children are able to concentrate their attention for no more than 15 minutes. </li><li>  During this period of time, kids are just beginning to get acquainted with the basic geometric shapes.  Thanks to joint work, the child will be able to get the knowledge he needs. </li><li>  The motility of the hands is not yet very developed in order to produce too small parts.  However, with regular exercises, finger dexterity will develop much faster. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="plasticine hare in stages" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44175/1470328.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><p>  Plasticine hares are not just crafts, they can be great toys for young children.  Ready-made plasticine animals can be used in dramatization of fairy tales.  It is necessary to create with the child, because it helps the kids to develop. </p>
