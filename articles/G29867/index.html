  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Wage</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Wages - this is the amount of money that an employee receives from an employer for a specific job specified in the job description or described verbally. </p><p>  Allocate these types of wages: </p><p>  - the main one.  This is a mandatory, pre-agreed payment depending on the form of payment at the enterprise: salary, piecework rate or tariff rate.  Also, the basic salary includes surcharges for <span>length of service,</span> allowance, overtime work, etc. </p><p>  - additional.  This is a kind of reward for work above the norm, a reward for success, working conditions, <span>severance pay</span> , etc.  These payments are optional and are carried out at the initiative of the employer. </p><p>  Depending on the payment system, according to which the employer works, an employee concludes an employment contract, none of the clauses of which should contradict article 135 of the Labor Code of the Russian Federation.  It is worth noting that all additional payments: surcharges, allowances, bonuses, as well as the conditions under which the work will be carried out, must be indicated in the employment contract. </p><p>  Another important point is the frequency with which wages are paid.  It should be at least twice a month, this norm is spelled out in <span>article 136 of the Labor Code of the Russian Federation.</span>  Payment days at each enterprise and in each organization should be defined and recorded in the internal rules of the labor schedule.  If the day of payment falls on a weekend, then payment must be made the day before.  As for vacation pay, they must be paid within three days from the day the employee goes on vacation.  If the vacation pay is not paid on time, then under article 124 of the Labor Code of the Russian Federation, the employee has the right to transfer his vacation to another time. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As for the amounts that are accrued to a full-time employee (who has fulfilled the norm), they should not be less than the minimum wage established by law.  Each company has the right to enter its minimum wage (at least officially determined). </p><p>  The minimum wage is the economically sound amount of money established by law, less than which employers are not allowed to pay their subordinates.  For the public sector, the rate of the first category worker is equal to the sum of the minimum wage.  With rising inflation, a revision of the consumer basket, changes in <span>gross national product</span> and other factors, the minimum wage changes.  Most <span>social payments</span> depend on the size of this indicator <span>.</span>  We can say that this amount is the basis for the system of state support of social guarantees of citizens in the field of income. </p><p>  The economy distinguishes between such concepts as real <span>wages</span> and nominal wages. </p><p>  As for the nominal, it represents the amount of money that was received from the employer for a certain period of time.  This indicator cannot reflect the real standard of living of the worker, since an increase in salary does not always indicate an improvement in his solvency.  While the real salary shows how many services or goods for the received amount of money can be purchased. </p><p>  To calculate real wages, it is necessary to divide the nominal wage for a certain period into the consumer price index, taken for the same period.  The resulting indicator will also reflect the true picture of a person‚Äôs ability to pay.  The diametrically opposite may be the dynamics of growth of real and nominal wages, if the country has a rather high <span>level of inflation.</span> </p><p>  In a market economy, an enterprise has the right to independently choose the system and form of remuneration, the mode of work and rest, the ways and methods of incentives for its workers.  The main condition is that the basic guarantees of the state in the field of remuneration and working conditions must be observed by employers. </p>
