And especially by Russian standards.  Therefore, many of our compatriots who have arrived as tourists in some European city often come to the decision to explore neighboring countries as well.  For example, quite often Russians are interested in how to get from Budapest to Vienna. </p><h2>  The main ways </h2><p>  The capital of Hungary - Budapest - is, among other things, a very large transport hub.  There are only three railway stations in this city.  Of course, there is an airport in the capital of Hungary.  It is located near the city.  The city of Budapest itself is located on the Danube River, which is navigable.  And therefore, a port was built here, including passenger ships. </p>

    <p>  Thus, tourists who decide to get from Budapest to Vienna on their own can use both rail and air transport.  The capital of Austria, like the main city of Hungary, is located on the banks of the Danube.  And this means that if you want to travel, tourists can choose the water mode of transport. </p><p>  Of course, a bus service is established between these two cities.  And of course, if desired, tourists can travel from Budapest to the capital of Austria and by car.  Highways in both of these states are traditionally good. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Distance between cities </h2><p>  Both Budapest and Vienna are geographically located approximately in the middle of those countries whose capitals are.  Hungary shares a common border with Austria in the west.  There are no intermediate countries between these two states.  Dimensions Austria and Hungary are small.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthese states is smaller than even in many regions of Russia.  Therefore, the distance from Budapest to Vienna is actually quite small.  In a straight line, it is only about 220 km.  But of course, due to various obstacles, tourists who decide to get to Austria from Hungary will have to travel a little longer. </p><p>  So, for example, the Danube river between these two cities makes several small turns.  For land transport, hills, ponds and forests can become an obstacle.  Thus, the real total length of the route from Budapest to Vienna, depending on the chosen mode of transport, can be about 220-300 km. </p><h2>  Flight ticket </h2><p>  Air transport is a good answer to the question of how to get from Budapest to Vienna.  Flights between these two cities are quite common.  They can be organized by different companies - Airberlin, Lufthansa, Alitalia, etc. The route from Hungary to Austria, of course, is mainly only direct routes.  However, in order to save money, tourists can buy a ticket to Vienna by plane and with a transfer.  Direct flight to get to your destination from Budapest, travelers can literally 40-50 minutes.  The total travel time when choosing a flight with a transfer is about 3 hours. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The cost of a flight from Budapest to Vienna depends primarily on the services of which particular company the tourist decided to use.  The price of a travel document for a direct flight is usually 450-470 euros, with a transfer - 180-300 euros. </p><p>  In order to buy a ticket to Vienna, tourists do not need to go to the Budapest airport.  Travelers can also buy a travel document for an airplane flying to the Austrian capital, including online.  All that is needed is to fill out a special form on the official website of the selected company.  An electronic ticket purchased at such a site is then simply printed on a printer and presented at the Liszt Ferenc Airport.  Tourists who decide to fly to Vienna from Hungary by plane never have any problems with tickets purchased via the Internet. </p>

    <h2>  Budapest Airport: how to get there </h2><p>  The Liszt Ferenc Airport Terminal is located 16 km from the center of Budapest.  You can get to it by train or minibus.  In the first case, you first need to get to the Western station of the city, and then catch the train number 1.  From the main bus station of the city, the airport can be reached by bus No. 200E or No. 93.  Both of these methods are quite convenient.  However, the easiest way, of course, is to get from the city to the place of boarding by taxi.  Also, many tourists book a transfer minibus at the airport itself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Budapest - Vienna Train: Travel Features </h2><p>  By rail, getting to the Austrian capital from Hungary is also quite simple.  Only two types of trains run between the two countries - high-speed (Railjet) and regional.  A budget trip takes about 4.5 hours in total.  By high-speed train, tourists can reach the place in just 2.5 hours. </p><p>  Tourists who decide to take the Budapest - Vienna train (Railjet) must pre-book a ticket.  And experienced travelers advise you to do this as soon as possible.  The more days left before dispatch, the cheaper the ticket for the speed train.  The booking fee for a trip by rail in Hungary is usually not too high. </p><p>  The answer to the question of how to get from Budapest to Vienna by regular train is also quite simple.  Traveling on a regional train in this country is cheaper than on a speed train.  In addition, such trains often stop in many cities less visited by tourists.  So passengers of simple trains have the opportunity to look at original life in the outback of Austria and Hungary.  You can usually buy a ticket for such a train right on the day of departure. </p>

    <h2>  High Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãTravel: Features </h2><p>  Railjet trains are just a great answer to the question of how to get from Budapest to Vienna.  Such trains depart towards the Austrian capital several times a day.  These high-speed trains offer passengers only three types of seats of different price categories: business class, 1st and economy.  For customers who have bought the first two varieties of tickets, the convenience is also offered along the way, such as table setting for dinner.  All meals at the end of the trip by passengers, however, must be paid.  Travelers from economy class can, if desired, visit the dining car on the train. </p><p>  Near each seat in the Railjet speed train there is a special outlet for Wi-Fi.  The price of a ticket for such a train to Vienna from Budapest starts at about 20 euros. </p><h2>  Regional Compositions </h2><p>  Budget trains can go to Vienna either through Gyor or through Bratislava.  In the first case, tourists have the opportunity to look at the unusually colorful center of the ancient city, designed in the Baroque style.  Tourists usually take tickets on the second route only when they want to explore Bratislava and spend a day or two here. </p><p>  Regional trains in Hungary are not at all like Russian long-distance trains or trains.  In most cases, they are equipped not with shelves, but with soft seats installed in six pieces in one compartment.  The seats are located in the wagons of such trains, three opposite each other.  Between them, two comfortable tables are provided.  The doors in all compartments of the budget train are glass.  At small <span>intermediate stations,</span> such compositions usually cost no more than 2-5 minutes. </p>

    <h2>  How to get to the railway station </h2><p>  Many tourists buy a train ticket in Hungary, like a plane, via the Internet.  After purchasing a travel document, first of all, you should carefully look at where the train is sent from.  Most often, trains to Vienna from Budapest depart from the West Station.  But sometimes the starting point of the trip is East. </p><p>  Budapest West Station is located near the city center.  It is located on the metro lines U6 and U3.  Near the train station there is also <span>a public transport stop</span> Europaplatz.  You can come here by city tram.  Budapest East Station is located on the M2 East-West Budapest subway line. </p><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe capital of Hungary is very large.  And to find the stations of Budapest to an inexperienced tourist, and especially without knowledge of the language, it will most likely be quite difficult.  In addition, in such a crowded metropolis, it is very easy for a traveler to even get lost.  Therefore, it is better for beginners to go to the desired station in the city by taxi.  This type of transport in Hungary is relatively inexpensive.  However, you should definitely bargain with a taxi driver.  Otherwise, it can greatly increase the price. </p><h2>  Direct flights to Vienna </h2><p>  You can find out the schedule of the trains leading to the capital of Austria both at the Budapest railway station itself and through the Internet at specialized sites.  There are really many trains to Vienna from Hungary.  The first to the capital of Austria from Budapest sent the composition of NZ 346 Dacia 1,2 (at 05:40).  Next to 9:40 trains run at intervals of 1 hour.  After 9:40, the interval between departures of trains to Vienna is 2 hours. From 15:40, the trains again go at intervals of one hour.  The last train leaves for Vienna at 20:40. </p><p>  Sometimes the timetable for trains from Budapest to Vienna may, of course, change.  Therefore, before heading to the station, the time of train movement should be further clarified.  You can also do this on some specialized Hungarian site. </p><h2>  River path </h2><p>  Many domestic tourists ask on forums on the Internet and the question of how to get from Budapest to Vienna along the Danube.  The river from Hungary to Austria can also be reached quite simply.  Meteor hydrofoil ships run between the capitals of these two countries.  It is worth the trip to them quite expensive.  However, for students and seniors, the company Mahart (it belongs to this type of transport) can make a good discount. </p>

    <p>  In winter, the Danube freezes very rarely.  However, ships on this river are sent to Austria from Hungary, unfortunately, still not all year round.  They transport citizens only from April to November.  The Meteor leaves from Budapest to Vienna at 9:00.  But travelers should still arrive at the port early.  The fact is that tourists who choose this method of travel to Austria may need a little time to check in and baggage. </p><p>  Goes from Budapest <span>ship "Meteor"</span> on the left arm of the Danube.  The path to Vienna along the river takes a lot of time.  However, on the road, passengers can, among other things, enjoy various kinds of Hungarian and Austrian sights. </p><p>  In Bratislava, ships proceeding from Hungary to Austria, unfortunately, stop only with a preliminary application.  In Vienna, the Meteor goes along the main channel to the River Station.  In total, a trip on the Meteor ship from Budapest to Vienna takes about 5.5 hours. </p><h2>  City port: description </h2><p>  The Budapest River Station is located, from where, in fact, Meteor ships depart, about 5 km from the city center, in the Chepel area.  The port of the capital of Hungary operates in a direct mooring.  That is, passengers can go ashore directly from the ships on which they arrived in the city (without the mediation of special boats). </p><p>  The port of Budapest is divided into two main parts - National and International.  Tourists who decide to go to Austria by boat on the Danube, of course, need the latter.  Ticket offices of the International Port of Budapest are located at the Belgrad rakpart. </p><h2>  How to find a river station </h2><p>  In order to get to the port, tourists who fly by plane to the Liszt Ferenc Airport must first take the minibus number 93, and then go down the subway (line 2).  Also, from the airport to the river station, you can also get by bus.  To do this, at Liszt Ferenc Airport 2 station, located next to the airport terminal, you need to take the route following K b√°nya-Kispest M. Next, transfer to the bus going through Soroks√°ri r√©v.  You need to get off at the stop Sz√©chenyi Istv√°n utca. </p><h2>  How to get to Vienna by car </h2><p>  Car rental is also a good answer to the question of how to get from Budapest to Vienna quickly and comfortably.  By car, tourists will need to overcome a total of 152 miles (244.6 km) to the Austrian capital.  It takes only about 2.5-3 hours to travel between Budapest and Vienna by car.  In this case, about 800 rubles will be spent on fuel. </p><p>  Tourists traveling by car <span>from Budapest to Vienna</span> should be on the M1 highway.  There are many tracks in Europe.  And therefore, in principle, the Budapest-Vienna road can be overcome on different routes.  Optimal for many tourists consider the path between the capitals of Hungary and Austria past such cities as: </p><ul><li>  Biatorbad; </li><li>  The obarok; </li><li>  Nyiregyhaza; </li><li>  Tatabanya </li><li>  Paulahof </li><li>  Friedrichshof; </li><li>  Fischamend. </li></ul>

    <p>  On this route you can get to Vienna the fastest.  However, for example, Bratislava in this case will remain a little off to the north. </p><h2>  Features of traveling by car in Hungary and Austria </h2><p>  A car rental in Budapest can only be issued to a person who is at least 21 years old (25 years in some companies).  In this case, the applicant must have available the rights of international standard, obtained at least 1 year ago.  In the absence of such a traveler must make a notarized translation of a domestic document. </p><p>  Renting a car is a relatively expensive way to get to Vienna from Budapest.  Car rental costs in Hungary about 30-100 euros per day.  However, tourists usually travel to Austria from Hungary for several days. </p><p>  Traveling on the roads of Europe to domestic tourists, of course, you need with a passport.  Of course, Russians should observe traffic rules in this part of the world.  So, for example, in settlements of Hungary you can drive by car at a speed of no more than 50 km / h, on a regular highway - 90 km / h, on a high-speed - 110 km / h.  Headlights on any road outside the city should be included in the low beam. </p><p>  In Austria, settlements are allowed to drive by car no faster than 50 km / h, on simple roads - 100 km / h, on highways - 130 km / h. </p><h2>  How to get to Vienna by bus </h2><p>  This type of transport is also a fairly convenient way of traveling from Hungary to Austria.  The bus ticket Budapest - Vienna costs about 1000-1500 p.  per person.  The minimum travel time in this case is 2.5 hours. </p>
