    <h2>  What class of devices does it belong to? </h2><p>  The following are divided into modern television solutions of the South Korean company Samsung: </p><ul><li>  Entry-level devices include those equipped with HD or FullHD matrices.  Their diagonal does not exceed 32 inches and there is no support <span>for SMART</span> TV <span>technology</span> .  But at the same time, the cost of such television devices is minimal.  This feature makes them the most affordable today, but their functionality is minimized. </li><li>  The segment of mid-range televisions is occupied by devices with a diagonal of not more than 43 inches, a 4K image and support for the SMART TV function.  Their cost increases significantly.  And it is to this group that the hero of this article belongs. </li><li>  The parameters of premium solutions are almost identical to the middle segment.  The difference lies in the fact that they are equipped with a protective layer of quantum dots (this feature allows for a long time to preserve saturated colors of the matrix) and a curved screen surface.  According to the manufacturer, these innovations significantly improve the quality of the displayed image.  Also, with such devices, the diagonal can reach 55 inches.  Accordingly, the cost in this case increases. </li></ul><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  According to reviews, the <span>Samsung UE40MU6100UXRU has a</span> typical delivery list, like many mid-range devices.  Reviews indicate that this solution cannot stand out with anything remarkable in terms of configuration against the background of analogues.  The South Korean manufacturer of equipment included the following: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  TV. </li><li>  The control panel to it. </li><li>  User manual, at the end of which there is a warranty card. </li><li>  A set of batteries for the control panel. </li><li>  Stand for installation on any horizontal surface. </li><li>  Power cable. </li></ol><p>  This list just lacks a vertical mounting system.  You have to buy it separately if necessary. </p>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  The main color of the plastic case for Samsung UE40MU6100UXRU is Black.  At the same time, reviews indicate one significant drawback - it is a glossy surface on which a layer of dust becomes quite noticeable.  Therefore, the owner of such a device will often have to wipe the surface of the TV. </p><p>  A 40 ‚Äùscreen is displayed on the front side.  Along its edges is a thin plastic frame.  The power button is displayed on the bottom of the device.  It also has a place for mounting the installation system on a horizontal surface.  On the back of the TV, all communication connectors are grouped. </p><h2>  Matrix.  Image Options </h2><p>  The largest supported image format for UHD on the Samsung UE40MU6100UXRU TV is 4K.  Reviews of experts and owners note the high quality of his picture.  The diagonal of the matrix of this device, as noted earlier, is 40 ‚Äù.  Its highest resolution can reach 3840x2160.  The matrix itself is made using EdgeLED technology.  The aspect ratio of the image in this case is 16: 9.  Image refresh rate is 1300MHz.  Among other important options, it should be noted that there is support for the HDR function. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Sound accompaniment </h2><p>  Two speakers with a rated sound power of 20 watts are part of the built-in speaker system of this solution.  Also, at the level of the software shell, the surround sound function is implemented in the Samsung UE40MU6100UXRU TV.  Reviews of Samsung - the device of this model - indicate the presence of one significant minus.  For unknown reasons, the developers did not equip it with a 3.5 mm port.  Therefore, it is impossible to connect an external speaker system to it.  As a result, the owner of such a multimedia center can only rely on the use of the built-in subsystem for issuing an audio signal. </p><h2>  Tuner.  Multimedia </h2><p>  Do they comply with all relevant requirements of 2017?  Specifications of Samsung UE40MU6100UXRU?  Reviews regarding the tuner indicate that its level of functionality is really excellent.  It is able to receive and display on the screen of a television device not only an analog signal, but also a digital one.  In the latter case, we are talking about the support of satellite (DVB-S2), cable (DVB-C) and local (DVB-T2) broadcasts. </p><p>  The only negative in this case is the lack of support for channels in the DVB-T format.  But such a digital format is not widely used in domestic spaces, and in the absence of this option there is nothing to worry about. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  But not only for watching television broadcasts the device in question is intended.  His communication list has USB ports.  You can connect a flash drive or an external hard drive to them and play various multimedia content (photos, music and even videos).  This fact turns the TV in question into an entertainment center. </p>

    <h2>  Communication kit </h2><p>  In most cases, on the positive side, the owners characterize the list of connections for the Samsung 40 UE40MU6100UXRU LED TV.  Reviews only indicate the absence of a 3.5 mm audio jack.  This circumstance does not allow, as noted earlier, to connect an external sound system to the device and thereby improve the sound quality of television programs and films.  The rest of the communication list of this multimedia center consists of the following: </p><ol><li>  3 HDMI sockets for connection of external devices.  It can be a <span>satellite receiver, a</span> DVD player, or a specialized decoder of a cable provider. </li><li>  2 USB ports  With their help, as noted earlier, you can connect a hard drive or flash drive to play recorded multimedia information. </li><li>  1 antenna input for receiving a television signal. </li><li>  1 CI slot for installing special expansion cards.  Most often they are used to decode the received signal. </li><li>  1 component input to which you can connect obsolete modifications to the receivers. </li><li>  RJ-45 port using twisted pair allows you to connect to a computer network and receive information from it. </li></ol><p>  The list of wireless interfaces includes Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.  The first of these is an alternative to the RJ-45, but when used, the signal is transmitted wirelessly.  And the second is designed to output sound to headphones. </p><h2>  SMART TV </h2><p>  Support for the SMART TV function is implemented in the software shell of the Samsung UE40MU6100U TV.  The review and reviews indicate that this significantly increases the level of functionality of this solution.  The operating system in this case is Tizen OS from Samsung.  In the future, it will be possible to install various mini-applications from the company store of a South Korean company for this software platform.  Since Tizen OS dominates the market for multimedia systems, there should certainly not be a problem with the content. </p>

    <h2>  power usage </h2><p>  In standby mode, the energy level of the UE40MU6100U TV from Samsung is limited to only 0.5 watts.  During operation, power consumption may be 130 watts.  But on average, it is 63 watts.  The annual consumption of electric power is 87 kW / h.  All the previously indicated values ‚Äã‚Äãare valid for the brightness of the device at 82%.  There is also a power saving mode in which the TV consumes no more than 21.5 watts.  As a result, it can be noted that today such a multimedia center is a very energy-efficient solution. </p><h2>  Setting procedure </h2><p>  Almost any review of the Samsung UE40MU6100UXRU TV means that it is quite simple to configure.  To do this, perform the following sequence of actions: </p><ol><li>  Mounting a support or mounting system.  TV installation. </li><li>  Cable connection with a television signal and its connection. </li><li>  We realize the organization of power supply of the multimedia center.  To do this, using a power cable, we supply AC voltage to the corresponding socket of the device.  After that, turn on the TV. </li><li>  At the end of its download, go to the setup menu and select the sub-item ‚ÄúChannels‚Äù.  After that, go to the "Auto Search" section and start this operation, after specifying the signal source (satellite, cable operator or local broadcast).  Upon completion, save the result. </li><li>  We return to the settings menu.  We find the ‚ÄúNetwork‚Äù item in it, where we select the type of connection (Wi-Fi or RJ-45).  We also set the remaining network connection parameters (address, password, login). </li><li>  Next, go to the main menu of the TV.  It is necessary to find the point of the Samsung store in it.  We go into it. </li><li>  The next stage is the installation of all the necessary mini-programs.  It is recommended that you choose one such as Ivi or Tvigle.  As in the first case, and in the second there are many free multimedia content, of which there certainly is something to choose from. </li><li>  After installing all the necessary software, the TV is ready to use. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Cost </h2><p>  At almost 40,000 rubles, the Samsung UE40MU6100UXRU TV is currently priced by retail chains and stores.  Customer reviews indicate that you can find a substantial discount if you wish.  So, in the promotional period, such a multimedia leisure center can be found at a price of 36,999 rubles.  Given the positioning and technical specifications, this cost of the television device in question is well-founded and justified. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  There are certain disadvantages to the Samsung UE40MU6100UXRU.  Reviews indicate possible problems when playing 4K content from flash drives or hard drives.  Again, by adjusting certain values ‚Äã‚Äãin the device settings, this problem can be solved, but not everyone can afford it.  Also, the disadvantages of this model of a multimedia center include the lack of a 3.5 mm audio port.  If necessary, its absence can be compensated by a wireless Bluetooth adapter. </p><p>  The pluses include the following: </p><ol><li>  Support 4K. </li><li>  High quality image output. </li><li>  Low cost. </li><li>  Availability of the SMART TV function. </li><li>  Universality of the device. </li></ol>
