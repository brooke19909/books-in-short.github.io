Reviews of "summer" tourists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Even in Soviet times, colleagues and neighbors began to envy those who left (on vacation or on a trip) to Gurzuf.  Rest, reviews of which were later listened to, was considered not just ‚Äúbeach‚Äù, but special.  After all, Gurzuf - it was our Italy.  There, besides the main elements of a successful vacation, the sea and the sun, there were also breathtaking views.  Beautiful nature (one Bear Mountain is worth it), Artek's proximity, winding streets, "Genoese" houses hanging over the water, Chekhov's cottage, picturesque rocks - all this caused enthusiastic sighs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gurzuf vacation review" class="if" height="205" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3663/267952.jpg" width="480"></div>

    <p>  But does modern Gurzuf really promise a vacation?  Review of him now - is he equally grateful?  We will try to analyze, especially since this village has remained as alluring for tourists, especially the "summer", as in the old days.  Firstly, the same Ayu-Dag and the twin rocks of Adalara remained here.  And people who are not alien to romance declare that they can be admired endlessly, because these natural formations even change their color depending on the weather and time of day.  Secondly, all the same endless steps from and to the sea.  For some, this is a drawback, and people who are active and athletic, on the contrary, are only happy.  And the old houses with verandas, and the smell of coffee in the streets ... For each his own, unique Gurzuf provides relaxation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gurzuf rest 2013 prices" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/266662.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Reviews from bathing enthusiasts are usually positive.  The beaches in Gurzuf, as in most resorts of the South Coast, are pebble, but quite acceptable.  And those who are not afraid to go far can even swim on the beaches of Artek, where the pebbles are so smooth and ‚Äúlicked‚Äù by the sea that you can lie on it without any litter.  In the evenings there are boardwalks along the promenade, the moon over the sea, as in Kuindzhi‚Äôs paintings, restaurants, the famous <span>Crimean wine</span> (all the more so since <span>white muscat red stone is</span> grown directly above the village, not far from the ancient capital of the Gothic principality of Theodoro).  In general, there is a place to eat in Gurzuf, and very good.  Meat and fish kebabs are especially good.  Restaurants on the beaches, if the wind blows from the sea, provide visitors with rugs, so that it becomes warm and cozy.  So you can love Gurzuf for life! </p>

After all, these places were loved by poets, writers and artists.  True, to enter the territory of the Military Sanatorium to admire the bicentennial park and the Night fountain is also not very simple, as in Soviet times.  But you can.  Many excursions are also organized from the village - to Yalta, to Ai-Petri, to the <span>Swallow's Nest.</span>  Often these are boat trips, sometimes bus excursions.  It‚Äôs cheaper to buy them at the pier, and not at the shouts.  Housing here is very expensive - it's Gurzuf!  Rest-2013 (accommodation prices) cost at least one and a half thousand rubles per room.  This is if in season.  The same can be said about nutrition, so it‚Äôs more economical to cook at home, if the owners allow.  However, if prices are not a problem for you, then in the village it is better to go to expensive old restaurants.  By their quality it is immediately evident that it was an elite resort.

    <p>  The clear sea and the beautiful climate, which is almost not addictive, is the main thing that <span>rest in Crimea</span> is good <span>.</span>  <span>Gurzuf, reviews</span> of which even if they complain about the high cost, still note the beauty and cosiness of this resort, recently began to provide not very expensive, convenient and comfortable private pensions.  Unlike ordinary hotels and resorts, as a rule, there is a kitchen with everything you need, Internet, modern appliances, a pool ... So for those who consider Gurzuf to be their second homeland from childhood, there is a good prospect that he will eventually will become a real European resort. </p>
