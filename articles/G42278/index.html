    <p>  Most of the sanatoriums were built here during the Soviet Union, but to this day they operate at full capacity and warmly welcome each new guest.  They successfully treat a variety of diseases with the help of various procedures, because the medical equipment is very good.  To improve the health of patients, therapeutic mud and mineral waters are also used, which this region is rich in. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Sometimes the choice of a sanatorium in Sochi can be very difficult, because each of them is a great place for both relaxing and improving health.  It is worth starting from your preferences, the location of the health resort and the reviews about it of those who have already undergone treatment in it. </p><h2>  The history of the Grand Hotel Rodina in Sochi </h2><p>  However, not all sanatoriums have survived to our days in their original form.  For example, the Rodina sanatorium (Sochi), which today is called the Grand Hotel, was built back in the 70s of the last century.  Then it was the property of the Council of Ministers of the RSFSR, and the entire elite of the party gladly came here to rest. </p><p>  Of course, excellent conditions were created for such high-ranking citizens, therefore the Rodina sanatorium (Sochi), which originally had the name ‚ÄúRussia‚Äù, was popular with many famous people of the country.  Here our great and courageous compatriot, cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, well-known throughout the planet, loved to rest.  And due to the fact that in those days international relations began to develop, the place was also loved by foreign guests from many European countries and acquired the status of an international health resort. </p>
