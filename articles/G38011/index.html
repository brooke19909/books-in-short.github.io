It got its name thanks to a fluffy thread made of twisted lace, between the threads of which a fringe of villi of various thicknesses is inserted.  The villi of the edge are very diverse - very thin, wide, shiny, with nodules, etc.  There is a ‚Äúgrass‚Äù one-color, two-color and multi-color, with iridescent color transitions.  This yarn is intended mainly for hand knitting or crocheting.  Knitting from grass is a quick way to create original and beautiful things.  Its only drawback is that it is very stretched, and this should be taken into account when working.  It turns out beautiful knitting from grass for children.  From it knit fluffy, as if made of faux fur, original little things resembling spring lawn, as well as cute "fur" animals for the game.  The fantasy texture of the yarn allows you to do things in which the kids look especially cute and touching, and this contributes to the variety of colors of the yarn - from gentle pastel, to bright and rich colors. </p>

    <p>  In knitwear for women, ‚Äúweed‚Äù is often used to knit individual parts - collars, cuffs, flaps on pockets.  Due to the ‚Äúductility‚Äù and excessive softness of the yarn, the products made entirely of it poorly hold their shape and quickly stretch.  Therefore, it is recommended to combine knitting from "grass" with other types of yarn.  For example, a coat knitted from ‚Äúgrass‚Äù and regular wool in the form of a combination of <span>stripes</span> will look very impressive <span>: a strip</span> of ‚Äúgrass‚Äù, a strip of wool.  Fantasy yarn will give the product a bright decorative effect and unusualness, and stripes of wool will help maintain its shape.  The models where the coquette is made of ‚Äúgrass‚Äù and the bottom of the shelves and the back, as well as the sleeves, are made of ordinary smooth yarn are well obtained. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  From the "grass" it is very good to knit hats and scarves, all kinds of scarves, as well as ponchos and shawls.  Knitting from the "grass" of a small hat cut to the head does not require additional strengthening of the shape; it is enough to simply make a more dense edging along the edge.  Berets and hats with small margins also look very impressive, but it is advisable to duplicate them with a denser base to obtain the desired shape.  If you want the product to be more dense, it is better to crochet it, as knitting from the "grass" turns out to be very "loose". </p>

    <p>  For example, let's try <span>to knit a scarf-fox.</span>  You will need yarn ‚Äúgrass‚Äù of bright orange and white colors and smooth woolen yarn of orange color.  <span>The scarf is knitted</span> and crocheted.  First, a triangular muzzle in the form of a cone is crocheted from smooth wool in a circle, adding 2 loops in each second row.  The ‚Äúbody‚Äù of the chanterelles is knitted with knitting needles from an orange ‚Äúweed‚Äù into two strands with a straight cloth.  After tying the required length, one thread is torn off and one white thread is added.  The number of loops is gradually reduced, knitting in each second row through two front loops two loops together front.  The remaining 3 loops are knitted together.  Separately, they knit paws and sew foxes to the "body".  To highlight the tail, the body is pulled with a thread just below the point of attachment of the hind legs.  Then crochet the ears, sew them to the muzzle and connect the muzzle to the body.  On the muzzle, eyes are sewn from two black beads and black hair indicates the tip of the nose.  The scarf is ready. </p>

    <p>  Finally, decorative things connected from this fancy yarn are very beautifully obtained.  A bedspread knitted from ‚Äúgrass‚Äù will truly become a bedroom decoration, as well as multi-colored decorative pillows made of monophonic yarn or with a knitted colored ornament from ‚Äúgrass‚Äù of various colors.  More experienced and bold craftswomen can be advised to knit a pouf or chair cover out of this yarn. </p>
