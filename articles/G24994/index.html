Previously, they were symbols of power, position in society and could tell a lot about their owner.  Each bracelet was special, decorated with various attributes and often served as a talisman.  They were made of different materials: wood, metal, beads or shells. </p><p>  And now such bracelets do not go out of fashion.  Their symbolism has disappeared, but as a decoration they are very, very in demand.  Many people like to make bracelets with their own hands.  Most often they <span>are weaved from beads</span> or threads.  Such simple products are available for manufacture. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bracelets made of thread" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10994/53411.jpg" width="200"></div>  even to children.

    <p>  In the 60s, <span>thread bracelets</span> were very common among young people.  They were called baubles and were made from a wide variety of materials.  It was considered very stylish to wear a lot of bracelets.  They were weaved not only for themselves, but also given to each other, calling them ‚Äúbracelets of happiness‚Äù.  Many believed that they bring good luck. </p><p>  The best thread for weaving a bracelet is a floss.  These threads are durable, do not fade and have a very bright color and a wide variety of shades.  You do not need to separate the thread, so the bauble is more durable.  Traditionally, a bracelet made of floss thread </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mouline thread bracelet" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10994/53413.jpg" width="200"></div>  weave from an even number of threads, usually 8-10.  If you take less, it will turn out narrow and inexpressive.  The length of the thread for weaving should be 4-5 times longer than the finished product, usually about one meter is taken for its manufacture.

To work, you need threads and scissors.  In addition, you will need to fix your product somehow.  You can pin the yarn with a pin to a sofa or pillow, but the most convenient way is to use a nail driven into a board to which the starting material for weaving is tied.  For these purposes, you can use the tablet folder with a clip, under which the edge of the threads is laid. </p><p>  Better to start with a small amount of flowers.  Only when you master this technique well will it be possible to create more complex and beautiful bracelets from threads.  The easiest way to weave is with knots.  To do this, fasten the threads, tying them with a knot and attaching them to a nail or pin, carefully straighten them.  Then take the outermost thread and knit knots on each subsequent one by one.  You can make the same thread another row in the opposite direction.  And so with every thread. </p>

You can divide the threads into two parts and weave two braids.  For beauty, beads are sometimes woven.

    <p>  If you weave carefully, tightly placing the knots to each other, you will get an original and beautiful product.  You can experiment with the color and number of threads, tie in two knots or place them not directly, but obliquely. </p><p>  Another simple way to make bracelets from threads is based on a leather lace.  It is necessary to double the lace tightly wrapped with threads of different colors, alternating them.  You can weave different beads or use a metal chain for the base. </p><p>  A more complex way of weaving, with which you can make various patterns and inscriptions on the bracelet, is weaving with one thread.  It should be much longer than the others, since it is the leading one, all weaving is carried out by it.  In this way, you can weave rhombuses, circles and squares, your name or wish. </p><p>  Bracelets made of threads are an original and valuable gift, as well as a stylish jewelry that does not go out of fashion for a long time, especially among young people. </p>
