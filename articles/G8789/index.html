They are comfortable for everyday wear.  If you still have <span>old jeans</span> that you already wanted to throw away, do not rush.  Give them a second life, for example, in the form of slippers.  Sew a cozy thing that will warm your legs.  You will learn more about how to sew slippers from jeans with your own hands from this article. </p><h2>  What do we need? </h2><ul><li>  The main thing is, of course, the old jeans. </li><li>  A piece of cardboard (it will be needed to make a pattern). </li><li>  Scissors. </li><li>  Pencil. </li><li>  A piece of chalk. </li><li>  Needle. </li><li>  Threads. </li><li>  Sewing machine. </li><li>  Sewing pins. </li><li>  Sintepon - approximately 25 cm. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="slippers from old jeans" class="if uuid-3104864" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106515/3104864.jpg"></div><p>  Let's consider in stages how to sew slippers from jeans with your own hands with a pattern.  You yourself can make sure that creating comfortable slippers is very easy.  One day - one pair of slippers. </p><h2>  The first stage: we make a pattern </h2><p>  The easiest option: take the finished one.  It needs to be printed and enlarged to the required size.  But you can do the pattern yourself, and it is very simple to do.  To make it, take a sheet of cardboard, a pencil and a ruler.  Place your foot on the cardboard and draw a circle around it.  On each side, add one centimeter.  Cut the resulting pattern. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now you need to make a pattern of the top of slippers from jeans with your own hands.  It is a semicircle, similar in size to the bottom.  On the left and right sides, add two centimeters. </p><p>  As you can see, it‚Äôs not difficult to make a pattern yourself.  Its plus is that it is cut exactly on your foot. </p><h2>  The second stage: we prepare the material </h2><p>  We work with jeans.  With our main material.  Smooth them with an iron and carefully inspect.  Since we make slippers from old jeans with our own hands, it is likely that they have abrasions, which, in turn, have different shades. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.instructables.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY slippers" class="if uuid-3104827" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106515/3104827.jpg"></div><p>  For the top of the shoe, choose the most beautiful tone, preferably the same for the right and left slippers.  Lay the top pattern in the selected places and circle with chalk.  Cut the resulting parts with an allowance for seams (one centimeter). </p><p>  The rest of the details will not be visible on the leg, so they can be cut without any special selection. </p><h2>  Third stage: working with other tissues </h2><p>  Cut two parts of the sole and two pieces for the top from sintepon.  Use the same templates for this.  We will need these details carved from denim. </p><p>  Iron all the details again.  Arrange in the necessary parts. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The fourth stage: we make out the top sneaker </h2><p>  Fold the denim with a synthetic winterizer, which is sandwiched between pieces of denim.  Fix the parts with sewing pins and sweep them, 1.5 cm back from the edge. Sew the bow separately.  Do the same with the other slipper. </p><h2>  Fifth stage: working with the sole </h2><p>  Using the sewing pins, connect all the parts of the sole according to the already known pattern: a synthetic winterizer between jeans.  Sew them around the perimeter.  Also sweep part of the sock separately.  Repeat with the sole for the other leg.  All this will come in handy in further actions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.instructables.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="slippers from jeans do-it-yourself patterns" class="if uuid-3104828" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106515/3104828.jpg"></div><h2>  Sixth step: connect the sole and the top </h2><p>  The most responsible step.  The fact is that the strength and comfort of slippers made of jeans made by yourself depend on this.  Be extremely careful at this point. </p><p>  We start making out with the left slipper.  Connect the top and the sole with sewing pins. </p><p>  Remember that a synthetic winterizer should be inserted between the fabric.  Details from it are better to make a little less.  So the liners will not be sewn.  From this slippers will only become more comfortable and stronger. </p><p>  Do the same manipulations with the right slipper.  Home shoes are almost ready.  It remains only to decorate it. </p><h2>  Seventh stage: decorate slippers </h2><p>  Choose your favorite idea.  And you can show your imagination and create your own version of the design of slippers from jeans with your own hands. </p><ol><li>  Tapes.  Consider this option decoration.  Take the tape 60 centimeters and cut it into four parts of the same length.  From two ribbons tie a beautiful bow.  Cut off its ends obliquely and solder them with a lit match.  Also make a second bow.  Fasten the decoration on each slipper.  To do this, fasten the middle of the bow knot with the shoes themselves with stitches, using a needle with a thread. <div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": Midnightgypsycustoms, "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself slippers from old jeans" class="if uuid-3104831" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106515/3104831.jpg"></div></li><li>  Buttons.  Unusual solution from improvised means.  Buttons of different shapes and colors will definitely cheer you up.  In addition, it looks pretty impressive. </li><li>  Flowers  There are two options.  You can make small flowers yourself and decorate the top of slippers with them.  They can be made either from the same denim, some other fabric, or from leather.  Also in the fabric store you can buy ready-made flowers. <div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sew slippers from jeans do it yourself" class="if uuid-3104850" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106515/3104850.jpg"></div></li><li>  Hand embroidery.  If you own the technique of ironing or embroider a cross, then it will not be difficult for you to decorate slippers for everyone to see. </li><li>  Sequins, rhinestones and more.  Show your imagination.  Slippers decorated with beads, beads, sequins or rhinestones will look original. </li><li>  Muzzles of animals.  The funny faces depicted on the front of the slippers will also cheer you up.  In addition, they look very cute. </li></ol>
