    <p>  <span>A fluffy</span> tulle <span>skirt</span> that looks like a cloud or a whipped cream cake will decorate any female representative who is young with her soul.  To independently create such a work does not need special skills and secret knowledge, it is enough just to be able to scribble on a typewriter and not fall into longing from a rather long monotonous work. </p><p>  <strong>DIY tulle skirt</strong> </p><p>  The product that we will sew is made based on the American Pettiskirt models, you can find its samples on the Internet by entering this name in the search engine.  Of course, there are differences between the self-sewn and branded item, but the overall impressions are very similar.  So why not give it a try?  The master class describes cutting and tailoring a skirt for a girl of five years of age.  Its finished length is 30 cm. So, let's begin! </p><p>  <strong>Material selection</strong> </p><p>  The original pettiskirt skirts are made of nylon chiffon, but in Russia this fabric is almost impossible to find on sale.  Either you have to order it from the United States, or use the available analogues.  Nylon chiffon is very light, almost weightless, while it holds its shape perfectly.  In addition, the edges of this material do not crumble, so they do not need to be trimmed at all.  Most of all, nylon chiffon looks like a nylon for tights, smooth and completely non-short. </p><p>  But since it‚Äôs quite difficult to get it, we will use what we have.  Option - tulle skirt.  Of course, he is somewhat harsh and pricks, so you need to choose the softest of those proposed.  You can also use lining nylon, devoid of the drawbacks of tulle, but it is heavy, because of which the skirt from it does not hold its shape and looks "fallen".  For tiers, you can also use this material so that the finished product looks more fluffy, almost like a pack of a ballerina, only more voluminous.  There is another option - sew tiers from chiffon, so that the result is as close as possible to the original. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A tulle skirt for its sewing will require: </p><ol><li>  Non-woven. </li><li>  Chiffon or tulle (for tiers). </li><li>  Satin or satin (for coquette). </li><li>  Fatin (for ruffles). </li><li>  Elastic band 25 mm wide. </li><li>  Tape. </li></ol><p>  Our skirt of tulle and chiffon consists, in fact, of two completely identical skirts.  Having made them colorful, you can get a two-sided product, that is, in fact, two outfits in one.  Let‚Äôs clarify the terminology: </p><p>  - The yoke is the top of the skirt.  Ribbon and elastic are sewn into it, and satin tiers are sewn to the bottom.  A 5-year-old child needs a strip of satin 1 m 22 cm long and 19 cm wide. </p><p>  - tiers - parts on which frills are attached.  They need chiffon cuts, one of which is 7 meters long and 9 cm wide, and the second is 16 meters long and 11 cm wide. </p><p>  - ruffles - the basis of the splendor of the skirt.  They are a 44-meter strip of tulle 7 cm wide. </p><p>  <strong>Work stages</strong> </p><ol><li>  All fatin is cut into strips of 7 cm wide.  To facilitate the process will help the paper cut the right size, which you can navigate when cutting. </li></ol><p>  2. The resulting ribbons are rolled into hanks.  A bunch of skeins is impressive! </p><p>  3. Cut the fabric into strips of the right size for the tiers (9 and 11 cm). </p><p>  4. On the sewing machine (seam zigzag) or on the overlock we process the edges of the chiffon.  At the same time, you need to ensure that the different halves of the skirt do not mix! </p><p>  5. For each half, we sew the chiffon stripes together and close in a ring. </p><p>  6. Be careful at the final stage, make sure that the ring does not twist. </p><p>  7. Now it‚Äôs the turn of the ruffle.  We add tulle strips to the basting thread one after another: the beginning of the next one is superimposed on the end of the previous one.  The length of the ruffle should be equal to the length of the lower tier. </p><p>  8. Attach ruffles to the lower tier of the skirt. </p><p>  9. Assemble the second tier to the size of the first (top) and sew them. </p><p>  10. Repeat all operations for the second half of the skirt. </p><p>  11. Cut the yoke out of satin and lay the long sides of the workpiece with non-woven fabric. </p><p>  12. Fold the strip across in half. </p><p>  13. Leave the mark in the strip for the seam, to subsequently insert the elastic there.  Sew on it and twist. </p><p>  14. On the front side, lay 2 lines along the elastic line. </p><p>  15. We fold the halves of the skirt with the wrong sides to each other and sew to the bottom of the yoke. </p><p>  16. We put in an elastic band to which we attach a ribbon.  That's all! </p><p>  This magnificent tulle skirt will adorn the wardrobe of both little fashionistas and well-held ladies.  Such forms are especially relevant for clubs and other entertainment venues, where you can afford to be somewhat frivolous in spite of all conventions. </p>
