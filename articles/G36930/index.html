  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Maldives or Dominican Republic: where and when is it better to relax</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Those who want to relax on the paradise coast often ask the question: what to choose - the Maldives or the Dominican Republic?  It should be noted that these two places have very little in common.  And it will not be difficult to determine which is better - the Maldives or the Dominican Republic, if we take into account the individual characteristics of a person. </p><h2>  Which is cheaper </h2><p>  When viewed from a price point of view, the Dominican Republic clearly wins.  Prices for holidays in the Maldives are much higher.  Especially the difference is visible in the all-inclusive system.  And for the same amount you can afford a 5-star hotel in the Dominican Republic and 4-star in the Maldives.  And if we consider budget hotels, then in the latter case, a person will only rent a guest house. </p><h2>  Weather </h2><p>  Prices for holidays in the Maldives are lower from November to April due to the fact that during this period it often rains.  The same applies to the Dominican Republic, but it manifests itself in it much less brightly, however, in winter it is colder here than in the Maldives.  However, someone is quite happy with this. </p><h2>  Flight </h2><p>  Those who wondered how much to fly from Moscow to the Dominican Republic by direct flight should take into account that this will be a long way.  There are flights with transfers, but there are also direct flights.  Moreover, there are more of the latter in the Dominican Republic than in the Maldives.  At the last point, planes fly only a couple of times a week. </p><h2>  Features of rest </h2><p>  In comparing the Maldives and the Dominican Republic, one must take into account that the former are a rather specific place.  Hotels are most often located on individual islands.  The atmosphere on them is extremely calm.  And some in this setting get bored.  But the question of what to see in the Dominican Republic, what to do in it, there are many answers.  There are a lot of animation staff, water parks, golf courses, casinos are open.  And few here miss. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  The same is true for excursions.  In the Maldives they are almost not found, a maximum of trips around the islands and snorkeling.  While in the Dominican Republic there are many excursion programs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tourist-destinations.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dominican Church" class="if uuid-3146427" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98582/3146427.jpg"></div><p>  When choosing the Maldives or the Dominican Republic, you need to remember that the former are a country consisting of islets.  There are beautiful landscapes, but many people will go crazy from boredom among them.  It makes sense to lie quietly on the paradise beaches. </p><h2>  General </h2><p>  In the beach season, the Maldives and the Dominican Republic have a lot in common - both countries are located at the equator, they are famous for the tropical climate.  In addition, their hotels are known for their excellent service, and the beach season remains open throughout the year.  Resorts are also famous for white sand, clean water.  People often come here to organize a wedding ceremony, and Russians do not need a visa. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dominicanrepublic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="when it‚Äôs cheaper to relax in the Maldives" class="if uuid-3146412" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98582/3146412.jpg"></div><h2>  Geographic differences </h2><p>  <span>Maldives is</span> located in the middle of the Indian Ocean, there are only 1,190 of them.  They are famous for beautiful landscapes with blue lagoons, white sand.  Local vegetation deserves attention. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Dominican Republic is located on a separate island between North and South America.  It is located east of Haiti.  The Caribbean Sea is washed from the southern borders of the country, and the Atlantic from the northern borders.  In addition, the country has several small islands.  When choosing the Maldives or the Dominican Republic, it should be borne in mind that the flight from Moscow to the last country takes 12 hours. </p><p>  In the Maldives, the temperature dominates all year round at 30 degrees, the water is heated to around 26 degrees.  When choosing when it is cheaper to relax in the Maldives, you should pay attention to the period from May to October - winds and rains make this time not so popular among tourists.  Between November and February, the weather is more comfortable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="expatliving.sg" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="holidays in maldives prices" class="if uuid-3146411" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98582/3146411.jpg"></div><p>  The Dominican Republic has a warm, humid climate.  In winter, the temperature reaches 26 degrees, and in the summer - 32 degrees.  From May to October there is the most rainfall.  At the same moment they are short-lived.  Water is heated to 28 degrees. </p><p>  When choosing the Maldives or the Dominican Republic, it is worth considering that in the first country tourists are often offered "water bungalows" - houses on stilts over the water.  Yacht cabins are also popular.  And the price for such happiness is exactly the same as for a hotel room. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  What to see </h2><p>  On the big island of the Dominican Republic there are famous restaurants with bars, spa salons with pools.  Hotels here are much larger than in the Maldives.  In the latter is the smallest capital of the world, which is located on an island of 6 square kilometers.  And here the Presidential Palace, the National Museum are located, several Muslim institutions are open, there is a beach and a street with shops.  Those who prefer the Maldives or the Dominican Republic first are impressed by the wealth hidden in the waves of the local ocean.  We are talking about corals, their inhabitants.  This is a unique and bewitching sight.  As a rule, hotels provide immersion services and familiarization with these phenomena.  For surf lovers, the conditions are also excellent. </p><p>  And a completely different picture - in the Dominican Republic.  Popular sights of the capital - Santo Domingo.  The discoverer of these places was Christopher Columbus, and there is a lot of interesting information about him in local museums.  They also contain medieval artifacts.  Nature is also picturesque - a place was found for everything: waterfalls, caves, mountain rivers, salt ponds.  The bays have a lot of unique flora and fauna.  Diving, snorkeling and rafting training services are also provided.  There is a unique opportunity to watch whale mating.  This happens from January to May. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dive-the-world.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Maldives and Dominican Republic beach season" class="if uuid-3146435" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98582/3146435.jpg"></div><h2>  Limitations </h2><p>  The tranquility of the Maldives is due to the Muslim culture of the local people.  So, even topless is forbidden to sunbathe here.  You can not bring alcoholic beverages, take them outside the hotel.  You will need to close the body from the shoulders to the knees, getting out into the city.  And there is hardly any resort with an animation program.  But in every hotel there are proposals for weddings, romantic meetings.  For this reason couples often visit the Maldives. </p><p>  The Dominican Republic in this regard is a completely free country, in which rum flows like a river and thunders of entertainment.  Outside the hotel there are many nightclubs; world-famous stars perform at some venues.  The local population loves to dance and, at any opportunity, does it. </p><h2>  Souvenirs </h2><p>  Visitors to the Maldives most often return home with crafts from coconut, shells, and wooden products.  Shark jaw, coconut oil are popular.  Miniature local boats, drums, and embroidered clothes are also brought. </p><p>  While in the Dominican Republic they buy coffee, cocoa, cigars.  Russians return to their homeland with local drinks - rum, liquors.  Lima dolls are also a popular souvenir.  The local population sells wooden products, corporate-style paintings. </p><h2>  Currency </h2><p>  In the Maldives, the currency is called Maldivian rufiah.  But as a rule, dollars, credit cards are accepted for payment.  There are bank branches, currency exchange points.  There is a tradition here to include tips in the bill automatically.  Otherwise, gratuities are welcome, and it is best to have small money going to a restaurant.  It is not customary to leave taxi drivers for tea.  Prices are high, and the all-inclusive system will cost $ 2,000 for 2 people in 7 days.  This is the minimum bar. </p><div class="photo" data-original="exploredominicanrepublic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dominican Republic Restaurants" class="if uuid-3146416" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98582/3146416.jpg"></div><p>  In the Dominican Republic, everyone pays for the <span>Dominican peso.</span>  But in tourist areas accept dollars, bank cards.  But you should not rely on the euro to come in handy - quite rarely this currency is accepted for payment. </p><p>  There is also a tradition here to leave tips, and in some places they are already being included in the restaurant bill.  Local fruits and vegetables are sold at low prices, but everything imported will be very expensive.  Trips to the Dominican Republic have recently lost in value.  And more and more tourists come here who do not have great financial opportunities.  So, a 3 star hotel on an all-inclusive system will cost about $ 800 per one.  And if you look for a better hotel, it could cost $ 1,500 for two. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  So, in the Maldives, a tourist may not like the lack of attractions, excursions, as well as the low quality of food.  There are high prices, but the concept of excursion service is not at all.  Two weeks on the islands may seem boring.  For children, this can also become a torment, because there will be no entertainment for them.  But if a person purposefully seeks relaxation with solitude with nature, this resort will suit him as well as possible.  To enjoy the variety of local cuisine, it makes sense to go to the "outback", as tourist cafes are aimed at selling fast food of not the highest quality.  Together with the flight, accommodation will be expensive.  But if a person seeks to dive under the water, the Maldives is the best choice. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.com.sg" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Maldivian restaurant" class="if uuid-3146438" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98582/3146438.jpg"></div><p>  In the Dominican Republic, food will be expensive.  This is probably due to higher prices for imported products.  However, local delicacies - seafood and fruits - will also be expensive.  You will need to look for national dishes, since, as a rule, tourist restaurants sell typical American food.  After all, the country is next to the United States.  The quality of the food is poor.  And even in prestigious restaurants, food from McDonald's is served, which tourists can try in large quantities at home.  At the same moment, the country is famous for its black coffee.  According to tourists, his taste is unique.  This is one of the most popular gifts that Russians often bring after a trip to the Dominican Republic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.selectcaribbean.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dominican fruits" class="if uuid-3146414" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98582/3146414.jpg"></div><p>  But as a rule, coffee at home is no longer as tasty.  Therefore, experienced tourists are advised to ask the local population for the secrets of its preparation.  It readily tells them.  It is recommended to buy real coffee in the market, as imported products are found in stores.  When going to the Dominican Republic, it is worth considering the low level of security in the country.  Crime thrives in it.  For this reason, those who plan to walk at night, it is better to pay attention to other resort countries.  Theft is very frequent.  With regard to women, the local population can behave aggressively.  Guided tours are recommended.  Alone, you should not go to study the area.  It is not recommended to leave children unattended. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, the Maldivian resorts are best suited for those who seek tranquility and unity with nature on the picturesque islands, who are inspired by diving with the study of coral reefs.  Resorts of this kind are popular with family people, couples.  But if Muslim traditions remain alien to man, and strict foundations are incomprehensible, it is better to take care of the search for other directions. </p><p>  Holidays in the Dominican Republic can afford people with different budgets and expectations.  There is something to do for lovers of extreme relaxation, picturesque landscapes, excursion programs, as well as those who like to relax without any restrictions and have fun.  There are no strict prohibitions here. </p><p>  For this reason, there is no unequivocal answer to the question which is better - Dominican Republic or Maldives.  At different periods of life, the same person will find different answers to him, finding his charms in the first and second versions, depending on his mood. </p>
