    <h2>  Smartphone Options </h2><p>  The ZTE Blade L2 equipment looks very modest against the background of similar devices.  Reviews and information about him once again indicate this.  It is immediately worth noting that the battery is integrated into the device, that is, it is non-removable.  The list of complete accessories for this gadget is as follows: </p><ul><li><p>  A proprietary charger with a USB output connector and a current of 0.7 A. </p></li><li><p>  A wired stereo headset, which also plays the role of an antenna when playing radio. </p></li><li><p>  Interface cord. </p></li><li><p>  <span>Warranty card</span> and user manual. </p>

White will appeal more to the weak half of humanity - women.  But the second option, in black, is more practical and versatile.  It‚Äôs just that ZTE Blade L2 BLACK will not get dirty so quickly.  Reviews <strong> </strong>  this is naturally confirmed.  The front panel of the gadget, as noted earlier, is made of plastic with a glossy finish.  It simply attracts dirt and dust, fingerprints remain on it.  To solve this problem, you will have to additionally buy a special protective film.  At the bottom of the screen is a typical panel for organizing the management of this device, consisting of three buttons.  Above the screen, as expected, there is a conversational speaker, a front camera for video conversations and a number of touch elements. </p>

    <p>  On each side of the device there is at least one communication or control element.  Given the diagonal of the touch screen of 5 inches, this solution is not entirely justified.  It will not be too convenient to control a mobile phone with just one hand.  The lock button is located on the right edge of the gadget, the volume control buttons are displayed on the left side.  On the bottom side of the smart smartphone, there is a conversational microphone and a wired microUSB port.  A typical wired connector, 3.5 mm, is mounted on the upper rib.  The back cover, as mentioned earlier, is made of plastic with a matte finish.  This approach is fully justified, dirt is not collected on it and fingerprints do not remain.  The main camera is displayed on top of it.  Nearby is a single LED backlight.  Below it is a loud speaker. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  CPU, graphics adapter and memory </h2><p>  The time-tested and highly reliable processor solution is used in the ZTE Blade L2.  Reviews <strong> </strong>  distinguish this feature of it.  But, on the other hand, MT6582 (and such a nominal chip is installed in this smart phone) can not boast of a high level of performance.  If last year solutions based on it could be attributed to the middle segment of devices, now these are budget smartphones.  The gadget has 4 cores based on the Cortex A7 architecture, which can accelerate to 1.3 GHz in maximum load mode.  The performance of this chip is still enough to run any application, but the settings for the most demanding toys will not be maximum.  But the time is not far off when there will be software that will not function on this CPU.  But at the same time, its computing capabilities are enough to solve most everyday tasks. </p>

    <p>  The processor is supplemented by a graphics accelerator - Mali-400MP.  But with this memory, things are completely bad with this smartphone.  The amount of RAM it has is 1 GB, and the capacity of the integrated flash drive is 4 GB.  In this case, the user is allocated only 2.5 GB.  This is clearly not enough for comfortable work on the device.  There is a slot for installing flash cards.  The maximum size can be 32 GB.  This allows to some extent solve the problem of lack of memory on this gadget. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  One of the most controversial issues is the display that the <span>ZTE</span> Blade L2 is equipped with.  Reviews, on the one hand, indicate its large diagonal of 5 inches.  But, on the other hand, its resolution is 480x854.  Such technical parameters lead to the fact that the picture on it will be grainy.  Although not very strong, but it will be noticeable.  Another feature of the device is that its screen is based on a TFT matrix.  This technology is obsolete today.  Its key disadvantage is a significant distortion of the image when the device is rotated.  In normal work, such as watching a movie or reading a book, this is not critical.  But during the game in the same ‚ÄúAsphalt 8‚Äù this can greatly spoil the gameplay process.  After all, the smartphone must be twisted in the hands during the race, and this without fail will lead to the distortion of the picture on the display. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  As previously noted, the battery is built into the ZTE Blade L2.  Reviews mark the controversy of such a design decision.  This does not affect the quality of the device‚Äôs assembly, but if the battery fails, you just can‚Äôt do without the help of a specialized center for repairing mobile gadgets.  The declared nominal battery capacity is 2000 mAh.  If you load the device to the maximum, then this is enough for 4-5 hours of continuous operation.  With an average level of use of the gadget, this value will increase to 2 days.  If you save battery life as much as possible, then you can stretch 3 days on a single charge. </p>

    <h2>  Interfaces </h2><p>  This smartphone is equipped with all the necessary interfaces for exchanging information with the outside world.  This is GSM, and 3G, and Wi-Fi, and ‚ÄúBluetooth‚Äù, and GPS, and A-GPS, and microUSB, and 3.5 mm.  All this is in the <span>ZTE Blade L2.</span>  <span>Customer reviews</span> say that the quality and reliability of any of the previously mentioned interfaces, both wired and wireless, is not satisfactory.  That is, from the position of data exchange, this device has no weaknesses. </p><h2>  User Feedback </h2><p>  The most complaints are the cameras in the ZTE Blade L2 Black.  Reviews say that their real values ‚Äã‚Äãdo not match the declared specifications.  The main one is based on a 8 megapixel sensor.  But, most likely, its real value is 5 megapixels, and the claimed 8 megapixels are obtained <span>by interpolation.</span>  Exactly the same situation with the front camera.  The claimed 1 megapixel is obtained using the same interpolation of 0.3 megapixels.  This is what causes most users of this gadget dissatisfaction.  Another problem is the dimness of the front panel of the smartphone.  I have to buy a normal film and stick it.  Likewise, a case is needed to protect the case.  It is also not included in the package.  Well, to solve the problem of lack of memory, you have to additionally purchase an external flash drive.  Otherwise, as for an entry-level device, this smartphone is quite acceptable. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  Only 4,625 rubles is currently rated smartphone ZTE Blade L2.  Reviews <strong> </strong>  indicate that this is not so much.  It has a screen diagonal of 5 inches, the processor, of course, cannot boast of a high level of performance, but it is quite enough to solve a wide range of tasks.  For a similar amount and with such parameters, it will be difficult to find something better. </p>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  If before there were no entry-level devices that would cost less than 5,000 rubles and have a screen diagonal of 5 inches, now the situation has changed dramatically.  One such device is the ZTE Blade L2.  Reviews indicate that in its niche this gadget has virtually no competitors.  He has certain shortcomings, but they are offset by a price tag of 4625 rubles.  This is a great phone for every day, which can easily cope with the most common tasks at the moment. </p>
