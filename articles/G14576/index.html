They are made of plastic, wood, porcelain and other materials.  Some cost several hundred rubles, others cost several thousand dollars.  We are moved by some, scared of others, admired by others ... </p><h2>  About reborn dolls </h2><p>  A separate direction in doll making is reborn.  They are also called "living."  Reborn dolls are as realistic as possible.  At first glance, it might seem that this is a living child.  The weight and height of the doll matches the baby‚Äôs real parameters.  The folds of skin, delicate hair and realistic eyes - everything is exactly like a real child.  Therefore, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow to make a reborn doll yourself does not leave the heads of hundreds of people. </p><p>  The process of creating such a toy takes a lot of time, since many techniques and materials are used.  As a rule, reborn dolls are not manufactured in series - this is a piece, very painstaking work.  A photography wizard can reproduce the image of a specific child.  Reburns became popular in Russia a little over 10 years ago, but have already won the hearts of people.  Many puppet masters have queues for making such a doll.  If you don‚Äôt know how to make a reborn doll yourself, then look for the answer in the text below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.worthpoint.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a reborn doll yourself" class="if uuid-3124671" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/126645/3124671.jpg"></div><h2>  The story of the creation of reborn dolls </h2><p>  Translated from English, reborn means "reborn, reborn."  Logically, these are dolls that look like little newborn babies.  The history of their creation goes back to the 90s of the last century.  Designers from the USA wanted to create the most realistic dolls.  The target audience was considered collectors.  The first doll via the Internet was sold in 2002 from the eBay website. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After a few years, not only collectors began to buy reborn.  Many women became interested in such babies, each for their own reasons - someone regretted that the children had grown up quickly, someone had no children at all, still others simply harmoniously entered them into the interior of the bedrooms.  In addition, you can make a reborn doll yourself. </p><h2>  Art training </h2><p>  You can find a large number of lessons on how to make a reborn doll.  Full-time training is practically not carried out due to the complexity of the process and the inability to make a toy in one day. </p><p>  It is worth noting that you need to learn from famous and sought-after masters.  Even the high price of training courses should not be an obstacle, as the master will share his secrets and best practices that have been accumulated by experience more than one year.  As you can see, the question of how to make a reborn doll with your own hands is solved quite simply.  The main thing is patience. </p><h2>  How to make a reborn doll at home </h2><p>  The first step in the creation is the degreasing of mold.  You can buy it in many online stores.  You need to do this with a solvent.  As a rule, the mold will be made of vinyl.  The kit includes a blank of the face, pens and legs.  In this case, the body is sewn from fabric and printed.  Also in the sets you can see the body of the doll.  Such a reborn will be as realistic as possible compared to a real child.  As a rule, such molds are used when there is little clothing on the doll (or not at all). </p><div class="photo" data-original="discourse.bountifulbaby.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a reborn doll yourself" class="if uuid-3124678" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/126645/3124678.jpg"></div><p>  Usually work begins with the head.  Holes are made on the blank in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe nose and eyes, if necessary, since they already exist on some molds, or not at all, since the doll can be made sleeping. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At the beginning of the work, the master reborn painter applies several layers of paint to Moldova.  As a rule, their number varies from 15 to 30. For this, he uses acrylic or oil paints.  They are applied with a sponge, sponge or brush.  After each layer, the mold is baked at a certain temperature.  Next, a fixative is applied to add a dull color to the skin.  It should be noted right away that you can bake the workpiece in the oven, but then it is forbidden to cook food in it.  When painting the workpiece for the most realistic effect, you can make slight reddening of the skin. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.worthpoint.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="make the reborn doll yourself" class="if uuid-3124674" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/126645/3124674.jpg"></div><p>  Next, artificial eyes and hair are fixed.  The latter are made, as a rule, from mohair, or use real ones.  This process is called rooting.  The smaller the doll is made in age, the thinner the hair should be.  Do not forget about the cilia (if the designer is going to insert them). </p><p>  When working with pens, some craftsmen insert artificial nails.  Of course, the similarity with a real child rises several times, but the cost of work, of course, increases. </p><div class="photo" data-original="michigan-made.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a reborn doll out of paper" class="if uuid-3124679" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/126645/3124679.jpg"></div><p>  Then the doll should be filled.  To do this, you can use the syntep.  It does not caking over time, when creasing, it quickly regains its shape, and is affordable.  In order for the doll‚Äôs weight to be as close to realistic as possible, the body should be filled with glass granulate. </p><p>  You also need to pay special attention to doll clothes.  It can be either an ordinary diaper for a very young baby, or a larger dress for a girl, and for a boy you can sew some costume.  The doll is ready.  As you can see, the question of how to make a reborn doll itself is solved quite simply.  You can make this toy even out of paper. </p><h2>  How to make a reborn doll out of paper </h2><p>  Such toys are made in a completely different way, unlike a vinyl doll.  There is nothing to do with the technology described above.  Apparently, there is a reason in the name - everything that is as close as possible to the look of a real baby can be called "reborn" in his work. </p><p>  How to make a paper doll in literally 10 minutes?  To do this, on a white sheet, you need to draw (or rather print for greater realism) the image of the doll, then cut it out.  You can also make removable clothes for the resulting paper toy. </p><h2>  Emotional connection with reborn doll </h2><p>  For many women and even entire families, rebirths are a substitute for a living baby.  Some ‚Äúnewly minted mothers‚Äù are so preoccupied with caring for the doll that they wash their heads, rock them, change clothes, take them out for a walk, and even buy toys.  Also, many couples who do not want to have children buy such a doll and take care of it.  You can buy a toy with a fake birth certificate or adoption certificate. </p><p>  On the one hand, this can be regarded as a mental disorder, on the other hand, therapeutic therapy (for example, if a woman cannot have children).  A doll can cause a strong emotional attachment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dhgate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="reborn dolls how to make at home" class="if uuid-3124672" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/126645/3124672.jpg"></div><h2>  How to sell a doll </h2><p>  Many craftsmen make excellent money on making reborn with their own hands.  It is impossible to meet such a doll gathering dust on store shelves.  Works are bought mainly through the Internet.  The main places of sales work online stores, blogs. </p><p>  In the Russian market, as in the CIS, such dolls have not yet become universally popular.  The market of the USA and Canada is a completely different matter.  There, rebuys are bought much more readily for fairly good amounts. </p><p>  In order to quickly sell the doll, you need to try to make a high-quality photo.  Indeed, if it ‚Äúhooks‚Äù the eyes of a potential client, then the chance to sell it grows several times.  Then you need to make a detailed description of what the doll is made of, its height, weight.  If it‚Äôs hard to determine the price, you can see the work of other masters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.popscreen.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Two reborn dolls" class="if uuid-3124681" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/126645/3124681.jpg"></div><h2>  Doll price </h2><p>  On the Russian market, reborn dolls cost an average of 20 to 100 thousand rubles.  The price is influenced by many factors: the degree of realism with a real child, the quality of the materials used, the size of the doll, the availability of clothes, etc. </p><p>  The rather high cost makes such dolls too expensive for many.  They should not be allowed to children to play to avoid damage.  They serve for aesthetic pleasure.  It is impossible to make two absolutely identical dolls, hence another criterion for the high price - the buyer will have an exclusive item. </p>
