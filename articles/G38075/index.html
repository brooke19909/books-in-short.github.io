The filmstrips themselves are special cartridges with an audio track and slides. </p><h2>  How to use? </h2><p>  The device is quite simple to operate, which is confirmed by the positive reviews on the "Firefly" overhead projector.  The cartridge must be installed in the projector and the book inserted in the remote control.  Then it is enough to direct the slide projector to any surface.  Users can independently select the operating mode of the device.

Long one fairy tale is no more than 26 minutes.  The book includes illustrations and the text itself.  All filmstrips for children use illustrations by professional and famous artists, and some tales are voiced by the writers themselves.  Some works are voiced by television and radio hosts, as well as honored artists.  Filmstrips are recorded at a professional recording studio.  All cartridges for the Firefly slide projector contain melodies and songs familiar to everyone since childhood. </p><h2>  Device functionality </h2><section id="product-1" class="product"><p>  The filmoscope is designed to demonstrate illustrations from a standard 35 mm film.  If parents still have fairy tales from their childhood, you can also see them.  In order for the device to last as long as possible, it is not recommended to use it for more than one hour. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.toyset.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Filmoscope Firefly" class="if uuid-3179217" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3179217.jpg"></div><p>  What can an audio slide projector do?  The device plays sound cartridges in several modes: </p></section><ul><li>  independent reading - the projector produces an image, and the text is voiced by parents; </li><li>  voice option - simultaneous playback of music and text with self-switching slides; </li><li>  automatic playback - the projector independently reproduces the sound and displays the image. </li></ul><p>  On the body there are control buttons and a sound control lever.  It is important to know that when you turn on the device, music turns on at maximum volume.  The user can direct the lens to the desired location as the body moves in an arc, up and down.  Some reviews of the Firefly slide projector indicate that the design moves quite hard, and sometimes even seizes. </p><h2>  Image feature </h2><p>  Users talk about the fact that the device produces a not very clear picture.  Despite the fact that the manufacturer claims that the image can be customized, in fact this does not happen.  If in one place the picture becomes clear, then in another it becomes cloudy.  However, children with great pleasure watch cartoons and listen to fairy tales, report user reviews. </p><h2>  The nuances of using </h2><p>  Many users report that kids love to study their shadows using a beam from the projector.  However, if during the game it is unsuccessful to touch the base of the device, the filmstrip is reset and starts over. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ozon.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sound overhead projector" class="if uuid-3179214" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3179214.jpg"></div><p>  If the filmstrip freezes, just turn on the projector again and continue watching.  Reviews of the Firefly slide projector indicate that cartoons can be watched on any surface: bathroom tiles, cabinets, striped wallpapers, etc. </p><h2>  Public opinion </h2><p>  Many parents are opposed to televisions, tablets and smartphones.  Reviews say that the Firefly slide projector perfectly replaces various gadgets, and also allows you to plunge into the atmosphere of a cloudless childhood.  The colorful case attracts the attention of young children, as many users talk about.  The projector has a compact size and a convenient handle is provided on the case.  The toy is very light, so the child can independently carry it and watch cartoons in any room.  Reviews of the Firefly slide projector are noted: the projector device is very simple, so even a 3-year-old can insert cartridges.  Users can independently adjust the volume using the buttons.  Reviews of the "Firefly" slide projector indicate that the toy has several modes of operation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.babyblog.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cartridges for overhead projectors" class="if uuid-3179223" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3179223.jpg"></div><p>  The slide projector can turn over the pictures and voice their content.  You can also select the manual mode, in which slides and sound are played as desired.  To improve the clarity of the image, just twist the lens of the device in different directions.  Specific filmstrips created specifically for this toy are suitable for the projector.  Included with the cartridges are small books with a specific fairy tale.  Users recommend watching filmstrips on a white ceiling or light wall.  Many liked the high-quality and diverse voicing of pictures.  Most parents were satisfied with the purchase, since such a thing can last more than one year.  It is convenient to take a toy with you on a visit or to the country.  Children show great interest in slide projectors, which is confirmed by numerous positive reviews.  Many parents claim that the slide projector can be used for entertainment and educational purposes. </p><h2>  Criticism </h2><p>  The main drawback is the lack of 100% image sharpness.  Many users report that it is difficult to find cartridges for the Firefly slide projector, and their cost is quite high.  When adjusting the direction, the housing may become stuck in the base.  Overhead projector requires careful and accurate handling.  Some comments contain information that for the normal operation of the ‚ÄúFirefly‚Äù 7 AA batteries are required, which are enough for about six months. </p><h2>  Brief conclusion </h2><p>  Many children enjoy filmstrips and listen to fairy tales.  Users claim that the benefits of such a pastime are much greater than from the TV.  Young viewers are not confused by the lack of image sharpness, so this drawback is significant only for parents.  Filmstrips delight users with the sound quality. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sidex.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sound slide projector Firefly" class="if uuid-3179215" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3179215.jpg"></div><p>  According to many parents, their children are captured by the image of the pictures on the ceiling.  A child can watch interesting cartoons independently and with great interest. </p>
