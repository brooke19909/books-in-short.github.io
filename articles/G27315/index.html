    <h2>  History </h2><p>  The Swabian district got its name in honor of Germans who speak a special, Swabian dialect of the German language.  Swabia and Memmingen have a long and interesting history.  In the fifth century, tribes of Alemans lived on the territory of the modern city. </p><p>  For the first time, the name of the city was mentioned in a donation agreement of 1128, which stated that the lands of Memmingen were granted to the Oxenhausen Monastery.  The city began to develop when the salt expeditions of the Roman Empire began to pass through it.  Memmingen is in the documents and is referred to as a parking lot on the way to salt traders who were traveling from Germany to Italy.  Such a good location contributed to the rapid development and enrichment of the settlement.  In 1438, the city received the status of a free city of the Roman Empire. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Back in 1506, the merchants of Memmingen could afford to equip their own ship for a foreign expedition with the aim of buying overseas goods.  Residents of the city were part of many of the governing bodies of the empire.  In 1522, Memmingen took an active part in the Reformation and sided with the Protestants.  In 1525, the first human <span>rights bill</span> in Europe, the so-called collection of ‚ÄúTwelve Articles,‚Äù was adopted here. </p><p>  In the 17th century, the importance of the city decreases, its wealth is gradually lost, and in 1803, after the attack of the Bavarian army, the settlement became part of Bavaria.  Numerous sights of Memmingen keep a memory of various historical events and eras.  Some of the historic buildings were destroyed during the bombing during World War II, the most valuable buildings were reconstructed. </p>

    <h2>  What to see </h2><p>  For day trips from Munich, tourists often choose Memmingen.  What to see in this city?  All attractions are concentrated in Altstadt (Old Town).  Walking around the city, you need to pay attention to the main attractions, which will be discussed below.  It is also worth looking at the drawings on the houses that have been preserved here since the Middle Ages.  Be sure to walk along the river surrounded by lovely Bavarian houses, find the houses where the commander <span>A. Suvorov</span> and the Russian Emperor Alexander the First stayed, as well as the oldest pharmacy Unicorn in 1489 and the painted building of the former customs of the late 15th century. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The Weavers Guild House, one of the city‚Äôs most beautiful half-timbered buildings, and the Fuger House of the late 16th century deserve special attention. </p><p>  The city is literally created for walking, it is worth walking along Maximilianstrasse, Heerenstrasse and going out to Wine Market and Grain Market Square, looking at the fisherman‚Äôs fountain and completing the trip in one of the authentic restaurants or on Market Square, where a farm products fair operates twice a week. </p>

    <h2>  House with seven roofs </h2><p>  Memmingen's most significant sights date back to the Middle Ages.  The abundance of salt, an important element in the leather industry in the Middle Ages, led to the fact that many craft workshops for dressing hides and furs were opened in the city.  For drying furs, an unusual structure was built with several ventilation openings in the roof.  The house received the nickname in honor of its specific design, which looks like a four-story roof with windows creating the necessary drafts. </p><p>  The building was erected in the 15th century on the foundation of a more ancient house.  When the tanning industry began to decline, the seven-roofed house was converted into a hotel.  During the bombing during the Second World War, the building was badly damaged, but after the end of hostilities, hardworking swabs quickly restored the house, while they tried as much as possible to use the original materials. </p><h2>  Town Hall </h2><p>  In all the ancient cities of Europe, the house where the leadership of the settlement sits is one of the most <span>beautiful buildings,</span> Memmingen was no exception.  <span>The town hall of this</span> Swabian village began to be built at the end of the 16th century, but it acquires its present form only by 1765.  This beautiful building in the Rococo style, with spectacular onion domes, is today the city hall.  This beautiful snow-white building, with spectacular bay windows and three towers, is decorated with elegant stucco molding, organically combines once fashionable elements of the French style and the traditional German silhouette of the pediment. </p>

    <h2>  Kirche of Saint Martin </h2><p>  The brutal stone building on the Herenstrasse is one of the oldest religious institutions in the region.  Church of St. Martin in the style of harsh Gothic architecture was built at the end of the 15th century on the site of the old Romanesque basilica.  The 65-meter tower of the cathedral remains the tallest building in the city today.  On the facade of the church you can see a painted clock dial made in the middle of the 16th century.  The interior of the cathedral is decorated with spectacular stellar arches, frescoes and original stained-glass windows, there are unique wrought-iron old choirs and an altar similar to Gothic lace.  In the 17th century, a superstructure was erected on the tower with a dome that looks inorganic in an old building.  Services are held in the cathedral today.  You can climb the tower to see the city from a height. </p><h2>  Herman's Palace </h2><p>  When sightseeing Memmingen, you can easily ignore the late Baroque palace, which modestly hid in the shadow of the cathedral.  Herman's Palace was built in 1766 and served as a home for the richest Swabian merchant.  It was in this house that all influential people stayed passing through Memmingen, including the Russian Emperor Alexander the First.  Inside the building, the magnificent interiors of the 18th century have been preserved.  Today, the palace houses a museum of local history, where you can learn about the glorious past of this ancient town. </p>

    <h2>  Salt warehouse </h2><p>  Since the time of the salt boom, a large salt warehouse has remained in the city.  Its length is more than 100 meters, which clearly shows the volume of trade in this valuable product.  A simple building with a curly facade was built in the years 1470-1474.  Today, there are restaurants and shops. </p><h2>  City fortifications </h2><p>  Since the Middle Ages, Memmingen has preserved the city walls that once protected residents from enemies.  They were built from the 11th to the 13th century.  Today, only part of the fortifications and several gates have been preserved.  The most beautiful gates are the West, which was rebuilt in 1648, and the Kempten Gate with a high brick tower built in 1383. </p>

    <h2>  Practical information </h2><p>  Memmingen, whose airport is 5 kilometers from the city center, is very convenient for transit trips.  In between flights, you can just see this town, dine in a restaurant, go to the museum.  A bus runs from the airport to the city every hour, but tourists often walk on foot, admiring the traditional Bavarian nature along the road.  Memmingen is good for everyone for tourists, but it has a big drawback - it has few hotels, especially medium and economical price categories.  However, most tourists come here from other places, for example, from Munich.  The best way to get from the capital of Bavaria to Memmingen is by train, express takes an hour, regional train - 1 hour 45 minutes.  For trips here, a <span>Bavarian ticket</span> and a complex ticket of the <span>Austrian railways</span> are also valid <span>.</span> </p><p>  The city is very easy and simple to navigate.  Immediately from the station begins the Old Town, in which in many places there are navigation stands for tourists with maps, and there are signs near the main attractions.  In the tourist information center, which is located on the Town Hall Square, you can ask employees any question and take a map of the city. </p>
