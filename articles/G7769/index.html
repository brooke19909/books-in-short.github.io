    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Tourists arriving at the hotel come from the stylish lobby area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel, which is medium in size and has a very presentable appearance, which is given to it by the columns at the entrance and the floor, lined with artificial stone with a pattern resembling granite.  Comfortable white plastic chairs with red seats and backs are placed here.  Newcomers settle in the hotel immediately upon arrival, which is very convenient. </p><p>  The hotel complex has 477 rooms.  Of these, 277 are standard, 108 are improved with one double and two single beds, 24 - family: double and with three beds.  They have all the necessary furniture: coffee and dining tables, chairs, beds, bedside tables.  The rooms of Three Corners Triton Empire Hotel 3 * have individual climate control, TV, safe, minibar.  The standard rooms have a shower, while the superior rooms have a bathtub. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Hotel guests generally prefer three meals a day (board) or two meals a day (half board) in the Sinuhe restaurant.  The buffet is more modest in assortment than in a five-star hotel, however, the restaurant chef cooks excellently.  There are also paid restaurants by appointment (Mediterranean Chez Pascal, Italian Dolce Vita and bars in the lobby area, by the pools, pub). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="three corners triton empire hotel 3 reviews" class="if" height="235" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1101164.jpg" width="312"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Most tourists who plan for themselves an interesting and varied excursion program in advance buy a half-board meal plan (so as not to unduly attach themselves to the restaurant‚Äôs work schedule).  Although the hotel guests are offered another option of food - <span>full board.</span>  In the latter case, meals in the buffets of the beach area and the pool area also become available to them. </p><p>  Vacationers note the good work of the main restaurant and good quality food.  They don‚Äôt save on meat and fish in main dishes, the portions are large, the menu has a lot of fruits. </p><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  Active free leisure includes <span>beach volleyball,</span> billiards, darts, table tennis.  However, the list of paid services provided by the hotel is much larger. </p><p>  For new arrivals, we recommend that you immediately visit the Turkish bath in the spa.  The effect of this procedure is to free pores and cleanse the skin.  Thus, the body prepares for a beach holiday and tan.  But on the day of visiting the bath, going to the beach is undesirable.  You should wait a day until the skin injured by the procedure is restored.  The spa also has a sauna and massage services. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel three corners triton empire hotel 3" class="if" height="235" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1101150.jpg" width="312"></div>

    <p>  For a fee, hotel guests visit the modern fitness center, where they train under the guidance of experienced instructors.  Here you can take several diving lessons. </p><p>  The three-star service of the hotel complex involves round-the-clock customer service at the reception, free Wi-Fi, an ATM, as well as pre-arranged celebrations in the restaurant. </p><p>  Positive and rare for three-star hotels is the presence of a mini-club open from 9-00 to 16-30, a special children's pool, a children's playground and animation. </p><h2>  Pool </h2><p>  Good outdoor pool of Three Corners Triton Empire Hotel 3 *.

    <p>  According to vacationers, the sandy strip of the beach itself is quite compact.  The beaches are provided with sun loungers, umbrellas, <span>beach towels.</span>  However, according to reviews, this inventory is noticeably worn. </p><p>  However, entering the water is convenient, and this attracts families with children to the hotel. </p><h2>  Level exceeding three stars </h2><p>  Three Corners Triton Empire Hotel 3 * offers its guests a really solid three-star vacation.  Moreover, according to the recognition of tourists themselves, in quality it is as close as possible to a four-star one.  There is a good health and sports infrastructure, a decent level of food (board and half board), even a mini club. </p><p>  For experienced tourists (who save on "stars" of their lodging, but invest the money they saved in excursions, shopping, visiting restaurants and clubs), such a developed service is a blessing.  After all, staying in a foreign country, it‚Äôs possible to relax internally only in the hotel where the tour was bought.  And the Three Corners Triton Empire Hotel 3 * hotel fully meets this criterion. </p><h2>  Hurghada infrastructure closest to the hotel </h2><p>  Traditionally, guests of three-star hotels actively use the nearby resort infrastructure for their holidays.  And in this regard, the hotel we are considering is no exception. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="three corners triton empire hotel 3 egypt hurghada" class="if" height="208" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1101139.jpg" width="312"></div>

    <p>  Wonderful shopping opportunities are provided by the guests of Three Corners Triton Empire Hotel 3 *.  Their reviews quite meaningfully list the nodal points of the tourist infrastructure of tourist Hurghada (the impressive Hurghada Marina Boulevard hypermarket, the eastern bazaar of the old part of the city, the Pharaoh leather store, the Karkusha textile store, the Levis jeans, hundreds of souvenir and <span>fruit shops on</span> Sheraton Road Street). </p><p>  However, those who bought a tour to Three Corners Triton Empire Hotel 3 * have the opportunity to plunge into the fun and idleness of resort nightlife.  They have a huge entertainment center Senzo Mell, McDonald's, KFS, Pizza Hut restaurants, dozens of bars, massage parlors, hookahs, discos, designed for a different wallet size. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Tours can be purchased directly from the tour operator (his guides will immediately offer you a full assortment upon arrival).  However, one and a half times it will be more profitable to purchase an excursion in specialized tour agencies of Hurghada. </p><p>  Having bought a tour at Three Corners Triton Empire Hotel 3 * (Hurghada), tourists have the opportunity to choose expensive and cheap excursions. </p><p>  More expensive are trips to Cairo and the pyramids of Giza, as well as to Luxor.  These places are branded for Egypt.  And each guest of the Land of the Pharaohs should visit them at least once.  But Egypt is not only a story in stone, it is also the beauty of the coral Red Sea.

Traveler reviews alternate with underwater photographs of vibrant exotic inhabitants of the underwater kingdom of Egypt: <span>angel fish, parrot fish, butterfly fish,</span> moray eels. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The hotel provides quality spa services.  It is very conveniently located in the old part of Hurghada.  Wonderful resort infrastructure of the city is within walking distance.  However, it is not for people accustomed to a five-star vacation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="three corners triton empire hotel 3 hurghada reviews" class="if" height="235" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1101148.jpg" width="312"></div>
