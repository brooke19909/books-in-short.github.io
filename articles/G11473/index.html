How to clean and dry your phone</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the life of any person, a situation may arise when an urgent need to find out what to do if the phone fell into the toilet.  To many, such an incident seems critical.  Firstly, because a gadget that accidentally "dived" into such an inappropriate place for it can be extremely expensive.  Secondly, because even in a modest phone, a person can store very important information.  Therefore, it is important to know what you need to do immediately with the gadget in order to save it. </p><p>  A modern person simply can not do without a phone, so he does not leave him even in the toilet.  The most common case of a gadget getting into the toilet is slipping it out of the back pocket of your trousers.  It happens that a smartphone falls due to other negligence.  You can wet the phone in another place.  For example, some people forget to get it out of the pockets of things sent for washing, drop it into the sink, bathtub, and spill various liquids on it.  It is not always possible to save the phone.  Much depends on what brand it is, what its tightness is, how long it has been in water. </p><p>  Unfortunately, people do not always find the information they need, and the device‚Äôs lifetime expires.  Of course, it is better to purchase a waterproof phone.  The price of such gadgets varies from 20,000 to 75,000 rubles, which depends on their brand and functions.  However, many people do not want to say goodbye to their favorite phone, accidentally falling into the water.  Let's figure out how to save him. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidauthority.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the phone does not work" class="if uuid-2581578" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2581578.jpg"></div><h2>  Take out the device! </h2><p>  What to do if the phone falls into the toilet and gets wet?  How to act in such a situation?  Are there any differences in the methods of "saving" the fallen touch and push-button phones?  For devices of different models, there are the same ways to save. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To begin, consider how to get a phone out of the toilet.  You need to do this very quickly.  You may need to put the glove on your hand first.  The faster the phone is removed, the less moisture will penetrate the important parts.  If no gloves were found, quickly put your hand in the toilet and remove the phone, thinking at the same time how dear it is to you. </p><h2>  What you can‚Äôt do if you want the phone to work after falling into the toilet </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikihow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to dry your phone from water" class="if uuid-2581582" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2581582.jpg"></div><p>  Do not do the following: </p><ol><li>  Never turn on the wet phone to check whether it works or not, as a short circuit will ‚Äúfinish‚Äù it completely and irrevocably. </li><li>  No need to shake the phone to remove water from it.  From these actions, the liquid will penetrate even more into the device and will be evenly distributed over all its interiors. </li><li>  Do not dry the phone with hot air (such as a hairdryer) or place it on any heater.  Because of this, sensitive parts can melt.  Some people try to dry their phone in the microwave.  It is strictly forbidden to do this, as there is a chance to spoil not only the phone, but also the microwave. </li><li>  Sorbents are capable of absorbing moisture.  You can try to use them.  In such cases, rice or silica gel is used.  But salt or sugar cannot be used for this.  They absorb moisture well, but these ingredients are not suitable for the phone.  Even if it happens that your gadget is old, you don‚Äôt want to use it anymore, you need to remove the phone from the toilet.  The fact is that it can get stuck in the pipe.  Then you will have to experience additional inconvenience and invest in calling a locksmith. </li></ol><h2>  Selikagel will help </h2><p>  What is silica gel?  Not everyone knows his name, although they could be found on sale.  Silica gel is a dried gel.  It is able to absorb a lot of moisture, so it is used as dehumidifiers.  You could see him in sachets, which are often placed in boxes with shoes.  This substance can also be purchased separately at stores.  If you come across a similar bag, do not write off to throw it away.  You may need it someday, for example, to save your broken phone. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikihow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the phone fell into the toilet" class="if uuid-2581583" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2581583.jpg"></div><h2>  What you need to do first to save the device </h2><p>  It is worth noting that not in all cases the tips listed in this article will help bring your phone back to life.  But if you do everything quickly, then there are chances.  It should also be remembered that after your phone falls into the water, its useful life will decrease.  Minor malfunctions are also possible.  So what to do with the device? </p><p>  If you see the phone in water, immediately remove it, wipe it with paper towels and immediately unplug it.  Next, you need to remove the battery, SIM card and memory card.  Remember to remove the battery immediately.  Do not over tighten, do not try to turn it on, or immediately dry it.  If the phone turns off, some chips still receive power.  This must be remembered.  If the smartphone is of a model in which the battery cannot be removed, you should immediately take it to a service center. </p><h2>  Disassembling the phone at home </h2><p>  Try to remove and unscrew everything you can.  The more room for air, the faster the phone will dry.  This will give more chances for its further functioning.  To unscrew everything, take a small watch screwdriver and a straight curly screwdriver.  These tools should always be in the house, as they can be useful in different situations.  Remember, the phone must be disassembled carefully, not forgetting that it was unscrewed.  You can sketch a diagram on a piece of paper or take a photo so that when assembling everything is done correctly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.makeuseof.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="waterproof phones" class="if uuid-2581591" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2581591.jpg"></div><h2>  Device cleaning </h2><p>  <span>How to clean the phone</span> inside?  If there is moisture, wipe it with a dry cloth.  This applies to all microcircuits, loops, contacts, if you could get to them.  They need to be wiped with a cotton swab, after moistening it with alcohol.  This magic liquid will not only clean them, but also help moisture evaporate faster.  Water itself does not pose a big threat to the phone.  It is harmful that it contains: salts, alkalis, minerals and other elements.  They can cause corrosion, rust and oxidize the details of the phone.  It is also worth noting that special cans of liquid are sold that can quickly dry the contacts. </p><p>  The refrigerator will evaporate moisture well.  But only the one equipped with the modern No frost system.  It has a fan and an evaporator, which will easily help get rid of moisture inside the phone.  After processing the phone with alcohol, it can be placed in the refrigerator for half an hour.  After this time, wipe the device again with alcohol. </p><h2>  Vacuum cleaner and hair dryer with cold air </h2><p>  Many people know one old way <span>how to dry the phone</span> from water.  To do this, you can use a vacuum cleaner if it has a narrow nozzle.  You need to direct the air flow into each hole, blow at least five minutes.  There is still a way to blow dry, but only cold air can be used.  It is required to keep the hair dryer from the phone at a distance of 10-15 cm. You cannot blow hot air, since more harm than good can be done, because hot air can melt important parts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="osxdaily.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="phone repair" class="if uuid-2581580" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2581580.jpg"></div><p>  If you have a special moisture absorber at home, you should place the phone in a dry bag and put in a bowl with this substance.  It quickly absorbs moisture.  Another tool is cat litter.  It also absorbs moisture well, so it will dry your phone quickly.  In addition, you can leave your smartphone in the sun to dry, but not in direct sunlight.  Another way is to load the phone in a bag of rice. </p><p>  As users say in the reviews, the best option is to use a moisture absorber or dry the gadget with a stream of cold air. </p><h2>  Further actions to save the phone </h2><p>  After all the procedures done, you need to leave the phone in a dry place for several days.  Make sure that there is no moisture on the screen and the battery does not oxidize.  Only after making sure that the phone has dried out well, you can try turning it on.  If you yourself managed to repair the smartphone, try connecting it to the charger.  You need to find out if it will charge, how long it will take to charge, how long the battery can last.  If the <span>phone is slowly charging,</span> it means that current is slowly flowing to the battery.  Therefore, turn off the device and take it to a specialist.  Also see if your gadget accepts SIM cards, a memory card.  Then call him and find out if your interlocutor hears you. </p><p>  What to do if the phone does not work after switching on?  In this case, hurry to take it to the master for a more accurate assessment of his condition.  Ask your phone to be diagnosed out of turn.  It is very important not to waste precious time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="osxdaily.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to clean the phone inside" class="if uuid-2581581" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2581581.jpg"></div><h2>  Do I need to go to a service center.  What to consider </h2><p>  Do I have to go to a service center?  Yes, if the phone does not work.  It is wise to visit the wizard if you have a warranty on the device has not yet expired.  True, it will not work to repair the phone for free.  A warranty phone repair will be done for money, but you will know exactly what is wrong with your gadget.  Since the failure is your fault, it will not be repaired under warranty.  But first, specify how much a phone repair costs.  It may not make sense to repair it.  In this case, no one will say how much he will work.  So how much does a phone repair cost?  For example, replacing a part (excluding the cost of the element itself) can cost 1000 rubles.  A replacement display assembly may cost about seven thousand rubles.  In this case, it is better to refuse repair.  Then you should immediately buy a new phone.  You may be saddened by the news that your broken phone cannot be repaired.  This may be the case if several vital elements are damaged. </p><h2>  Do I need to tell the truth </h2><p>  If the phone falls into the toilet and does not turn on, it may have broken some parts, a screen or a battery.  In this case, the wizards will tell you what needs to be replaced.  Sometimes it happens that people try to trick a service center in order to get a free repair under warranty.  Be sure, the master will immediately find out the cause of the breakdown, because many gadgets have a tiny indicator that, when in contact with water, changes color, for example, it was white and it turned pink.  Better tell the truth.  Let them help you immediately so that you don‚Äôt lose time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.howtogeek.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cleaning smartphone" class="if uuid-2583294" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2583294.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get rid of the smell of a toilet </h2><p>  We have already figured out what to do if the phone falls into the toilet.  Let‚Äôs talk about how to get rid of the unpleasant odor that the phone can emanate after the incident.  If after resuscitation your gadget has earned, but the smell of the toilet remains, you should put the device in a bag and put a bag of coffee, soda or activated charcoal there.  They perfectly remove odors.  You may need to repeat the procedure.  There are many varieties of odor absorbers that are sold specifically for refrigerators.  If you have one, you can also put them next to the phone or put them in a bag or other container.  There are absorbers with activated carbon, an ozonizer, mineral-salt absorber.
