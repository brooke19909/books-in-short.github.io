  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Do-it-yourself origami paper machine</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Making paper figures by folding is very entertaining and useful for the development of children.  In addition to perseverance and attentiveness, memory and logical thinking develop.  All these skills will help the child at school, and with a toy made by yourself, you can play or colorize, stick on a postcard or present to a friend. </p><p>  It is more interesting to offer origami paper machines for boys to make, but some girls also do not mind rolling their dolls on a car.  Collect all the figures according to the schemes, which are subsequently remembered.  The following toys can already be made from memory. </p><h2>  A car </h2><p>  The assembly scheme of the origami paper machine is simple, so you can try making this model for beginners or primary school children. </p><p>  For work, you need a square sheet of thick paper of any color.  First, it is folded into two equal parts to determine the center line of the fold.  Then each of the halves is additionally bent in half once and then again.  The inner fold of each part of the craft should be on the inside. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="scheme origami cars" class="if uuid-2501325" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2501325.jpg"></div><p>  Then the workpiece is turned with the even side out and the center line is bent up.  You should get three broken lines or waves: one in the center (large) and two on the sides (small).  They put the whole accordion together and bend the triangles of corners down. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Then the origami paper machine unfolds as follows.  Large triangles form the beveled edges of the car cab.  And the small corners are the wheels.  To make them without sharp corners, the lower edge is bent in a straight line up. </p><p>  When bending the corners of the rectangle of the car body, the desired shape is given with the headlights in front.  After the origami of the paper machine is made, you can decorate the craft with an application or simply paint with colored pencils. </p><h2>  How to make a jeep? </h2><p>  From paper of different colors, you can make a whole car park for a child.  How to make a regular passenger car, you already understand.  Now we will consider how to make an origami out of paper a jeep car.  Off-road vehicles have a more even surface on the back.  Consider what is needed for such a job. </p><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="paper machines for playing" class="if uuid-2501332" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2501332.jpg"></div><p>  It is better to take square sheets of paper dense - 100 g / m <sup>2</sup> .  You need a flat table surface and accuracy when folding paper.  Each fold must be carefully smoothed with a finger so that the work looks neat. </p><h2>  Paper folding pattern </h2><p>  Before you make an origami machine out of paper for the game, practice on any one-sided sheet.  The detailed and step-by-step diagram shows that you need to do the work gradually, performing bends in the order of the numbers under the figures.  Initially, we bend the square in half in one direction and the other.  This is necessary to determine the center and divide the sheet into equal parts.  Then the lower half folds in half and the edges bend outward.  In this case, bends are made from the center point of the rectangle to the edges.  It will be the wheels of a jeep. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.voorbeginners.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="paper jeep folding scheme" class="if uuid-2501330" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2501330.jpg"></div><p>  Then the upper half goes down and steps back a couple of centimeters from the edge, as in Figure 6, and we lift the paper up.  Further, the edges bend down with the corners down, forming an even line between the center point and the edges at the corners. </p><p>  It remains only to turn the craft to the other side and the work is finished.  Decorate the appearance of the machine as you wish.  You can start the game. </p>
