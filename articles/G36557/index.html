Basically, these are the knees and the inner area between the legs.  In the case of a hole in the lap, a patch, even a very neat one, will be visible, but on the legs it can be fixed in such a way that it will be impossible to even guess what it is.  How to make a patch we will describe in this article. </p><h2>  Types of patches and useful tips for proper jeans repair </h2><p>  Patches have a different appearance and vary in functionality. </p><p>  Decorative - sewn into the damaged place and looks like a noticeable flap on the jeans panel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pacountrycrafts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="repair - finishing children's jeans" class="if uuid-2670597" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2670597.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Double - has two parts of the same shape for the wrong side and front side.  The back part is a little larger. </li><li>  The consignment note is the most short-lived, it is used for quick repair and is sewn on top of the rubbed place. </li></ul><p>  Before you put a patch, prepare the patch from which you will make it, and jeans.  But first you need: </p><ul><li>  wash them; </li><li>  dry and iron in places where the work will go; </li><li>  cut a patch of the desired shape from a piece of matter; </li><li>  trace the place of the future patch with soap or chalk. </li></ul><p>  To give a more accurate look to the patch, do not forget about some little things: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  leave <span>a seam allowance</span> ; </li><li>  go through the edges of the part to patch with an overlock or zigzag; </li><li>  after work do not be too lazy to wash and iron jeans. </li></ul><h2>  How to patch jeans between legs with a sewing machine </h2><p>  Clothing repair with the help of technology always turns out to be much more neat and invisible.  So, prepare the machine and get to work! </p><p>  First you need to turn the trousers inside out and cut all the threads on the wiped places.  Next, with a needle and thread, go through small stitches along the edge of the holes.  This is necessary to stop the shedding of material.  Do not tighten the thread, the fabric should not wrinkle! </p><p>  Now you need to cut a patch that matches the color and texture of your item (do not forget about the seam allowances).  Attach to the inside and fasten with needles along the edges (there should be no wavy edge). </p><p>  A further task is to stitch the patch in 2 directions with seams that are at most close to one another.  In this you will come in handy option "reverse". </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.asksarah.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="frequent stitching" class="if uuid-2670574" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2670574.jpg"></div><p>  When the whole patch is filled with stitching, cut and fasten the thread.  That's all.  How to make a patch between the legs, you now know.  It will be practically invisible. </p><p>  When stitching the knees, the patch should be located on the face of the fabric.  Since it will not be possible to make a patch in this area, it will be better to sew the same on the other leg - for symmetry. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to sew a patch manually </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the machine is not always available.  In this case, try to make a temporary repair manually.  First, you will need to select the material for the patch.  Now you need to cut the patch, covering the hole and having an allowance for the seam, and attach the outside to the canvas.  The patch and jeans should match.  Secure the edges with pins.  Next, sew small patches around the perimeter with small frequent stitches. </p><div class="photo" data-original="closetcasepatterns.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="manual patch sewing" class="if uuid-2670602" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2670602.jpg"></div><p>  Now the trouser leg must be turned to the wrong side and also sew the fabric around the scuff.  This will strengthen the material, and it will not be destroyed further.  Here's how to make a patch for a short time, before the "overhaul". </p><h2>  Contrast Denim or Leather </h2><p>  On their knees, denim pants are often torn by children who do not know how to sit still.  Really constantly buy jeans?  Well of course not!  There is no need to go to such a cost if you can easily sew up a gap!  How to make a patch on jeans in the knee area - now we will tell. </p><div class="photo" data-original="diyprojectsforteens.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="leather patches" class="if uuid-2670592" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2670592.jpg"></div><p>  Such an repair, albeit done with great diligence, is always in sight.  Therefore, we will make the patch a fashionable accent. </p><p>  Take for her a fabric in a completely different shade than jeans, for example, to gray - a black patch.  Better yet, use your skin!  Jeans with leather inserts are now at the peak of popularity! </p><p>  At the initial stage of the jeans repair process, it is necessary to determine what size the patches will be, draw on paper and cut out a paper pattern.  It is best to take the width of the leg, and let the length be at least 18 cm. Do not forget about the allowances for the seams - 1 cm each. Cut the patch from the prepared fabric, iron all the allowances on the wrong side and fasten with jeans with pins.  It remains to sew on a sewing machine or manually: as you wish and conveniently!  This method involves inserts on both trousers. </p><h2>  Emergency jeans repair </h2><p>  But there is not always enough time to carry out high-quality ‚Äúrepair work‚Äù to fix your favorite jeans, and put them on urgently!  It is in this case that adhesive-based patches can help.  They can be very easily glued from the wrong side of the wiped area simply by ironing with a hot iron.  Such an intervention will allow some time to last and not burst further than the damaged area.  But this method of "restoration" is very short-lived: there is always a chance that jeans will burst further due to tension. </p><p>  So, we looked at several ways to patch on your favorite jeans.  Decide which option to choose for yourself! </p>
