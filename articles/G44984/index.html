Photos and information on the official website are not always objective, therefore it is better to receive first-hand information.  For example, from reviews of tourists.  Here are the main positive points associated with living in this hotel: </p><ul><li>  stylish architecture, interior decoration and interior rooms; </li><li>  good hearty breakfasts (there are three menu options); </li><li>  much attention is paid to fire safety (in particular, a strict ban on smoking is established); </li><li>  due to the fact that the hotel is located in the courtyards in the middle of residential buildings, it is quiet and calm at night, and there is also not much traffic; </li><li>  You can order breakfast delivery to your room for free; </li><li>  Convenient location in the central part of the city (it is easy to get to tourist sites from here); </li><li>  a good restaurant with a cozy summer terrace (it is especially pleasant to sit outdoors after a tiring road); </li><li>  near the hotel there is a public transport stop, from where you can quickly get to anywhere in the city; </li><li>  to the promenade and the train station can be reached on foot in 10-15 minutes; </li><li>  spacious rooms with a pleasant design (a specific style was invented for each category); </li><li>  near the hotel there are many grocery and grocery stores with affordable prices; </li><li>  convenient location of car parking (directly opposite the hotel entrance); </li><li>  quick registration and placement without unnecessary bureaucracy; </li><li>  fresh repairs and new plumbing in the rooms; </li><li>  Free Wi-Fi works fine (high speed, stable signal). </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.hotels.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="&quot;Light Hotel&quot;, Volgograd, phone" class="if uuid-2530564" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39549/2530564.jpg"></div><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Tourists highlight a number of negative aspects associated with living at the Light Hotel in Volgograd.  Negative feedback is as follows: </p><ul><li>  the rooms are poorly prepared for new guests to check in (for example, you can see the hair in the bathroom and on the pillow); </li><li>  paid parking (and it is arranged inconveniently and poorly guarded); </li><li>  I would like a more hospitable meeting from the reception staff (I would like to see a smile and hear elementary words of greeting); </li><li>  high prices for food in the hotel restaurant; </li><li>  due to poor ventilation and increased humidity, the bathroom smells unpleasant; </li><li>  double rooms are equipped for one guest (the problem is solved after contacting the reception); </li><li>  poor access roads to the hotel; </li><li>  the hotel administration is very unyielding in matters of early check-in and late check-out (even for an additional fee this is not always possible to solve); </li><li>  economy rooms have little light and free space; </li><li>  very dim lighting does not make it possible to read before bedtime, to normally do makeup, and so on; </li><li>  the rooms do not have wardrobes to hide clothes (you have to keep everything in your suitcases or try to fit on one hanger); </li><li>  irregular cleaning of rooms (I would like the maids to at least take out the trash); </li><li>  in the cold season, rooms are poorly heated, and heaters do not save (in addition, they are not available in the hotel in sufficient quantities); </li><li>  ugly views from the windows of the rooms (some windows are adjacent to the walls of neighboring residential buildings); </li><li>  the carpet is old and dusty (it must be completely replaced or dry cleaned); </li><li>  the electronic lock often fails (you have to call the master to get into the room); </li><li>  you have to constantly convince employees that breakfast is included in the price (apparently, the information is not transmitted to the restaurant); </li><li>  in standard rooms there are no declared slippers; </li><li>  there are no shelves in the shower to accommodate cosmetics and other hygiene items; </li><li>  when you leave the room, the electricity is completely turned off, and the products in the refrigerator deteriorate; </li><li>  in the rooms you can find cockroaches, mosquitoes and ants; </li><li>  in economy rooms, windows do not open (despite the presence of air conditioning, it is very stuffy and uncomfortable); </li><li>  the air conditioner is too noisy (but if you turn it off at night, the room will be very stuffy); </li><li>  An electric kettle and hairdryer can be taken only at the reception, but they are not enough for all (sometimes administrators allow their personal kettle to be used); </li><li>  there are no coolers with drinking water on the floors; </li><li>  a narrow curtain in the shower does not protect the bathroom from splashing water; </li><li>  poor sound insulation (the voices of neighbors and the sounds of a banquet from a restaurant interfere with relaxation); </li><li>  despite the fact that a round-the-clock mode of operation is declared, early morning and late evening you can not catch the reception staff; </li><li>  the hotel is not designed for long stays (not enough amenities and additional services); </li><li>  upon check-in, employees do not take guests to the room and do not help them with their suitcases; </li><li>  few outlets in rooms (smartphones have to be charged in turn); </li><li>  there is no rug in the bathroom, so there is a risk of slipping (in addition, water is transferred to the room and absorbed into the carpet); </li><li>  there are no mosquito nets on the windows, so if you decide to ventilate the room, then start a lot of mosquitoes; </li><li>  the minibar is poorly kept (guests are often forced to pay for drinks that they did not take from the refrigerator). </li></ul>
