History of occurrence</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, origami can be safely called one of the most popular types of creativity.  The techniques for adding paper crafts are easy to learn, and everyone can do it. </p><p>  In the article we will tell the story of origami briefly, dwell on the origin of art, and also consider some of its other techniques. </p><p>  In Japanese, the word literally means "folded paper."  But the name "origami" only appeared at the end of the 19th century with the publication of the first books on origami.  And before that, the techniques for making paper crafts were conveyed visually to each other and were called "orikata" ("folding work"). </p><h2>  History of occurrence </h2><p>  Of course, origami is primarily paper crafts.  And the first paper, as you know, appeared in Ancient China at the very beginning of the second century AD.  Therefore, the origami story of paper must be associated with this country. </p><p>  But not so simple.  It is believed that origami appeared in Japan.  Allegedly, the first figures were born from the art of drapery fabrics, which was necessary in the manufacture of traditional Japanese clothing. </p><p>  In addition, while paper was expensive and accessible only to temples, both in China and Japan, origami was used only by clergy for religious worship. </p><p>  Over time, origami crafts appeared in Japanese noble families.  A true nobleman was now even considered such if he could entertain a bored lady by folding these angular but lively figures.  And the samurai used crafts to collapse notes.  Only this person could read this message by unfolding the figure.  Even later, origami began to decorate the premises during all kinds of celebrations. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="news.infurma.es" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Origami in Japan" class="if uuid-2353722" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65831/2353722.jpg"></div><p>  A traditional <span>Japanese wedding,</span> that is, a wedding held according to the canons of Shinto, for example, implied the obligatory decoration of the interior with paper folded butterflies, which symbolized the bride and groom. </p><h2>  Origami spread.  Japan </h2><p>  In general, you can probably talk about the real art of origami only with the advent of the Japanese paper crane - one of the most simple and most popular crafts created without any practical purposes. </p><p>  Incidentally, the first origami textbook published in Kyoto in 1797 was entitled How to Fold a Thousand Cranes.  This title of hers clearly referred the reader to an old legend that promised the fulfillment of a wish to someone who would fold a thousand paper cranes.  True, despite the name, the publication talked about the methods of addition and other figures. </p><p>  After World War II and the bombing of Hiroshima, a paper crane acquired special significance.  Japanese girl <span>Sadako Sasaki,</span> sick with leukemia, was laying cranes in the hospital, believing that with a thousandth who had escaped from her hands, a terrible disease would recede.  The girl managed to make only 644 figures ... </p><h2>  Akira Yoshizawa </h2><p>  Great merits in the promotion and development of origami art in the XX century are attributed to Japanese origami Akira Yoshizawa (Yizizawa). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Once a young draftsman Akira, who works at an engineering plant, explained the basics of descriptive geometry to beginners, folding up origami figures for clarity.  He achieved such mastery in this art that the factory owners allowed him to engage in origami even during working hours. </p><p>  However, only after the war, Akira Yoshizawa managed to continue her activities.  In 1954, his book, The New Origami Art, saw the light of day, and soon the Center for the Study of this Art founded by him opened in Tokyo. </p><p>  This famous master has developed a whole charter with universal designations for origami folds.  These essentially instructions served to convey origami techniques in writing.  The book collected basic models for mastering the first steps in this art. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mikeyang0711.pixnet.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Akira Yoshizawa" class="if uuid-2359931" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65831/2359931.jpg"></div><p>  Akira Yoshizawa lived a long life, created more than 50 thousand previously unknown models, and after the well-deserved triumph of his first book, he published 18 more books on origami. </p><p>  Thanks to his work, lovers of classical origami realized that there was an ideal designer - a square sheet of paper.  Only with the help of hands, simple techniques and your imagination can you learn to create thousands of the most diverse images - animals, plants, objects. </p><h2>  Origami and the Western World </h2><p>  It is believed that in the history of origami there were two independent sources: Japanese and Western. </p><p>  This art appeared in Europe by the 16th century.  This is the story of origami.  Then they knew how to fold miter (headdresses of priests) and women's caps made of fabric without the use of threads and needles.  In a special way folded napkins when laying the table or just crafts that adorned the interior in European houses, could also serve as the forerunners of this art form. </p><p>  With the development of industry, paper crafts have become popular in the West.  And today it is already impossible to say for certain whether the original models were borrowed.  For example, the Spanish symbol of origami - a paper bird "Paharita" from the city of Toledo, according to legend, was made almost in the XII century.  Moreover, ‚Äúpaharito‚Äù was also called a bird, and generally any origami figure.  Therefore, people in Spain, when they say ‚Äúmake butter,‚Äù mean folding paper. </p><h2>  Origamists of the West </h2><p>  The Spanish writer, poet and philosopher Miguel de Unamuno, who lived at the turn of the XIX and XX centuries, created many figures and wrote two books on origami.  His name is today associated with the Spanish and South American schools for this art. </p><p>  Around the same time, paper figures appeared in France, this time among magicians on the stage.  Successfully tried himself in the art of making paper crafts and the famous American illusionist <span>Harry Houdini.</span> </p><p>  A significant contribution to the history of origami for children was made by the German theoretician of preschool education, the founder of the kindergarten system, Friedrich Frebel.  Back in the 19th century, he worked on the development of the logical thinking of the child, adding up simple figures.  The basics of geometry, embodied in the tricks of folding a square out of paper, were borrowed by a German teacher, probably from the teachings of the ancient Arabs. </p><p>  The 20th century has become a true open gate in the history of origami art to merge all its traditions and united origami lovers from all over the world.  To this day, textbooks are published in many languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the world, centers are opened in which origami masters teach, its forms and methods are developed and complicated.  However, the basic models, which seem simple to sophisticated masters, can cause newcomers who are taking their first steps in the world of origami crafts, lively interest and even admiration. </p><h2>  Basic models of classic origami </h2><p>  It is very possible that it is thanks to Frobel that it is so simple today to tell the story of the origin of origami for children on the example of such simple models as a cap, boat, glass.  Well, planes and jumping frogs at least once in childhood, most likely, did everything. </p><p>  And here is another model that takes an initial position in teaching beginners.  Today in the textbooks it is called the ‚ÄúSanbo Box‚Äù.  In the ritual sanbo once placed various offerings to the gods in the temples.  In the future, she, having crossed the temple threshold, began to be used when setting the table.  This is quite a versatile container for storing, for example, nuts, sweets or paper clips. </p><div class="photo" data-original="origami.wonderhowto.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Box Sanbo" class="if uuid-2354329" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65831/2354329.jpg"></div><p>  And one of the most popular origami models was a miniature bird with spread wings.  She probably appeared in Japan, because the instructions for assembling this figure appeared in Europe only closer to the end of the XIX century.  The World Exhibition in Paris, held in 1878, to which the Japanese brought this figure and revealed the secret of its folding, became an incentive to unite the traditions of West and East and to develop a new world origami. </p><h2>  Modular origami </h2><p>  This technique looks like a natural continuation of classic origami.  In contrast to it, not one but several sheets of paper are used to create the model, and the limit on their number was nevertheless removed, which allowed to significantly expand the capabilities and imagination of their creators. </p><p>  Using modular origami, voluminous figures are collected: balls, boxes, stars, flowers.  Then they are assembled in accordance with the plan into even more complex and intricate models. </p><p>  The history of modular origami calls the name Mitsunobu Sonobe, who became the founder of this technique and enjoys well-deserved recognition in Japan so far.  Various variations of the basic models, in fact, are even called "sonobe" (or "sonob"). </p><p>  But the American mathematician Robert Lang looked at this technique from a special, engineering point of view and developed algorithms for constructing figures that still amaze with the accuracy of their forms and the filigree execution. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vqronline.org" data-author=": Jason Motlagh, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Robert Lang" class="if uuid-2355448" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65831/2355448.jpg"></div><p>  His genius also belongs to technical origami products: an airbag, folded using the techniques of this art, and the development of a space telescope with a huge lens made in the form of a thin membrane.  When folded with it, the rockets were transported into space, where it could be deployed and used without any damage or creases. </p><h2>  Kusudama </h2><p>  The technology of modular origami is based on the manufacture of sonobes.  Most often, they have two "pockets" into which the edges of other models are inserted.  This is how a classic kusudama ball develops.  Sometimes the models that make it up are glued together or even stitched together. </p><p>  From sheets of paper in different colors (some use candy wrappers or even banknotes as the basis for manufacturing), two-color or multi-color kusudamas, similar to crystal balls or spherical inflorescences, can be folded.  They are also compared with the right crystals and molecules. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickriver.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Flower Kusudama" class="if uuid-2355454" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65831/2355454.jpg"></div><p>  A lot of repeating flower segments with eight volumetric petals is one of the most fashionable flower patterns in this kind of technique. </p><p>  In the Land of the Rising Sun, they always loved figures that could be used in practice in everyday life.  Thus, Japanese healers put aromatic herbs into pockets of Kusudama and hung them over the patient‚Äôs bed.  And from flower bouquets they made bouquets for the bride at wedding ceremonies. </p><h2>  Other types of origami techniques </h2><p>  The history of origami is known for a large number of methods for folding paper crafts.  The simplest of them - the usual origami - is designed for those taking the very first steps.  It helps to master the simplest models such as box, flower, hare, cat, etc. </p><p>  And here is a wet origami.  He was invented by the tireless origamist Akiro Yoshizawa.  To work in this technique, paper with increased plasticity is required, for which the sheets were wetted with water from a spray bottle.  Or a thin layer of adhesive solution was applied to them.  Figures made using this technique are a bit like papier-m√¢ch√© crafts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thisiscolossal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wet Origami" class="if uuid-2354351" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65831/2354351.jpg"></div><p>  The Kirigami technique, which appeared thanks to Masahiro Chatani, a Japanese architect, made it possible to use scissors in the manufacture of crafts.  Thick sheets of paper are cut and folded in a special way, which helps in the manufacture of not only postcards, but also architectural models and three-dimensional ornaments. </p><p>  There is also folding according to the scan or pattern - that is, according to the drawing, where all the folds that should be present in the finished product are marked.  The drawing contains many lines, and working with it involves the skills of an experienced origamist. </p><h2>  About the benefits of origami </h2><p>  The fact that origami is an absolutely invaluable lesson for kids, many teachers have said and will still say.  Firstly, it develops fine finger motility and imagination, and brings up such important skills as perseverance and patience.  Secondly, a small origamist in practice studies the initial geometric concepts, such as square, triangle, diagonal, vertex, angle, median.  The technique of folding the figures poses concrete logical tasks for him, which, when solved, will certainly reward the child with another elegant model.  Finally, origami is not expensive.  All you need is a suitable paper and a little patience to follow the instructions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mommyandmeoverseas.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Baby Origami" class="if uuid-2357390" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65831/2357390.jpg"></div><p>  However, almost all of the above can be attributed to adults.  Moreover, the origami field, it seems, will never be impoverished and will constantly present its followers with newer and newer techniques and options for embodying their fantasies and bold projects. </p>
