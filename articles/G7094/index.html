Different eras harmoniously intertwine here, creating an incredible atmosphere of mystery.  It is thanks to this that the wonderful island enjoys such popularity among tourists from all over the world.  The Rhodes Hotel Fund will satisfy the needs of all guests - both very sensitive to comfort and less picky.  Nevertheless, the most convenient in this regard are four-star hotels (for example, Family World Aqua Beach Rhodes), in which the level of service is very high, and prices are much lower than in five-star ones. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="family world aqua beach 4" class="if" height="352" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/783562.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Rhodes - the pearl of the Mediterranean </h2><p>  An ancient Greek legend says that the mighty Zeus, deciding to make a present for <span>the sun god</span> Helios, gave him an island that rose from the depths of the sea, turned green and bloomed under the rays of the grateful Helios.  In his honor, a giant statue was erected on the island - one of the 7 wonders of the world - the Colossus of Rhodes.  Another legend is associated with the name of the island: Rhodes is a lovely nymph with whom the radiant god was in love and married her.  Today this island is considered <span>an open-air museum</span> and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  This means that tourists coming here spend a significant part of their stay at the resort on excursions.  Parents often bring their children to Greece to introduce them to the origins of our civilization.  And just then they choose the <span>family-run Hotel</span> Family World Aqua Beach. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get to Rhodes </h2><p>  In high season flights to the island are carried out from different cities of the world, including from both Russian capitals.  The flight time from Moscow to Rhodes is 3 hours 10 minutes.  The airport is 16 km from the capital.  At other times of the year, you can first fly to one of the international air harbors of Greece, and from there go on an domestic flight to the island.  As for how to get from the airport to the desired hotel, the most convenient way, of course, is to arrange a transfer when buying a tour.  By the way, for guests of Family World Aqua Beach 4 * this is a mandatory service.  And this is another plus in favor of buying a ticket to this hotel.  Although some tourists still refuse it, preferring to rent a car (from 30 euros). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="family world aqua beach rhodes" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/783560.jpg" width="600"></div>

Therefore, those tourists who are accustomed to such a service, consider it quite normal and write about it in their comments.

In addition, they believe that the food here is tasty, but not varied.  However, most guests leave only positive reviews.  Especially those who came to the island with the kids.  Indeed, in Greece, children are especially tender, attentive, and this, of course, flatters the pride of their parents. </p>
