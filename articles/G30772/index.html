    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  They allow you to make an objective picture of such an institution as the Crystal Hotel (Kemerovo), reviews.  The hotel is characterized by the following disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  if we objectively evaluate the <span>quality of services,</span> we can conclude that the cost of living is overstated; </li><li>  very poor and monotonous breakfast; </li><li>  poor insulation, and therefore you will not be able to relax in your room; </li><li>  standard rooms do not have air conditioning, and therefore there simply is nothing to breathe; </li><li>  the bathroom has a pronounced smell of dampness; </li><li>  even in double rooms, tea, coffee and cosmetic set are provided for only one person. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Quite a popular institution is the hotel "Crystal" (Kemerovo).  Photos of the hotel, taken by travelers, demonstrate a style that is in line with Soviet traditions.  Nevertheless, it is very cozy here, and the quality of service is consistent with European hotels.  This place is attractive not only for its comfortable accommodation, but also for its excellent quality of service.  Especially popular are the sauna and restaurant.  These objects are popular not only among guests, but also among citizens.  Nevertheless, the price of accommodation can be considered somewhat overpriced, taking into account minor flaws (for example, poor breakfast or the smell of dampness in the bathrooms). </p>
