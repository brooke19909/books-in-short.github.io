    <p>  Holidays in Turkey are a great opportunity to spend a vacation on the seashore relatively inexpensively and with all imaginable comfort.  Today this country is one of the most popular among tourists, because the rest of the building is accessible to people with harmful incomes, and the service provided is of the highest level.  Magnificent hotels with comfortable rooms, polite and helpful staff, excellent landscaping, attractive offers of sightseeing tour operators - these are all Turkey. </p><p>  Holidays in Turkey are perfect for newlyweds, and for families with children, and for youthful groups, seeking to have a good time.  The tourist infrastructure of the country is one of the most developed in the world. </p><p>  <strong>about the country</strong> </p><p>  Turkey is located both in the European and Asian parts of the mainland, which explains its cultural and historical uniqueness. </p><p>  <span>The history of Turkey</span> has more than one century, it is rich in events, which are especially interesting to learn about in person.  Here you have the opportunity to visit many stunning museums and historical monuments (for example, Istanbul's <span>Hagia Sophia</span> and the Museum of Anatolian Civilization or the old city around the citadel in Ankara).  Many <span>cities in Turkey</span> are themselves museums. </p><p>  The climate here is very mild and pleasant.  You can swim in the sea from April to November.  Turkey is washed by four <span>seas: Aegean,</span> Black, Marmara and Mediterranean.  Holidays in Turkey in one of the resort cities - Antalya, Belek, Alanya, Bodrum, Marmaris or Kemer - is the best option for a sea holiday. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Secrets of Turkish hospitality</strong> </p><p>  Russians love Turkey for its notorious all-inclusive system.  Everything has been created here for lazy relaxation, when you are truly taken care of and surrounded on all sides by the staff‚Äôs attention so necessary during <span>the holidays</span> .  You can lie on the beach and enjoy the presented refreshments, and during breaks visit fascinating excursions that you are also ready to offer at almost any time of the day or night. </p><p>  <strong>Tours to Turkey</strong> </p><p>  The cost of trips to Turkey is growing every year.  This is due, first of all, to an increase in the level of service and the comfort of living conditions for tourists. </p><p>  If you want to save on a ticket, you can send an application to a travel agency for last-minute tours to Turkey.  Their cost is much lower than regular tariffs.  Therefore, if you freely manage your time, last-minute trips to Turkey can become a real find and pass to a wonderful sunny fairy tale. </p><p>  In the event that your vacation is strictly regulated by a certain time frame, you should take care of purchasing a ticket in advance. </p><p>  <strong>Turkey Hotels</strong> </p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>  The uniqueness of the hotels in Turkey lies in the fact that they are so beautiful, comfortable and ready to offer a great program for vacationers, that they can practically not be left throughout the stay and not be bored.  The entertainment offered by the hotels is interesting for both children and serious adults.  Bars, restaurants, tennis courts, diving clubs, water parks, clubs for children, animation and much more are on the list of opportunities that Turkish hotels offer tourists. </p><p>  This country is rich in nightclubs and all kinds of discos that work all night.  Vacations in Turkey are loved by almost everyone without exception. </p><p>  <strong>Order tours</strong> </p><p>  You can book tours in person at a travel agency or online online, by sending an application indicating the requirements for living conditions and arrival dates.  The latter option will significantly save your time and is a very convenient way to get all the information you need about cities, hotels, prices for tours and hotel accommodations.  You can compare the proposed vacation options and choose the most suitable for you, without leaving home.  To order, it is enough to contact the managers of the travel agency to confirm the order and pay for the service. </p>
