  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The first lake of Chelyabinsk: fishing, bathhouse, barbecue</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Southern Urals is richly endowed with natural resources and has rightly earned the fame of the "Lake District".  Many different reservoirs are located throughout the region far and close to Chelyabinsk, but some formed almost on its outskirts and even inside the city itself. </p><p>  Not all lakes are of natural origin, there are also artificial water spaces formed from industrial human intervention.  Each has its own story and unique name. </p><h2>  First Lake, Second and others </h2><p>  On the whole planet there are <span>karst lakes,</span> they are formed in landscape soil dips, where rain, melt water collects, these voids can also be filled with underground spring water, fresh and even salty.  Just once, industrialists decided to use four small karst lakes located on the eastern outskirts of the city as waste tanks.  Here is a story of the origin in Chelyabinsk of the First Lake, then the Second Lake, the Third Lake, the Fourth Lake and Shelyugino. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.2019358141668" data-lng="61.51587325952153" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/0/8/9/1089.png"></div><p>  Unromantic names in former water sumps for technical effluents of local plants ChTZ, CHPP-2, etc. Although they are all connected by drain channels, over time the water in two such reservoirs became more safe for use, but only a year after the cessation of discharge into them industrial waters.  And in 1957, a young fish factory began to stock up the First Lake of Chelyabinsk.  First, whitefish and carp were launched, and then the ‚Äúassortment‚Äù was expanded: perch, ripus, pike, peled, ruff, pike perch, roach, gudgeon, chebak, crucian carp, bream.  For amateur anglers and even professionals, there is a place to roam. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Recreation center </h2><p>  The modern First Lake of Chelyabinsk is one of the favorite vacation spots of citizens.  Since there is a reservoir within the city, you can get there by public transport.  Buses, trolleybus routes or fixed-route taxis go here.  But you still have to walk a little on foot to get to the recreation center by the Lake Baths on the First in Chelyabinsk.  The road will go along the "Teacher" gardening association, so you can not be afraid of excesses. </p><p>  Here are cozy cottages with amenities and real Russian baths.  Hotel in 2 floors with rooms of various capacities and comforts.  Banquet rooms, summer terraces, secure parking, sports grounds for adults and children. </p><div class="photo" data-original="chelyabinsk.gilmon.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="&quot;Bathhouses on the First&quot; in Chelyabinsk" class="if uuid-2289628" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2289628.jpg"></div><p>  It would be a great idea to hold a wedding ceremony on the First Lake of Chelyabinsk.  There is definitely enough space for any number of guests.  But you need to reserve places here in advance.  There are many holidays in the country, but it is necessary to celebrate them somewhere. </p><h2>  City Beach </h2><p>  Here is a well-kept sandy beach, which you can get to just by paying 100 rubles for an admission ticket.  Moreover, the beach on the First Lake of Chelyabinsk is also visited year-round. </p><div class="photo" data-original="orghost.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest in &quot;Banks on the First&quot;" class="if uuid-2289635" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2289635.jpg"></div><p>  Especially for kebab lovers - equipped barbecue areas.  It lacks only the barbecue itself, a delicious feast and a cheerful company of friends. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For lovers of winter forms of entertainment - horseback riding, tubing center.  An ideal place to relax your body and soul at any time of the year. </p><h2>  Features of local fishing </h2><p>  In fact, there are many sandy beaches along the shores of Lake First.  After all, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe lake is 18.5 square meters.  km  And the presence of developed infrastructure around and transport accessibility made the coast a desirable place for thousands of citizens to live. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rechelstroy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Relax on the beach of the First Lake" class="if uuid-2289622" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2289622.jpg"></div><p>  For this reason, new residential neighborhoods under construction have become popular among young families with children and older couples who want to spend more time in close proximity to nature. </p><p>  Well, indeed, what a charm - fishing within walking distance in winter and summer.  Which man will refuse such a pastime, especially considering the fact that it is not necessary to go far? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ladyshik.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Winter fishing" class="if uuid-2289625" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2289625.jpg"></div><p>  Fishing on the First Lake of Chelyabinsk is possible both from the shore and from boats.  The maximum depth of the reservoir is 10.5 km, the shore is gentle, so unloading of boats is possible everywhere, but drive up no closer than 50 meters.  Everything should be within the law. </p><p>  The fish factory, located on the shore, guarantees fishermen a 100% successful bite. </p><h2>  But.... </h2><p>  Since 2006, negligent attitude of heads of nearby industries, and sometimes residents of new microdistricts, lead to pollution of the ancient karst lake.  The Chelyabinsk environmental prosecutor‚Äôs office is warning.  For a long time it is time not just to talk about the purity of the world, but to teach this at least from school years.  Can start from the first lake?  No wonder it is the First. </p>
