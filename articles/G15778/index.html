    <h2>  Amplitude - trampoline center (Kaliningrad): reviews </h2><p>  Although the institution has been operating since the end of 2015, many Kaliningraders managed to jump on trampolines.  Reviews in the end about this institution are more positive.  Very instructors and trainers are praised, the general atmosphere and the center's compliance with all safety standards. </p><p>  In addition to the residents of the city, “Amplitude” is also visited by visiting people.  Someone celebrates a birthday there, while others spend time waiting for their transport.  And most of them are satisfied. </p><p>  Of course, there are always people who will be unhappy.  Sometimes visitors themselves initially incorrectly recognize or misunderstand the information (for example, that some action is still active), and then get a bad mood.  Employees of the trampoline center are also wrong.  For such cases, official groups of the center were created in social networks to understand a specific situation if the issue was not resolved on the spot. </p>
