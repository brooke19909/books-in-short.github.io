Pamukkale: excursions, hotels, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For more than 20 years, Turkey has been a confident leader among tourist destinations around the world.  The Mediterranean coast of the country is mainly in demand, although in recent years the <span>Aegean Sea has</span> also been loved by many travelers.  A beach holiday in Turkey is really magnificent, but few people know about an alternative pastime here.  But just 120 km from the Aegean coast, at the northern foot of Mount Kardzhi, there is a real crossroad of times - the city of Denizli.  Here, in an intricate way, antiquity intertwines in a close embrace in the person of historical monuments with modern civilization and oriental flavor.  And besides excursions, the city will be happy to offer you a spa-style vacation - mineral <span>springs, thermal</span> pools, traditional hammams will not leave anyone indifferent.  But his main pearl lurked 18 km north. </p>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Just 15 minutes by car along the excellent Antalya-Izmir highway, surrounded by picturesque mountains and cliffs - and welcome to the new natural wonder, Pamukkale.  A truly stunning picture will appear before your eyes - a snow-white mountain with flowing turquoise streams of <span>thermal waters</span> against the azure sky!  Almost every travel guide says about Pamukkale that it is one of the most popular <span>attractions in Turkey.</span>  Indeed, the so-called Cotton Castle is striking in its natural, miraculous beauty. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Pamukkale - what is it? </h2><p>  First of all, Pamukkale, reviews of which are so enthusiastic, is a huge thermal pool of natural origin.  In the spring of the bowels of the earth beat hot jets of highly calcined mineral water, cascading down.  Evaporating, the water leaves in its path fantastically frozen crystals of dazzling white calcium. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="distance to pamukkale" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/8918/531018.jpg" width="550"></div>  Pamukkale travertines can envy even the most talented and skilled architect.  And since there are a lot of thermal springs in the vicinity, this area has become famous as a spa resort.

    <h2>  Why "Cotton Castle"? </h2><p>  Absolutely in all guidebooks Pamukkale is also called the Khlopkov Castle, as this word is translated from Turkish.  The mountain owes such a name, firstly, to its snow-white hue, and secondly, to the history of the nearby town of Denizli.  From ancient times, Denizli was famous for its cotton, which was grown there for the needs of the whole country, and even for export. </p><h2>  History of Pamukkale </h2><p>  From ancient times it was known about Pamukkale that it is a unique thermal balneological resort.  That is why the ancient city of Hierapolis is nearby.  The Romans built it in the immediate vicinity of a hot mineral spring.  The ancient thermal pool of Hierapolis still exists surrounded by the skeletons of marble columns and the ruins of the ancient Roman temple of Apollo. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pamukkale tour" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/8918/531015.jpg" width="600"></div>  The water temperature here is approximately equal to the temperature of the human body (35-36 ¬∞ C), so you can‚Äôt refresh yourself.  Along the perimeter, lush greenery creates a pleasant shadow and coolness.  The size of the pool allows you to simultaneously be in it up to 200 people so that they do not interfere with each other.  In addition, the pool is divided into two parts - shallow and deeper.  Locals tell legends that Cleopatra herself has been here more than once and was happy to immerse herself in the healing waters of a mineral spring.  By the way, and you can follow the queen‚Äôs example and plunge into the pool, of course, not for free.  It is worth visiting about 30 <span>Turkish liras.</span>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Pamukkale - an excursion or an independent trip? </h2><p>  What to prefer in this case?  Almost every tourist knows <span>where Pamukkale is located</span> on a map.  You can get here by car, bus, train or plane.  For example, traveling from Antalya or Marmaris to Izmir, Ephesus or Kusadasi, you can stay overnight in Pamukkale.  The hotels here are very diverse both in price policy and in terms of service.  Alternatively, you can head to Pamukkale for a day trip from Ephesus or Izmir. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pamukkale reviews" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/8918/531016.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  But even if you are not a fan of independent trips, you can still visit Pamukkale.  The excursion here is organized from almost anywhere in Turkey, and even the longest trip will be easy and comfortable thanks to local buses and the quality of Turkish tracks.  The distance to Pamukkale from any popular beach resort is no more than 300-350 km.  Depending on the direction, you can ride along the breathtaking mountain serpentine or along the pleasant and easy channel of a calm river.  A tour in Pamukkale from Kemer or Antalya should optimally be a two-day trip, combining Pamukkale and Ephesus.  Here you will spend a pleasant day exploring the vast ancient Roman ruins of Hierapolis, visit the largest ancient amphitheater, view exhibits at the Archaeological Museum, take pictures at the picturesque travertines and refresh yourself in the Cleopatra Basin.  In addition, a visit to Pamukkale can be combined with Laodocia or the city of Aphrodite - the goddess of love. </p><h2>  Surroundings of Pamukkale </h2><p>  Almost all tourists who have visited Turkey at least once heard about Pamukkale that it is the most beautiful Cotton Castle.  But few people know how many more beauties are hidden in its environs.  Just two kilometers west of the Denizli ‚Äì Pamukkale highway is Laodokia.  Give this ancient town at least a couple of hours - you won‚Äôt regret it.  If you plan to devote several days to exploring the surroundings, we recommend staying in the town of Pamukkale - there are nice hotels here, each of which, by the way, has its own thermal pool.  There are more than 30 of them. Hal-Tur Hotel, Venus Hotel, Sinter Terasse House Hotel, Melrose Viewpoint Hotel, Ozbay Hotel received the highest ratings from tourists. </p>

    <h2>  Pamukkale Plateau </h2><p>  As we already said, Pamukkale is a small, only 300 m high, mountain with a plateau on top, where the ruins of Hierapolis and the Cleopatra basin are located.  There are only three roads leading to the plateau, on each of which you will have to pay the entrance.  It is optimal to rise and fall from different sides in order to maximize the beauty of Pamukkale.  An excursion will cost you an average of $ 10. </p><h2>  An interesting fact about Pamukkale </h2><p>  In the early 90s of the previous century, local authorities decided to change the development strategy of the Pamukkale resort in order to increase the flow of tourists from abroad.  But as a result of the incorrectly developed strategy, the number of tourists, on the contrary, decreased, so before the beginning of the XXI century, almost nothing was said about Pamukkale in tourist guides. </p><h2>  Travel Tips </h2><p>  If you decide to go on an independent trip and explore Pamukkale without the help of a guide, the following recommendations will be useful to you.  If you drive into the city by car, you can see that the locals on motor scooters around you are actively gesticulating and are trying in every possible way to attract your attention.  The first thought that comes to the mind of a gullible tourist is a doubt: maybe something is wrong with the car?  In fact, as soon as you stop and get out of the car, the locals will immediately try to put some rubbish in your hands and begin to persuade them to buy it.  They will ask if you need a hotel, restaurant or souvenir shop, and if necessary, they will certainly lead you to your destination, for which, of course, they will take their ‚Äúcommission‚Äù.  Whether this will affect the price you pay is unknown, but it certainly won‚Äôt get lower! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pamukkale from Kemer" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/8918/531019.jpg" width="570"></div>

    <h2>  Bans </h2><p>  Since Pamukkale is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it is protected by local and international law.  So, the road leading to the terraces from the southeast is closed to visitors.  The excursion trail is marked and limited here, and access to the terraces is prohibited in order to preserve the flow of water, color and structure of travertines.  Separately installed and marked places where visitors can swim in the thermal waters. </p><h2>  Reviews and opinions of tourists </h2><p>  Most visitors to this wonderful creation of nature are indescribable delight - you seem to be in parallel reality, tourists say.  In fact, Cotton Castle really makes a lasting impression.  Snow-white terraces, turquoise water, ancient monuments of architecture, a relaxed atmosphere will appeal to everyone, regardless of gender, age and nationality. </p><p>  This place is exceptional in the uniqueness of natural phenomena: warm, highly mineralized water that flows from thermal springs and flows down the snow-white slopes of the mountain forms crystal-clear turquoise pools.  On the plateau crowning this natural miracle, the most ancient example of early Christian architecture in the Roman style has spread. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pamukkale hotels" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/8918/531020.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Pamukkale National Park, reviews of which are usually enthusiastic, combines not only the famous Cotton Castle, but also the adjacent several villages, near which thermal springs come to the surface.  And in the local ancient amphitheater in Hierapolis, modern theater troupes are still performing, returning us many centuries ago and surprising us with excellent acoustics and a stunning atmosphere. </p><p>  Pamukkale National Park is truly a masterpiece created by nature, and the pearl of not only Turkey, but the whole world! </p>
