  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IPhone competitors: model overview, comparative characteristics, photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Fans of technology with a ‚Äúbitten apple‚Äù rejoice, because now you can buy two of the latest iPhone models.  That's just for the XS and X models will need to pretty much spend money.  But you can buy smartphones much cheaper with almost the same characteristics.  And such an insignificant ‚Äúalmost‚Äù reservation among the competitors of ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù is not worth the difference of 20-40 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Differences iPhone XS from iPhone X </h2><p>  In terms of design, both phones are exact copies of each other, the display also has no differences, and its diagonal is 5.8 inches.  The screen resolution, number of pixels, contrast and brightness have not changed.  Here are just manufacturers specify that the dynamic range has increased by as much as 60%.  Unfortunately, users are unlikely to notice this. </p><p>  There is a difference in weight, but not significant - XS is heavier by as much as 3 grams.  Most likely, it arose due to the improved and strengthened glass both from the side of the screen and from the back side. </p><p>  The processor in XS is better and able to save battery power, performance has increased by 15% and it is better tuned to work with neural networks.  In addition, the improved processor now has not a 2-core coprocessor, but an 8-core one. </p><p>  We expanded the main memory of the device.  If on model X there was a maximum of 256 GB, then in XS it became 512 GB.  This is enough to store 100,000 photographs. </p><p>  The camera remained unchanged, the difference is only in the increased size of the sensor from 1.2 to 1.4 microns.  This allowed about 50% more light to pass through. </p><p>  Among the less significant differences, you can specify the following: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Face ID has become faster </li><li>  the audio adapter was removed from the package; </li><li>  autonomy increased by 30 minutes; </li><li>  manufacturers modified the NFC sensor. </li></ul><p>  As you can see, the changes are quite insignificant, but the price difference between these models is from 20,000 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.forbes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone 10 competitors" class="if uuid-3122893" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43342/3122893.jpg"></div><h2>  Competitors </h2><p>  There is a large selection of smartphones with the same or approximate characteristics, but with prices an order of magnitude lower.  The iPhone competitors are on the alert and every spring delight people with new products. </p><h2>  Samsung Galaxy Note 9 </h2><p>  The cost of this smartphone is from 69,000 rubles.  Samsung has a large screen diagonal, increased RAM, a stylus, a standard headphone jack, a memory card slot and faster charging.  Not without cons.  It is only one; it consists in a less efficient processor.  That's just it is almost not felt. </p><p>  According to buyers, this Korean device is currently the most advanced. </p><p>  The screen is 6.5 inches with a resolution of 2960x1440.  It does not have a recess above the sensors.  The camera is dual with a post-focus, Samsung Exynos 9810 processor, more RAM (6 GB).  The main advantage of this device is the stylus, in addition, it still plays the role of a remote control (remote).  He is able to rewind music and video, as well as release the shutter on the camera and at the same time everything happens without contact with the smartphone. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Note 9 can be called the main competitor of the iPhone XS. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.harveynorman.ie" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="phone competitor to iphone" class="if uuid-3122897" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43342/3122897.jpg"></div><h2>  Samsung Galaxy S9 + </h2><p>  The cost of the phone is approximately 66,000 rubles.  This model has a fairly large screen with increased resolution, it does not have a notch in the upper part under the camera, sensors and a speaker, more RAM, there is a standard headphone jack, the kit includes fast charging and there is a slot for expanding memory. </p><p>  This competitor of "iPhone 10" and XS has minor disadvantages, but this helps to save a few thousand rubles.  The screen is 2.10 inches smaller diagonally, there is no stylus, the battery is 500 mAh less, and in the basic version of the memory it is 64 GB less. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gumtree.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chinese iPhone competitor" class="if uuid-3122926" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43342/3122926.jpg"></div><h2>  LG G7 ThinQ </h2><p>  This representative of competitors "iPhone" costs 59,000 rubles.  Its performance is lower due to the average processor, however, this is not very noticeable for ordinary users. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The screen of this model has a higher resolution, there is a connector (standard) for headphones, the kit provides for fast charging and there is a slot for a memory card.  In addition, the headphones have a very clear and loud sound. </p><p>  However, despite its advantages, this model is not very popular.  Many believe that this is due to the strange and disproportionate form of the screen (19.5x9) and the camera, which takes not very good photos in automatic mode.  However, during manual shooting this problem is not.  The smartphone has one significant advantage in the form of an additional wide-angle lens.  This few models can boast of. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.argomall.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="competitors iphone xs" class="if uuid-3122931" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43342/3122931.jpg"></div><h2>  Chinese competitors </h2><p>  Chinese rivals iPhone X and XS are trying in many ways to copy the eminent brand and make their models as close as possible to the "apple".  That's just their cost at times less with fairly good quality. </p><h2>  Xiaomi Mi 8 </h2><p>  The cost of the main Chinese competitor iPhone is only 29,000 rubles.  The screen of the model is of good quality and has a higher resolution, more RAM, the kit comes with fast charging. </p><p>  The smartphone runs on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor, which is inferior to the iPhone in performance.  At the same time, Mi 8 has 6 GB of RAM.  A memory card slot is not provided, but the phone‚Äôs internal memory can be 64 or 128 GB.  This is quite enough for the average user. </p><p>  The phone has a preinstalled MIUI proprietary shell, for many this is a definite plus. </p><p>  An interesting story is connected with this phone.  When it started selling, Apple's chief design officer Johnny Ive called Xiaomi thieves.  However, they objected to this that they had not stolen anything, but only inspired by Apple models. </p><p>  It looks pretty comical, because, in fact, Mi 8 is a classic copy-paste in Chinese design. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidpolice.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone's main competitor" class="if uuid-3122935" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43342/3122935.jpg"></div><h2>  Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 </h2><p>  This competitor ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù was not seen in such stories and outwardly completely unlike the ‚Äúapple‚Äù representative.  This model costs an average of 25,000 rubles. </p><p>  The smartphone runs on a good eight-core Qualcomm SDM845 Snapdragon 845 processor, but its performance is less.  RAM 6.8 or 10 GB, it depends on the RAM.  Display 6.39 inches diagonally without a notch "monobrow" for cameras and sensors.  The main distinguishing feature is the traveling panel, on which all the elements missing in the upper part are located.  It looks unusual and quite stylish because of this. </p><p>  There is no standard headphone jack on the case, so only wireless models are suitable for it, but this can be forgiven for the clear, loud and surround sound of the music. </p><p>  This flagship model has every chance to become the No. 1 competitor for Apple. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theverge.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone competitors" class="if uuid-3122945" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43342/3122945.jpg"></div><h2>  Huawei P20 Pro </h2><p>  This phone (competitor of "iPhone") is equipped with a large display with a diagonal of 6.1 inches and a resolution of 2244 √ó 1080 with an aspect ratio of 18.7 √ó 9.  It also has an oleophobic coating. </p><p>  The processor of the P20 Pro Huawei Kirin 970 with artificial intelligence, which is an advantage against its counterparts.  The number of cores is 8, the RAM is 6 GB, but the built-in 128 GB, but there is no slot for expanding it. </p><p>  The smartphone is very fond of fans to take photos.  Thanks to three cameras at 40, 20 and 8 megapixels, the pictures are bright, saturated and clear.  Selfie lovers appreciated the front camera at 24 megapixels. </p><p>  Huawei P20 Pro is able to fully replace the "iPhone X" and XS.  In addition, it costs 2 times cheaper (39 000 rubles). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.xtremeskins.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Other iPhone competitors" class="if uuid-3122947" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43342/3122947.jpg"></div><h2>  OnePlus 6T </h2><p>  The manufacturer of this Chinese flagship equipped the device with a pretty good Snapdragon 845 processor, it is inferior to the iPhone in performance, but it works smartly and without failures.  The smartphone has 6 or 8 GB of RAM (depending on the main memory), models with a capacity of 128 or 256 GB offer a choice. </p><p>  The flagship also has a large and high-quality screen in 6.41 inches diagonally, with a resolution of 2340 √ó 1080 and support for HDR.  A distinctive feature of this device is a fingerprint built into the screen.  By the way, this does not affect his work. </p><p>  The cameras here are pretty mediocre, at least on the iPhone they are much better.  But buying such a smartphone is clearly not due to the quality of the pictures. </p><p>  In general, this is a pretty hardy device.  In talk mode, its battery lasts 25 hours, and when watching a video - 16 hours.  Impressive results.  The cost of a smartphone is 40,000 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dxomark.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="competitors iPhone 10 from other manufacturers" class="if uuid-3122950" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43342/3122950.jpg"></div><h2>  Meizu 16th </h2><p>  This model has a frameless display without a "monobrow" in the upper part.  At the same time, the camera and sensors are located in an almost imperceptible 7 mm strip.  In this case, the diagonal display is only 6.0 inches and with a resolution of 2160 √ó 1080, but this is more than the iPhone.  This smartphone also has excellent cameras.  The pictures are bright, rich and clear.  It provides for panoramic, continuous shooting modes and there is a bokeh effect. </p><p>  The processor is rather weak, but it works with 8 cores.  RAM 6 GB, built-in only 64 GB and at the same time there is no slot for its expansion. </p><p>  On the case there is a standard headphone jack.  The price of this model is 40,000 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="superg.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="phone competitor to iphone" class="if uuid-3122961" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43342/3122961.jpg"></div><p>  The main competitors of "iPhone X" and XS can safely be called Samsung Galaxy Note 9 and Xiaomi Mi Mix 3. But their cost is 2-3 times lower.  Of course, the processors of both models are rather weak, but many ordinary users do not notice this, since they do not use them at full capacity. </p><p>  According to the synthetic test, iPhone X and XS are ahead of all their non-apple competitors.  In principle, this is the expected result.  After all, their performance is really at their best.  Here are just the rest of the characteristics, if they are not inferior to other manufacturers, then they are significantly losing ground in terms of price and capabilities. </p>
