How to get to the Temple of Heaven in Beijing?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  An exotic country that attracts guests with an abundance of architectural and natural monuments is not in vain called a true treasury of attractions left from the oldest world civilization.  An ancient state with a rich culture, rooted in the distant past, is proud of a unique building with a strong energy - the embodiment of the greatness of the architects' skill and deep astrological knowledge, which China has always been famous for. </p><p>  Temple of Heaven in Beijing (Tiantan) is a cult object of the Celestial Empire.  Protected by UNESCO, it is recognized as the country's most popular attraction.  This is the only religious building that has a rounded shape, the roof of which is covered with blue tiles, not red ones.  The architectural complex Tiantan is located in the southeast of the state capital.  And its location is based on ancient knowledge of two energies - Yin (female power) and Yang (male). </p><h2>  Doctrine of harmony </h2><p>  Confucian teaching states that the ruler is of divine origin.  The Temple of Heaven in Beijing, the construction of which was begun by order of Emperor Yong Le in 1406, and completed 14 years later, was a religious building where offerings were brought twice a year so that sunny days could stand as long as possible or it would finally rain.  The ruler was obliged to observe the laws of the universe, so as not to violate the natural course of things, and to honor them in the same way as the father's covenants, showing the highest degree of virtue and respect for the ancestors.  The Chinese believed in the perfect balance of nature and knew that if harmony was broken, it was worth waiting for various disasters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="temple of heaven in Beijing how to get" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1765756.jpg" width="600"></div>

If heat or cold comes on time, then the earth gives a good harvest, and a powerful empire only flourishes.  Laws of Heaven are repeating natural cycles, birth and death. </p><h2>  A sacred place where Chinese ideas about the world come true </h2><p>  After a hundred years later a new religious building appeared, named after the Earth, the religious complex with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 267 hectares was renamed the Temple of Heaven in Beijing.  The architecture of the structure has its own characteristics: the northern sector is made in the form of a semicircle, and the southern sector is a square.  The architects used various forms to deliberately divide the masterpiece into two components. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="temple of heaven in beijing briefly" class="if" height="420" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1765716.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The device, architecture, as well as the symbolism of the Temple of Heaven in Beijing make it possible to perceive it as the main shrine, in which the Chinese ideas about the world are embodied: they believed that the earth has the shape of a square, and the sky that helps people looks like a circle. </p><h2>  A masterpiece of world architecture, restored and open to visitors </h2><p>  The most beautiful monument, where the Sky is connected to the Earth with the help of man, underwent several reconstructions over six hundred years, but its appearance has been preserved unchanged.  It will take at least three hours to get around the historic complex open to visitors.  On its territory, surrounded by a centuries-old cypress forest, you can meet both locals walking in the parks and admired tourists from all over the world. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Temple of Heaven in Beijing, described in an article, was restored in 2006, and more than six million dollars were spent on its restoration by the authorities.  At the beginning of the last century, after the overthrow of the last emperor, the state controlled the religious monument, where the entrance for ordinary people was closed.  Despite all the prohibitions, believers penetrated the sacred building, and already in 1918 it was open to the public. </p><h2>  Important rite for the monarch and residents </h2><p>  The magnificent Temple of Heaven (Beijing), stretched from north to south, was the place where the rulers of China communicated with the gods.  Only the emperor, who was considered the son of Heaven, could ask the higher powers for prosperity and prosperity for the country.  He went with his courtiers during the solstice to the sacred object to pray and make sacrifices. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="temple of heaven in beijing description" class="if" height="444" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1765732.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Naturally, such an important ceremony took place in complete solitude, and ordinary people were forbidden to watch the actions of their monarch under pain of death.  Residents were eagerly awaiting news of how the rite passed.  It was believed that if the emperor could not get support from higher powers, then Heaven did not trust him, and in the event of a crop failure his rule could be in jeopardy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There are records in historical chronicles that 23 emperors of the Celestial Empire performed almost seven hundred sacrifices here, strengthening their power.  And only in 1911, by order of the government, the bloody rite was canceled, and seven years later, the Temple of Heaven in Beijing, a photo of which convey its amazing beauty, was open to all visitors. </p><h2>  Palace of Abstinence (Solitude) </h2><p>  However, before performing the ceremony, the emperor was obliged to prepare for it and spend up to five days in the Palace of Abstinence, where he fasted and constantly meditated, purifying his soul.  The huge complex, decorated with images of dragons, symbolizing the power of power, was surrounded by a deep moat filled with water and powerful stone walls.  This is done in order to preserve the peace of the ruler, who daily prayed to higher powers. </p><p>  Now there is a museum, the expositions of which demonstrate objects of the Qing era, used for bloody sacrifices. </p><h2>  Altar of heaven </h2><p>  The three-tier structure of a round shape, in the construction of which cement and iron were not used, is a round pyramid with a diameter of about 67 meters.  The altar has an amazing sound effect: even the words uttered in a whisper, heard in all corners of the altar, as if ascend to Heaven, reflected from the plates with multiple echoes.  It is believed that, like a sound, the strongest energy of an amazing place is concentrated here, so it is recommended to come here to the opening itself, when there are not many people to be alone with yourself and reflect on important topics. </p><p>  The tiers made of white marble symbolize several elements - not only heavenly and earthly, but also human.  People who are able to realize the most unusual ideas and create something new connect them.  And this trinity was embodied in the architecture of the altar, in which after many centuries not a single crack appeared. </p><h2>  Cherished Plate </h2><p>  Gates lead to it from four corners of the world, and each of the stairs consists of nine steps.  In the center of the altar, where the ruler performed the ritual of sacrifice to the gods, there is a huge stone slab on which the emperor, kneeling in the Temple of Heaven in Beijing, knelt and communicated with higher powers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="temple of heaven in beijing" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1765767.jpg" width="505"></div>

    <p>  There is a belief that she fulfills her most cherished dreams and that is why tourists who have made a wish will definitely stand on her.  The plate is surrounded by a ring consisting of nine platforms, and in the ninth ring there are already 81. The number 9 is the number of the ruler, which indicates nine levels of the sky. </p><h2>  Hall of Sacrificial Prayers (Harvest) </h2><p>  The three-tier wooden structure, created without the use of cement and nails, was restored after lightning struck it.  It is considered the main attraction of a religious complex called the Temple of Heaven (Beijing).  In the hall where the emperor prayed to the gods for a good harvest, wooden columns were installed, symbolizing 12 months, four seasons and 28 constellations.  The very construction of the hall shows the correct heavenly order, which should be on Earth. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="china temple of heaven in beijing" class="if" height="353" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1765761.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The top of a cone-shaped structure with a six-meter marble terrace, made in the shape of a circle, is crowned with a golden ball.  The interior is striking in its amazing luxury, and especially delights the ceiling, decorated with elegant carvings, which you want to admire.  Tour guides claim that the hall is decorated with five thousand images of dragons that have retained the brightness of colors, and therefore it is so popular among photographers taking spectacular pictures. </p><h2>  Hall of Heaven (Greatness) </h2><p>  A small blue-tiled hall, where the emperor turned to heavenly forces, is a bit like the Temple of Harvest.  It was designed to store old tablets with the inscribed names of the ancestors of the clan of the great emperor of China and the names of natural elements.  If you stand on stone slabs in front of his entrance and shout, you can hear multiple echoes.  This is due to the reflection of sound waves from a round wall surrounding a small room. </p><p>  True, as tourists say, there are always a lot of people trying to verify this statement in practice, and therefore there is a terrible rumble in which nothing can be made out. </p><h2>  What else to see? </h2><p>  The Temple of Heaven in Beijing, which cannot be briefly described, is rich in famous sights, but there are enough places on its territory that are of interest to tourists.  So, there are secondary halls where services were previously held to the gods, and now they have souvenir shops. </p><p>  Indoor galleries, on the ceilings of which you can see scenes from the history and views of China, are incredibly popular: they not only direct visitors along a given route, but also save from heat.  Here you can take a break after an exciting trip, eat, enjoy the wonderful scenery and just chat with other tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="temple of heaven beijing" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1765769.jpg" width="600"></div>
