  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sodium bicarbonate and scope of use</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sodium bicarbonate <span>(drinking soda)</span> is a crystalline salt, for most people it is better known as a white powder with a fine grinding fraction.  The name of this product has a number of synonyms: <span>sodium bicarbonate,</span> bicarbonate soda, sodium bicarbonate, <span>baking soda,</span> sodium bicarbonate.  It is odorless, has a salty-alkaline taste.  Soda is quite well soluble in water, forming an alkaline solution, its basicity depends on the amount of dissolved soda. </p><p>  <span>Sodium bicarbonate</span> practically does not dissolve in alcohol, is explosion-proof and fireproof, non-toxic.  In dry air, sodium bicarbonate does not react, in the case of moistening of a crystalline salt or in contact with water, a reaction occurs with the release of carbon dioxide.  Actively reacts with acids to form new salts and gaseous compounds.  At temperatures above 60 degrees, the decomposition process is in progress, the products of this process are carbon dioxide, water and <span>sodium carbonate.</span> </p><p>  Soda on the mucous membrane can cause respiratory irritation.  This should be taken into account when sending people to work continuously in an atmosphere containing bicarbonate soda dust.  Sodium bicarbonate has practical applications in medicine, food, chemical, light, pharmaceutical and metallurgical industries.  Widely used in everyday life by the country's population. </p><p>  The food industry uses sodium bicarbonate in the production of bakery and confectionery products, for the preparation of drinks. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Drinking soda is used as a baking powder during the baking of bread products (the property of soda is decomposed into components when heated, including carbon dioxide).  A good acid neutralizer is sodium bicarbonate.  Its NaHCO3 formula is known to everyone who once studied chemistry.  As far back as the 19th century, a German physician Bulrich discovered that bicarbonate soda was able to remove burning sensation in the esophagus with high acidity.  A teaspoon of soda dissolved in 150 gr.  water, can eliminate heartburn. </p><p>  The ability to neutralize the effect of sodium bicarbonate acid began to be used where it is necessary to remove excess acid trapped on the body (acid burn, mosquito bite, etc.).  Dry baking soda can be used to treat a fresh burn.  Soda solution is practiced as a weak antiseptic for intoxication, infection and diabetes.  It also helps with inflammatory processes of the eyes, to thin the secretion in the bronchi, rinse the mouth and other diseases. </p><p>  However, sodium bicarbonate with prolonged use can cause side effects in the form of: headache, vomiting, loss of appetite, etc.  Experts do not recommend applying a lot of soda to people with hypertension. </p><p>  There are contraindications, about which you can find out after consulting a doctor. </p><p>  The chemical industry uses sodium bicarbonate in the manufacture of polystyrene, various dyes, household chemicals, fluoride reagents. </p><p>  With the help of soda, the process of separating hydrogen sulfide and <span>carbon dioxide</span> from a gas mixture has been established.  It is also used in the manufacture of powder fillers in fire extinguishers and fire extinguishing systems.  Sodium bicarbonate when <span>extinguishing a fire with</span> carbon dioxide released during heating, isolates the access of oxygen to the burning center.  Light industry uses this product in the production of artificial leather and rubber for soles, for finishing textile fabrics and tanning leather. </p><p>  In domestic conditions, soda has practical applications for removing plaque on the hair from the use of mousses, conditioners, etc. To do this, just add it to the shampoo.  Sometimes a ‚Äúdry shampoo‚Äù is used to remove accumulated fat on the hair, for this purpose a little soda is applied to the hair roots, combed and treated with a hot hairdryer.  A thick paste of water and soda (1: 3) will remove the problem of rough skin on the heels and elbows.  In enameled dishes, it is easy to remove carbon deposits with a solution of baking soda. </p>
