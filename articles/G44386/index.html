    <ol><li>  <em>Territory.</em>  The hotel has a large landscaped area, the size of a park, it has a lot of greenery.  Garbage is nowhere to be seen: gardeners work. </li><li>  <em>The rooms.</em>  The authors of the reviews note that the rooms are quite clean, they are cleaned every day.  They are placed here quickly, upon request they will give housing close to the sea.  Tourists who visited the Sangho Club Zarzis 3 *, say that everything works properly in the rooms, it‚Äôs spacious here, there‚Äôs nothing to be called for.  They change linen, they will bring TV at the request.  Clean well.  The lack of shower gel, shampoo and hair dryer in the bathroom is the norm.  The hotel on the first line has bungalows that can be accommodated for a surcharge of $ 25 per day, but, according to many, these expenses are not at all justified.  These rooms are accommodated either families with young children, or those with sore feet, elderly people (if there are free bungalows).  It‚Äôs better to save money, say the authors of the reviews.  They advise you not to worry too much if the room gets a little further away from the beach.  Firstly, everything is very close here, and you can still walk to the sea in 5 minutes on foot from anywhere, and secondly, from the rooms that are located on the hill, there is a very beautiful view, it has quiet and very large balconies. </li><li>  <em>The beach</em> .  According to reviews, it is beautiful, big, clean.  Wonderful sand - white and fine.  It is well known that the local problem is the shortage of sun loungers and deck chairs.  Since everyone is missing, they are brought from the pool or find some other way out.  The authors of the reviews report that many Russian tourists occupy sun loungers at the hotel for the whole day and mainly their towels are sunbathing on the beach.  To the great shame and regret, users write, a separate article can be devoted to the behavior of some Russian tourists: in the restaurant and in the hotel they show "unlimited rudeness and arrogance." </li><li>  <em>Sea.</em>  Guests admire that the sea at Sangho Club Zarzis 3 * is crystal clear.  But, unfortunately, small.  In mid-September, it already throws a lot of algae onto the beach, although they, according to the guests, do not interfere at all, the water still remains as clean and clear.  The guests here enjoy clean sand and sea water, the smell of the sea, but note that they do not reach the depths, the sea is shallow on the beach, although sometimes there are relatively deep places - down the throat. </li><li>  <em>Nutrition.</em>  According to the reviews of tourists who have been here, the Sangho Club Zarzis 3 * hotel is fed very well, satisfying, tasty and varied.  Breakfast, lunch and dinner are satisfied with all vacationers.  Every day, the menu contains beef, turkey, lamb, fish, and fruit - melon and grapes.  Often a hotel is filled with guests, so sometimes there are not enough places and dishes in the restaurant.  In the morning, during breakfast, you sometimes have to queue for an omelet, but this is not tiring.  Coffee from the vending machine, good tea, croissants, local cottage cheese and yogurt are delicious.  Delicious pancakes, donuts are cooked at the client.  Juices - such as "yuppie" orange, lemon.  For $ 2 you can order fresh orange juice.  For lunch, in addition to 3-4 types of meat, a side dish is proposed: rice, mashed potatoes, french fries and various stewed vegetables.  The meat is often cooked with local seasoning, it is quite spicy.  But served and stew, suitable for the children's menu.  Soups are quite spicy.  Fresh vegetable salads can be seasoned with mayonnaise, olive oil, sour cream.  The menu also includes spaghetti with filling, shrimp, fish.  On the street cooked meat on the grill.  Ice cream is offered once a week.  For dinner, the menu is the same as for lunch.  The authors of the reviews recommend taking a pack of napkins with them on a trip, as it is rather problematic to purchase them in a hotel. </li><li>  <em>Alcohol.</em>  According to tourists vacationing at Zarzis, the hotel‚Äôs bar has ‚Äúquite a variety of alcohol‚Äù: vodka, whiskey, wine, gin, sedratin, bukh (local vodka), beer.  There is coffee and tea, soft drinks.  Bartenders make delicious cocktails.  Opening hours of the bars: from ten in the morning until eleven in the evening.  Drinking water is given in unlimited quantities.  According to some tourists, the alcohol in the local bars is diluted, especially with a large influx of guests. </li><li>  <em>Staff.</em>  According to vacationers, the hotel staff is ‚Äúvery friendly, polite, instantly fulfills any request, tries to please in every possible way‚Äù.  At the reception they communicate in French, Arabic, a little in English and, helping themselves with gestures, in Russian. </li><li> <em>Animation.</em>  A separate respect for hotel guests is to local animators.  From morning to late evening, boys and girls faithfully entertain holidaymakers.  Pool games, volleyball, water polo, aqua aerobics, kids club, fitness, animation, dancing.  Unobtrusively, but a lot of fun.  Outside the hotel, a little to the left, there are attractions for children (paid, but cheap).  Nevertheless, some reviewers write that although they liked the Sangho Club Zarzis 3 *, they won‚Äôt go there anymore.  Nothing to watch, nowhere to go.  From idleness I had to sleep and eat a lot. </li><li>  <em>The Internet.</em>  There are quite big problems with the Internet at the Sangho Club Zarzis 3 * hotel, as vacationers report.  It is very slow and connects ‚Äúonce in a while‚Äù. </li><li>  <em>What to bring with you?</em>  The authors of the reviews advise: to bring with you an adapter or Euro plugs for appliances, shower gel, shampoo, hair dryer. </li></ol>

    <p>  The hotel is called a pretty decent "three rubles", many of whom have only positive impressions.  The advantages of the hotel include: a large territory, a significant amount of greenery, excellent animation, decent food.  The cons are: disadvantages of service on the beach (lack of deck chairs and umbrellas), lack of paper napkins in the dining room. </p><p>  Many reviewers thank the entire staff - from administrators to janitors - for a wonderful stay.  In their opinion, in the Sangho Club Zarzis 3 * everything is very good.  They advise to find fault with less, to realize the "three-star" and the low price of the hotel, which he fully justifies.  The hotel is fully consistent with its category, according to its guests, and in some respects deserves four stars. </p>
