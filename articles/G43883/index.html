This article is based on the opinions of many electricians who share their tips and convenient tricks.  They will help to understand the scenarios of the correct connection. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="EFAYN5y43YI" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFAYN5y43YI" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/6/4/7/1/16471.jpg"></div><h2>  Starter hole sawing </h2><p>  For the first step in the matter of how to assemble the socket, you will need a tool such as a screwdriver. </p><p>  To solve this problem, plasterboard saws are often used, they are often called hacksaw.  They can be used to pierce a wall to make a hole.  But experts found that less damage occurs when several starter holes are made in opposite corners with a lean flat-head screwdriver.  Of course, when you need to cut something, it is better to make it a saw.  But too aggressive cutting can lead to rupture of drywall on the reverse side, which will significantly weaken it.  It is important to stay inside the lines.  Too large a hole will be unusable.  If the hole is small, you can cut the edges with a utility knife. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Find the cavity </h2><p>  This is the second step in how to assemble the outlet. </p><p>  When you need to pull electricity out of an unfinished basement, a simple way to find out where to drill a hole for a new cable is to drill a small ‚Äúseeker‚Äù hole near the base of the wall and put in a long wire clothes hanger.  Many electricians use nippers for cutting at an angle of 45 degrees and actually use a cutting end for drilling.  So the hanger will pass through the carpet, parquet floors and even drywall.  If you need to do the same work, but from the attic, you need to stretch the wire, and then lower it down and measure about 9-10 centimeters.  Here in this place and it is necessary to drill a new hole. </p><p>  The same trick works in any room, even in the same attic.  You just need to drill a hole where the wall crosses the ceiling.  Since there is no finish, it is necessary to measure the distance from the hanger only 5 centimeters.  Of course, you can use a conventional wire, cutting off the necessary length from it.  But it is worth paying attention that plastic hangers will not work! </p><h2>  Cable stripping </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to assemble an outlet block" class="if uuid-3183291" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/105416/3183291.jpg"></div><p>  The third step in how to assemble the outlet is to prepare the materials before they are drawn. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is much easier to remove the sheath from the cables before installing the box.  Make sure that at least 6 millimeters of protection are fitted inside, behind the clamp.  And also it is necessary that at least 15 centimeters are left in the device.  It is necessary to measure from the front edge of the box opening.  After installation, you need to bend the end of the wires using the hole on the device to strip them. </p><h2>  Hole cutting </h2><p>  The fourth step is how to assemble the sockets.  The plug must be inspected at this point.  It is important that no burning is present on it, and that the wires are not tangled. </p><p>  A rotating tool is a great, safe way to cut through tiles.  It is necessary to establish a small depth of the cutting element in order to avoid getting into the plumbing or wires in the wall cavity.  If possible, grout lines should be used on both sides of the hole, because they are much easier to cut through.  The next step is to drill start holes in opposite angles.  For this, a glass and tile tool is suitable. </p><h2>  Electric box </h2><div class="photo" data-original="rianve.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ground outlet" class="if uuid-3183290" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/105416/3183290.jpg"></div><p>  If the question is only how to properly assemble the outlet, then it is worth proceeding immediately to this fifth step. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There are several types of boxes, sometimes referred to as remade.  Some of them are easier to find than others (but they are all available online), while others are easier to install and more reliable (details below).  Instead of nailing, the boxes are attached to drywall.  Here are some of the most common styles: </p><ul><li>  A fiberglass rigid box is a favorite of many contractors, although it is slightly more expensive.  They like it because the sturdy clamping system is much more reliable than the cheaper models.  These boxes are not always available in malls, but you can find them in electrical stores.  This model works well, especially if the outlet is widely used, as it enhances protection. </li><li>  A PVC box is the least expensive and most affordable, but it also appears to be the most fragile on the market.  Some professionals complain that the clamping legs are not strong enough and the screws push the plastic back. </li><li>  Finally, a fiberglass box is a good choice.  The models are reasonably priced, available at many malls, and they are stronger than the PVC version. </li></ul><h2>  Foldable wires at the back of the electrical unit </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.circuitbasics.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="assemble a ground outlet" class="if uuid-3183277" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/105416/3183277.jpg"></div><p>  How to assemble a ground outlet?  It should be noted here that all subsequent steps imply the presence of this parameter. </p><p>  Many electricians connect all the wires together, and then conduct short individual cords (pigtails) to the outlet.  They also ensure that the rest of the circuit remains energized below the ceiling, even if this outlet fails.  You need to carefully fold all the wires and insert them into the back of the box.  Recklessly driving cords into a crowded box can lead to loose connections and damage to the insulation.  Eventually, a fire may occur. </p><h2>  Two wires with different sizes </h2><p>  To answer the question of how to assemble a double outlet, it is worth noting that the procedure remains the same, only the number of cords increases.  Therefore, it is worthwhile to closely monitor each step.  And it's best to mark each end with your number. </p><p>  If the wires are pulled out of the circuit when assembling the double socket and there is a 12 gauge cord among them, you do not need to install the 14th connector material in a new outlet or vice versa.  It must be connected with the same wire as the source.  The same scheme will be relevant for answering the question of how to assemble triple sockets. </p><h2>  Finishing electrical boxes with a support </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to assemble a socket" class="if uuid-3183280" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/105416/3183280.jpg"></div><p>  Many electricians prefer to work with drawers with metal flanges.  They provide more support than hinged wings.  Their disadvantage is that they are not intended for thicker walls.  Therefore, when you need to add wires to drywall with a large skin, it is recommended that before installation cut off about 20 millimeters from both metal flanges using fairing scissors.  You need to make straight cuts, otherwise the box will be bent in the hole. </p><h2>  Outlet attached to the bare frame </h2><p>  You must understand that when you select a circuit to which you want to add material, the ease of connecting the wire is likely to be the most important factor.  Here are a few acceptable options. </p><ul><li>  General purpose sockets in living quarters, attics and unfinished basements. </li><li>  Places for switches and lighting fixtures where non-switched 120-volt power is available. </li><li>  Smoke Detector Locations </li></ul><p>  It is worth noting that you can‚Äôt just add to any chain in the house.  Here are some schemes to avoid. </p><ul><li>  Dedicated kitchen, bathroom and laundry. </li><li>  Separate circuits for electric appliances, such as garbage trucks, refrigerators, stoves, dishwashers and trash compactors. </li><li>  Circuits for special tools such as microwaves. </li><li>  Box with too many wires. </li></ul><h2>  Marked switch </h2><div class="photo" data-original="makezine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="assemble the outlet" class="if uuid-3183289" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/105416/3183289.jpg"></div><p>  When power is supplied from a source other than a power outlet (such as a lighting fixture or smoke detector), the new cable and socket must be protected from arc shorting.  If there are no devices at the input where this type could be installed, then there is no other choice but to protect the entire circuit by installing a circuit breaker on the panel. </p><h2>  Two electrical boxes connected to each other. </h2><p>  This method will also answer the question of how to assemble three sockets. </p><p>  New electrical codes require protection against arc faults for all branch circuits supplying the socket, switches, lighting, smoke detectors, etc. That is, in all places in the home, except for bathrooms, storage rooms and garages.  Circuit breakers and sockets are designed to detect dangerous, abnormal sparking in branched circuits and turn off the power before a fire starts. </p><p>  When saturation occurs from an existing outlet for a new one, the electrical code requires protection for both wiring.  The easiest way to do this is to install the socket on the first device of the circuit.  The connector will provide output protection for most of the existing and new extended wiring.  This tip also allows you to answer the question of how to assemble a block of outlets. </p><h2>  Standard socket and with protection </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.homeyou.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="assemble the outlet block" class="if uuid-3183292" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/105416/3183292.jpg"></div><p>  Stable sockets are designed to prevent the ingress of a metal object.  Burglar resistant vessels are the safest device to date in all indoor and outdoor locations for residential units. </p><p>  By removing those ugly and often dangerous extension cords, you can quickly and easily add a new outlet without breaking the wall.  The main condition is that you must have at least one socket in the room.  No extra holes and dirty fixes, and repaints.  The procedure allows you to position the TV against a wall in which there was no outlet. </p><h2>  Work safe </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.popsci.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="outlet block" class="if uuid-3183300" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/105416/3183300.jpg"></div><p>  Before you begin any part of this project, you must turn off the power to the circuit on the main electrical panel by disconnecting the breaker or removing the fuse. </p><p>  Before touching bare wires or terminals on a switch or outlet, you must use a voltage tester on all cords. </p><p>  If the wiring is old, with fabric insulation, you must contact an electrician to recommend safe connections.  With this outlet, as a rule, there is no ground wire, and it is difficult to distinguish between hot and neutral, because both of them are covered with black insulation. </p>
