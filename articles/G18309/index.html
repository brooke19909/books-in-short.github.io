Salary, allowances and benefits for bailiffs</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Bailiffs belong to the category of <span>civil servants.</span>  It seems to many that their work does not require special efforts, so such people receive undeservedly high wages.  But this is not so.  The work of the bailiff is not easy, primarily from a psychological point of view.  In practice, it turns out that not every candidate with a specialized education is able to fulfill the duties of a bailiff.  We will find out how much bailiffs get and what is the complexity of their work. </p><h2>  Who can apply for a position? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.thoughtco.com" data-author=": Hero Images / Getty Images, "><img itemprop="image" alt="bailiff salary in 2018" class="if uuid-2976240" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18963/2976240.jpg"></div><p>  The applicant must meet certain requirements. </p><ol><li>  Be a citizen of the Russian Federation. </li><li>  Reach the age of 20 years. </li><li>  Have a diploma of higher economic or legal education. </li><li>  Have experience in the legal field. </li><li>  Know how to work with paperwork. </li><li>  To be stress-resistant, hardworking, principled and cheerful person. </li></ol><p>  In order for the applicant to receive the coveted position, he must undergo an internship (2 weeks) at the FSSP (Federal Service of Bailiffs) and collect the necessary documents.  Then the candidate participates in a competition that includes two stages: an intellectual test and a personal interview.  Only after successfully completing all stages is he enrolled in the FSSP staff.  He can become a performer (collect debts and fines), ensure order at court hearings or work with cases related to crimes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The bailiffs belong to the law enforcement bodies of the Russian Federation.  Such workers are required to wear branded clothing.  Having served a certain number of years and having official merits, the bailiff can be awarded ranks and honorary titles.  Before answering the question ‚ÄúHow much do bailiffs receive?‚Äù, You need to understand the specifics of their work. </p><h2>  What is the difficulty? </h2><p>  Bailiffs are endowed with numerous powers.  Every day they are engaged in the restoration of civil rights, interests and solving problems of social importance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wrightandleftreport.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what affects the salary of bailiffs" class="if uuid-2976248" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18963/2976248.jpg"></div><p>  To execute one trial, the bailiff needs to take many actions: </p><ul><li>  Send inquiries to the appropriate organizations to find out if the debtor has income and bank accounts. </li><li>  If necessary, draw up a decision to arrest the debtor's account and send it to a banking institution. </li><li>  Execute a document to recover funds from the offender. </li><li>  Check the property of the debtor and, if necessary, arrest it. </li><li>  Assess the seized property and begin the process of its implementation. </li><li>  Transfer money from the sold property to the debtor. </li><li>  Draw up documents to cancel existing arrests. </li><li>  Finish enforcement proceedings by submitting documents to the archive. </li></ul><p>  As you can see, debt collection is a rather laborious process that can take a long time.  The bailiff should be well versed in this area and be prepared to spend a lot of effort on one trial.  The salary of the bailiff takes into account the specifics of his work. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Their activities are complicated by many factors, including: </p><ul><li>  Inadequate financing of expenses. </li><li>  High workload (per employee may account for up to 5 thousand enforcement proceedings). </li><li>  Obstacles of a bureaucratic nature. </li><li>  Irregular working hours. </li><li>  Frequent negativity on the part of debtors. </li></ul><p>  The above paragraphs explain the complexity of the bailiff.  In this area, a large staff turnover is recorded.  People simply can‚Äôt cope with their duties, losing their job to other candidates.  But, despite the difficult work schedule of the bailiffs, their position remains prestigious and in demand. </p><h2>  Responsibilities </h2><p>  The bailiff is a civil servant.  He can be an executor or follow the order of conduct of cases at court hearings. </p><p>  The main responsibilities of the bailiffs are: </p><ul><li>  Ensuring the entry into force of court decisions. </li><li>  Consideration of applications for enforcement proceedings. </li><li>  Implementation of work with debtors. </li><li>  The study of legal literature and the continuous improvement of their skills. </li></ul><p>  It is these people who pronounce the phrase ‚ÄúGet up, the court is coming‚Äù before the trial. </p><p>  Civil servants carry out their activities on the basis of Federal Law No. 79-FZ (07.27.04). </p><h2>  Rights </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.rbth.com" data-author=": Alexandr Kryazhev / RIA Novosti, "><img itemprop="image" alt="bailiff work schedule" class="if uuid-2976233" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18963/2976233.jpg"></div><p>  The bailiffs are quite extensive.  They have the right to: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  Request the necessary information about debtors from their employers. </li><li>  Pass into the premises occupied by the debtor in order to inspect, evaluate his property and, if necessary, arrest him. </li><li>  Seek help from police officers, FSB. </li><li>  Check the income of debtors and, if necessary, seize their bank accounts. </li><li>  Carry a firearm. </li><li>  Use physical force when absolutely necessary. </li></ul><p>  The bailiff position is prestigious, but it requires professionalism and patience from its carrier.  In order for a civil servant to take advantage of the above rights, he must carry out his activities in accordance with the rules established by law, avoiding exceeding his own authority. </p><p>  Bailiffs are not entitled to: </p><ul><li>  Disturb debtors from 22:00 to 06:00. </li><li>  Show self-will. </li><li>  Do anything beyond court orders. </li><li>  Describe the property of the debtor that does not belong to him or without his presence. </li><li>  Take a living wage, the only available housing, various rewards for debt collection. </li></ul><h2>  Schedule </h2><p>  The bailiffs are not normal.  They host citizens on certain days and at a time allotted for this purpose.  The bailiff's work schedule after receiving clients cannot be called stable.  According to Russian laws, he established a five-day work week with two days off;  the amount of working time per week is 40 hours.  But in practice, bailiffs do not leave the workplace until they complete all the tasks entrusted to them by the management.  There are frequent cases when they have to stay at work ‚Äúovernight‚Äù. </p><h2>  What does salary consist of? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.ing.be" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much does the bailiff earn" class="if uuid-2976236" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18963/2976236.jpg"></div><p>  Before answering the question: ‚ÄúHow much do bailiffs earn?‚Äù, We indicate what their income includes. </p><ol><li>  Official salary. </li><li>  Surcharge for the occupied rank. </li><li>  Additional monthly payments. </li></ol><p>  The amount of cash on the first two points is fixed.  It is established at the legislative level.  Additional payments include: </p><ul><li>  Premiums for work experience (up to 30%). </li><li>  Various cash rewards. </li><li>  Extra charges for services with special conditions. </li><li>  Bonuses for the performance of complex work. </li><li>  Extra charges for work with information considered a state secret. </li></ul><p>  It is the additional payments that determine how much the bailiffs receive in total.  Without them, the monthly <span>income of civil servants</span> would be really low. </p><h2>  Privileges </h2><ol><li>  Compulsory insurance of life and health of the bailiff is made from the federal budget. </li><li>  In the event of harm to the life of a public servant, he is entitled to pay the insurance amount. </li><li>  They are entitled to an additional pension for length of service provided that they have been in the position of civil servant for more than 15 years.  This amount is set to the size of the main labor pension. </li><li>  The bailiffs are entitled to a free ticket for all modes of transport.  If they use a personal car for official purposes, then they will be given monetary compensation on the conditions provided by law. </li><li>  On a business trip, the bailiff has the right to purchase travel documents out of turn;  he also lives in hotels on a free basis, presenting a business trip certificate. </li></ol><p>  The benefits of bailiffs are determined by Russian federal laws. </p><h2>  Bailiff salary in Moscow </h2><div class="photo" data-original="en.kremlin.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How much does the bailiff get in Moscow" class="if uuid-2976232" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18963/2976232.jpg"></div><p>  In most Russian regions, it is about 18,000 rubles.  In large cities, this figure is higher.  How much does the bailiff get in Moscow?  In the Russian capital, the average value of this indicator is 29,800 rubles.  This is data for 2018. </p><h2>  Salary by Russian regions </h2><p>  Bailiffs who ensure the established procedure during court hearings have higher incomes than colleagues who work as executors.  So, how much do bailiffs receive in various regions of Russia? </p><ul><li>  Krasnoyarsk Territory - about 30,000 rubles. </li><li>  Kamchatka Territory - 27 500 rubles. </li><li>  In the Kursk region, the Komi Republic - 23,000 rubles. </li><li>  In the Kaliningrad and Sverdlovsk region - about 21,000 rubles. </li><li>  In Buryatia, Bryansk and the Leningrad region - 19 000 rubles. </li></ul><p>  The highest demand for the vacancy is ‚Äúbailiff‚Äù in Moscow, Leningrad region.  Next are the Krasnodar, Krasnoyarsk Territory, and after them - the Sverdlovsk Region. </p><h2>  Salary increase </h2><div class="photo" data-original="butlercountydd.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bailiff salary increase" class="if uuid-2976239" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18963/2976239.jpg"></div><p>  The salary of bailiffs in 2018 should be higher.  This was repeatedly said by representatives of the Ministry of Justice.  The draft law on stimulating employees of judicial enforcement services is being considered by the State Duma of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  The Ministry of Justice proposed to stimulate the bailiffs by establishing special allowances that take into account the special regime of their work.  The size of the allowance will vary from 50% to 150% of the official salary of the employee. </p><p>  Experts believe that the real income of bailiffs can increase by no more than 30%. </p><h2>  Ways to increase the salary </h2><p>  The increase in the salary of bailiffs is planned to be completed by early 2019.  This will be achieved by establishing special allowances depending on the working conditions of public servants.  The coefficients are planned to be distributed depending on the load attributable to a particular employee. </p><p>  Among the options for increasing salaries to bailiffs being considered by the Russian government, there may be a special procedure by which their income will increase by a percentage taken from the amounts recovered from debtors. </p><p>  Representatives of the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation note that increasing the salary of bailiffs will become an additional monetary burden for the budget.  About 9.5 billion Russian rubles may be needed to implement the plans. </p><p>  Nevertheless, the country's government is looking for suitable options to provide the bailiffs with decent working conditions.  Not so long ago, the government granted the FSSP the status of a law enforcement agency.  This method did not increase the salaries of the bailiffs, but provided them with the opportunity to take advantage of the benefits that are available to police, FSB, and prosecutors. </p><h2>  Salary of foreign colleagues </h2><div class="photo" data-original="soniamontejano.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bailiff position" class="if uuid-2976234" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18963/2976234.jpg"></div><p>  What affects the salary of bailiffs?  This is the average level of wages in Russia, and the number of completed cases.  But even wages with all bonuses and allowances do not stimulate FSSP employees who perform complex and responsible work.  Statistics show that the earnings of Russian bailiffs are several times lower than those of foreign colleagues. </p><ul><li>  Australia recorded the highest average monthly bailiff income of about $ 4,000. </li><li>  America is not much inferior to Australia.  Here FSSP employees can earn 3,500 usd in 30 days. </li><li>  In the UK and Germany, this figure is about $ 3,200. </li><li>  In France, the bailiff receives 2,800 usd. </li><li>  In Kazakhstan, FSSP employees are willing to pay 84,000 tenge. </li><li>  In Belarus, the bailiff earns 520 Belarusian rubles. </li><li>  In Ukraine, this figure is 6,100 hryvnia. </li></ul><p>  In the United States of America, judicial decisions are not implemented by bailiffs, but by sheriffs and their deputies, marshals and collectors. </p><p>  In many European countries, bailiffs work privately.  This applies to Belgium, France.  To do this, they receive a special license. </p><p>  Israeli bailiffs work with special services and magistrates' courts. </p>
