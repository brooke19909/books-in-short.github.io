It seems to you that you have already traveled all over our small globe?  Then a small surprise awaits you.  Moreover, it is literally hidden under your very nose - between Mauritius and Madagascar, and its name is Reunion Island.  If now you imagined a burning desert and semi-educated savages, then you were mistaken again!  The French island of Reunion in the Indian Ocean is a splinter that broke away from the French Republic with all its luxury, splendor and pomposity.  But at the same time he combines African exoticism and the charm of nature. </p>

    <h2>  How to get there? </h2><p>  Even the most diligent pupils who studied diligently at school will most likely find it difficult to show on the map where Reunion Island is located.  And all because he is not included in the school curriculum.  And an equally annoying situation has developed with most domestic tour operators.  This is due to the small popularity of the resort among Russians.  But Europeans have long chosen this place for themselves. </p><p>  So what if the tour package is not found, but the heart breaks?  Everything is simple!  Reunion Island, tours on which you will not find fire in the afternoon in the vastness of our homeland, is very popular in Europe.  The best way to get through Paris is where daily flights depart to Saint-Denis. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By the way, useful information for lovers of independent travel: Reunion is not the case.  But more about that below. </p><h2>  Where to relax </h2><p>  The most popular holiday destination is the capital of the island - Saint-Denis.  This is a traditional metropolis, luxurious and expensive.  Local attractions are mainly architectural ensembles and a botanical garden.  Here you will find a splendid Paris amid exotic African scenery. </p><p>  For a beach holiday, it is better to choose Saint-Gilles-les-Bains.  The snow-white sandy beach is somewhat spoiled by the abundance of tourists, but keep in mind that the guests here are mostly wealthy Europeans.  So, girls, for the suitors only here.  By the way, for lovers of exotic, there are beautiful beaches with black volcanic sand. </p>

    <p>  If you prefer thermal spas, pay attention to Silao.  And for history buffs, Saint-Paul is perfect.  The town will easily take you to the colonial past of the island: the architecture, atmosphere and landscapes here are so poetic that they will delight even the most sophisticated traveler. </p><h2>  Climatic features </h2><p>  The Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean - although the territory of France, but the climate here is much more pleasant.  A hot, dry tropical summer lasts from November to April.  During this period, the temperature is about 30 ¬∞ C during the day and almost the same (25 degrees) at night.  Humidity is quite high, which softens the heat well.  Winter from summer differs by only 10 degrees, but no more, and therefore also very comfortable for relaxation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Transport </h2><p>  If you plan to rent a car, keep in mind that the traffic here is right-hand. </p><p>  Reunion Roland Garros International Airport is 10 km from Saint-Denis and 51 km from Saint-Gilles.  On average, 2-3 flights per day are carried out from Paris in this direction.  In addition, there are a lot of connecting flights (with transfers) from other <span>European capitals</span> with different levels of comfort and cost.  The average duration of a flight from Paris is about 11 hours. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  When planning your vacation, do not forget to check with your mobile operator if it supports roaming services on the island, since this is really a rarity.  Otherwise, you will have to purchase a SIM card of a local operator, which is quite expensive.  Therefore, it is better to use an ordinary landline phone at the hotel. </p><p>  As for the Internet, there are no problems with this.  And therefore, Skype or Vider was and remains the optimal means of communication. </p><h2>  Visa </h2><p>  Considering that Reunion is an island belonging to the French Republic, the visa regime here is appropriate.  Therefore, for the document you should contact the French Embassy in your state.  A Schengen visa with a validity of at least 1 year is also suitable.  When processing documents, please note that there are several types of permissions: </p><ul><li>  Visa giving the right to stay exclusively on the island. </li><li>  A visa giving the right to stay in all Overseas possessions of the French Republic, as well as on the continental part of the country. </li></ul><p>  To apply for a flight permit, you will need the entire standard package of documents, including your travel program, scheduled daily.  It is compiled in English or French.  By the way, the amount of medical insurance should be at least 30 thousand euros.  And, of course, a consular fee of 1,500 rubles.  In addition, for the child to enter you will have to prepare a certificate from the school where he is studying. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Nevertheless, the island of Reunion, a vacation on which not all the inhabitants of our country can afford, is gaining more and more popularity. </p><h2>  Currency and other financial matters </h2><p>  Reunion as part of Europe, despite its geographical location, belongs to the eurozone.  You can carry out currency exchange operations without problems in any branch of the bank, but the rate here is very disadvantageous, and therefore it is better to stock up the euro at home.  In addition, in most stores you can pay by credit card of an international standard. </p><p>  Be prepared for the fact that the prices at Reunion are slightly higher than in mainland France.  On average, vacation on the island will cost you about 4000-4500 euros per person for 2 weeks of stay. </p><h2>  Shopping at Reunion </h2><p>  Shopping at Reunion is a pleasure.  Here you can enjoy the same shopping experience as on the mainland.  The working hours of the main shopping centers and shops are from 9.00 to 18.00, with a break from 12.00 to 15.00;  Saturday and Sunday are days off.  Every year, in early February, the Reunion opens a sales season lasting at least one and a half months. </p><p>  When going home, do not forget about souvenirs: wicker elements of decor, world famous French perfumes, jewelry. </p><h2>  Local kitchen </h2><p>  Reunion is a gourmet paradise!  The local cuisine is quite loyal to the delicate stomachs of Europeans, but so unusual that gastronomic ecstasy is guaranteed to you.  As always in the tropics, in the dishes there is an abundance of spices and spices, in particular, curry, ginger, garlic and cloves.  Like lemon juice, they all disinfect food in extremely hot and humid climates. </p>

    <p>  Another feature is the abundance of seafood, sometimes very unusual in appearance and taste, such as barracuda.  All this is generously poured with scolding - spicy sweet and sour aromatic tomato-based sauce.  Almost all dishes put pieces of exotic tropical fruits. </p><p>  From drinks you will be offered, albeit familiar, but unusually tasty juices and coffee.  But alcohol lovers are highly recommended rum punch, prepared according to ancient recipes of brave pirates. </p><h2>  Things to do in Reunion </h2><p>  Having traveled the whole world, having seen enough of all the wonders, you finally chose Reunion - an island of surfing, diving, trekking and just a beach holiday.  A place where developed European civilization harmoniously combines with antiquities and exotic Africa.  In addition, there are a number of historical sites that tell about the exciting past of Reunion. </p>

    <p>  The coast of Reunion Island is ideal for both passive and outdoor activities.  Velvet sand beckons you to lie down, and the hot tropical sun promises a stunning bronze tan.  By the way, the black <span>volcanic sand</span> on the beaches became a local wonder.  It looks amazing. </p>

    <p>  The island is surrounded on all sides by coral reefs, and therefore is ideal for lovers of underwater beauty: here you have a bottom topography (underwater gorges and caves), and unique living creatures.  Sharks are not particularly afraid, the much more real danger is strong undercurrents. </p><p>  Surf lovers should stay on the east coast of the island, where stunning waves reign. </p><p>  The main object of trekking is the picturesque volcanic valleys with lava fields.  Where else can you walk along the edge of the vent of an active volcano.  By the way, eruptions here are quite frequent, but at the same time completely safe.  If you want to look into the crater of a volcano, be prepared to climb 3 thousand meters along the flows of frozen lava.  But the view from the top will generously reward you for your efforts and perseverance. </p>

    <p>  Given the popularity of various festivals among tourists, tour operators even compiled a rating of the most festive destinations, where Reunion Island takes its place of honor.  Indeed, in addition to the traditional Christmas and New Year celebrations (according to all thoughts and inconceivable calendars), festivals of harvest, flowers, pineapple and others are held here.  And the local festival of Malabar takes place according to ancient Indian traditions and even includes a ritual of sacrifice. </p><h2>  Reunion island photos and attractions </h2><p>  Perhaps the best that is on the island is its nature.  The Botanical Garden and the Museum of Natural History, the Salazi mountain valley and the Bassin Komoran waterfalls, coral farm and sea turtle nursery - what else do you need for a full sightseeing vacation? </p>

    <p>  But do not forget that Reunion is an island of volcanic origin, and therefore its main highlight is, of course, volcanoes: Piton de Nezh and Piton de la Furnes.  By the way, it is here that you can watch the spectacular show of the volcanic eruption, being in complete safety. </p>

    <p>  Due to the difficulties with transport and the remoteness of most sightseeing objects from civilization, independent trips around the island are almost meaningless.  But helicopter tours are very popular.  The price of such a flight is about 200 euros per person, but much more emotions and impressions. </p><h2>  Helpful information </h2><ul><li>  The official language is French.  The local population often uses Creole (a dialect of French) in everyday life.  Excellent knowledge of English will absolutely not help you here, since it is practically not used. </li><li>  The vast majority of residents are Christians, Catholics. </li><li>  Customs requirements on the island are identical to European ones. </li><li>  In order to call an ambulance, you need to dial number 15, the police - 17. </li><li>  When planning your trip, avoid the period from December to February - this is the cyclone season.  If you still want to celebrate the New Year on the island, follow the weather forecast: try to stock up on food, water and a flashlight in an orange cyclone and it is better not to go outside.  And in a red cyclone, in no case should you leave the room and it is not recommended to use a mobile phone. </li><li>  Be sure to use quality mosquito repellents.  Reunion is a European island, but first of all it‚Äôs still the tropics with a bunch of outlandish and dangerous infectious diseases. </li><li>  Before travel, vaccination against hepatitis A, typhoid, malaria, tetanus and diphtheria is recommended.  Despite the fact that according to tour operators, malaria on the island is completely destroyed, doctors confirm that isolated cases among tourists are still regularly found. </li><li>  Although tap water is considered clean, it is not worth drinking. </li><li>  Enjoying the warm waters of the Indian Ocean, do not forget about the currents, the tides. </li><li>  Sharks on Reunion are rare, but periodically they are met by surfers, and divers, and even just swimmers.  Be careful. </li><li>  In winter, some traffic restrictions may apply on the island. </li></ul>
