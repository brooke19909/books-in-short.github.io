Is it possible?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Among the huge number of securities currently offered on the stock market, of course, Sberbank shares can be considered the most attractive and promising in terms of their profitability and increase in exchange rate growth.  Understanding this, many are wondering how to buy shares of Sberbank. </p><h2>  Why exactly is Sberbank? </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to buy shares of sberbank" class="if" height="302" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/385555.jpg" width="452"></div></h2><p>  Of course, future owners of the above securities are confident that they are making a competent investment of their hard-earned money, well aware that they will receive an effective tool for conducting trading operations. </p><p>  However, like another financial structure, Sberbank cannot give full confidence that the rate of issued securities will always be stably high, since there is a dependence on the state of affairs in the oil and gas sector.  Nevertheless, the Russians do not cease to be interested in <span>how to buy shares of</span> Sberbank.  And all because, given the attachment of the Russian economy to the "oil needle", this institution is showing optimistic indicators.  An example is the crisis situation that developed in 2008, when all securities collapsed, and only a year later, Sberbank shares began to rise in price, historical highs were recorded. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Of course, the above factors are an impulse to begin to become interested in how to buy shares of Sberbank.  However, one should not forget that transactions in the stock market are always a risk that should be justified under any circumstances. </p>

    <p>  So, let's move on to a practical consideration of the issue of how to buy shares of Sberbank. </p><h2>  Features of the transaction for the purchase of securities </h2><p>  Today, "Sberbank" shares are offered for sale in two forms: there are simple and preferred securities.  In this case, the first shares are sold at a higher price.  Their second advantage is that they give the <span>right to vote.</span> </p><h2>  Where can I get them? </h2><p>  Many are interested in the question of where to buy shares of Sberbank of Russia.  As one of the options you can offer the capital's stock exchange. </p><p>  If you are firmly determined to purchase Sberbank shares (where to buy them, you do not know about this), then you can advise over-the-counter markets.  Some prefer to deal directly with the issuer or private companies. </p><p>  And yet, the lion's share of traders and investors work precisely in the stock market, since it provides additional guarantees of protection against fraud and more favorable conditions than Sberbank offers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Those who want to buy shares of Sberbank and are going to do it all the time cannot recommend a better place than the stock exchange.  However, this does not mean at all that other options for platforms for investing your money in Sberbank securities should be ignored.  The advantages of the stock exchange are an attractive pricing policy and an optimal degree of risk. </p><p>  Again, if you just started doing the above business on an ongoing basis, then the question of how much you will acquire securities will not be of fundamental importance.  Why?  Yes, because you are just mastering the market, developing your own strategy and you must decide for yourself what amount for investments will not be burdensome for you. </p><p>  If you intend to get a solid profit from trading, then the question of how many securities you buy is of paramount importance.  It is one thing to buy about ten shares, and after a while they are more expensive to sell in order to "slightly" get rich.  Another thing is when you intend to earn serious investment profit from the sale of "Sberbank" securities.  Given inflation and other negative factors, income will be tangible in the case of the acquisition of a bulk package of securities. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Buying shares of Sberbank on the stock market is a daily task for investors who engage in trading operations with assets on a professional basis.  They manage to correctly combine trading and investment activities, as a result of which their income doubles.  However, this does not mean at all that beginners cannot achieve similar successes in the above field.  The main thing is to decide on a strategy for making a profit. </p><h2>  Brokerage service </h2><p>  Many Russians are interested not so much in the question of whether it is possible to buy shares of Sberbank in principle, but how to gain access to trading on the exchange. </p><p>  It should be noted that for this there is an institution of brokerage services.  <span>Who is a broker</span> and what does he do?  This is a legal entity that, on the basis of a license, provides certain types of services, the focus and scope of which, as a rule, are determined individually.  How to choose a reliable broker?  First of all, pay attention to how many clients he serves and how much money he works with. </p>

    <p>  Also analyze how long a legal entity has been working in the stock market and what is its level of technical support.  As a reliable broker, you can recommend RosEuroBank, Troika Dialog, or Finam. </p><h2>  How the purchase of shares is realized in practice </h2><p>  The procedure for acquiring Sberbank shares is quite simple.  First, you decide on the <span>choice of a broker,</span> then conclude a service agreement with him, then open a brokerage account.  After that, you can deposit money into it and carry out trading operations in the stock market. </p><h2>  Forecast for the future </h2><p>  Of course, the stock market "lives" according to certain laws that determine supply and demand, so you can still find out at least approximately the rate of an asset.  It is also necessary to understand that in order to determine whether securities are going to rise or fall in price, a number of factors should be investigated.  Experts do this on the basis of technical and fundamental types of analysis. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How can I buy shares of Sberbank" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/385674.jpg?1398854267188" width="448"></div>

    <h2>  The opinions of analysts are mixed </h2><p>  As for the forecasts regarding the securities of Sberbank, here the opinions of experts differ.  One part of analysts is convinced that the risks involved in trading with stocks are too great, and their price has already reached its maximum growth.  At the same time, the amount of overdue debts on loans increases along with the reserves created to reduce financial losses.  These factors, in their opinion, have a negative connotation in terms of the attractiveness of a credit institution. </p><p>  Another part of experts is inclined to believe that trading in Sberbank shares can bring quite substantial profits.  They are confident that those who chose a long-term investment for up to three years can count on this.  Experts emphasize that the market has underestimated the ‚ÄúSberbank‚Äù securities, since the stock price has not reached 170 rubles, which means that today it is a profitable investment. </p>

    <p>  One way or another, no one dares to give accurate forecasts as to how Sberbank securities will behave in the future. </p><h2>  How to purchase Sberbank shares from the issuer </h2><p>  Many are interested in the question of how to buy shares through Sberbank and is this possible?  Yes, of course, there is such a chance.  How can I buy Sberbank shares in the above way?  Everything is very simple.  You come to the department of the financial and credit structure and conclude a broker service agreement with him.  For almost fifteen years, this bank has been a full and legitimate participant in stock exchanges.  The contract for brokerage services provides for a clause according to which the client can at any time purchase or sell securities of the above financial structure.  Turn to professional brokers, and they will definitely advise you on how to make investment profitable. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  I would like to emphasize once again that trading <span>in securities of</span> Sberbank is a rather risky type of business. </p><p>  Of course, the above financial structure has a high degree of stability and reliability.  However, one should not forget that the level of return on his shares may also fluctuate. </p><p>  It is very important to learn how to properly monitor market dynamics and regularly analyze the state of the banking system in our country, which is changing very often.  In addition, Sberbank is always responding to the depreciation of the ruble and the inhibition of economic growth processes.  It is necessary to take into account the fact that the Central Bank systematically "cleans" the system by revoking licenses from unreliable credit institutions, which often do not comply with the law.  That is why, before making investments, carefully weigh the pros and cons. </p>
