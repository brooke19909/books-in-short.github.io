    <h2>  How to return a reputation? </h2><p>  If the company got into the lists of fines by accident, it can exclude itself from it on its own.  How to do it? </p><p>  The first step is to check the availability of the company on the list on the website of the Department of Economic Development.  It contains data on 6 thousand outlets that have not been registered.  Next, you need to write a letter asking to exclude the organization from the list of debtors.  The complaint can be satisfied if the notice of registration was sent with a delay or the company does not trade at a particular object. </p><p>  An enterprise has 20 days to appeal against being listed.  Otherwise, data on the taxpayer will be transferred to the Federal Tax Service.  The inspectorate will calculate the amount of the fee and set a claim for its payment.  You can challenge this act within 180 days.  To do this, you must write a complaint to the Department, but already on the model presented on the website of the state institution.  The application should also be accompanied by supporting documents (a copy of the notice, lease agreement, cadastral extract with information about the outlet). </p><p>  Documents can be sent by email or mail.  The Department takes 30 days to make a decision (in some cases, 60 days).  If a decision is made in favor of the company, it will be removed from the list and the act will be updated.  Immediately after this, the FTS will cancel the charge. </p>
