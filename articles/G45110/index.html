There are wide sandy beaches and a fairly deep sea.  One of the regions of this resort village is Peresyp Spit.  Recreation centers of Kirillovka and boarding houses stretch along the coast of this sandy strip from the center of the village to the ravine.  From there, another Azov resort begins - Stepanovka Pervaya.  At the very edge of the spit, not far from the ravine, there is a base of the same name - “Peresyp”.  How to relax there and what conditions tourists offer - read the article below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Recreation facilities" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2183419.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What is the spit Peresyp resort of Kirillovka </h2><p>  A long strip of beaches stretches to the north-east of the village.  On one side is the Milk Estuary, and on the other, the Sea of ​​Azov.  Unlike the neighboring Fedotova spit, there are not so many entertainments, restaurants and night clubs in Peresyp.  Only at the very beginning of the beach, almost near the center of the village of Kirillovka, is the amusement park.  There are also the only nightclubs on the spit - Rio and Galaxy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Tourists come here for a relaxing holiday on the beach.  They ride on minibuses either to the center of the village, or to the neighboring Fedotova spit.  There they will find a water park (one of the largest in Ukraine), a dolphinarium, and much more. </p><p>  Among the other resorts of Kirillovka, the Peresyp spit began to be built up.  Recreation facilities here were mostly departmental; earlier, many children's camps worked on the spit.  Be prepared for the fact that most of the housing offers here still have a certain post-Soviet spirit with the appropriate service.  However, at the same time, new private hotels function on the spit, many of which are on the first line from the sea.  Some are located by the estuary, across the road from the beach, but even then go to the treasured sea no more than 150 meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Recreation center spill Kirillovka" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2183417.jpg"></div>
