Is it possible to pay in rubles?  What is the currency in Goa in circulation?  The answers to most questions can be found in the article. </p><h2>  Local currency in Goa </h2><p>  Goa is one of the southern states of the Republic of India.  Therefore, the currency in Goa is the <span>Indian rupee.</span>  In accordance with the international standard, it has an INR code. </p><p>  As of February 2019, banknotes of the following denominations are in circulation: 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 2,000 rupees. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="A denomination of 2,000 rupees" class="if uuid-3168016" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102889/3168016.jpg"></div><p>  The Reserve Bank of India periodically updates the appearance of banknotes.  Therefore, before the trip, we recommend clarifying how local banknotes look at the time of travel. </p><h2>  Exchange of Russian money </h2><p>  Goa currency exchange rate against the ruble as of February 4, 2019 by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation is fixed at 1: 1.08.  That is, for 1 domestic ruble, theoretically, you can get 1.08 Indian rupees.  The actual purchase rate of the Russian currency will be lower.  The last few years, domestic tourists simplify the calculations and reduce to a ratio of 1: 1. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="500 rupee banknote" class="if uuid-3168033" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102889/3168033.jpg"></div><p>  Paying our currency, for example, for a hotel does not work.  But to exchange it or purchase jewelry is quite. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Dollars in india </h2><p>  The situation is completely different with the American dollar, which is gladly accepted throughout India and in Goa.  The US currency is very popular and in demand.  On February 4, 2019, the dollar to rupee rate was fixed at 1: 71.12, that is, for 1 USD you can get 71.12 INR. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thehindu.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dollars in goa" class="if uuid-3168080" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102889/3168080.jpg"></div><p>  The rise or fall of the dollar has a significant impact on the Indian rupee.  In the summer of 2018, for $ 100, you could get 6,400 - 6,500 rupees. </p><h2>  Euro to Goa </h2><p>  The situation is similar with the euro.  This currency in Goa and India is also quite popular, although somewhat less than the dollar. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="india goa currency" class="if uuid-3168188" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102889/3168188.jpg"></div><p>  On February 4, 2019, the rate was established at 81.97.  That is, for 1 EUR you can get 81.97 INR.  The currency of the European Union is recommended to exchange.  Calculating her is a little more difficult. </p><h2>  What currency to take to India and Goa? </h2><p>  Most profitable are classic American dollars.  There are several reasons for this: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul data-id="ef044524c5eff"><li>  The dollar is growing in relation to both the Russian ruble and the Indian rupee. </li><li>  Everyone accepts the currency everywhere: taxi drivers, shopkeepers, exchange offices, jewelry stores, hotels, sheki and restaurants, guides.  Have banknotes of several denominations.  Bring along new bills, in good condition and the latest series of issues. </li><li>  You can take the euro.  Although they are unlikely to be accepted at the same hotel, exchanging for local currency is also not difficult. </li><li>  If you traveled to neighboring countries before traveling to India, they will also accept the currency of these countries at exchange offices.  For example, Nepalese, Indonesian or Thai. </li></ul><h2>  How much money to take with you? </h2><p>  Goa currency for tourists is the quality of their vacation.  Decide what you want to buy, where to go and what to try.  India is a country for people of any income.  If you intend to eat in coastal cafes, the average check for lunch or dinner will be from 200 to 700 rupees (from 180 to 650 rubles), depending on your appetites and the dishes you order.  On the shore, prices are slightly higher than in the settlements themselves. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.newindianexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="200 rupees for 2019" class="if uuid-3170064" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102889/3170064.jpg"></div><p>  Guides and guides are ready to offer you trips around the state with sightseeing from 50 to 150 dollars.  As payment they accept both American currency and local. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  What prices can you meet: </p><ul data-id="dc268c9ccd8b"><li>  masala tea - from 10 rupees (9 rubles) in a chayvala to 60 rupees (55 rubles) in a shekel; </li><li>  tomatoes - 20 rupees (18 rubles) per kg; </li><li>  pineapples - from 30 to 70 rupees (28-65 rubles) per piece; </li><li>  bananas - 60 rupees (55 rubles) for 12 pieces; </li><li>  chicken - 90-100 rupees (83-92 rubles) per kg; </li><li>  pasta - 80-120 rupees (73-111 rubles) per kg; </li><li>  rice - 90-160 rupees (83-148 rubles) per kg; </li><li>  milk - 40 rupees (37 rubles). </li></ul><p>  As you can see, the prices are quite low, the rest are kept at a level slightly cheaper than Russian ones. </p><h2>  Exchange points </h2><p>  The state lives in the tourism business, so you will not have problems with currency exchange.  Another question is to get a profitable course.  Therefore, the first advice is to bargain.  Even with currency exchange in Goa.  The exception is banks and official points of purchase and sale. </p><p>  A feature of the process is the fact that the rate may depend on the face value of banknotes and their condition.  New, crispy hundred-dollar bills will be exchanged at the maximum rate.  If the banknotes were already in circulation or the face value is less, the rate will be offered lower. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bfsi.eletsonline.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="goa currency rate to ruble" class="if uuid-3170078" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102889/3170078.jpg"></div><p>  First of all, tourists try to change the currency at the airport.  Forget and hide the wallet deeper.  This is the place where you will be offered the lowest rate.  Do not panic at the thought of having to pay the taxi driver.  In India, you can pay after you reach your destination.  You can change the currency on the way or at the hotel. </p><p>  The most profitable course will be offered to you in jewelry stores.  Indians love to communicate, so 10-20 minutes of careless conversations will give a chance to win several hundred rupees when exchanging from $ 100. </p><p>  You can also clarify the course at travel agencies.  Ask at the front desk of the administrator or driver, and you will be happy to be taken to the nearest office, in the hope that you place an order for excursions or tours throughout India. </p><p>  When exchanging, specify the availability of commission for the operation.  Do not pay attention to the inscription about the absence of it.  During the exchange process, they may explain to you that the commission is not taken only in some cases, for example, when exchanging rupees for dollars. </p><h2>  Use of bank cards </h2><p>  In Goa, you can use a plastic card to get Goa currency at ATMs.  However, there are certain nuances: </p><ul data-id="041b746e7348e"><li>  settlements in the state are small, so sometimes you need to look for an ATM; </li><li>  periodically, the connection with the bank disappears or bills end; </li><li>  in stores they do not accept cards everywhere. </li></ul><p>  Do not be surprised at the presence of an armed security guard near the ATM.  For India, this is normal.  But you can turn to them for help if you can not figure out the menu interface. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.magzter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what currency to goa india" class="if uuid-3170138" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102889/3170138.jpg"></div><p>  Indian ATMs are distinguished by the main design feature - the device does not capture the card.  Even with the right choice of menu items, the transaction will be canceled.  The reason is the presence of a card in an ATM.  To withdraw money, perform the following sequence: insert a card, wait 3-5 seconds, remove it, select a withdrawal point, indicate the amount and enter the pin code at the final stage. </p><p>  You can also contact travel agents for cash.  Almost all have such a service as cash advance: money is deducted from your card and cash is issued.  However, be vigilant and accurate, contact only trusted companies.  Get recommendations from compatriots, of whom there are a lot in Goa. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="10 rupees of a new sample" class="if uuid-3170142" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102889/3170142.jpg"></div><p>  With a minimum commission, you can withdraw money from ATMs of the State Bank of India (SBI) and Bank of India (BOI).  Upon receipt of cash in their ATM, a commission may be charged by the bank that issued the card in Russia.  In devices of other credit organizations in India, the minimum commission is 200-300 rupees. </p><h2>  Tips from seasoned </h2><p>  Three years ago, India had an unprecedented precedent: one fine morning, millions of people who prefer to keep savings at home in cash suffered huge losses.  On the evening of the previous day, the government announced the withdrawal from circulation of banknotes of 500 and 1,000 INR.  The exchange could be made within a few weeks and with a limit on the amount.  In order not to be once in the queue for an exchange among Indians: do not exchange all cash and do not empty the card.  Take off as needed. </p><p>  In addition, follow these tips: </p><ul data-id="bda920cb29684"><li>  If you plan to bring plastic cards with you, use cards issued by different banks.  Store them in different places for greater security.  In case of loss of a card, try to transfer funds as quickly as possible from one to another, only then block the card by calling the bank operator. </li><li>  The presence of several cards will also allow you to bypass the daily limit for removing the cache.  Many ATMs have a limit of 10,000 rupees.  This can come in handy if you are planning a major purchase or spending. </li><li>  After exchanging, inspect the bills received.  Do not take shabby, sealed, inscribed notes or pen or pencil.  In other places you may refuse to take them.  Or bargain, agreeing to accept such bills, you can get a very good rate. </li><li>  Exchange a few hundred-dollar bills.  Banknotes of small denomination can be settled with sellers until you sort out the situation. </li></ul><p>  And communicate with compatriots.  If you have difficulties with the exchange or cash withdrawal, you can contact them.  It is rare that someone refuses to accept several thousand rubles on a Sberbank card in exchange for rupees. </p>
