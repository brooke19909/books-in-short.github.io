It is located on the Sikhote-Alin ridges, densely covered with oak and coniferous forests.  The area of ​​the park is more than 36 km <sup>2</sup> .  If you study this place from afar, it seems that stone castles are scattered among the strangely growing pines, and it is extremely clear that dragons and other mystical creatures "live" here ... </p>

    <h2>  You just need to take a closer look </h2><p>  Stunning in its beauty, unusual rock structures are located wherever the eye sees: on the slopes, in glens, in the valleys of small streams and springs.  They rise on massive boulders and even lie with a necklace on the tops of hills.  Some look very monumental, others are real bas-reliefs. </p><p>  For example, the composition “Three Serpent Heads” is interesting.  She “shows” the crocodile’s battle with the three-headed snake.  Surprising is the Dragon King.  On his eight-meter head is a crown (four meters high), which barely touches the rocky ledge, that is, it practically levitates. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the description of the Dragon Park (Primorsky Territory) there are often references to “dragon eggs” scattered throughout the territory.  Their sizes are appropriate: from three to six meters high.  On some, you can see the images of people. </p><h2>  Unique "antiquities" and not only </h2><p>  Inside the Dragon Park (Primorsky Territory), according to eyewitnesses, there are sculptures of people and living creatures, not ours, of unearthly origin.  Many guests claim that they saw granite slabs with runes applied to them.  Moreover, the lines are clearly cut, as if by a tool. </p>

    <p>  Experts believe that images of figures and faces of people, shapes resembling huge eggs or prehistoric animals, appeared in these places thanks to the winds.  Not without, of course, the sun and rains. </p><p>  There are many saids here - soaring stones.  That's certainly a miracle of nature.  There are formations similar to the Krasnoyarsk pillars.  If you climb them, a stunning imagination opens up - an endless taiga ... </p><p>  But activists of various tourist movements support the legend of the man-madeness of these rock formations.  And they are sure to add stories to them about the influence of residents of other dimensions, Martians, Hyperboreans, and even the clear influence of Atlantis. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Among the famous sculptures in this area, one can distinguish “Dragon Egg”, “Vase”, “Big Dragon” (800 m long), “Atomic Mushroom” and others. </p><h2>  "Teeth of the Dragon" </h2><p>  The most famous peak of the central part of Sikhote-Alin is Mount Sestra (1971 m).  The closest part of the Partizansky ridge was the popular name “Dragon's Teeth”.  In fact, these are ancient and constantly destroying outlier cliffs located on a small section of cliff no more than five kilometers long.  Each “tooth” is a little less than 20 meters high.  The sight is very picturesque. </p><p>  Both Sister Mountain and Dragon's Teeth are located on the territory of the Call of the Tiger National Nature Park.  You can visit it only with special permission. </p>

    <h2>  The Big Dragon </h2><p>  This figure in the Dragon Park of Primorsky Territory (see photo above) is really colossal.  It takes at least an hour to get from the head to the tail.  Moreover, the head lies in the south, and the tail in the north. </p><p>  The beast’s view is frightening: the large-headed beast-dog with two humps and a spiky tail stretched out at the top of the hills.  Attentive tourists on thorns distinguish the outlines of human faces, and on the tail itself - reptiles, an elephant with an elephant and even birds.  At a certain distance from the sculpture, you can see another person’s face: the impression is that he simply leaned against the head of the animal.  At a certain time of day, with a special fall in the sun's rays, a warrior with a spear and a shield becomes clearly visible.  He is in a long robe, hat and something incomprehensible in his hands. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The dragon's mouth is distinguished by a marble-like breed of white shade.  And on the right side of the head there is a place, as if specially exposed: the skin is removed and the cranial structure and even the eyeball mount are visible.  On the other hand, the eye is also “perfectly made”: pupils looking seriously, eyelids and even eyelashes. </p><p>  The dimensions of the stone beast-catcher are impressive: with a length of more than 800 meters, the humps are 20-25 meters high, and the tail (this is a solid granite block) with 16 spikes reaches a height of up to 8 meters.  In some of them, bowl-bowls of 50 * 100 cm were formed, up to 40 cm deep. Convenient notches lead to them: the leg becomes good. </p><p>  A “completed" figure is made of partially quartz granite rock.  One of the two large dorsal humps is covered with a vitreous mass, as, in fact, is the tail. </p>

    <h2>  "The dead child" </h2><p>  Very interesting sculptural composition.  You can find it in the Park of Dragons (Primorsky Territory) on the central spur of <span>the mountain range of</span> Przhevalsky.  The length of the figure is more than eight meters, the height is more than three.  In the upper part, the composition reaches a width of five meters.  Its relief is similar to sea waves.  Among them are many human heads and faces, moreover, easily recognizable.  Most of them express sorrow, their eyes are closed.  Two huge faces are depicted with their mouths wide open, the impression is that a man screams from grief. </p><p>  The bottom is oval, and there are no traces of erosion and weathering. </p><p>  From above, the sculpture looks like a dead, recently born child.  His chest cavity is opened. </p>

    <h2>  "Small dragon" </h2><p>  Excursions in the Dragon Park (Primorsky Territory) often rise to this composition.  It is located on a hillside, directly above the resort "Chistovodnoe".  The dragon is only five meters high, but is mounted on a pedestal, which has approximately the same height and a perfectly flat surface.  The animal is standing straight, looking south.  The upper legs and tail are pronounced.  On the head, very similar to the head of a lizard, eyes, nose and mouth are clearly visible.  The neck is oval and smoothly crafted, just like the chin and small hump in the upper back.  The right paw, brought to the head, forms a cup. </p><p>  The tail, almost two meters long, is bent up.  Together with stylized paws, a dragon rests on it.  The whole figure at the back is reinforced with buttresses and other thickenings.  Notches were made along the body and tail to make it easier to get to the bowl. </p><p>  A "made" figure of crystalline granules.  The largest of them has a width of 5 mm. </p>

    <h2>  "Stone bowl" </h2><p>  It is also known as the "Mushroom" or "Atomic Explosion."  In reviews of the Dragon Park (Primorsky Territory), it is described as a complex structure. </p><p>  There is a bowl on the throne, as it were.  He is a meter with a small one.  The throne is real: the back, depressions for the legs and sloping armrests.  Near them are bowls with a depth of a meter and a width of just over half a meter.  A semicircular boulder with one flat side surrounds the entire monument.  Five-beam stars are clearly visible on it, and behind them is a pattern that very much resembles a mushroom arising from a nuclear explosion. </p><h2>  "Screaming people" </h2><p>  An interesting sculptural composition on the northwestern slope of Warrior with the Dragon.  People are "made" in the form of tower-shaped blocks.  In their upper part, mouths are clearly visible frozen in a scream, covered eyes and raised eyebrows in desperation.  Creepy slightly ... </p><h2>  Denial of physics </h2><p>  Dragon Park in the Primorsky Territory (how to get, read below) has a lot of “soaring” stones in its collection.  They stand, so to speak, on the inclined surface of rocky ridges.  And for the most part, the bases hang in the air.  “Standing” like this, and even hundreds of years, according to our earthly laws, is simply impossible.  And they do it .... </p>

    <h2>  Did nature try this? </h2><p>  Going down from the "Big Dragon" in the Dragon Park (Primorsky Territory), you find yourself in an even more amazing world - the world of huge stones of a very regular shape.  Neither wind nor rain can cut the rock like that, and even make cuts in some of them depicting runes ... </p><p>  Walls are made of immense "building bricks" weighing a hundred tons.  By the way, they are very reminiscent of Baalbek.  Here you can also see petrified cyclopean structures and many towers laid out from blocks processed by an unknown builder.  Separate towers are installed on foundations, which are perfectly fitted granite blocks. </p><p>  Seaside researcher S.V. Kobelev claims that nature has no relation to these blocks.  He believes (and even puts out a lot of evidence for his assumptions) that the entire sculptural complex was created by masters of protocivilization.  Among the evidence is the heterogeneity of materials, hollowed out steps, and so on. </p><p>  On some sculptural compositions you can see relief, aeolian-like forms of weathering.  But the same signs are repeated from time to time on them, which, of course, is also quite difficult to attribute to natural origin.  Maybe this is a high relief writing? </p><h2>  Dragon Park (Primorsky Territory): how to get, description of the route </h2><p>  The easiest way, of course, is to go to this unique place by car.  From Vladivostok to the park 330 km.  You need to move to Partizansk, then Lazo.  From him we are heading for the Transfiguration.  But there is a pointer to the village of Chistovodnoye 30 kilometers before it.  We turn off and then make our way along the primer for at least 20 km. </p><p>  By the way, it should be noted that there is no gas station in the village.  The nearest ones are in Transfiguration (50 km) and Lazo (85 km). </p><p>  How to get to the Dragon Park in Primorsky Krai by public transport?  It’s also easy.  Intercity bus number 510 runs to the village of Chistovodnoye.  He leaves four days a week (except weekends and Fridays) at ten in the morning.  It takes about six hours to turn to the village.  Further, either on foot or slow down along the way. </p><p>  The park itself can only be reached on foot.  The path is full of signs, it is impossible to get lost.  Everything about everything takes about an hour. </p><p>  You can stay for the night only in the local balneotherapy center.  But since this is not a hotel, but a dispensary, they often refuse.  Therefore, one thing remains - the tent. </p><h2>  Tips before visiting </h2><p>  Dragon Park in the Primorsky Territory in a couple of hours you can not get around.  Therefore, it is better to plan a trip with an overnight stay. </p><p>  The first thing that former guests of these places pay attention to is shoes.  It should not slip (that is, no slippers, shoes and sneakers) and firmly fix the ankle.  The nearest emergency room is in Transfiguration, fifty kilometers away (and you also need to lower the victim somehow from the mountain!). </p><p>  The second one.  It is highly advisable to have a personal first-aid kit equipped to the maximum.  It must have a <span>bactericidal patch, an</span> elastic and simple bandage. </p><p>  The third.  In a backpack (and not a bag or bag) you need to put a bottle of clean water (suddenly you have to wash the wound).  Thermos with tea (it is better not to drink to the highest point) and sandwiches.  It is advisable to make them with solid (non-melting and rapidly disappearing) products.  Let it be boiled meat, cheeses and hard sausages.  You can add vegetables to them (naturally, it’s better not to take soft ones, for example, tomatoes) and fruits.  Sweets and chocolates will be superfluous: they cause thirst.
