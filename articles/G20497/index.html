Novostar Palmyra 3 * (Tunisia, Sousse): hotel description, photos, prices</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the popular tourist destinations for holidays at sea abroad is Tunisia.  Novostar Palmira, a beach treshka on the outskirts of Sousse, is a good example of a hotel that, despite its low star rating, has a great rating among travelers.  This name was given to the hotel not so long ago, since it joined the network of the same name.  Previously, it could be found under the name "Palmyra Beach Club."  The hotel stands directly on the sea and provides guests with good quality services.  This is one of the hotels Tunisia can be proud of.  ‚ÄúNovostar Palmyra‚Äù, reviews of which we will consider here, was built in 1985, but in 2013 it underwent a complete <span>overhaul</span> and was updated one hundred percent. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tunisia novostar palmyra" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/661946.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  Sousse is one of the busiest tourist cities in the amazing country of Tunisia.  "Novostar Palmyra" is located in one of its suburbs called Shot Meriyem.  The port of El Kantaoui is five kilometers from here, and the <span>airports of Monastir</span> and Enfida are approximately the same distance - 35 km.  Medina Sousse is twelve kilometers from the hotel.  The Hawaii Entertainment Center and the shopping mall, where you can also buy souvenirs at an inexpensive price, are 4 km away.  The fact that the hotel is located near airports makes the transfer pleasant and short-lived.  Even children do not have time to rocking. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Sousse, resort areas.  Shot Meriem </h2><p>  Probably not a single country on a beach holiday attracts tourists with its flavor and originality like Tunisia.  Sousse (‚ÄúNovostar Palmira‚Äù, which we describe refers specifically to it) is the music of Sufis and hammams, an incomparable sea and fish cafes on the waterfront.  It is also one of the best places in the country for youth recreation and children's health.  The main resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSousse is Port El Kantaoui, which is located north of the center.  This is a very large suburb.  It begins eight kilometers from the Medina and ends at twelve.  The resort, in turn, is also divided into districts.  The farthest is Shot Meriem, where our hotel is located.  There are no historical attractions, but a lot of entertainment, shopping and opportunities to walk. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tunisia Sousse Newstar Palmyra" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/661962.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Hotel Novostar Palmira (Tunisia) is a four-story building built in a beautiful green garden.  Of course, the hotel cannot boast tens of kilometers of the park.  But still, the hotel area is very compact, pleasant in appearance, and fully thought out for the convenience of tourists.  Everything is designed in the same style and well-maintained.  There is neither dirt nor debris, as happens, for example, in the "treshki" of Hammamet.  There is a large outdoor pool.  Not far from it there is a sports area with tennis courts, fields for playing football and even archery.  The hotel's beach is one of the best on the whole coast of Sousse.  There are several shops at the hotel where you can buy various souvenirs and beach accessories. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tunisia newsstar palmyra reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/661964.jpg"></div>

Twice a day, extra baked goods are served in the lobby.  The cuisine is based on local dishes, but also practices European food.  The hotel serves all kinds of meat, including pork, which is rare for a Muslim country.  During one meal, at least three types of fruits and five fresh vegetables are provided.  There is always fish.  On Fridays, evenings of national cuisine are organized, where seafood is also prepared - shrimp, squid, octopus, mussels.  Four types of ice cream are provided for lunch and dinner.

This is a very safe place for kids who are interested and fun there.  Children's animators are simply in love with the kids, and they usually reciprocate.  The hotel also has a maxi club for your older offspring.  Since the hotel has traditionally been home to many of our compatriots, there is a Russian administration and a team of animators.  The staff is well trained, all complaints are taken into account and problems are resolved. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Novostar palmyra tunisia prices" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/662015.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Sea treatment </h2><p>  Hotel "Novostar Palmira" (Tunisia), the photo of which you see in this article, has one of the best beaches on this coast.  It is literally fifty meters from the building.  The beach is not only equipped with umbrellas and sunbeds, which stand on the whitest, fine sand, like powder, but also smoothly turns into a lawn for sunbathing with soft green grass.  If you want to settle there, then you will be covered by a shadow from high spreading palm trees.  The entrance to the sea is very gentle - perfect for kids.  Places, sunbeds and shadows are enough for everyone.  The beach itself is simply huge.  Palmira Novostar is the only beachfront hotel in the entire county.  There is a water sports center on the beach.  In addition, here you can ride a kayak, a catamaran and windsurf for free.  Paid - parachute flying and swimming on a "banana".  Tourists call the hotel beach fabulous and say that relaxation here really heals.  Just wallowing on this white sand, you enter a state of trance and complete relaxation.  There is also a pool, which is carefully cleaned, with a children's compartment.  You can spend time there if there are waves on the sea or jellyfish and algae sail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Newstar palmyra tunisia photo" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/662032.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Prices </h2><p>  Now consider the question of how much it costs to relax at the Novostar Palmira Hotel (Tunisia).  Ticket prices start at eighty-eight to ninety thousand rubles for two for seven days.  Since the hotel is suburban, it provides you with all the services so that you do not spend more.  But if you want to travel around, then tourists give approximate prices.  For example, to get a taxi to the Medina, you will need to pay from ten to fourteen dinars, while a trip to El Kantaoui will cost only five to seven.  But if you want to ride a budget, feel free to sit on the piles.  These minibuses go quickly and often.  To get to Port El Kantaoui, you will pay one dinar, and two to the center of Sousse. </p><h2>  Tunisia, "Novostar Palmira": holiday reviews </h2><p>  Hotel tourists call a great option for a vacation at sea.  Good and plentiful food, especially <span>fish, ice cream,</span> sweets.  The cocktails are great and the disco is mind-blowing.  The hotel staff is wonderful, people work with soul.
