They are good enough for relaxation and, despite their "stardom", meet all European standards.  The rating of Corfu hotels among tourists shows us that far from always the first places are occupied by the ‚Äúfives‚Äù and ‚Äúfours‚Äù.  For example, according to reviews of vacationers from Russia, the highest rating is given to the Bella Vista and Belvedere hotels, although they have only two and three stars, respectively.  The fourth place is occupied by the Quartet Corfu Handris, and then the famous Fives Grekotel and Marbella come.  Nevertheless, Russian-speaking vacationers most of all in the last two hotels.  Prices at Corfu hotels are usually very high during the summer season.  But they are not chosen for the <span>quality of services</span> or food, but for their proximity to the beaches.  Therefore, Sea Bird Hotel, to which this article is devoted, is considered very good precisely because it is not far from the beach and does not have to go high uphill. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sea bird hotel 3 corfu" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/664992.jpg" width="474"></div>

    <h2>  Corfu All Inclusive Hotels </h2><p>  Of course, many tourists who go in search of the most comfortable holiday are attracted by Greece (Corfu).  ‚ÄúAll inclusive‚Äù is the system by which many hotels of the island begin to operate, from the three-star Almiros Natura to the luxurious Marbella.  In such hotels, they not only feed three times a day, including drinks, but also give packed lunches during excursions, and also organize themed dinners at least once a week.  But this <span>type of vacation is</span> convenient mainly for those who prefer only the sea, sun, shopping and trips accompanied by a guide.  Traditional travelers, especially those who rent cars in order to travel around all the nooks, bays and beaches, prefer "half board".  This is more convenient, does not bind you to the hotel, and also allows you to manage the time at your discretion. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sea bird 3 corfu" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/665006.jpg" width="474"></div>
