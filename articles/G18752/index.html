Yes, in the evenings there are different parties and shows, but when night comes, silence sets in.  So nothing can stop a peaceful rest and sleep. </p><p>  The staff is polite and courteous.  Some people even say that upon arrival they were provided with other, better rooms.  And without surcharge.  The cleaning is also good, the bubbles with shampoos, gels and other hygiene items are regularly replenished, like everything you need to make drinks. </p><p>  If we make a general conclusion, we can confidently say: people who dream of a relaxing holiday near the sea in comfortable, comfortable apartments should go here.  This hotel is perfect for these purposes, like the island of Corfu. </p>
