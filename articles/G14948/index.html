    <h2>  Lahdenpohja - brief information about the city </h2><p>  The city is the administrative center of the homonymous (Lahdenpohsky) district - the most southwestern in Karelia.  Located on the shore of the Yakimvar Bay of Lake Ladoga on the Aura-Yoki River, which is 300 km from Petrozavodsk.

Until 1924, the city was called Si eklahti, that is, "Sieve Bay". </p><p>  According to 2010 data, about 8,000 people live in Lahdenpohja.  Its area is only 9 square kilometers. </p>

    <h2>  Historical data </h2><p>  First you should get acquainted with the city of Lahdenpohja - the sights will wait a bit.  Its foundation dates back to the 16th century, when the settlement of Yakkim was settled here.  In those days, the northwestern Ladoga region was part of the Bogoroditsky Kiryazhsky graveyard of the Karelian district of Pyatina Novgorod Novgorod. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Then, in the year 24 of the last century, the village of Lahdenpohja appeared at this place.  He received the title of city only during the USSR, in 1945.  Simultaneously with this event, the formation of the Lahdenpohsky region took place. </p><p>  Going deeper into the history of Lahdenpohja, some points can be emphasized.  In 1323, Karelia was divided into two parts.  This is the first border between the Swedish state and the Russian Empire, which could have official status.  But already in the XV century, the territory became fully owned by Russia.  True, not for long: a century later, when the Russo-Swedish war broke out, Karelia retreated to the Swedes, the victorious side.  A little later, the Russian army liberated the territory.  This happened in 1721. </p><p>  In 1918, Karelia was again taken away - this time the Finns.  The republic returned to <span>the USSR</span> only after 1940, when the <span>Russo-Finnish war ended.</span>  Here is such an interesting story.  AND <strong> </strong>  Lahdenpohja attractions are also attractive.  Although there are very few of them. </p>

    <h2>  What is better to know in advance </h2><p>  When walking around the city, it is better to always carry a passport with you.  Since the territory used to be a border zone, one can still see vigilant military here, although the regime has long been gone.  Nevertheless, in order not to lose time and not spoil the impression, it is recommended to keep your passport with you. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Lahdenpohja Attractions </h2><p>  On the territory of this tiny ‚Äústate‚Äù, in which there is still a touch of Finnish flavor, inaccurately mixed with the Soviet ‚Äúdesign‚Äù, there are only a few attractions.  But these places are worth a visit.  Therefore, if ever the occasion arises to visit Lahdenpohja, where to go and what to see will already be known. </p><ol><li>  Starting directly about the sights of Lahdenpohja, it is worth mentioning first of all the ruins of the Lutheran church.  This once interesting building was built in 1850.  The famous Finnish architect of German origin, Karl Engel, was engaged in the design, who completely completed the layout of Helsinki and created many beautiful objects.  Classicism is traced in his works, and the Lutheran church is no exception.  The ruins remained after the 1977 fire.  Nearby is a monument to Finnish soldiers. </li><li>  Rauhala Manor.  The facility was built in the late 1800s by the Winter family.  The estate is located on the outskirts of the city. </li><li>  Speaking about the sights of Lahdenpohja, one cannot but mention the Huuhkanm√§ki.  This is the architectural ensemble of the military town of the early 1900s.  Now in this area there are many entertainment venues (tourist area), but Huuhkanm√§ki remains a monument of Finnish military architecture. </li><li>  <span>Mass grave.</span>  It is located in the city center and was opened in memory of the Soviet soldiers who died in 1941.  Nearby is the chapel of St. George the Victorious.  She, in turn, was timed to the 50th anniversary of the Victory over Nazi Germany. </li><li>  There is also a <span>Lutheran church</span> in Lumivaara.  It was built in 1935, and a Finnish war cemetery was formed next to this architectural landmark. </li><li>  Orthodox chapel in the name of Valentine.  The temple is located on the promenade of the Yakkimvarsky Gulf. </li></ol>

    <h2>  One of the most interesting places is an abandoned bunker. </h2><p>  In Lahdenpohja, the sights are divided into ‚Äúfrequent‚Äù and ‚Äúrarely visited‚Äù.  One of the last is an abandoned bunker.  Its authors are Americans who designed a secret underground shelter in the 1930s, specially commissioned by the Finns.  Now this place is abandoned, but it is very attractive for tourists and locals.  Therefore, in order to explore the whole city, it is worth getting into this place as well. </p>

    <h2>  G. Lahdenpohja - ‚Äúprotected Russia‚Äù </h2><p>  The most attractive natural attraction of the Lahdenpoh region is Kuhkaa.  This is a picturesque island, which is famous for its sandy beaches and is perfect for a relaxing holiday.  Especially for those people who like to be among nature. </p><p>  On <span>Lake Yastrebin,</span> which is a natural monument and part of the "reserved Russia", tourists can admire the large rocks.  This place is located on the border of Karelia and the Leningrad region.  The object is a rock mass of about 60 meters in height, which seems to hang over the lake.  Climbing competitions are held here, and those who are not fond of this sport can just relax - clean air and a pleasant landscape are always beneficial. </p><p>  The city of Lahdenpohja, the sights of which were considered in this article, is a truly unremarkable settlement.  But if one day fate brings you to this corner of Russia, you should not waste time in vain - it is better to visit popular places, especially since there are few of them. </p>
