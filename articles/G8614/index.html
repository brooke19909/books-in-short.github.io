This is a convenient device for heating food and ready meals.  In most microwave ovens, they are almost eternal, and in order to disable it, you need to make special efforts and imagination.  But some stoves (especially old ones) present unpleasant surprises to the owners.  A common problem is a sparkling microwave inside.  Many housewives, seeing fireworks from sparks, are scared and panicked.  Let's look at what to do in this case, what it is connected with and how to fix it. </p><h2>  What sparks in the microwave </h2><p>  The device of any microwave oven has a magnetron.  This device generates electromagnetic waves at high frequency.  When the voltage necessary for its functioning (namely 4 thousand volts) comes directly to the magnetron for the generation process, as well as 3 V for the subchannel, the antenna of this device starts emitting high-frequency oscillations.  The wavelength of this oscillation is 12 centimeters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why the microwave sparks inside" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1826193.jpg" width="600"></div>  The magnetron operates at a frequency of 2.4 GHz.  The wavelength is 12 centimeters - it is this distance that radiation travels in one oscillation.  If you open the theory of radio waves, then the hole in the stove should not be larger than a quarter of this wavelength and is 3 centimeters.  At this frequency, water molecules begin to resonate, due to which they heat up.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A spark is an electric charge or an arc that forms between two conductors.  In the role of such can be various objects made of steel, metallized images.  When an alternating magnetic field begins to act on a conductor, eddy currents appear in it. </p><p>  If two conductors with different potentials are close to each other, there will be a discharge or a spark between them.  Therefore, microwaves sparkle inside. </p><h2>  Improper operation </h2><p>  Let's try to understand the causes of sparking.  And violations of the operating rules - this is one of them.  The instructions for any microwave oven indicate that special dishes should be used in the microwave.  If these recommendations are not followed, then sparks will form inside the device during operation.  The device pops during operation. </p><p>  If the microwave inside sparks, manufacturers do not recommend using the device at this time.  If you use the oven further, it can lead to sad consequences, such as the failure of the device, as well as exposure to dangerous electromagnetic waves. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="microwave sparks sparks inside the microwave" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1826191.jpg" width="450"></div>  It is forbidden to put utensils made of solid metal and with metallized patterns in the <span>microwave oven</span> , including with various borders based on them.  Sparking may be short in time.  But this is a significant risk that the magnetron will fail.  This is the most expensive part in a microwave device.

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So, the <span>microwave sparkles</span> inside.  What to do in this case?  It's simple - just stop the device and remove the electricity conductor.  However, if the furnace continues to frighten the owner with sparks, then this indicates the failure of the device. </p><h2>  The need to replace the mica plate </h2><p>  This is the most common cause of sparking after operational disturbances.  The reason is that the mica plate burns out during operation.  Manufacturers use it in the design of microwave ovens to disperse microwaves.  If the stove is not monitored or insufficiently looked after, then fat deposits and food and food residues accumulate on this plate.  As a result, the plate overheats.  This leads to its destruction.  If you do not change this plate, you will have to replace the already more expensive magnetron. </p><p>  To find out if the mica plate is really to blame, you need to understand which side the microwave sparks inside.  If the spark comes from the side of the plate and the burning smells distinctly inside the furnace, this indicates the need to replace the element.  Do not use a microwave device with burnt mica. </p><h2>  DIY plate replacement </h2><p>  You can repair the microwave oven yourself.  First you need to make sure that the reason why the microwave sparks inside is because of the diffuser.  Then the plate is checked for burnt holes.  Before starting to install a new one, the inner chamber should be thoroughly cleaned of grease and product residues. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sparks microwave inside" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1826192.jpg" width="600"></div>  These mica plates are sold in household goods stores.  Buying a product in an ordinary store is simpler and cheaper.  However, the product may not fit in size - you have to cut it.  To clarify the dimensions, the old plate from the microwave is applied to the new and with the help of scissors they remove all unnecessary.  The edges should be treated with sandpaper.  Then it remains only to install the plate.

    <h2>  Damaged inner coating </h2><p>  This is another popular reason.  The microwave sparkles inside and sparkles - what should I do?  Carefully check the inside cover.  The place where food is heated or cooked is covered with a special enamel layer.  Leftover food, scratches - all this leads to various damages. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sparks microwave inside cause" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1826196.jpg" width="600"></div>  Restore this coating with your own hands will not work.  To do this, you need special enamels that can not be purchased in everyday life.  This type of repair is carried out by specialists in service centers.  Coating is inexpensive. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <h2>  Coverage recovery </h2><p>  Before returning the microwave oven to a service center to restore coverage, all dirt and grease should be removed from the inside.  Where there is a violation of the coating, the enamel should be removed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why the microwave sparks inside what to do" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1826194.jpg" width="600"></div>  If you spend time, you can find this coating on sale, but it is not everywhere.  After cleaning, the damaged area is blown out with this agent and left for a certain time.  Then carry out a check.  If the <span>microwave</span> sparks after starting, the sparks inside the microwave indicate that the coating should be improved.  If there is no cod, then the device can be used further.

      <p></p>
    <h2>  Reasons for coating failure </h2><p>  If too large dishes are placed in the microwave, this can cause damage to the enameled surface.  If the dishes do not touch the walls, then during the rotation they can move out.  With constant friction, the enamel will become thinner and thinner each time.  Ultimately, this will lead to the need to restore coverage. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So that the microwave oven does not spark, you must follow the operating rules and do not use metal utensils with it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="microwave sparks inside what to do" class="if" height="378" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1826195.jpg" width="600"></div>  It is also necessary to monitor the condition of the internal chamber - it must be kept clean.  If suddenly the furnace will give out electrical effects, do not panic.  There are just a few reasons why the microwave sparkles inside.  What to do, we already know.
