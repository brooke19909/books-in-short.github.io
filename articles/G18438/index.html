A statement about the Nazi desire to exterminate the inhabitants of the European part of the <span>Soviet Union</span> appeared during the tribunal in Nuremberg.  It is quite natural that until this time a similar idea was repeatedly voiced by the allied professionals in information warfare, but at that time it was only propaganda. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="OST master plan" class="if" height="451" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/216527.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Supporters of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe extermination of Slavs by the Germans allude to several documents at once.  The Ost master plan is the main one, even though its true version has not been discovered to this day.  Be that as it may, he was still mentioned during the <span>Nuremberg trials.</span>  The only thing that was then available was only "Proposal and comments on the plan."  The authorship of this document is attributed to E. Wetzel, who led during the war one of the department of the Ministry for the Eastern occupied territories.  In general, it was a sketch made in pencil in a regular notebook.  The source, which was officially published, consists of four parts.  The first of these was ‚ÄúComments that should be included in the Ost plan‚Äù.  The second section is ‚ÄúRemarks on Germanization‚Äù, and the third is ‚ÄúSolving the Polish Question‚Äù.  The document completed part of what was called the ‚ÄúQuestion of the future treatment of the Russian population.‚Äù </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  According to Wetzel, in </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Fascist plan Ost" class="if" height="205" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/216526.jpg" width="246"></div>  four and a half thousand Germans were to be resettled at the initial stage.  Moreover, racially undesirable local residents should be sent to the West Siberian region.  As for the Jews, they had to be exterminated before that.  In the second part, the issue of including Germans of Nordic origin in the Reich orbit is considered, and in the next, the most dangerous people are called Poles.  However, he emphasized that it was impossible to completely eliminate them to solve the problem.  In the final, fourth, section, the author admires the racial type of Russians, therefore, notes the inadmissibility of their elimination.  Despite everything, in the comments that need to be included in the Ost plan, there are many obvious inaccuracies and errors that relate directly to the activities of the agency entrusted to Wetzel.  All this casts doubt on the authenticity of this document and raises the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãits falsification.  It is possible that specialists representing allied interests worked on it beforehand. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="OST Plan" class="if" height="389" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/216525.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Most Western historians and scientists have not taken this document seriously for a long time and do not consider it authentic.  On the other hand, to assert that the fascist plan of Ost is fiction, is by no means impossible, even despite the fact that even a copy of it was not found.  Be that as it may, the monstrous acts of the Nazis during the war had to be regulated by something.  Without a doubt, Hitler's plans included the destruction of a huge number of Jews and Slavs, which amounted to millions.  Whether such a document as the Ost plan existed or not in reality, against this background it becomes no longer so important. </p>
