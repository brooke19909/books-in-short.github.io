This is a year-round health resort, in which, in addition to providing effective treatment, the educational process is organized.  Children with skin, respiratory, digestive and cardiovascular diseases from 4 years old are accepted for treatment, from 6 years old for recovery.  One of the features of the sanatorium is that only children are accepted. </p><h2>  Location and infrastructure </h2><p>  On the territory of the largest forest in Belarus, in the Nalibokskaya Pushcha, in the pine forest of the Volozhinsky district, a children's sanatorium of the same name was founded in 1981.  Within a radius of 40 km there are no harmful industries.  It occupies 26 hectares of forest, where there are seven one-story houses with three- and four-bed rooms, designed in the summer for 180, and in the winter for 150 children taken to the sanatorium.  The house has toilets, showers, hot and cold water, dryers. </p>

    <h2>  Natural healing factors </h2><p>  Being in the sanatorium "Nalibokskaya Pushcha" is indicated for excitable children and children with chronic respiratory diseases.  The clean air of the mixed forest affects the child's body in the form of aerotherapy in outdoor games, sports fields.  Children receive heliotherapy by taking sun baths at the artificial reservoir and on the "dry beach" of the sanatorium, where sun loungers and umbrellas are installed.  Such appointments are necessary primarily for children with skin diseases.  Bathing in the lake has a three-sided effect on the skin of the child - thermal, chemical and mechanical, which contributes to overall recovery. </p><p>  Since 2009, a speleoclimatic clinic has been operating on the territory of the Nalibokskaya Pushcha sanatorium.  This project was carried out under the supervision of Ph.D.  A. S. Bogdanovich.  Salt blocks were delivered from the Soligorsk potash mines.  The procedures prescribed by therapists are taken by children with bronchial asthma, a chronic form of bronchitis with asthmatic components. </p><h2>  Communication, Internet and leisure </h2><p>  At present, it is difficult to find an area that would not be covered by a mobile network and the Internet.  Three mobile operators: Velcom, Life and MTS provide uninterrupted communication and communication between parents and children.  There is mobile Internet, which anyone can use in the sanatorium "Nalibokskaya Pushcha".  In the photo below, fans of computer games. </p>
