The varieties of this cognitive activity include numismatics.  That is collecting coins.  Those who do this seriously understand that there are instances that can bring not only moral satisfaction, but also enrich their owner.  The collection is turning into capital.  The most expensive items include the royal coin. </p><p>  Moreover, the more collectors appear who want to get such items in their collection, the more expensive they are.  But not everyone seeks to profit.  The most enthusiastic collectors will never part with a coin from their collection, even if the <span>value of coins in</span> Tsarist Russia reaches a million rubles.  But there are also numismatists who are ready to give everything for the opportunity to get a rare copy. </p>

    <h2>  What are they needed for </h2><p>  Why are royal tsar <span>coins</span> or their more noble brothers of gold and silver so attractive, for example?  Most likely, its historical value.  Lovers of antiquity reverently imagine who, several centuries ago, held this money in their hands, under what circumstances the tsar‚Äôs coin was lost and was able to ‚Äúsurvive‚Äù to this day.  Those who engage in this kind of gathering should be very well versed in the types, history of occurrence, and the value of their exhibits.  Knowledge on how to determine authenticity, how to store it, under what conditions it can lose its value, will not be superfluous.  For example, will the royal coin cost less if it has abrasions, chips or other damage. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Which is worth more </h2><p>  The crown of each collection is the rarest and, accordingly, the most expensive unit.  For example, the value of coins of <span>tsarist Russia is</span> higher if these are trial copies.  That is, they were released in limited quantities to determine whether it was necessary to engage in mass production.  These rarities include the Constantine ruble made of silver.  It was released in 1825.  The number of these coins does not exceed 5-6 pieces.  Or existing in even smaller amounts (2 pieces) of Peter's silver rubles.  Date of issue - 1722. </p>

    <h2>  The rarest </h2><p>  The amount of 50 million rubles that paid for a gold coin with the image of Catherine at the London auction sounds fantastic.  But this is true.  The fact is that the second such royal coin is only in the Hermitage.  This trial copy weighs just 33 grams.  Its face value is 20 rubles.  Year of release - 1755. A distinctive feature is the inscription "Elizabeth Golden". </p><p>  The approximate cost of royal coins in 2015 </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  face value </td><td>  year of issue </td><td>  price </td><td>  currency </td></tr><tr><td>  1 ruble </td><td>  1725 </td><td>  36500 </td><td>  ruble </td></tr><tr><td>  half a half </td><td>  1725 </td><td>  1730 </td><td>  dollar </td></tr><tr><td>  1 chervonets </td><td>  1701 </td><td>  50500 </td><td>  Euro </td></tr><tr><td>  denga </td><td>  1701 </td><td>  75 </td><td>  dollar </td></tr><tr><td>  2 rubles </td><td>  1727 </td><td>  131500 </td><td>  dollar </td></tr><tr><td>  1 kopeck </td><td>  1727 </td><td>  175 </td><td>  Euro </td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  How it all started </h2><p>  <span>The monetary reform of the</span> 16th-17th centuries had an impact on the monetary system of Russia.  Money was minted both from plain copper and from noble gold.  Their denomination was very different from what is accepted today.  At that time, fifty kopecks, half kopecks, as well as 5 kopecks and the hryvnia were in use.  In 1704, the first Russian silver ruble was minted.  In 1718, two-ruble coins began to be issued.  It is noteworthy that at that time on the back depicted a two-headed eagle with symbols of power in clawed legs.  Interestingly, silver in tsarist Russia was inexpensive.  After all, it was mined a lot, in addition, new metal processing plants were being built.  Therefore, they did not spare him and issued coins from silver of high fineness. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Money reform was gradually carried out.  On the coins, instead of an eagle, they depicted four letters P. intertwined with each other. Gradually there was a depletion of silver reserves, and the fineness decreased.  In 1730 saw the light of new money.  On the front side of the silver ruble depicted Anna Ioannovna.  Several times the mass of coins was facilitated due to the need to reduce government spending.  But gradually the mass reached 18 grams, the coins became heavier and remained so until the beginning of the last century. </p><h2>  And before it was not wooden </h2><p>  The silver ruble did not lose its position in the money market during the time of Alexander the First.  But he had to change the appearance.  Signs indicating the autocrat disappeared.  Coins began to be called state.  The denomination even on gold or platinum money denoted the amount of silver.  Alexander II first increased the <span>minting of coins,</span> but then ordered to reduce their sample.  This applies to all coins except the silver ruble. </p><p>  But Alexander the Third again wanted to portray his portrait on the front side.  Commemorative coins began to be issued in the late XIX - early XX centuries.  They were released on major holidays.  The dominant position of the silver ruble was changed by J. Witte at the end of the 19th century.  He made the gold ruble the main currency.  During this period, coins acquired an almost modern look.  The main difference was the image of the emperor on the front side. </p>

    <p>  If a person has all the necessary knowledge, no one can deceive him.  So, the numismatist will be able to be proud that in his collection there are special coins, royal ones.  The price you have to pay to own them does not matter to a true collector. </p>
