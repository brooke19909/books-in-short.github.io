    <h2>  Device design: what did the very first iPhone look like? </h2><p>  Dimensions: 115 by 60 by 11.6 millimeters. </p><p>  Weight: 135 grams. </p><p>  Jobs's first swallow was amazing at the time.  Today, the way the first iPhone looked, causes bewilderment and quiet ridicule of the haters of the company, because the gadget was completely plain, quite heavy and thick.  One way or another, the first-generation iPhone stood out from the crowd.  Unlike competitors, the smartphone from California had a metal case, and the entire front panel was occupied by the display.  The iPhone could not boast an abundance of keys, the exterior of the device was as austere and stylish as possible. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition to the aluminum back, there was also a plastic insert on the rear panel through which the signal passed, as well as a camera (weak even by 2007 standards) with a resolution of 2 megapixels. </p><p>  Later, the material was replaced with plastic, which was perceived by many as bad taste, but after a while Apple changed their minds and returned to their previous premium style. </p>

    <h2>  Device display: first multi-touch capacitive display </h2><p>  Answering the question about how the first iPhone looked, the easiest way to say that it was one solid display. </p><p>  The main advantage and the crown ‚Äúchip‚Äù of the new smartphone is the screen.  Moreover, the iPhone‚Äôs display could recognize up to ten different taps at the same time, was controlled by gestures and was extremely responsive (unlike the resistive screens offered by competitors).  In fact, this was the only element that the lucky owner of such a device observed. </p><p>  The screen size was 3.5 inches.  The display had a rather lousy resolution, only 320 by 480 pixels (the value of the number of dots per inch was 163).  It was a TFT matrix, scary, now even repulsive. </p><h2>  Technical equipment of the device: what was under the hood? </h2><p>  More important than how the first iPhone looked, how this phone worked.  Despite all its innovation, at that time the smartphone was rather slow and could not boast of a rich set of features. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The heart of this kid from Cupertino was the Samsung S3C processor based on the ARM architecture, with one core and acceleration up to 620 megahertz.  The amount of RAM stopped at a value of 128 megabytes, while the amount of main memory was at the level of four gigabytes (later additional modifications with 8 and 16 gigabytes of flash memory appeared). </p><p>  As for the battery, the phone could live offline for up to 6 hours (web browsing).  In standby mode, the phone could oversleep and all 200 hours.  The smartphone supported modern wireless interfaces, including: Wi-Fi protocol 802.11, Bluetooth version 2.0.  There were no familiar things for many like the infrared port. </p>

    <h2>  Criticism: opinion of market leaders (former) </h2><p>  The dog barks - the wind wears, and the caravan goes on.  It is with this proverb that I want to start a conversation about criticism of the iPhone.  Already on the day of the first announcement, everyone hurried to slander against the new brainchild from America.  People were not happy with how the first iPhone looked, its price, limitations in operation and the lack of a keyboard. </p><p>  The head of Microsoft at that moment, <span>Steve Ballmer,</span> laughed and said that no one in his life would ever buy such a phone, and even for $ 600.  In his opinion, the first iPhone was good for nothing, while Microsoft communicators were ideal for businessmen. </p><p>  Research in Motion employees, who claimed that the lack of a keyboard would make the phone unusable for everyday use, did not lag behind.  Moreover, the creator of Blackberry complained that Apple did not think about the battery life and the phone would run out quickly. </p><p>  What was the surprise of competitors when they managed to use the new smartphone.  How accurate the touch screen turned out and how massive the battery was installed in it.  Apple was able to prove the viability of the idea and select the market for phones.  After all, the one who laughs last laughs well. </p>

    <h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  Looking at how the first iPhones looked, you can see what a huge path the evolution of smartphones has come and how much the world has changed, into which technologies have come, so affordable and simple.  The approach to education, creativity, pastime, health care and many other aspects of life has changed.  Is this good or bad?  The question remains open so far. </p>
