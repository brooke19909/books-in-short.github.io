After all, babies grow, and the size of each element of their clothes each time becomes larger, and as for the female "nylon", then, probably, there is no need to talk about how easily ‚Äúpuffs‚Äù and ‚Äúarrows‚Äù are formed on them.  As a result of this, a situation arises when it is a pity to throw away a thing and it is impossible to wear.  Therefore, the logical question becomes what can be done from old tights? </p>

    <h2>  Application in the manufacture of new clothes </h2><p>  Perhaps it‚Äôs worth starting with what can be done with old tights so that they continue to be an element of clothing.  So, if we are talking about children's products, in which heels and toes have been worn, then life can be prolonged by replacing this part of them.  To do this, use the scissors to trim the lower part of the product, and instead of it sew on ordinary socks, picking them according to the texture and color.  Thanks to this simple manipulation, you can not only get rid of holes, but also increase the <span>size of tights</span> if you sew on socks with a high tibia. </p><p>  It will be useful for needlewomen who are engaged in sewing to know what can be done from old pantyhose cuffs and collars for windbreakers, body shirts and other items of clothing.  If we are talking about "kapron", then they are perfect for making mitts, which can be a great addition to many outfits.  To do this, it is enough to trim the lower and upper parts of the tights, and cut a hole in the thumb area.  The most suitable are color and openwork options. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Old pantyhose in the kitchen: why are we needed? </h2><p>  Tights that are no longer suitable for the manufacture of new clothing items should also not be thrown away.  After all, from them you can make a lot of irreplaceable items for the kitchen.  Old <span>nylon tights</span> can make an excellent washcloth.  To do this, they should be folded several times - depending on the desired thickness of the future washcloth - and fasten in several places with a thread and a needle for more convenient use. </p>

    <p>  Nylon pantyhose is an excellent device for filtering various liquids.  Of course, most housewives in the kitchen have special strainers, but it is so good to detain larger particles that are unnecessary in a liquid only with the help of such a simple device. </p><p>  In the kitchen, tights, regardless of the material of manufacture, are also excellent for storing onions and garlic.  You just need to cut them at the hip level, wash, dry, fill with onions or garlic and hang them on a hook.  In this case, these vegetables, which are always necessary for the preparation of many dishes, will be at hand and, in addition, well preserved. </p><h2>  Useful crafts for home </h2><p>  Going beyond the kitchen, you can also come up with what can be made from old tights.  So, they can become indispensable assistants when cleaning the house.  There is no better material for cleaning furniture than children's tights!  But the mirrors are better to clean with nylon products.  In addition, their composition allows you to polish shoes to a shine, and who does not like perfectly clean shoes or boots? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Having started the conversation about cleanliness and cleaning, it is worth mentioning another important role that nylon tights can play in the house - to save the owners of vacuum cleaners with reusable filters from torment with their cleaning.  To do this, you just need to trim the pantyhose in the thigh and trace area, tie a knot on one side, and pull the other on the pipe and secure it with an elastic band.  After cleaning, the tights can be thrown away with garbage, so you do not have to waste time cleaning the vacuum cleaner. </p>

    <h2>  Ways to use in the country </h2><p>  The answer to the question of what can be made from old tights is also worth knowing to summer residents.  "Kapronki" you can wrap the trunks of fruit trees in order to protect the latter from all kinds of rodents.  It is important that the gap between the turns during spiral winding does not exceed 5 mm, then the trees in the garden will definitely survive.  Particularly ‚Äúlazy‚Äù gardeners came up with another quite successful way to use tights - planting potatoes in a stocking.  To do this, potatoes should be placed in a stocking and bury, leaving the end above the ground.  Kapron will not interfere with its growth, but when harvesting it will not be necessary to plow the land, but it will be enough to pull the stocking, having slightly poked it with a shovel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Old nylon panty hoses are also convenient for tying all kinds of crops - tomato, beans, etc. To do this, cut the tights into strips and apply as necessary.  The advantage of kapron ropes is that they do not stretch and do not rot, due to which they perfectly support the plant throughout its growth. </p><h2>  Knitting from old tights </h2><p>  Tights and stockings also should not be thrown out to needlewomen, who are interested in knitting.  From old tights you can knit a lot of useful and interesting things.  To do this, they must be cut into strips and fastened together.  You can use a soldering iron to fasten kapron strips, but natural materials will have to be stitched or simply tied. </p>

    <p>  With the help of a hook you can knit an excellent rug from old tights, which you can then lay in any place convenient for you.  To do this, it is enough to have basic crochet skills.  During the work, you can give the rug any desired shape. </p><h2>  Beads and brooches from nylon tights </h2><p>  No matter how strange this may sound, old <span>nylon tights</span> are an excellent material for making jewelry that women love so much.  So, for example, from colored products wonderful beads and brooches can turn out.  For the manufacture of this unusual jewelry (except for tights proper) you will need large beads and 10-15 cm ribbons of the corresponding color.  First you need to cut a strip 30-35 cm long and 3-4 cm wide from tights. Sew it in such a way as to make a cylinder, turn it on the front side and put 7-8 beads inside, after each of which tie a neat knot.  Then sew a ribbon to both edges, and the new necklace is ready.  In a similar way, you can make a two- or three-tier decoration. </p>

    <p>  You can make a magnificent brooch from colored nylon tights and wire, for example, in the shape of a flower.  To do this, you need to take a wire about 20 cm long, wind a strip of nylon on it and twist it into a hairpin - this will be the pestle of the future flower.  Next, you need to bend the wire in the form of a petal and cover it with the same material.  The number of petals will depend on the size of the brooch.  At the final stage, all the elements of the flower must be twisted together and the fastener attached. </p><h2>  Toys </h2><p>  If you show a little imagination, you can get new and unusual toys from old tights.  The easiest to make is a snake.  You just need to cut off the femoral part of the tights and fill one stocking with some soft material, you can even use the same old tights, cut into small parts.  If the stocking is greatly expanded upwards, then it must first be sewn to the diameter of the lower leg, and it is better to make the tail.  After filling, the open edge should be sutured.  To get a more realistic toy, on one side of the obtained snake, you should make eyes using beads or small buttons, then sew on the tongue, cutting it out of any red material. </p>

    <p>  An octopus can also be an interesting toy for a baby.  To make it, you need 4 pairs of tights and a lot of soft material for filling.  It is necessary to take some tights, in their femoral part to make 6 more holes.  Then, alternately placing the remaining pairs of tights inside the first, pull their hosiery through the cut holes.  After that, it is necessary to fill all 8 ‚Äúlegs‚Äù and ‚Äúhead‚Äù (the femoral part of the first tights) with soft material, sew up the top, preferably after trimming it in the form of a semicircle, glue the beads in the eye area.  By the way, this soft toy can be made with a child. </p><h2>  How to make a doll from old tights? </h2><p>  A doll from old tights can be no less original than the soft toys described above.  First you need to cut off the track and the femoral part from the nylon pantyhose, the narrower side of the resulting stocking should be sewn in the form of a semicircle on the wrong side, then fill the resulting bag with a synthetic winterizer, drag its upper part with a thread to get the head.  To form the legs, use a thread and a needle to pull the bag in the lower part vertically to the beginning of the body. </p><p>  Next, you need to sew two narrow and small bags from the same tights and stuff them with a synthetic winterizer - these will be the pens that need to be sewn to the body.  To make the handles look more realistic, you can form fingers with the help of a thread and a needle.  It remains only to give the doll an image (embroider the eyes, eyebrows, mouth with thread, and form hair from yarn or felt).  And you can give the child. </p>

    <h2>  Decorative crafts for home decoration </h2><p>  Crafts from old tights can have not only a practical purpose, such as toys or washcloths in the kitchen, but also decorative.  So, from nylon tights you can make a magnificent bouquet of flowers to decorate the yard or living room. </p><p>  The ideal material for this craft is colored "nylon", but bodily ones are also suitable.  To get a brighter color, they can be painted with acrylics.  You will also need another thin wire and a self-adhesive tape of green color.  First, from the wire you need to make a frame in the form of a petal, tighten it with a capron.  Then twist several petals together and attach to the frame, a wire wrapped in green self-adhesive tape.  The leaves are made similar to the petals, only the frame is fitted with a green nylon.  From these flowers you can collect whole color bouquets of various shapes, and then decorate any room with them. </p>
