    <h2>  Biography of Diogenes of Laertes </h2><p>  Unfortunately, first of all it is worth saying that today Diogenes Laertius remains a mysterious person.  His biography does not contain a single reliable fact. </p><p>  Based on the opinions of scientists, it can be concluded that <span>this philosopher-biographer</span> was born in the Cilician city of Laertes.  Diogenes Laertius was born (the photo of his bust is presented first), presumably at the end of the second century AD and survived to the third century AD. </p><p>  And scientists, in turn, were able to draw this conclusion, based on the fact that the philosopher in one of his works mentions the name of Sextus Empiricus, who was his contemporary. </p><p>  As for the name of Diogenes, there is also no reliable information as to whether this real name, or pseudonym, is a nickname. </p><h2>  The works of Diogenes </h2><p>  This philosopher is also called the historian of philosophy.  His hand belongs to a treatise, which consists of 10 books and describes the life and work of many ancient Greek thinkers. </p>

    <p>  It is also worth noting that in this treatise, 84 philosophers were mentioned, about a thousand statements by more than 250 different authors were cited. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The same treatise, authored by Diogenes of Laertes, has several different names, more precisely, different sources transmit it differently.  As a rule, the main ones are: ‚ÄúHistory of philosophy‚Äù, ‚ÄúLife and opinions of famous philosophers‚Äù, as well as ‚ÄúBiographies of sophists‚Äù. </p><h2>  Composition of the treatise on philosophers </h2><ol><li>  The book is about Thales, Soloy, Biant and other philosophers of the four "seven" who lived in 7-6 centuries BC. </li><li>  The second book describes the followers of the Ionian school.

His works are described. </li><li>  The book is about Polemon, Carnead and other philosophers who were students of the Academy of Plato. </li><li>  This book describes the life and work of Aristotle, as well as his disciples Theophast, Heraclides and Demetrius. </li><li>  In the sixth book, the postulates of the doctrine of the cynical school are transmitted, information is given about its founder Antisthenes and his students - Diogenes of Sinop, Kratet with his wife Hipparchia, Metroclus, Onesicritus and others. </li><li>  Diogenes Laertius devoted this book to the Stoic philosophical school.  Here are mentioned such names as Chrysippus, Ariston of Chios, Zeno of China and others. </li><li>  The eighth book is completely devoted to the life and teachings of Pythagoras with the names of Empedocles, Eudoxus, Philolaus and other Pythagoreans. </li><li>  This book describes the <span>Elean school of philosophy</span> and its representatives - Heraclitus of Ephesus, Xenophanes, Parmenides, as well as the followers of the <span>materialist theory of</span> philosophy - Democritus, Leucippus.  The book also mentions the names of the sophist Protagoras and the skeptics Piron and Timon. </li><li>  The last book of the treatise is dedicated to the philosopher Epicurus. </li></ol>

Conclusions about the character and temperament can only be drawn from his legacy and rare references to scientists. </p><p>  And judging by the works, Diogenes of Laertes was a very wise, observant, and cheerful person.  The quotes that belong to him are known and are the source of wisdom, and the works are filled with humor, legends and interesting biographical facts of <span>famous philosophers of</span> those times: </p><ul><li>  Diogenes asked for alms from the sculpture, and when they asked him why he was doing this, the answer was: ‚ÄúTo accustom yourself to refusals.‚Äù </li><li>  ‚ÄúThere are many people, but very few people in the world‚Äù </li><li>  "And where to wash those who washed here?"  the philosopher once asked, speaking of one untidy bathhouse. </li><li>  in one of the books the following quotation is given: ‚ÄúEuripides gave Socrates the work of Heraclitus and asked his opinion;  he replied: ‚ÄúWhat I understood is fine;  which I probably didn‚Äôt understand, either. ‚Äù </li><li>  ‚ÄúThe slander is the most fierce of wild animals, and the flatterer is the most dangerous of tame animals‚Äù </li></ul>

    <p>  It is also important to say that Diogenes of Laertes is not the philosopher whom the legend associates with the <span>barrel.</span>  <span>Diogenes</span> Sinopsky arranged for himself a house in a barrel and behaved extremely shockingly.  But Diogenes of Laertes, at least judging by the archives, was not seen in this. </p>
