Such models are always liked by both young girls and fans of the current boho style. </p><p>  Most often, lace skirts are worn in warm time, so for knitting it is better to choose thin cotton or linen threads.  Although you can choose a gentle mohair, and then the skirt will look good with autumn ankle boots. </p><p>  Depending on the type of figure for knitting an openwork skirt, you can choose an A-silhouette or a more sophisticated half-sun.  For craftswomen who are proficient in knitting techniques, you can offer the silhouette of the "Elven Tower".  It takes a long time to count the loops, but the result will definitely please. </p><p>  Knitting a skirt with knitting need to start from top to bottom.  On the circular knitting needles, dial the desired number of loops, knit several rows with an elastic band.  Then continue the work with the selected pattern, gradually increasing the number of loops. </p><p>  Almost any openwork pattern, from simple to filigree complex lace, is suitable for knitting.  If you don‚Äôt have much experience, but you really want a smart lace skirt, you can perform even stripes of lace, and additional loops to be knitted with a facial smoothness. </p><p>  Knitting a fishnet skirt for women with knitting needles will certainly cheer you up, and the thing itself will become one of the basic in the wardrobe. </p><h2>  Wrap skirt </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.asos.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Models of wrap skirts" class="if uuid-2747754" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2747754.jpg"></div><p>  With the onset of cold weather, I want to please myself with warm soft things.

Which is not surprising, because this is one of the most feminine types of skirts: the model emphasizes the waist and scatters down a beautiful frill. </p><p>  One year old skirt is suitable for any season - you can knit it from thin cotton with the addition of viscose or choose a warm yarn and a dense pattern. </p><p>  To knit a skirt "Year" you first need to make a pattern in accordance with the parameters of the figure.  Its length without a shuttlecock can be up to the knee or be slightly lower.  On the pattern, it is necessary to mark the line of the hips, to this length it will be necessary to expand the knitted fabric. </p><p>  To get started, you need to dial the required number of loops on circular knitting needles and tie 8-10 rows with an elastic band.  Then you need to gradually increase the number of loops.  Continue adding loops until the fabric of the product reaches the line of extension of the hips, then begin to knit straight. </p><p>  Having tied the length of the skirt almost completely to the shuttlecock, it is necessary to reduce a small number of loops.  The fit of the skirt in the knee area will visually increase the slimness of the figure. </p><p>  Then double the number of loops (dial additional loops of yarn over one) and tie a shuttlecock of the desired length on them.  Hinges to close.  And you can try on your new feminine skirt! </p>
