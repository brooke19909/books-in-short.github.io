One of them is the acquisition by the client of a policy when registering any banking service.  In this regard, you need to know how to return Sberbank insurance in case of early repayment of the loan.  In order to have a full understanding of this program, you need to find out what it is. </p><h2>  Basic concepts </h2><p>  Credit insurance is a product that reduces the risk of the bank in the event of adverse situations in the life of the borrower, and also protects his life. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wisebread.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to return insurance in a savings bank" class="if uuid-3192306" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3192306.jpg"></div><p>  Thus, if the borrower loses work or other unfavorable situations arise, the organization assumes all responsibility to the financial institution. </p><p>  The percentage of insurance depends on the amount of money that a client of Sberbank took on credit.  The larger the loan amount from a financial institution, the more expensive the policy.  Of course, not a single bank will operate at a loss, so you should not be surprised at its ‚Äúprice‚Äù for a large loan. </p><h2>  Insured events </h2><p>  Many people care about the question: what can you protect a loan from?  In this case, insurance cases are: </p><ul><li>  loss by the borrower of health, disability; </li><li>  a serious illness, as a result of which the client of the bank cannot continue to pay the loan; </li><li>  job loss; </li><li>  borrower's death; </li><li>  worsening financial situation. </li></ul><p>  In this regard, the question arises: is it possible to return insurance on a loan from Sberbank if such an event does not occur?  The answer to this question can be found by reading the article to the end. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If a client of Sberbank is going to take a consumer loan (including a car), then it will be necessary to insure only responsibility and his life.  And in the case of any other loans, for example, mortgages, where a mortgage is needed, in addition to your life, it will be necessary to insure against mortgaged property. </p><p>  According to the norms of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation, protection of consumer loans is not considered mandatory and is carried out exclusively at the request of the borrower.  It would seem that the answer to the question of whether it is possible to return insurance on a loan from Sberbank is obvious.  At the same time, the protection of collateral is mandatory in cases where it is a mortgage or other type of lending, in the conditions of which a mortgage is required.  However, in this case, the client is no longer required to insure liability. </p><div class="photo" data-original="abaforlawstudents.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="can I return insurance to Sberbank" class="if uuid-3192309" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3192309.jpg"></div><h2>  Goals </h2><p>  In the interests of any bank that is successfully and stably developing is a maximum reduction in the percentage of loan defaults.  As for Russian financial institutions, the situation is rather complicated, and therefore many of them have no choice but to impose insurance on all clients.  This is a very lucrative business.  For this reason, many banks create their own insurance organizations, which subsequently become part of a single holding.  Thus, banks make a profit both on interest on lending to their customers, and on a dubious service called credit insurance. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Is it beneficial to the borrower? </h2><p>  If we consider the issue from the point of view of a simple person, then, of course, insurance is unprofitable for him.  This is due to the fact that the loan amount is also increased by the amount of the policy.  But no one wants to give their money away just like that.  Nevertheless, if the activities of the borrower are associated with risks and the likelihood of being fired or losing their working capacity is high, then such a client will have certain benefits. </p><div class="photo" data-original="financefeeds.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to return insurance in a savings bank" class="if uuid-3192305" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3192305.jpg"></div><h2>  Cost and terms </h2><p>  The price of the policy in different banks is different, but may vary within the following limits: </p><ul><li>  life insurance - 0.30-4% of the total cost of the loan per year + some additions to the base rate; </li><li>  from accident - 0.30-1% of the loan cost + many additions to the basic tariff; </li><li>  oncological diseases - 0.10-1.7% + additions; </li><li>  collateral insurance - more than 0.70% + paid additions. </li></ul><p>  The amount depends on two main criteria: the interest rate for the policy and the size of the loan. </p><h2>  Features of insurance in Sberbank </h2><p>  As for this financial institution, there are some features of insurance that should be considered when concluding loan agreements. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  The purchase of a policy when applying for consumer loans is not mandatory. </li><li>  Discrepancies between reality and legislation: in case of refusal of insurance, the bank may refuse to issue a loan to a client. </li><li>  The client has the right to return the money for insurance on a loan from Sberbank ahead of schedule, without waiting for the expiration of its validity, however, no more than 30 days should pass.  In this case, the borrower must be returned half of the cost of the policy or recalculated on the days of the loan balance. </li><li>  In the case of a mortgage agreement, the client is obliged to protect the property, which is a mortgage loan, from damage (fixed in regulatory enactments). </li><li>  Sberbank loan insurance is refunded based on the provisions of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation. </li><li>  The client of this financial institution has the full right to refuse the imposed service even after issuing a loan within one month from the moment of signing the contract and return insurance to Sberbank as an unnecessary product without changing the terms of the contract. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.thessaliaeconomy.gr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible to return insurance at Sberbank" class="if uuid-3192308" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3192308.jpg"></div><h2>  Insurance companies accredited by Sberbank </h2><p>  In the process of choosing a company, all customers worry about its impeccable reputation and reliability.  It is important for payers to receive payments on time and without problems if an insured event occurs.  There are a number of companies that are accredited by Sberbank.  It is not known whether credit insurance will be returned if it is insured by another organization.  The list of companies accredited by Sberbank today includes: </p><ul><li>  Ingosstrakh company; </li><li>  Alfa Insurance; </li><li>  Oranta organization; </li><li>  Sogaz; </li><li>  Rosgosstrakh company, etc. </li></ul><h2>  Types of insurance from Sberbank </h2><p>  This major bank offers customers a range of programs that protect their money in a variety of situations.  So, for example, insurance is mandatory for car loans, mortgages and other popular programs. </p><p>  In addition, here you can take advantage of special premium packages ‚ÄúStatus‚Äù or ‚ÄúPrestige‚Äù, which allow you to use programs for tourists traveling abroad. </p><p>  Below are the main and most popular programs of Sberbank. </p><ol><li>  Life insurance is ideal for a family if the client wants to protect her from the hard blows of fate.  The cumulative version of such a program allows you to get a certain amount of money upon reaching the term specified in the contract. </li><li>  Credit insurance, as employees of this bank say, is by no means a method of shifting a secondary financial burden onto the shoulders of a client.  On the contrary, it is insurance that will, if necessary, protect family or own financial assets.  In Sberbank there are no programs that are prescribed for a certain type of loan: they are all quite varied and diverse.  At the same time, what type of insurance to choose, what nuances to include in the policy, all this is decided individually. </li><li>  Mortgage insurance at Sberbank.  Each client of this financial institution, applying for a mortgage, must insure the property (apartment or house) against possible loss and damage.  The recipient of funds in the event of an insured event is a bank.  This will allow the borrower not to repay the loan if something happens to the housing.  In addition, in some cases, borrower health and life insurance is required.  This is required for the financial protection of the parties.  When obtaining a mortgage loan, customers can purchase a policy at a bank branch or in the office of an organization that has been accredited by Sberbank.  What other protection options are there? </li><li>  Apartment insurance.  Sberbank will not issue a loan if the borrower does not protect the acquired apartment from damage and loss.  This is done in accordance with the requirements of the law.  It is possible to avoid the acquisition of a policy only when the house in which the housing is purchased is not yet completed.  In this situation, the acquisition of insurance is postponed until the receipt of documents of ownership. </li><li>  Insurance card.  This can be done at a fairly low cost.  Such a program will protect against unauthorized withdrawal of funds in the event of loss or theft of a card, in case of damage or in cash in a period not exceeding two hours after withdrawing them from the ATM.  It is possible to declare an insured event at any time of the day by phone. </li></ol><h2>  How to return insurance at Sberbank? </h2><p>  The acquisition of a policy is often imposed by banks as a compulsory service.  After concluding a loan agreement, borrowers are interested in the following question: is it possible to return insurance to Sberbank, where to apply and what order is used for such a procedure. </p><p>  By entering into a loan agreement, customers do not receive a separate personal protection agreement.  In essence, they join the voluntary health and life insurance program.  A detailed procedure for reimbursement of risks and instructions on how to return insurance to Sberbank are published on the official website of this institution, they are periodically adjusted.  A client is charged for connecting to the system.  Therefore, it is most beneficial to contact a special company that specializes specifically in these services - Sberbank Life Insurance LLC. </p><p>  Before returning money for insurance at Sberbank, the client must write a statement.  It is provided by a bank branch employee.  As a rule, the borrower is provided with a template for filling out, but it is also possible to fill out an application in any form.  Below is a sample that you can focus on if necessary. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dolgi-net.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="will Sberbank loan insurance be returned" class="if uuid-3192223" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3192223.jpg"></div><p>  It should be noted that the statement contains all the necessary details: </p><ol><li>  To - the name of the insurance organization, address, name of the head, TIN, PSRN. </li><li>  From whom - the surname, initials of the borrower. </li><li>  Number of loan agreement and individual insurance policy. </li><li>  Applicant's signature, date of compilation. </li></ol><p>  The application is made in duplicate - one is handed over to the applicant with a note of the insurance organization on acceptance, the second remains with the insured and is stored until the resolution of the case. </p><p>  You can refuse to apply for a policy only in the case of an individual contract, but collective programs do not return. </p><h2>  Failure Rules </h2><p>  You can apply for compensation for the cost of insurance services on the basis of termination of the agreement at any time during the term of the contractual relationship.  It is not necessary to do this immediately after granting a loan or during the period of its repayment. </p><p>  In case of cancellation of the policy within a month after applying for a loan, the full amount is refundable.  In the case of filing a notice after the end of the specified period, it is possible to return no more than half of the paid cost before the end of the entire loan period. </p><p>  In case of <span>early repayment of a loan from Sberbank, it is</span> realistic to return insurance.  It should be noted that the protection period in this case is calculated as a multiple of the time spent on credit money.  When making early payments, the amount is proportionally reduced. </p><h2>  Documents required for return </h2><p>  The application for refusal must be submitted to the organization.  In order to return the loan insurance at Sberbank after repayment, you must provide the following list of documents: </p><ul><li>  a request in the appropriate form indicating the policy number and loan agreement, the name of the borrower; </li><li>  duplicate of the policy; </li><li>  copy of loan agreement and payment schedule; </li><li>  policyholder passport and its copy; </li><li>  statement on the absence of debts to the bank in case of repayment of the loan ahead of schedule. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.1stchoicemoney.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="can I return insurance on a loan at Sberbank" class="if uuid-3192311" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3192311.jpg"></div><p>  The process of receiving these important documents, as well as their consideration is carried out formally.  Insurers are not entitled to demand other papers from the borrower and an explanation of the reasons for terminating the contract.  In connection with the refusal, the banking organization does not have the right to present a notice on the repayment of the loan ahead of schedule. </p><h2>  Bank Responsibility </h2><p>  According to the law, it is forbidden to impose on the client protection of life, health, property.  For coercion to acquire it when lending, a financial institution may be involved in sanctions regulated by Art.  938 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation.  If an unsatisfactory decision is made on the issue of reimbursing the cost of the policy, the actions of the bank should be appealed to the prosecutor's office, Rospotrebnadzor and the court.  From the next paragraph, we learn whether it is possible to return insurance at Sberbank when repaying a loan ahead of schedule. </p><h2>  Repayment of a loan ahead of schedule </h2><p>  Such an event requires a separate consideration.  It should be noted that in case of early repayment of the loan, insurance can be returned to Sberbank much more simply than other cases.  What to do in this situation: </p><ol><li>  Filling out an application in the name of the insurance company for a refund (two copies). </li><li>  Attaching the necessary documents. </li><li>  Personal submission to the office of the insurance company or sending a statement by mail with a notice of delivery. </li></ol><p>  When submitting an application, you must personally verify that the company employee has put a mark on the acceptance of documents.  Then it remains only to wait for the receipt of funds in the current account. </p><div class="photo" data-original="news.abs-cbn.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="repay Sberbank insurance upon early repayment" class="if uuid-3192307" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3192307.jpg"></div><h2>  Dispute Resolution Procedure </h2><p>  Each client must know their legal rights and understand how to return loan insurance to Sberbank, including through the court.  In order to restore violated interests and rights, for example, if the protection of life and property has been imposed, it is imperative to comply with the pre-trial dispute settlement regime.  That is, in case of refusal to return insurance to Sberbank (both in full or in part), you should initially file a claim.  The document can be taken personally to the office of the insurer, through a representative operating on the basis of a power of attorney or by mail. </p><p>  If it is not possible to return insurance after receiving a loan at the established time, or if the institution leaves the claim without consideration at all, the borrower has the right to appeal to the court. </p>
