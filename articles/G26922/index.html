    <h2>  Sights of Sarapul </h2><p>  In Udmurtia, this is the second most economically developed settlement after Izhevsk.  The oldest <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãof the republic</span> has preserved to this day the historical center, the main decoration of which are rich merchant houses.  G. Sarapul has more than 150 buildings that are attributed to the architectural monuments of the XIX century. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This city is the birthplace of the legendary Nadezhda Durova, who during the war of 1812 was the orderly of Kutuzov.  In the vicinity of the city, the famous <span>Udmurt writer</span> I.G. Gavrilov was born, who became the founder of the Udmurt Opera and Ballet Theater.  Locals are proud that the famous Soviet actor <span>Oleg Zhakov</span> was born on their land <span>,</span> who gained fame after his work in films such as ‚ÄúWe are from Kronstadt‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Great Citizen‚Äù, ‚ÄúBaltic Deputy‚Äù. </p><h2>  Observation deck on Mount Ural </h2><p>  From here all excursion routes around the city usually begin.  The townspeople called Mount Ural a viewing platform with a stunning view of Sarapul.  Of course, calling the hill on which the site is equipped a mountain, the locals got a little excited, but at the same time the site became very popular.  People come here to enjoy the sunset, and couples in love meet the dawn here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="viewing platform on mount ural" class="if" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1348325.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Merchant houses </h2><p>  The tourist city is not Sarapul.  Nevertheless, its sights are of great interest to everyone who comes here on personal or official business. </p><p>  Bashinin's dacha is a magnificent snow-white building, which was erected in 1909, in the wooded part of the city.  P.A. Bashinin, a merchant, philanthropist, and respected resident of Sarapul, became its owner.  The project was developed by architect I. A. Charushin.  The building was decided to build in the Art Nouveau style, which at that time was very popular in Russia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="turret cottage" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1348323.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  An interesting feature of this building is a certain optical illusion: looking at it from afar, or looking at a photo, you will think that it is wooden.  In fact, it is built of stone, which imitates country wooden architecture.  After the death of P.A. Bashinin, the cottage was inherited by his younger brother Peter, who lived here until 1917. </p><p>  Then the mansion was nationalized.  It organized a sanatorium for street children, a surgical building, a tuberculosis dispensary, and even a commissariat.  Since 1991, the building, along with the park adjacent to it, was annexed to the Museum of History.  Restoration work was carried out here, and in 1995, the famous summer house opened its doors to visitors.  Today it is a very popular and recognizable landmark of the city. </p><h2>  House Koreshova </h2><p>  Sarapul has always been attractive to merchants.  The sights that have survived to this day only confirm that rich merchants simply competed, trying to build luxurious palaces for their families with incredible architectural delights. </p><p>  Timberman, public figure P.F. Koreshov also took part in this competition.  He commissioned the project to architect I.A. Charushin, and soon a mansion was built with scaly domes, forged weathercocks, and a magnificent facade finish.  This is a typical example of the Ural architecture of those times, which combines elements of neo-baroque and modern. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="g sarapul" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1348317.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The building housed both an office, living quarters and a shop.  On the plot there were utility structures.  After the revolution (1917), the building was nationalized.  For more than thirty years there has been a city council, then the Palace of Pioneers.  And today, the building was given to the city registry office. </p><h2>  Museum of History and Culture </h2><p>  If you want to learn more about how Sarapul developed and lived, you should start to see the sights from this museum.  Its construction was initiated by the city authorities in 1909.  Local residents actively supported this initiative.  They began to bring interesting things from their personal archives, many of which were of historical value. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sarapul sights" class="if" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1348322.jpg" width="570"></div>

    <p>  Over a long history, museum funds have increased.  Today, their collection is about 200 thousand rare exhibits.  A feature of this museum is the design of the hall - visitors enter the old city of Sarapul, with merchant shops, photographs of famous city dynasties, carved platbands and <span>wrought iron gates.</span> </p><h2>  Monument to N. Durova </h2><p>  This sculptural composition appeared in the city in the summer of 2014.  The monument to Nadezhda Durova in Sarapul was erected in honor of the bicentennial of the beginning of the European campaign of the Russian army, in which N. Durova took part.  In honor of her selfless service to the Fatherland in the city, it was decided to establish a sculpture by Vladimir Surovtsev, the people's artist of the Russian Federation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to Nadezhda Durova in Sarapul" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1348320.jpg" width="333"></div>

    <p>  <span>Nadezhda Durova</span> became the first hussar girl, the first female officer in Russia to take part in the battle of Borodino.  In Sarapul, she lived a little more than thirty years.  From here she went into the army, along with the Cossack regiment. </p><p>  Funds were allocated by the city authorities to create the monument, and by the City Day it was inaugurated.  The monument is located at the place where the old home of Hope once stood. </p><h2>  Church of Xenia of Petersburg </h2><p>  Lovers of religious architecture will also be interested in Sarapul.  Sights here are not as ancient as in many of our cultural centers, but nevertheless they are of historical value. </p><p>  The current church of Ksenia of Petersburg is located in the very center of the city.  It was built in 1911 and consecrated in the same year.  The building, built of burnt bricks, looks majestic - painted arches, domes sparkling in the sun, are perfectly preserved to this day.  Surprisingly, in Soviet times the temple was not closed, it remained one of the few active temples of the Volga region. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="g sarapul" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1348321.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Today, services are held in the church and are visited by believers in the city and its environs.  The territory is well-groomed and landscaped - flower beds are broken, benches are installed. </p><h2>  Fire Tower </h2><p>  This building in the city is often called the "old tower".  Fire tower is a unique attraction of the city.  There are two such structures in Russia - in the Omsk region and in Udmurtia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Fire Tower" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1352632.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Sarapul Kalancha was built in 1887 on behalf of the City Council.  Despite the past centuries, and today the construction looks very impressive, despite the fact that part of the building, dating to the end of the XIX century, has long been demolished.  The building was built on one of the highest points of the city - on Freedom Square.  It is distinguished by a pronounced centric composition.  The most famous part of the building is a fire tower nine-story high. </p>
