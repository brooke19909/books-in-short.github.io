They are suitable for any style of interior.  But fresh flowers are sometimes not freely available, and they will fade very soon.  So why not create artificial roses from corrugations with your own hands?  Yes, and huge!  This design of the premises is incredibly effective and absolutely affordable! </p><h2>  Unforgettable holiday decorated with growth flowers </h2><p>  Room decoration with giant flowers, among which you feel like Thumbelina, is becoming more and more popular and widespread.  Various celebrations, children's matinees, thematic photo shoots and even just the interior of shops are decorated with huge growth roses from corrugated paper, peonies from Thomas, sunflowers, poppies, etc. </p><div class="photo" data-original="handmadex.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flowerbed" class="if uuid-2593147" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2593147.jpg"></div><p>  Do you dream of a unique and unique wedding?  Create amazing corrugated paper accessories with your own hands that your guests will remember for a long time. </p><h2>  Necessary tools and materials </h2><p>  Before starting work on a rose from a corrugation, it is necessary to prepare: </p><ul><li>  corrugated paper for a flower (better than several shades close to each other, for example, dark pink, pink, light pink or white, cream, very light green); </li><li>  green corrugated paper; </li><li>  balloon; </li><li>  paper napkins; </li><li>  PVA glue; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  green tape; </li><li>  wire; </li><li>  a metal-plastic tube (1.5-2 cm in diameter) about 2 m long. </li><li>  solid spherical object, you can take the doll‚Äôs head. </li></ul><h2>  Create a giant do-it-yourself corrugated rose: workshop </h2><p>  The first step in our work will be the preparation of templates for the petals of two different shapes.  Cut them out of hard cardboard.  Now, according to this pattern, we cut our blanks from corrugated paper, making sure that the stripes of corrugations go along the petal.  The leaves of the flower we have 2 shapes: drops and hearts.  Teardrop-shaped need 8-10 pcs.  (4-5 pcs. of the darkest and medium shade), heart - 18-20 pcs.  (10 pieces of medium shade and the rest are the lightest).  Put them aside and begin to build a "receptacle" of our rose. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.litres.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="patterns for petals" class="if uuid-2593155" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2593155.jpg"></div><p>  Inflate a balloon somewhere to the size of your head.  We glue it with paper napkins using the papier-m√¢ch√© technique, it is better to choose napkins to match the color of the flower, but you can also take just white ones.  We are waiting for the glue to dry.  At this time, you can do the stem and leaves. </p><p>  Leaves are cut out of green corrugated paper in the amount of six pieces, adhering to their natural shape.  In the middle of the sheet, grease with glue and lay the wire.  We bend in half along the wire and put it under oppression.  We do the same manipulations with all the leaves.  After the glue has dried, we unfold them and wrap the wire 4-5 cm from the sheet with tape, twist together 3 wires and twist the tape together. </p><p>  The stem at our rose will be made of a metal-plastic pipe.  We wrap it with the same ribbon that was used in the manufacture of leaves, attaching the cuttings in the right places.  Bend the bottom into a ring for stability. </p><p>  Now back to the ball.  We cut the ball from napkins in half, put one half in the other and fasten them together.  Let's start giving the corrugated rose petals their natural shape.  Gently stretch the edges to make waves, and form the middle by pulling the petal over the head of the doll prepared in advance. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Let's start creating an inflorescence.  We glue the leaves from the center, starting with the narrowest and darkest, continuing in a circle with a slight offset relative to the previous petals and moving to a medium in color.  We continue by carefully filling the hemisphere.  The largest and brightest petals are pasted over the base from the outside. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="giant rose" class="if uuid-2593151" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2593151.jpg"></div><p>  From the bottom we glue a short tube made of cardboard or metal plastic, which is slightly wider in diameter than the stem.  This is necessary so that we can attach the flower head.  We glue the bottom with green paper and glue the sepals. </p><p>  We put the flower on the stem, straighten all the petals and a growth rose from corrugated paper is ready! </p><h2>  Paper flower: quick option </h2><p>  But not everyone has the patience and skills to create such a complex flower.  But how to make a big rose out of corrugation without spending a lot of time? </p><div class="photo" data-original="festima.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rose for Thumbelina" class="if uuid-2593131" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2593131.jpg"></div><p>  There is such a much simpler and faster way.  Take the red corrugated paper, cut the roll in half.  Expand and cut the edges on one side in the form of deep scallops.  Take a thick wire or metal-plastic pipe and paste over it with a green ribbon.  Now begin to wrap a strip of paper with scallops around the "stem", forming a flower.  Tie with a strong thread.  Glue the place of attachment with tape tape, adding sepals.  Twist the petals with a pencil, slightly stretch in the center.  That's all, it turned out the simplest rose in the manufacture of corrugation! </p>
