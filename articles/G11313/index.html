    <h2>  Hotel Description </h2><p>  The Cleopatra Life Hotel (Alanya) is one of the oldest in the resort.  It was built in the late nineties of the last century and was very popular among tourists.  However, over time, it noticeably dilapidated and lost part of its charm, so eleven years ago it was decided to completely renew the hotel and change its concept.  Thanks to the changes, Kleopatra Life Hotel 4 * four years ago received a new name and four stars.  Previously, he belonged to the average "three rubles".  Two years ago, the hotel was last renovated, turning it into a stylish and attractive complex for young people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since the hotel belongs to the urban category, one should not expect a huge territory with a large number of infrastructure facilities.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel is only one thousand eight hundred square meters. </p><p>  "Cleopatra Life" (Turkey) is a five-story building, which contains one hundred rooms.  With full occupancy, the hotel can accommodate a little more than two hundred people. </p>

    <h2>  Location of the hotel complex </h2><p>  The Cleopatra Life Hotel is located in Alanya, just one and a half kilometers from the resort center.  However, keep in mind that if you want to see the sights of Antalya, then you will have to travel more than a hundred kilometers.  On public transport, this will be quite problematic, so it is best to order a taxi for such a trip. </p><p>  Hotel Kleopatra Life is located within the city, so vacationers are quite easy to get to any of its points.  The reviews often indicate that due to the location of the hotel, its guests have the opportunity to walk around the resort and enjoy its attractions. </p><p>  From the international airport, you need to drive about fifty kilometers to the Cleopatra Life Hotel in Alanya.  You can use the group transfer from the meeting party or book in advance individual transport from the hotel complex. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The hotel is located close to the municipal beach.  In order to get to the sea, you must cross the road.  Walking usually does not take more than five minutes, so guests of the hotel complex consider it a very suitable option for a beach holiday. </p>

    <h2>  A bit about infrastructure </h2><p>  The hotel has long sought to get four stars, so its infrastructure is fully consistent with the declared status. </p><p>  The hotel has one restaurant and three bars.  In each institution you can get not only a full lunch or dinner, but also delicious snacks and a wide range of drinks. </p><p>  If one of the guests does not want to go to the beach after a hearty breakfast, then he can relax by the pool.  He is alone in the hotel and is very popular.  Around him posted sun loungers and tents from the sun. </p><p>  Those who come to the hotel not to relax, but to solve their business issues, will appreciate a cozy and well-equipped conference room.  It can accommodate forty people, and if desired, the hotel staff will hold any festive event for guests in the banquet hall. </p><p>  The hotel complex provides tourists with a 24-hour reception, where you can leave valuables in a safe, exchange currency or rent a car.  Free parking is available for vehicles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The hotel has a doctor‚Äôs office.  The specialist will examine the patient at any time of the day or night, and if necessary, prescribe medications for him or arrange hospitalization. </p><h2>  A few words about the level of service </h2><p>  The infrastructure of the Kleopatra Life 4 * hotel is highly appreciated by our compatriots.

    <h2>  Beach description </h2><p>  We have already mentioned more than once that the beach area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Cleopatra Life Hotel (Alanya) is municipal.  Therefore, tourists will have to pay for sunbeds and umbrellas.  On average, the cost of one deck chair varies between five dollars.  If you rent a place for several days at once, then you can get a discount. </p><p>  The beach belongs to the category of sand, but stones are still found here.  Reviews of the Cleopatra Life Hotel often mention the fact that the beach area is not too clean.  Numerous butts, candy wrappers from sweets and wrappers are lying on the sand.  This spoils the overall positive impression of the coast. </p><p>  However, the sea in this part of the resort is very clean, and the entry into the water is gentle.  On the very shore in many places there are large concrete slabs.  Entering them into the sea is rather inconvenient; in windy weather you can even injure your legs, as waves often overturn bathers. </p><h2>  Entertaining activities </h2><p>  Many tourists go to Turkish hotels for entertainment.  Kleopatra Life does not belong to those hotel complexes where they are ready to amuse their guests from morning till night.  Most of the time here is quite quiet, and guests craving for fun find him in the city. </p><p>  The hotel does not have animation, this is considered a plus by a significant portion of holidaymakers.  However, Cleopatra Life will not leave tourists without entertainment.  They have a special game room with chess, darts and cards.  If desired, guests can choose active sports such as, for example, volleyball and table tennis.  On the beach, vacationers will be offered water activities, but you will need to pay for them.  Once a week during dinner, the hotel hosts a festive show program, which includes dancing and live music. </p>

    <h2>  Kleopatra Life: room description </h2><p>  The hotel complex provides guests with two types of rooms: standard and family.  The differences between them are only in the possible number of guests.  Three people can be accommodated in the standard, and four in the family room. </p><p>  Each is equipped with air conditioning, satellite TV and a telephone.  The apartments are equipped with a safety deposit box and a minibar.  When you check in, there are sweet carbonated drinks and drinking water.  Maids replenish water supplies daily during cleaning. </p><p>  Bathrooms are equipped differently.  Some rooms have showers, while others have a floor-mounted shower.  The toilet is usually located very close to the soul, which creates a certain inconvenience to vacationers. </p><p>  All apartments have balconies with a set of garden furniture.  If you want to drink tea or coffee in the evening, then you do not have to go down to the bar.  For these purposes, there is a tea set in the room. </p>

It is designed for the simultaneous landing of two hundred people.  The restaurant starts its work at eight in the morning, and the last visitors should leave it by midnight. </p><p>  Bars are located in different places on the territory of the hotel complex and operate according to their own schedule: </p><ul><li>  the pool bar opens at ten in the morning, and closes with the pool at six in the evening; </li><li>  the beach bar can accommodate two hundred guests and has an operating mode identical to the previous institution; </li><li>  the bar, combined with a cafe, is open until two in the morning and is designed for a hundred people. </li></ul><p>  Keep in mind that sometimes the working hours of establishments change. </p><h2>  additional information </h2><p>  The hotel is recommended for families without children.  It will be very comfortable for young people and couples who want to actively spend their holidays.  The most popular months in the hotel complex are July, August and October.

    <h2>  Negative moments of rest in the hotel </h2><p>  Immediately I want to note that there are very few negative reviews about Cleopatra Life.  From them we found out the disadvantages of this hotel complex: </p><ul><li>  small and cramped rooms; </li><li>  the inability to leave the air conditioner on when leaving the apartment; </li><li>  thin walls; </li><li>  lack of air conditioning in the restaurant; </li><li>  the inability to occupy anything with children. </li></ul><p>  The last item on the list, however, is difficult to attribute to the shortcomings of the hotel.  After all, he initially positions himself as a complex where only adults will be comfortable. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  Most of the hotel guests write that they would like to come here one more time.  Of the advantages, they distinguish the following points: </p><ul><li>  cleanliness in the rooms and on the premises; </li><li>  convenient location relative to the city center; </li><li>  delicious food; </li><li>  fast working internet; </li><li>  staff attitude; </li><li>  high-quality cleaning in the apartment; </li><li>  proximity to the sea. </li></ul><p>  In general, the hotel receives high marks from tourists, so it can be safely recommended for the first and subsequent trips to Turkey. </p>
