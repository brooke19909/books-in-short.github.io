    <p>  Several approaches are used to define the concept of ‚Äúconfederation‚Äù.  Traditionally, this term characterizes an independent form of state structure, in which the countries that form it retain independence, have their own <span>governing bodies</span> and state authorities.  According to another approach, confederation is a self-sufficient form that should be considered within the framework of federalism. </p><p>  Adherents of the traditional understanding of the term indicate that the states included in the structure form special united bodies designed to coordinate actions in the presence of certain goals (foreign policy, military).  Thus, a confederation is a union of states that retain their sovereignty in full. </p><p>  In addition to the fact that the members of the state union remain inviolable, the national police, the monetary system, the army and other structures often remain unchanged.  Confederation is usually a temporary phenomenon.  This union arises for a short period, in order to solve any social problems.  These tasks may consist in uniting efforts in any area of ‚Äã‚Äãsociety: politics (internal or external), art or culture, military affairs, economics and more.  Usually, the confederation does not have its own regulatory and management bodies.  As a rule, control, supervisory or advisory structures are formed. </p><p>  The Federation and Confederation have historically come together.  However, in practice the second is extremely rare. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  According to some authors, a confederation is a transitional form of <span>the state</span> system.  Most often this is why it exists for a short period.  So, for example, the Confederation of the States of the South of America arose in 1861. </p><p>  Along with this, there is an opinion that this form can subsequently become quite common.  In particular, it can become a constructive model of the device in the conditions of the collapse of major powers that had external signs of a federation (such as the USSR). </p><p>  Thus, the union of states with independence is united on the basis of an agreement on the coordination of actions on a certain range of problems.  As a rule, issues are resolved in the field of defense, customs tariffs and the postal system, and foreign policy. </p><p>  There are other signs of confederation that distinguish it from other systems of government. </p><p>  For example, the bodies of an formed union do not have a direct impact on its constituent countries.  In most cases, these bodies take their decisions in accordance with consensus between parties interested in any issue.  Moreover, the actual entry into force of decisions occurs after they are approved by the authorities in the respective states. </p><p>  The Confederation, as a rule, does not have a single tax and legal system.  However, in this <span>form of government</span> can be created one economic space, introduced a single currency and the institution of common citizenship. </p><p>  In a confederation, <span>legislative power is</span> most often represented by bicameral assemblies owned by its subjects.  There is no own legislative body in this structure.  Instead, the Allied Council, endowed with limited powers, acts.  It should be noted that in the modern world most often the confederation is perceived not as a type of government, but as just a community of states with complete independence.  And this alliance is created with specific goals.  Thus, it is believed that the confederation is more an international legal entity than a form of government. </p>
