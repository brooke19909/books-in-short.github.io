We are being watched by video cameras on every corner, in every office, our computers and even our phones are watching.  This makes us feel insecure.  Something close to panic reigns in society: a person has lost the right to personal space and personal life.  But here‚Äôs the paradox: few people have the tempting thought that finding people by phone number is not such a bad thing. </p>

    <h2>  Why keep an eye on a person? </h2><p>  But who knows why?  One of the most popular purposes of this not entirely ethical invention is the surveillance of husbands for wives and wives for husbands.  Jealousy will not push it.  But there is a very useful side to the question of how to track a person by <span>phone number.</span>  For example, it is very important for parents to know the whereabouts of the child - whether he left school, whether he is at home while his mother and father are working. </p><p>  A service by which you can find a person‚Äôs location by phone number can be useful in an extreme situation, for example, if a loved one is in the place where the natural disaster occurred.  And without any disasters, no one can forbid worrying about their loved ones. </p>

    <h2>  Phone to help you </h2><p>  All three major mobile operators in Russia, without any ethical problems, help those who want to track a person by <span>phone number.</span>  Megafon, Beeline and MTS connect this service with equal ease, with a difference in name and short numbers only.  But in all cases, the subscriber must inform the operator of his intention, choose a tariff plan, and a monthly fee will be regularly charged from his account.  In addition, it is impossible to activate the service without SMS coming to the phone of the person for whom control is being established.  Moreover, he must respond to this request with consent.  But many people manage to safely circumvent this moment by secretly getting the handset of a loved one in their hands.  Details of how to determine the location of a person by phone number using a specific mobile operator - hereinafter. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Opportunities "Megaphone" </h2><p>  This operator has several tariff plans, according to which you can determine where the current family member is.  So, the ‚ÄúMayachok‚Äù service helps to locate the child, and parents are happy to install it on children's phones.  This is a fully justified measure in our troubled times, which is why many schools introduce electronic cards that record the student's arrival and departure, electronic diaries that help parents monitor his progress online. </p><p>  Let us return to how to track a person by phone number on the Megafon network.  Another service can be called not only useful, but also necessary, as it is specially designed for installation on the numbers of elderly parents so that you can be in touch with them at the time of illness or any other problems. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="track a person by phone number" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13387/378479.jpg?1398026994047"></div>

    <p>  The third tariff can be called ordinary - it allows you to determine the location of a person by phone number so that he himself does not know about it.  You can use this service online, on the company's website, in the "Locator" tab.  Here or on your mobile application, it is enough to find a map on which you can determine the location of the desired phone number.  Of course, this is only available to those who have the service activated. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  What does Beeline offer </h2><p>  This network operator is more concise.  You can determine the person‚Äôs phone number by sending one letter to the short number ‚Äú684‚Äù - ‚ÄúL‚Äù.  The inconvenience for the seeker is that the consent of the wanted subscriber is required to be obtained with each call.  Of course, not everyone wants to be ‚Äúon the hook‚Äù, and many simply block their SIM cards.  Another option is to make an open call to 06849924. You will have to pay relatively little for the service - 2.5-5 rubles.  So after all, this is not a permanent service, but a one-time service, which is activated only for the duration of a call between phones. </p><p>  Beeline Coordinates is a new network service.  It allows you to connect five users at once, with their consent, of course, and if necessary, specify their location.  You can connect it yourself or in any communication salon for free, and using it during the first week is also free.  Subsequently, the cost of using the service will be 1 RUB.  70 kopecks  daily. </p><h2>  Search with MTS </h2><p>  One of the most popular and absolutely legal services of this operator is ‚ÄúA child under supervision‚Äù.  To activate the service, you need to send an SMS with the word "mom" or "dad" to the number "7788".  Follow the requirements of the answering machine in steps - and for two weeks the child is supervised, moreover, for free.  And then the service will cost 50 rubles every month. </p><p>  The corporate communications package that MTS provides to organizations and private firms is in high demand.  By connecting this service, the head through GPS sees his whole team, in full view.  This is a very useful option for tracking cargo transportation, logistics routes. </p>

    <h2>  USSD request </h2><p>  This is another method for tracking a person by phone number.  The call should be from a cell phone.  You need to type the characters in the following sequence: * 148 * / number of the wanted person (via the code +7) / call.  The subscriber receives an SMS notification, to which he must respond with consent.  In this case, a message arrives with the coordinates of the person.  You must confirm your request at the end by sending an SMS with your phone number to the service number "000888".  At the same time, 5 rubles are debited from the account. </p><h2>  How to track a person by phone number using the "Locator" </h2><p>  MTS and Megafon have a common service, known as Locator.  To connect it, an appropriate tariff plan is purchased.  In addition, it cannot be activated without the consent of the subscriber whose movement is supposed to be controlled.  From his number you need to send a confirmation of consent to SMS.  After that, if necessary, you need to send SMS with the monosyllabic text ‚ÄúWhere‚Äù to the short number ‚Äú6677‚Äù.  The answer will come in a few minutes.  Payment of 10 rubles occurs in fact for each use of the function. </p>

    <h2>  A word in defense of freedom of movement </h2><p>  Most services that allow you to track the coordinates of a person require the consent of the subscriber to monitor him.  Except for children and old parents, it is unlikely that many will voluntarily subscribe to such a "shortening."  This is at least unpleasant.  The man himself must control who is allowed to "follow him on the heels" in the virtual sense of the word.  For each "Locator" craftsmen find ways to block the service.  And there is no doubt that in the near future the world will be surprised at new inventions both in the field of surveillance and anti-tracking. </p><h2>  And again about ethics and the rule of law </h2><p>  There is surveillance of a person authorized by law enforcement agencies.  In this case, the location of a person by phone number will be tracked using special tools.  And there are times when a person is missing or is wanted.  In any case, tracking requires authorization, without which the actions of any services are illegal. </p><p>  Everyone asks himself the question of ethical surveillance of someone.  Is it really necessary to question all the actions of a loved one?  Not trusting a husband or wife, children or friends, suspecting them of everything, you can only destroy the relationship.  Yes, and yourself from the inside.  And if it turns out to convict someone - then we must still live with this truth ... Although ... let everyone decide for himself. </p>
