The sights of this cozy town annually attract many fans of a calm and measured rest from around the world. </p><p>  <strong>A small digression into history</strong> </p><p>  People in the place where modern Protaras is located have settled for a long time.  Back in ancient Greece, the Lefkola policy was founded in a small but convenient harbor.  It is in these parts in the I century BC.  e.  the Macedonian Demetrius I Poliorket was defeated by the Egyptian satrap Ptolemy.  But time left almost nothing from the ancient city with the exception of small ruins.  Excavations of the ancient city of Kourion, which was almost completely destroyed as a result of a powerful earthquake in the 4th century BC, are still being carried out in the vicinity of Protaras.  e. </p><p>  As for modern history, after the war in 1974, Cyprus was divided into two parts - Turkish and Greek.  As a result, that part of the island where Protaras is located had to be restored almost from scratch.  But because of the old buildings, which are famous for most other famous resorts, there are not so many.  Virtually devoid of historical monuments of architecture Protaras, the sights of which were created in our time, it is worth noting, it did not become worse from this.  Those who are going on vacation in this small Mediterranean town, there is always something to see. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="protaras sights" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12502/275229.jpg" width="600"></div>

This temple, which rises on one of the rock fragments, looks especially beautiful in the dark, when it is illuminated with special lighting.  During the day, the site offers simply stunning views of the sea and the coast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of protaras on the map" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12502/275228.jpg" width="350"></div>

    <p>  By the way, in order to admire the beauties of nature, it is better to go to the nearby Cape Greco, known for its white sand beaches and famous sea caves.  And in the depths of the island is the Valley of <span>Windmills,</span> which are used to supply water for irrigation of nearby fields. </p><p>  The Chapel of the Blessed Virgin Mary is another <span>architectural monument</span> that Protaras is famous for.  The sights you can see here are a collection of porcelain plates dating from the 18th century.  There is also a museum of <span>Byzantine culture.</span> </p><p>  Walking around the city center, you can‚Äôt ignore the local History Museum, where you can look at an interesting collection of carriages, pottery and toys.  It is also worth a visit to the Folk Art Museum, famous for its collection of furniture, copper products, costumes, artisans tools. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is worthwhile to especially pay attention to the Show of <span>Dancing Fountains,</span> which is especially popular with all tourists arriving in Cyprus.  Protaras, whose map of attractions is not replete with famous architectural monuments, still attracts visitors from all over the island.  More than 18 thousand jets driven by powerful pumps, illuminated by searchlights and controlled by advanced computer systems, create a unique holiday feeling.  You can admire this amazing sight for hours. </p><p>  All sorts of holidays and festivals are held annually in Protaras.  The most colorful of them is the Apocreo Carnival, which takes place in late winter - early spring.  Almost all of July is a solid Art Festival, and a week in September is a Wine Festival. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cyprus protaras map of attractions" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12502/275227.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  On the streets of Protaras there are many small cafes, restaurants, pubs where you can taste national dishes or drink local wine.  Although it is worth noting that the vibrant nightlife characteristic of most Cypriot cities is not about Protaras.  The resort's attractions are local nature and the sea, where you can not only swim, but also dive to enjoy the beauty of the underwater world, which is unusually diverse. </p>
