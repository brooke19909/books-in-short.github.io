Greek land carries the spirit of past greatness, and numerous architectural monuments reflect a rich history.  The sights of Greece, created by human hands and nature itself, made its appearance unique. </p><h2>  Priceless Antique Monuments </h2><p>  The sunny country is a large-scale archaeological site.  Populated from prehistoric times, it arouses the interest of scientists, since traces of human civilization are found throughout its territory.  Millions of tourists rush here to immerse themselves in the atmosphere of past eras, get acquainted with priceless monuments, feel their greatness.  And the skill of the restorers allows each guest to see historical objects that have become a real legend and to learn their rich history. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wanderlust.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sights of sunny Greece" class="if uuid-2418488" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2418488.jpg"></div><p>  In our article we will tell you that it is a must-see in Greece for tourists who want to combine holidays in resorts and visit unique sights. </p><h2>  Athens business card </h2><p>  Famous objects are concentrated in the heart of the ancient world, causing the keen interest of travelers.  For many tourists, the country of fascinating myths is associated with the Acropolis of Athens.  In Greece, the so-called well-fortified place of temple constructions was called, and in each city there was a similar hill.  However, the heritage of all mankind is located on a rock historical monument in Athens. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="blog.only-apartments.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Acropolis - a world masterpiece of architecture" class="if uuid-2418472" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2418472.jpg"></div><p>  People who lived before our era built a fortress here, in which they took refuge during long wars.  After a fierce battle with the Persians, a new construction of the historical center began under the leadership of the outstanding orator and ruler Pericles.  The modern look of the unique sights of Greece has developed over 23 centuries ago.  The French conquerors built a huge castle at the entrance to the largest temple complex, and the Turks rebuilt the buildings several centuries ago, turning them into mosques.  However, now all the traces left by the invaders are destroyed, and every traveler admires the amazing beauty of Athens' visiting card.  Thanks to the laborious work of the restorers, the buildings appear in their original form and amaze both with the intricate labyrinths of the corridors and the high snow-white columns. </p><h2>  Past immersion </h2><p>  The pearl of world architecture for a long time has been a significant place for the residents of the city.  The history of the monumental structure is closely intertwined with Greek mythology.  The unique Athenian Acropolis (Greece), allowing you to dive deep into the millennia, stands on a sacred hill that rises above the city.  Brilliant architects connected the powerful walls of the colossal complex with the slopes of the mountains into a single whole, giving the area a harmonious completeness. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The main temple of ancient Athens </h2><p>  The majestic construction of the sanctuary in the VI century turned into a Christian temple.  The Parthenon is located in the heart of the historic center.  Dedicated to the goddess Athena, who gave her name to the city, it is the most famous building of the ancient complex and the most visited. </p><p>  Parthenon Temple in Greece, built of expensive marble, surprises even modern travelers who have seen a lot in their path.  From afar, it seems rather small, but as it approaches, it seems to grow in front of visitors.  The talented creator of the project, the brilliant architect of that time, Iktin used optical illusions, trying to capture the imagination of the ancient Greeks.  The temple seems straightforward, but in fact in its architecture all the details have a slight slope.  And even the upper part of the steps bends in the center, and it seems to visitors that the stairs are absolutely flat.  Researchers have even come up with a special term for a system of bumps and curvatures - the Parthenon Curvature. </p><p>  In the center of the legendary monument of ancient architecture stood a tall statue of the patroness of the city, and her spear and helmet were visible even from the sailing ships.  The eleven meter monument, made of gold and ivory, has not been preserved to this day. </p><h2>  Temple complex </h2><p>  Behind the main gate began, the so-called Propylaea - quaint buildings with columns, immersing in the world of the mysterious sights of Greece.  There was also the temple of Niki Apteros, the wingless goddess. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.touropia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The Majestic Parthenon" class="if uuid-2418443" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2418443.jpg"></div><p>  Next to the Parthenon is the Erechtheion, which was a treasury of various relics and a venue for religious rites.  The beautiful temple dedicated to Athena, Poseidon and King Erechteus underwent extensive restoration, since during the country's struggle for independence the building was completely destroyed. </p><h2>  Visitors reviews </h2><p>  As recognized by tourists who visited a well-preserved architectural ensemble during a fascinating many-hour excursion in Greece, they really seemed to meet face to face with ancient Hellas.  It seems as if one of the long-known myths comes to life right in front of amazed guests.  A fabulous place is amazing, evoking in memory long-forgotten images familiar from the school curriculum.  This journey is not only in modern, but also in ancient Greece.  Despite the ruthlessness of time, the great architectural monument has not lost its greatness. </p><h2>  The highest mountain in the country </h2><p>  Another symbol of Greece is the legendary peak - the abode of powerful gods.  A popular attraction of Greece, the description of which is presented in the article, is located near the city of Thessaloniki, in the historical region of Thessaly.  This is a huge array of snow-covered main peaks. </p><p>  The height of Mount Olympus in Greece is 2918 meters.  It is determined by the main peak - Michikasu.  The former abode of the gods is studied by archaeologists who in the 60s of the last century discovered the temple of Zeus himself with ancient statues, the sanctuary of Apollo and the tomb of Orpheus.  Here is the existing monastery of St. Dionysius, which appeared in the XVI century.  And next to it is a cave in which the Athenian thinker has been for a long time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripsavvy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mount Olympus (Greece)" class="if uuid-2418483" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2418483.jpg"></div><h2>  Mountain climbing </h2><p>  Mount Olympus is declared a national reserve, archaeological site and part of the natural heritage of the world.  Hiking trails and roads lead to its top.  Those who wish can spend the night at the mountain base, enjoying a wonderful sight.  Judging by the reviews, the ascent and descent as part of a group, accompanied by an experienced guide, remain in the memory of tourists forever.  At the peak of Mitikas, everyone signs in a special magazine and takes stunning photos.  A breathtaking experience pays for any price for a guided tour in Greece.  And those who believe in miracles and still adore ancient Greek myths respond with great admiration to the adventure, because the wonderful view from the picture appears in reality. </p><h2>  Holy Land </h2><p>  The UNESCO-protected spiritual center of Orthodoxy is considered one of the most mysterious places on our planet.  Not only pilgrims from all over the world seek to get to this Greek peninsula, but also ordinary travelers who have heard about the miracles that happen in the holy land covered with legends.  The eastern part of the Halkidiki peninsula, washed by the waters of the Aegean Sea, is the main stronghold of East Christian monasticism.  The holy Mount Athos (Greece) attracts all Orthodox who have both material and spiritual needs. </p><p>  Christian legend says that the ship of the Virgin Mary during the storm nailed precisely on the coast of the peninsula, the beauty of which astonished the Mother of God so much that she prayed to the Lord to leave her this land.  God agreed to grant her request, calling Athos the "pier of salvation."  Since then, all women have been prohibited from visiting the mountain, and men of any faith will have to obtain special permission. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.touropia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mount Athos, monasteries" class="if uuid-2418442" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2418442.jpg"></div><p>  Now there are 20 monasteries, in which approximately 1800 monks live.  In addition, numerous hermitages are scattered on the territory, which differ from the cloisters in their status.  The way of life of people living on the mountain does not obey worldly laws.  Their souls are inspired by thoughts of eternal life, and none of them seek material wealth.  A few decades ago, the monastic republic ruled by the Holy Kinot was inaccessible to Russian pilgrims.  And now our compatriots came here to bow to the shrines and receive spiritual help. </p><h2>  What do tourists say? </h2><p>  Many tourists who visited Athos say that they changed their lives after exploring this amazing place.  Some are even so impressed by what they saw that they decide to quit everything and settle in the holy land, having accepted monasticism.  The religious landmark of Greece is entirely devoted to prayers and service to the Lord.  A pacifying bright place marked by a seal of high purity is always open to the world, and only here Orthodoxy appears in all its diversity.  A small piece of land is recognized as a genuine spiritual school that cleanses the soul of a person and makes him radically change. </p><h2>  Palace of the Grand Masters (Rhodes) </h2><p>  One of the most beautiful architectural monuments of the world is located in the capital of the island of Rhodes.  A delightful masterpiece created by medieval engineers appeared in the XIV century on the site of the destroyed citadel.  The impressive building, built according to the laws of fortification art, has turned into the main residence of the masters of the Order of St. John.  However, soon the knights fleeing the warlike Turks left the island.  The invaders turned the palace, more reminiscent of a powerful fortress, into a prison. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thousandwonders.net" data-author=": Jorge L√°scar, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Palace of the Grand Masters (Rhodes)" class="if uuid-2418462" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2418462.jpg"></div><p>  Only at the beginning of the 20th century, when Rhodes moved to Italy, did the new owners return the sights, emphasizing the power and influence of the knightly brotherhood, to their former gloss.  The restored building today is a famous museum, which presents unique relics.  Visitors will be able to see only 24 of the 200 halls. But even this is enough to understand the scale of the magnificent structure and appreciate the luxury of the interior.  Marble sculptures, antique furniture, beautiful vases, colorful murals on the walls, bright mosaics on the floor make an indelible impression. </p><h2>  Visitors reviews </h2><p>  Visitors to the museum seem to be transported to the Middle Ages, when knightly tournaments were organized, and valiant warriors thundered with their armor.  Summoning associations with something mystical and mysterious, the fortress amazes with both power and beauty.  It seems that a small city can fit inside.  Tourists who plunge into the past admire the architectural complex that has preserved its greatness.  And the museum‚Äôs curious expositions do not leave anyone indifferent. </p><h2>  Miraculous Underground Monument </h2><p>  On the island of Kefalonia there is a natural miracle - cave lake Melissani.  In Greece, he is considered one of the most beautiful miraculous monuments.  An underground attraction that was once used for religious rites, formed more than 20 thousand years ago.  During a major earthquake, the dome of the cave collapsed, and now the sun's rays penetrate through a kind of window, illuminating the water surface with bright light and coloring it in the most incredible shades - from light turquoise to dark. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Tourists sailing in a boat, it seems as if they are hovering over a miraculous masterpiece, the water in which is incredibly clear.  You can even see the rocky bottom, as well as how small fish splash.  It is best to come here on a clear day, when the azure waters shimmering in the sun's rays fascinate with magical beauty. </p><p>  All lovers must lower their hands into the underground lake so that their love is happy.  And lonely travelers wash themselves with clean water in order to finally find their happiness. </p><div class="photo" data-original="carmensluxurytravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cave Lake Melissani" class="if uuid-2418447" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2418447.jpg"></div><p>  If you want to not only have a good rest, but also get acquainted with the rich heritage of the state, go to Greece, where "everything is there!"  The Orthodox country, on the earth of which great heroes and Olympic gods walked, preserved the mystery of antiquity and the carelessness of modernity. </p>
