    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Cretan Kalypso Cretan Village is located in a town called Plakias.  A little less than 50 years ago there were about a dozen houses.  But now Plakias has become a popular resort, famous for its pristine beaches, amazingly beautiful nature and proximity to all sights. </p><p>  If you look at the hotel from above, it may seem that it seemed to have grown out of a cliff.  Indeed, the complex is located on a hill, surrounded by lush flowering vegetation, in close proximity to the quiet beach of Caravos.  From here to Rethymnon, which is one of the most beautiful Cretan cities, can be reached in 30-40 minutes.  The airport, however, is far away - the nearest is 115 kilometers away (located in Heraklion).  But in 15 minutes you can drive to the Frangokastello fortress, which was built in the XIV century. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Facilities and service </h2><p>  Cretan Kalypso Cretan Village has everything you need for comfort.  On the territory there is a minimarket, a hall for conferences and banquets, a souvenir shop.  It offers free Wi-Fi and a shuttle service (both in the city and to / from the airport).

    <h2>  About service </h2><p>  4 * reviews left about Kalypso Cretan Village make it possible to understand whether the hotel is really as good as the description and photos show.  Most of the comments are positive, which is not surprising.  After all, the hotel offers really good conditions at affordable prices. </p><p>  Guests say that cleaning is daily, not superficial, towels are changed with the same regularity.  Still here they give out one for the beach - but on bail.  In the end, when the guest passes the towel, the money is returned in the same currency and in the same amount, all honestly. </p><p>  In general, in this small Cretan village, in the form of which the hotel was made and decorated, there are a lot of advantages.  Almost no children come here, so it is very quiet here.  Here is a nice and polite staff who are always ready to help with advice or recommendation.  More attentive and fast waiters in restaurants, not forcing their customers to wait a long time for an order.  And, by the way, very tasty food, as people assure.  All in abundance.  And each dish is incredibly tasty, high-quality and fresh.  Seafood, an abundance of meat, vegetables, fruits, pickles, fish and much more. </p><p>  By the way, there is where to take a walk.  Many recommend going down the concrete path towards Plakias.  From there, those species are opened that are able to amaze the imagination.  But the path ends in a dead end.  However, for a walk and the idea to take some beautiful photos - that's it.  Otherwise, you can go along another path that begins behind the beach, with handrails and steps.  If you walk along it, you can go to the spacious sandy beach with taverns. </p>
