    <h2>  The popularity of smartphones </h2><p>  To begin with, in the modern market segment of mobile devices it is almost impossible to find a phone just for making calls.  The trend of increasing the production of smartphones is growing rapidly.  These gadgets are no longer just phones, but a whole electronic complex with a diverse set of functions.  Even the simplest of them support a variety of services and applications that allow their owner to have a miniature computer in his pocket.  At the moment, this market is confidently divided between two large companies - this is American Apple and Korean Samsung.  Here are what phones are now in fashion overwhelmingly!  If the Korean manufacturer has budget options for gadgets, then this can not be said about the "apple" products.  Of course, in society they pay attention to what device you use.  Cheap devices are visible to the naked eye.  However, focusing on fashion trends, you can pretty much empty your wallet.  After all, the news of mobile electronics is very expensive. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Battle of the Giants: Apple or Samsung </h2><p>  Products of a California company are always in steady demand, despite the high cost.  Indeed, these phones are, by and large, fashionable.  A person with the latest Apple gadget model can always be called a mod in the field of mobile technology.  It's like having Gucci shoes and Dolce &amp; Gabbana jeans!  Korean models are also popular.  But the materials that are used in the production of these phones (even at the top level) somewhat lower their value for those consumers for whom it is important to impress first of all.  A mobile phone, fashionable today in almost the whole world, is the Iphone-5S.  Samsung galaxy-S4 is also among the fashion innovations of smartphones.  Its sales are even slightly higher than that of its competitor, nevertheless, the reputation of the American product is a bit, but still better. </p>

    <h2>  Other brands </h2><p>  But these two brands do not exhaust the list of popular products of the mobile market.  What phones are in fashion besides the above?  There are a lot of such tubes.  In general, if we are talking about the reputation of a particular manufacturer, then you can always rely on devices from Sony and Nokia.  These are always fashionable phones.  Photos of these and many other devices are presented in large numbers in stores, the Internet and television advertising.  Of course, the <span>prestige of these</span> handsets is slightly lower than the products of the two largest players in the mobile market.  However, this is ideal if you are limited in means, and you want to impress others.  These devices confidently occupy the position of middle peasants in the line of smartphones.  Also, the products of a Taiwanese company, known under the HTC brand, burst into this list of common, and hence fashionable, mobile devices. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Products from the Middle Kingdom </h2><p>  Recently, more and more positions in the market of cell phones are gained by Chinese manufacturers.  In Russia, a rather mixed attitude to all products manufactured in this country.  We must pay tribute to Chinese businessmen - the quality of goods there has significantly improved.  This is evidenced by their swift penetration into foreign markets and popularity among the population.  What phones are now in fashion from Chinese gadgets?  The question can be answered with confidence that these are Huawei and Oppo.  Two leaders deliberately implement an ambitious plan to conquer the market and try to move the leaders.  I must say, they succeed to a certain extent.  Mobile devices of these brands already have their fans, even in America.  In terms of price and quality, they are an ideal option.  Although these phones are not yet as famous as those mentioned above, they have every chance of becoming a fashion accessory in the very near future. </p>

    <h2>  Luxury Brand </h2><p>  And finally, which phones are now in fashion with money bags?  Vertu is the undisputed leader in impressing others.  The prestige of this tube needs no comment.

These mobile phones are made of gold, platinum and other precious metals.  They can be decorated with various valuable stones, have a top-level electronic base.  On average, the opportunity to boast of such a novelty will cost the owner 62 thousand euros.  Therefore, the release of these devices is limited. </p>
