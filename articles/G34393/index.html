Egypt annually receives thousands of armies of travelers from around the world, including from our country.  This country is primarily interesting for those who crave new experiences.  And in Egypt, tourists receive almost the "sea", both in direct and figurative meanings.  After all, buying even the most economical tour, almost all travelers get a bonus for free the amazing Red Sea with its unique underwater world, as well as the opportunity to see with their own eyes, for example, the same pyramids.

    <h2>  All inclusive </h2><p>  In the past few years, ‚Äúall-inclusive‚Äù has become a familiar concept for Russians traveling to Egypt on holiday.  Like their Turkish counterparts, hotels in this country also offer an affordable menu with a varied buffet and a large selection of alcoholic beverages, though locally produced.  However, with a more detailed study of the concept of the all-inclusive scheme, many understand that Turkish and Egyptian all inclusive are somewhat different. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Our compatriots rest system "eat, drink, walk, without spending a single penny in place" is quite popular.  However, if in Turkey this scheme works flawlessly and clearly, then many should know that when they come to Egypt, they will get "all inclusive" with some "pitfalls". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Faraana heights 4" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/726984.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Firstly, most hotels in this country have one weak point - food.  Therefore, not all even the most upscale hotels can guarantee a wide range of food.  In addition, the concept of "all inclusive" in Egypt is not proposed according to a single approach developed for the country.  For example, some hotels offer free water activities, while you have to pay for classes in the gym or for fitness. </p><p>  Sometimes four-star hotels, such as Faraana Heights (Sharm-El-Sheikh), have a more complete range of all-inclusive services than luxury fives.  In general, many hotels working on this concept are located in this resort. </p><h2>  Sharm El Sheikh </h2><p>  Many believe that this modern and very dynamic tourist center located on the Sinai Peninsula is not exactly Egypt.  The numerous hotels built here, including the four-star Faraana Heights, are as Europeanized as possible.  Therefore, they provide much better services and have better conditions for relaxation than hotels in other <span>resorts in Egypt.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Most <span>hotels in Sharm El Sheikh</span> have a large territory and a highly developed infrastructure.  A significant advantage for many is the presence of their own beach on this coral plateau. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Egypt all inclusive" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/726986.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Today, Sharm el-Sheikh among the Russians is considered the ideal place to relax.  There are very affordable prices, a fairly high service.  In addition, the resort is only four hours from the capital from the capital, and the dry and warm climate, much more calm compared to, for example, Hurghada, makes it possible to visit the resort year-round. </p><p>  Another advantage of this Egyptian city, most visited by our compatriots, is that there is a fairly wide variety of prices for accommodation, as well as an abundance of excellent restaurants with any cuisine and entertainment, for example, jeep safaris, camel watching the sunset.  But the biggest plus of Sharm el-Sheikh is his vibrant nightlife.  Discos, clubs, casinos in the evenings are packed to capacity.  The same can be said about hotels, tours in which are sold out in high season instantly.  And one of them is the four-star El Faraana Heights. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  The hotel was built in Sharm El Sheikh in the northern part of its Nabq Bay area.  The famous promenade-promenade Naama Bay is twenty kilometers away from it. </p><p>  The resort's international airport is just ten minutes away.  This is especially convenient for those Russians who come to rest with young children.  I must say that there are a lot of those at the hotel, since such a short transfer is very convenient for kids who do not tolerate the road. </p><p>  Faraana Heights is considered one of the most extreme in the resort of Sharm El Sheikh, behind it there is only a highway in the direction of Dahab.  The hotel was built in 2010.  It is part of the King Snefro Group hotel chain.  The territory on which this four-star hotel is built is sixty-four square meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Faraana heights reviews" class="if" height="311" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/726988.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  It consists of the main building, where the registration desk is located and where you must approach during check-in, as well as a complex of two- and three-story bungalows built in an unusual Andalusian style for the region. </p><p>  The territory on which the hotel is built is located on a certain elevation from the general level of the coast.  Therefore, the windows of the rooms offer a magnificent panorama of the Red Sea and the famous Nabq Bay.  The hotel is separated from the beach by a road. </p><p>  The territory of Faraana Heights (Sharm) is fully equipped.  Everywhere there are fountains, ponds, nooks where residents can sit in the shade of palm trees and chat with each other.  The paths lined with stone connect with each other not only the body, but also the pool and many other objects. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The Faraana Heights Hotel (Sharm 4 *) has its own secure parking, where even tourist shuttles can stop.  Advance reservation of parking spaces is not required.  There is a gallery on the territory along which small shops are built where not only food products are sold, but also many other retail goods necessary for tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Faraana Heights 4 Charm" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/726989.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  Location Faraana Heights has been chosen very well.  It seems to be "on the edge", far from the bustling city center, however, to the famous Naami Bay promenade in the region, where there are numerous establishments in which life does not stop even for a minute, even at night, only twenty minutes away.  The hotel offers a free daily shuttle service to the bay of the same name. </p><p>  Concierge services, room service of packed lunches, and ironing are also offered.  The hotel has a laundry, luggage storage, which is especially convenient for those tourists who, after checking in, have a certain amount of time to wait for their transfer.  Having handed over things, they can walk to the sea, go shopping or just sit in a restaurant or cafe. </p><p>  Here, in the administrative building, there are conference and banquet halls.  Hotel managers can help organize any event, be it a corporate party, seminar or wedding celebration.  There is also a laundry room, safe deposit box and a beauty salon. </p><h2>  Hotel Policies </h2><p>  The reception is open around the clock.

    <h2>  For children </h2><p>  Russian tour operators Faraana Heights is positioned as a family, and therefore it is always full of children.

Umbrellas with sun loungers, mattresses and beach towels are provided free of charge to residents of the ultra- and all-inclusive concept. </p><p>  Nabq Bay has its own specifics: during low tides, water goes very far.  Coral reefs are also located close to the coast.  However, the Faraana Heights 4 * bathing area is famous for the lack of pronounced tides, in addition, there is a sandy entrance to the sea.  The length of the beach is three hundred meters, the bottom is clean. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2>

This is especially true for pools with fresh and artificially created water, around which comfortable sun loungers are placed.  Many tourists prefer to spend time here.

You can play volleyball on the beach. </p><p>  There is a massage room, as well as a fitness center and solarium.  For slot machines and billiards you need to pay extra.  Many entertainments for tourists are offered on the beach, in particular, air hockey, scooter and catamaran rental, banana skiing, parachuting. </p><p>  Separately, I want to say about diving, which in the Red Sea is truly amazing.  Those who wish can rent all the necessary equipment and under the supervision of licensed instructors admire the beauty of the underwater world.  Many because of the excellent beach, suitable for diving, stay at Faraana Heights. </p><h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  The hotel is offered today by many Russian travel companies.  Therefore, here you can meet many of our compatriots.  For those who are coming to Egypt for the first time, the Faraana Heights 4 Hotel has really liked.  Especially against the backdrop of similar Turkish "fours." </p><p>  Most of the Russians who visited this hotel consider it to be fully consistent with their category.  Guests enjoy the location, the large and beautifully furnished grounds, and the well-refurbished rooms with original interiors. </p><p>  As for food, the reviews are also positive: food is provided in large quantities, so tourists do not remain hungry, even if they are the last to come to the restaurant.  The cuisine in the hotel is very tasty, and animators who really like the children also receive praise.  The staff works well and is smiling and always helpful. </p><p>  Some Russians enjoyed their stay at Faraana Heights so much that they intend to come here more than once.  The only disadvantage, some consider it an inconvenient road to the sea, although the hotel provides a free shuttle to the beach. </p>
