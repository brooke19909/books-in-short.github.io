First, the sausage is inflated by the pump, but not completely.  The more you intend to do the twist, the larger the piece of unfilled air you should leave.  Next, three bubbles of the same size are made alternately.  It will be the face of the beast and two ears.  As can be seen in the diagram, at the end of the ball, the void is reduced, since air pressure arises during twisting.  The figure under No. 3 shows that the first twist rotates and connects to the last. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="work flow chart" class="if uuid-2723498" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2723498.jpg"></div><p>  Further work continues on the front legs.
