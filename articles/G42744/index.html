For example, in the Zodiac <span>4 *</span> hotel <span>(Tunisia / Hammamet) the</span> minimum price for accommodation is about 50 US dollars.  For such a fee, it is difficult to find a room in hotels of the same class somewhere in Cyprus, the Greek islands and even in neighboring Egypt. </p>

    <h2>  What attracts tourists to Tunisia? </h2><p>  In this African country, Europeans are more than comfortable.  It will be interesting both for beach lovers and fans of excursion programs and various sports, including extreme ones: surfing, rafting, golf, snorkeling, diving, safari, etc. High-quality hotel services also belong to the advantages of this country , but the biggest bait is still white beaches and the opportunity to do thalassotherapy - ‚Äútreatment by the sea‚Äù.  Tunisia was not so long ago a French colony, and it was then that this branch of the "beauty industry" began to develop here.  Russians in this country are attracted by almost everything: the opportunity for a comparatively low fee to receive high-class service in hotels and restaurants, and wonderful, and most importantly, effective procedures included in thalassotherapy, and a great excursion program, and free morals, and many noisy entertainments, which are hard to find in another Muslim country.  The main resorts of the Tunisian coast are Monastir, Sousse, Ost.  Djerba, Mahdia and, in fact, Hammamet, where the Hotel Zodiac 4 * is located.  Tunisia can be either noisy or quiet and measured.  If you prefer a respectable vacation, then Hammamet is exactly what you are looking for. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there? </h2><p>  This <span>African country is</span> best reached by air.  In high season, scheduled and charter flights depart from both Russian capitals, as well as some major cities of our country.  Flight time is about 4 hours.  Airports are located in the capital, as well as in some cities, for example, Enfide, Monastir, etc. Hammamet, where the Zodiac 4 * hotel is located (Tunisia), can be reached by international buses, piles (something like our shuttle taxis) and even by rail.  The distance between the airport terminal and the resort is about 50 km.  By the way, one of the best options is car rental.  An order can be made in advance, being in Russia, or already being at the airport, contacting ‚ÄúKar rent‚Äù.  The cost of rent per day is about 80 TND.  In this case, the car will be provided only to persons who have reached the age of 21 years and above and in the presence of a driving license issued at least a year ago. </p>

    <h2>  Yasmine Hammamet </h2><p>  6 km south of Hammamet is the tourist area Yasmin - the most comfortable area on the entire Tunisian coast.  There are many deluxe hotels, both five- and four-star.  As for the latter, one of the best is Hotel Zodiac 4 * (Tunisia).  Reviews about him on the pages of various information resources are quite positive.  Although there are negative comments regarding, as a rule, nutrition.  In addition, this hotel is presented in promotional materials as a complex located on the first beach line.  But in order to get to the beach, tourists have to cross the road.  And this is also one of the reasons for the dissatisfaction of vacationers with this hotel.  However, let us return to the description of the resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãHammamet Yasmin.  Here, vacationers will find a lot of entertainment venues, as well as various wellness centers offering spa services, including thalassotherapy, etc. Lovers of the royal game, golf, also come here, as in this area there are gorgeous Citrus et courses Yasmine  Fans of boat trips on yachts will also be pleased by choosing this resort for relaxation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  In total, Zodiac 4 * (Tunisia / Hammamet) has 97 rooms.  Of these, 81 are standard, 12 are for families of 3 or more people, and 4 rooms are upscale "suites".  They are located on two levels (floors) and are equipped with everything necessary for a respectable vacation of premium tourists.  In addition, there are facilities for the disabled and non-smokers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Description and service </h2><p>  Standard rooms at the Zodiac Hotel are no worse than suites.  Just their area is less.  All rooms have air conditioning and heating, as the hotel is open year-round, and in the winter months it is sometimes necessary to heat the rooms.  There are also TVs with satellite channels, telephone, Internet, safe, mini-bar (for a fee), comfortable furniture.  The bathroom is equipped with a shower or bathtub.  They have all the necessary bath and toiletries, as well as a hairdryer.  Cleaning is done daily, and linen is changed 2-3 times a week.  In some reviews, vacationers complain that, despite the advertised cleanliness of the hotel staff, linen and towels are changed very rarely.  If for you cleanliness is one of the most important determinants, then check the declared information several times and only after that go to the Zodiac 4 * hotel (Tunisia).  Prices are low, but can this justify the dishonesty of staff?  As noted above, the cost of living at this hotel starts at $ 50 (per day). </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Hotel guests can choose from various types of food: all-inclusive, full-board, half-board, or breakfast only.  In the main restaurant of the Zodiac 4 * hotel (Tunisia), a buffet is served three times a day with a huge selection of hot dishes, drinks, salads, pastries and desserts.  Although in some reviews, former guests complain about the meager menu, nevertheless, the restaurant chefs work wonderfully and wish to delight guests with their culinary masterpieces.  Those vacationers who prefer to choose the all inclusive system can use the bars (free of charge) located on the hotel territory throughout the day.  At 3 p.m. tea and pastries are served in a special room.  In addition, daily, next to the pool, for guests, barbecue is fried in a barbecue cafe, and for gourmets there is always a counter with ice cream.  The hotel also has a pizzeria and an oriental cafe. </p>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Despite the fact that this hotel is located on the first line, a magnificent snow-white beach is located across the road, 250 meters from the hotel entrance.  It is well equipped: there are toilets, changing rooms, sun loungers and umbrellas, plenty of opportunities for water entertainment.  Instructors will help tourists dive into the waters of the Mediterranean Sea for the first time and go diving, you can ride the waves, learn windsurfing, go water skiing, scooter and banana, parachute over the waves, etc. </p><h2>  Zodiac 4 * <span>(Tunisia): reviews</span> and ratings of tourists </h2><p>  Some vacationers, choosing a hotel, pay attention to the reviews, and not to the information posted on the official websites of hotels.  On the other hand, they must take into account that these statements can be written either by ‚Äúwell-wishers‚Äù from competing hotels or by paid agents who praise the hotel for advertising purposes.  And do not forget about the subjective opinion, which does not always coincide with reality.  So, for example, reviews about the Zodiac hotel can be found both positive and negative.  To understand how things really are, you need to look at a huge number of comments, and turn to different information sources.  And only after that draw the appropriate conclusions.  For example, some tourists write that during their stay at the hotel they lost several kilograms, because the food was tasteless, while others, on the contrary, praise the skill of the culinary specialists.  Statements are made about the mistreatment of Russophobia employees, while others are enthusiastic about the friendliness of the staff.  So who to believe?  To myself.  Go to Tunisia, of course, armed with some knowledge, and remember that there is no companion for the taste and color.  Have a nice rest! </p>
