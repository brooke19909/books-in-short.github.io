    <h2>  Some facts </h2><p>  First, we will answer the question that a person can ask when he first opens a history textbook.  What continent is Egypt - the country from which the <span>history of the Ancient World</span> begins <span>?</span>  And although modern scientists hypothesize that different nations founded their civilizations before the pyramid builders, official science counts precisely from this mysterious state.  So, on what continent is Egypt located?  This is hot Africa, the cradle of mankind.  And a little more clarification to the question "On which continent is Egypt located, in which part of it?"  This is the north-eastern part of the Black Continent, which is limited by the sands of the Sahara, the Libyan <span>Plateau, the Arabian Plateau</span> , the shores of the Mediterranean and Red Seas. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what continent is egypt on and in what part" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/688565.jpg" width="600"></div>

Now let's talk about the country itself and its features.  Today it is an <span>Islamic state</span> that is in great demand among tourists.  In ancient times, it was a powerful power with a strong central authority, a unique religious cult, highly developed science, medicine and engineering.  The cultural heritage of this country still amazes wanderers who have seen a lot in their path. </p><p>  <span>The geographical position of Egypt</span> determined its climate.  The country is always hot (the Sahara breathes all year round), and therefore the tourist season here never ends.  At any time of the year you can swim in the warm waves of the cleanest seas, scuba dive or go on a Nile cruise. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what continent is egypt in what part of it" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/688560.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The main attraction of the Country of the Pharaohs </h2><p>  So, on what continent Egypt is located and in what part, the reader already knows.  Now let's talk about the main attractions of this amazing country.  Contrary to the expectations of many, these are not pyramids, not magnificent temples and sculptures, but a natural marvel called Nile.  It is the longest river in the world that gives life to the region.  Without its spills, farming would not have been possible, and therefore history could have developed in a completely different way.  On the shores of Africa's largest waterway, the main cities of Ancient Egypt are located.  It is to them that the tourist sets off, deciding to take a walk along the river in a small comfortable boat.  The most popular routes are on the Nile between Luxor and Aswan. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The river originates in the lakes of tropical Africa.  This part of it is called the White Nile.  Then it merges with the Blue Nile, which begins in <span>Lake Tana</span> (Ethiopia).  A powerful stream carries its waters through the sands, loses them, grows thinner, but does not disappear.  Not far from the Mediterranean Sea, it is divided into many branches, forming a delta covered with papyrus. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what continent is Egypt on what sights" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/688562.jpg" width="559"></div>

    <h2>  Magnet for lovers of antiquity </h2><p>  Everyone already knows what continent Egypt is located on, whose sights so attract people.  And what can the country boast of? </p><ul><li>  The pyramids.  Huge stone masses, smoothly polished externally and densely covered with hieroglyphs from the inside.  These are the dark tombs of the pharaohs, who survived even the very memory of the rulers, and sometimes lost the name of the one for whom they were intended.  They are countless in number, they come in different sizes, and it seems that time is afraid of them, and therefore does not touch them. </li><li>  Sphinx.  The mysterious sculpture of the half-human half-tree, the purpose of which, as well as age, is not known for certain. </li><li>  Amazing temples in Luxor, Edfu, Karnak, Kom Ombo, Aswan, Kalabshi, Amarna.  They amaze with their perfect forms, colossal, so it seems that here you can communicate with heaven, just by closing your eyes. </li><li>  <span>The Cairo Museum,</span> where a huge number of artifacts of antiquity are collected, which have no analogues. </li><li>  Cairo (the capital), where you can walk through the colorful bazaars, and Alexandria - the largest port, where the lighthouse towered (the seventh wonder of the world) and the library, which died in a fire. </li></ul>

    <h2>  The main resort of the planet </h2><p>  Do you know what the best resort in the world is called, on which continent is it located?  The Egyptian pyramids are not the only attraction in the country.  Most tourists are attracted by resorts, as the coasts of the Mediterranean and Red Seas are literally created for relaxation.  A large number of hotels for different tastes and budgets are concentrated here (yes, everyone can afford a vacation here).  Sunbathing, water rides and entertainment, sports, sea and river walks, diving, trips by jeeps and camels to the desert will not leave anyone indifferent.  Noteworthy is the Ras Mohammed National Reserve near Sharm El Sheikh, and numerous mosques, and oases lost in the sand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what continent is egypt on and in what part" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/688564.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  What else is worth doing while in Egypt?  To visit thermal springs in Baharia, buy hookah (shisha), which are of four types, purchase souvenirs for relatives and friends.  It is worth noting that, in addition to papyrus, scarab, pyramid or Sphinx figures, it is not recommended to buy anything else here - the cost of goods does not differ in cheapness. </p><p>  Be sure to try the local cuisine.  For cooking, they use lamb, spices, rice and couscous, fish and seafood, traditional for the Middle East. </p><p>  Now pack your bags and actually go where the past is intertwined with the present and awaits the coming of the future.  Go to Egypt, where everything originates from ... </p>
