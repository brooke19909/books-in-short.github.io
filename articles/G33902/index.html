And many are convinced that you can highlight a child through original clothing.  Of course, the best option in this case is a do-it-yourself thing.  Therefore, in the material presented below, we will talk about how to knit a vest for a girl.  And we will not limit the reader in choosing a tool, and the described product will be able to repeat the mother, who owns both a hook and knitting needles. </p><h2>  Preparatory stage </h2><p>  Both the professional and the beginner needlewoman know that knitting of any thing begins with the purchase of the necessary materials and tools.  Regarding the first one can only say one thing: it is important to choose yarn taking into account the time of wearing the product.  It is also worth noting that for a lace vest, it is better to choose a plain yarn rather than motley. </p><p>  When purchasing the right tool, it is worth giving preference to one that is made of metal.  It will provide the necessary slip, speed and quality of knitting.  The size of the knitting needles or hook is pretty simple.  You can simply examine the label on the yarn or select an instrument one and a half times wider than the thread. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="tank top for girls" class="if uuid-2881237" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2881237.jpg"></div><p>  Also, at the preparatory stage, you should take measurements from the girl, and the vest will definitely fit. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Required Parameters </h2><p>  Measuring a person is very simple.  It is only important to consider what measurements need to be taken.  For a vest you need: </p><ul><li>  the estimated length of the product is A; </li><li>  armhole height - B; </li><li>  girth of the widest part of the body (chest or hips) - B; </li><li>  shoulder width - G; </li><li>  neck width - D. </li></ul><h2>  Fragment of the pattern </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet sleeveless jacket" class="if uuid-2881243" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2881243.jpg"></div><p>  It doesn‚Äôt matter what tool the knitter plans to work with.  In any case, you will first have to dial the loops.  In order not to make a mistake in determining their number, you need to tie a sample of a pattern measuring about 10 x 10 centimeters.  The most important thing is to work with prepared tools and yarn.  In the finished fragment, you do not need to close the loop if it was knitted, and break the thread.  But just in case, it is not necessary to dissolve it.  After all, it is he who will help us build all further work on the vest for the girl. </p><p>  Therefore, we consider the number of loops and rows in it.  And after that we divide each value by 10. So we find out how many loops (W) and rows (3) are in 1 cm. </p><h2>  Loop set </h2><p>  When the parameters specified in the previous paragraph are calculated, we proceed to knitting the studied product.  We start from the back.  And first of all, we calculate the number of loops that we need to put on knitting needles or crochet in the form of a chain.  It is very simple to do this: divide parameter B by two and multiply by parameter G. The resulting number will be the answer to the question of how many loops should be gathered for knitting the back of a vest for a girl with knitting needles or crochet.  To calculate the number of loops for the front shelves, it is necessary: ‚Äã‚Äãdivide parameter B by 4 and multiply by parameter G. If, before the whole, we knit it like a back. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="tank top description" class="if uuid-2881257" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2881257.jpg"></div><h2>  Armhole dressing </h2><p>  Most beginner knitters have difficulties at this stage.  And all because it is possible to independently create a beautiful rounded edge only from the fifth, and even from the tenth time.  To facilitate the work of the reader, we have prepared detailed instructions, the implementation of which will help to prevent mistakes when knitting vests for girls.  So, in order to unleash an armhole, first of all, it is necessary to determine its level.  It is not difficult to do this: we multiply parameter Z by parameter B. As a result, we obtain the number of rows that separates the lower edge of the product from the armhole.  Having reached the right moment, we calculate the number of extra loops: subtract the parameter D from the parameter D and multiply the found value by the parameter G. </p><p>  Next, we begin to gradually reduce the loops: </p><ol><li>  In the first row we skip or close six loops. </li><li>  In the second and third - three. </li><li>  In the fourth, fifth and sixth - two. </li><li>  The remaining number of extra loops is distributed in the last rows.  We are reducing them evenly.  It is advisable to record all your actions.  After all, then in a similar way it will be necessary to knit the armhole on the front so that the vest for the girl connected with a hook or knitting should be even. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="sleeveless jacket step by step" class="if uuid-2881255" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2881255.jpg"></div><h2>  Shoulder and gate design </h2><p>  When performing the back, it is necessary to begin the reduction of loops for the collar and shoulder seams at the same time.  About seven rows before the end of the product (multiply parameter A by parameter Z).  Tie the shoulder seams in this way: </p><ol><li>  Multiply the parameter G by the parameter D. As a result, we find out the number of loops allotted to complete the gate. </li><li>  After that, we mark them with a thread so as not to go astray during the knitting process. </li><li>  Then divide the total number of loops by two.  If we knit a vest for a girl with a crochet, we just don‚Äôt go to the second half.  If with knitting needles - we transfer the extra loops to another loop or securing with pins. </li><li>  In the first row we close 6 loops for the shoulder seam and 12 for the collar. </li><li>  In the second, third and fourth - 5 and 3 each. </li><li>  In the fifth, sixth and seventh - 4 and 2. </li><li>  The remaining number of loops is also distributed in the last rows.  The main thing is to make a uniform transition. </li><li>  By analogy, but already mirror the second half of the back. </li></ol><h2>  Front end </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="sleeveless knitting" class="if uuid-2881241" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2881241.jpg"></div><p>  It is not so difficult to knit a vest for a girl, how to determine the style of the product.  It is especially difficult to choose a fastener option.  At present, ties with tassels at the end, which are located on the collar of the vest, are very popular.  Also a fashionable option are pom-poms, replacing regular buttons.  If you wish, you can completely leave the studied thing "in free flight."  In this case, each person is free to rely on their own taste.  However, it is necessary to determine the style in advance so that, if necessary, knit holes for buttons or pompons. </p><p>  After that, we proceed to the implementation of the shelves.  We collect the number of loops that we determined in one of the previous paragraphs.  We knit a flat cloth until we reach the level of the armhole.  We knit it according to the previously described technology, and then move on to the collar.  It is important to note that in front it should be lower than in the back.  Therefore, we begin twelve rows to the end: </p><ol><li>  In the first row, we reduce or skip 12 loops. </li><li>  In the second and third - 3 loops. </li><li>  In the fourth, fifth and sixth - 2 each. </li><li>  The remaining number of loops are evenly distributed on the last rows. </li><li>  By analogy, we knit the second armhole, given that for it it is necessary to mirror the described actions. </li></ol><h2>  Seamless product </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="sleeveless knitting" class="if uuid-2881254" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2881254.jpg"></div><p>  The vest connected for the girl looks much more beautiful if there are no seams in it.  Especially if an openwork thing is done.  However, in this case, the technology is significantly different from that described previously, although many knitters note that it is much easier to knit.  To provide the reader with a choice, we suggest exploring both options, and then choosing the one that suits you best. </p><p>  The technology of the seamless vest is quite simple: </p><ol><li>  First, we dial the following number of loops: multiply parameter  by parameter B. </li><li>  This way we know how many loops are required to cover the entire circumference of the body. </li><li>  We crochet a chain or we sew loops on knitting needles. </li><li>  After that, we knit the product with an even cloth until we reach the level of the armhole. </li><li>  At this moment, we divide the canvas into three parts, highlighting the back and two front shelves. </li><li>  Each of them will have to be knitted separately. </li><li>  It is important to note that it is unnecessary to knit the armhole.  However, you still have to work on the collar, although you can make a square neckline if you wish.  In this case, it is necessary to close or skip the required number of loops and tie the shoulder, moving a smooth canvas. </li><li>  After that, the vest for the girl - school, everyday or formal-holiday - is sewn.  But only at the shoulder seams. </li></ol><h2>  Pattern Options </h2><p>  Professional knitters note that lace vests, worn on a blouse, badlon or an ordinary T-shirt, look most beautiful.  However, finding a pattern in numerous knitting magazines is not as easy as it seems at first glance.  Therefore, in the current article, we also offer the reader several original options. </p><p>  Spectacular, but difficult to execute pattern is quite difficult to disassemble yourself.  In addition, a huge number of people absorb information much better when they observe the process with their own eyes, rather than reading a long and tedious description.  Therefore, we advise the reader to study the video instruction below.  In it, a professional knitter talks in detail about what manipulations you need to perform to make a crochet openwork. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="t0gZ1gY48Eg" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=251&amp;v=t0gZ1gY48Eg" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/9/7/5/6/9756.jpg"></div><p>  For readers who prefer to follow the graphic instructions, we propose to knit a vest for the girl according to the schemes.  The first pattern is for knitting needles, the second is for the hook. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern design" class="if uuid-2881249" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2881249.jpg"></div><p>  We hope that in this article we were able to convince the reader that it is very simple to execute the original product on your own.  You just need to set a goal and go towards it. </p>
