Beads are small beads of different colors, shapes and sizes.  From these beads you can weave everything that is enough for imagination.  Some are fond of weaving jewelry, many weave a variety of flowers, trees and other plants.  Some people like animals and <span>insects made of beads,</span> and others like weaving paintings.  As you can see, from these wonderful little beads you can weave anything.  There are numerous <span>bead weaving</span> techniques <span>.</span>  Let us dwell on some of them. </p><p>  <strong>French beadwork technique</strong> </p><p>  One of the most interesting weaving techniques is French bead weaving.  No wonder, because flowers, trees and even leaves made in such an unusual technique look very beautiful, voluminous and ‚Äúalive‚Äù.  In another way, this technique can be defined as weaving in arcs or in a circle.  There is also <span>parallel weaving,</span> it is a bit simpler, but very similar. </p><p>  French beadwork is distinguished by the fact that in the center of each woven item and in each plant there is a strong core.  More often it is made of wire.  Larger beads are strung onto the wire thicker, and then alternately, attaching from below to above, to the top, to the left and to the right of the rod, they arrange a thin wire with smaller beads.  Each stroke of the wire, both from above and from below, is attached to the rod with one turn, and the last move with two.  Thus, a leaflet is obtained.  The tips on the one hand must be hidden, on the other - cut and a little "fluff" by inserting into a flower to keep the leaf.  Weaving flowers is a little more complicated.  Usually, several techniques are used there, often parallel and French beadwork. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  French beadwork is a very interesting and easy technique.  As in any work, you just need to adhere to the instructions, carefully weave, step by step, carefully stringing the beads on the wire.  You should try your hand at weaving flowers and leaves.  One of the simplest flowers is violet.  What does that require?  Beads of several colors, a beautiful small pot, thin and thick wire, silk threads or green fishing line, green and lilac beads, as well as yellow medium beads for stamens, not very large, but larger than the beads.  For starters, you can make a small violet of seven flowers and nine leaves.  To revive the flower a little, it is worth taking small green beads a tone lighter and use it to weave leaves in the last row. </p><p>  If you combine all the flowers and leaves with each other, you get a wonderful violet.  Put it in a beautiful pot, plaster it and put it in the most prominent place in your apartment.  With this weaving technique you can make many wonderful things for your home and many decorations for you personally. </p><p>  French weaving with beads makes it possible to create flower petals and leaves not only round, but acute-angled.  This can be achieved by changing the angle of inclination of the arcs when attached to the rod.  It‚Äôs just that when connecting a thin wire to a thick one, you need to change the angle, for example, 45 degrees. So the leaf will have sharp corners. </p><p>  <strong>French bead bow</strong> </p><p>  To weave such a bow, you need to take red and <span>pink</span> beads <span>, a</span> needle, a silk thread, a fishing line, but it is best to use wire.  To make a French bow, 4 rhombuses are needed: two larger ones, two smaller ones.  We will begin to weave a rhombus from the center, first one way, and then the second.  Take and put on the wire two beads and fix them by threading one end of the wire on the other side.  Then three, four, five, and so on.  Then we return and weave the other side.  Thus, weave four rhombuses and then combine them into bows.  Large rhombuses are best weaved from red beads, and small ones from pink.  French bead bow ready.  From the bow you can make a brooch or an elegant hairpin, as well as <span>clips for curtains</span> and many other jewelry. </p>
