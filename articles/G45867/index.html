  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to check your phone for viruses?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The development of the mobile device market inevitably led to the fact that hackers began to create malicious virus programs that infect operating systems such as Android, Windows Mobile, Symbian.  If you are a mobile Internet user, receive and transfer files via Bluetooth or via MMS, then your phone is already at risk of malware infection.  Therefore, it will be very useful for you to know how to check your phone for viruses.  Let's look at a few ways for you to choose the most suitable one for yourself. </p><p>  Method 1. Entrust phone scanning for professionals </p><p>  Make sure that one of the aforementioned operating systems is installed on your phone.  Contact the service center that serves your model of mobile device, where they will give you qualified advice and conduct an initial diagnosis of the device for attacks.  Depending on which subspecies of the threat will be detected (mobile or computer virus), the type of software that will protect your phone will depend on it. </p><p>  Method 2. How to check your phone for viruses: Spy Monitor Pro </p><p>  In a specialized store, purchase Spy Monitor Pro (of course, the licensed version of this software), install the program on your phone using the installation wizard.  Then start the scanning process (it is better to choose a background mode for this - so you can continue to use mobile for your needs).  After scanning, click on "Remove viruses." </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Method 3. How to check your phone for viruses using mobile antivirus </p><p>  Download the mobile version of Kaspersky Anti-Virus from the official site, indicating the platform on which your mobile device works.  This version of the antivirus is trial and will last only a week.  For full and safe operation of the phone, it is recommended to purchase a mobile antivirus in the full version. </p><p>  Method 4. How to check your phone for viruses through a computer </p><p>  If your mobile phone does not have a full-fledged operating system, then you can check for viruses in it using the antivirus installed on your computer or laptop.  To do this, you need to connect your phone to the computer via a DATA cable, which, as a rule, is included in the package for a new mobile phone.  If necessary, synchronize the PC and phone using a special program.  As soon as the system detects a new device, restart the computer for the new connection to take effect. </p><p>  Now, to check your phone for viruses, go to the folder called ‚ÄúMy Computer‚Äù and in the ‚ÄúRemovable Storage‚Äù section, double-click the shortcut with the name of your mobile phone.  Then click on the link ‚ÄúCheck by antivirus‚Äù.  After the scan is completed, you will see a list of files that contain possible threats.  Select "Cure All."  At the end of the process, safely disconnect the mobile phone as a removable device from your computer. </p><p>  After ‚Äúhealing‚Äù your phone, restore the default settings by reinstalling the files that came with the factory software for the mobile phone model.  In the future, remember that important data and information should be copied.  Since the ingenuity of hackers knows no bounds, malware programs are updated much more often than antiviruses.  And virus protection is more reliable. </p><p>  So, we tried to answer the question of how to check the phone for viruses.  Now you need to periodically check and clean the phone, remove ‚Äúgarbage‚Äù, unnecessary toys, etc.  Prevention of the emergence of viruses, like our health, is always better and easier than treatment. </p><p>  And if it seems to you that the ‚Äútreatment‚Äù with the help of a computer antivirus is only enough for a short time, it means that only the memory card is cleared, and the enemy ‚Äúlurks in the device itself‚Äù.  To restore the normal operation of the mobile phone, it would be better to contact a special service center that has a license. </p>
