In this city of love, in addition to the Eiffel Tower, there are many other equally beautiful sights.  Madeleine Church in Paris is one of the most beautiful architectural monuments of this city. </p><h2>  Construction history </h2><p>  The Madeleine Church is located in the 8th <span>arrondissement of Paris.</span>  It is also known as the Church of St. Mary Magdalene.  The temple is located on the eponymous square, which is included in the ensemble of the Place de la Concorde. </p><p>  The construction of the church lasted 85 years due to instability in the politics and economy of France during the late 18th - early 19th centuries.  Initially, the construction of Madeleine Church in Paris was supervised by the architect Contant d'Ivry during the reign of Louis XV.  Then the construction was continued by Couture, who wanted to take the Pantheon as a basis.  During the reign of Napoleon, the construction of the church was carried out by the architect Vignon.  Construction was completed in 1842, and the temple was consecrated. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.parisinfo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Madeleine Church" class="if uuid-2537569" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54146/2537569.jpg"></div><h2>  Architecture </h2><p>  Madeleine Church in Paris is similar in shape to a classic Greco-Roman temple.  A wide staircase leads to the entrance, and the building itself is supported by massive tall columns in the amount of 52 pieces, and their height is 20 meters.  Massive doors made of bronze have murals depicting the Ten Commandments. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Inside the Madeleine church is divided into two parts by semicircular arches.  One of them is the lobby, in which there are places for an organ and a small choir.  In another part there is a nave.  The main difference between the Madeleine church in Paris is that in its interior decoration warm shades alternate, which are expressed in gilding, with cool tones (white marble from which the columns are made). </p><p>  It is illuminated by natural light that penetrates through casement openings.  There are no stained glass windows in Madeleine Church.  This creates an atmosphere conducive to solitude and reflection.  Also, in addition to natural light, baroque lamps are used.  The majestic Madeleine church in Paris is made in the neoclassical style. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": Patrick Mayon, "><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of Madeleine church" class="if uuid-2537583" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54146/2537583.jpg"></div><h2>  sights </h2><p>  In Madeleine‚Äôs church there are other equally beautiful and famous architectural monuments that deserve special attention. </p><ol><li>  Sculpture by Charles Marcetti - it is located above the main altar and depicts the ascension of St. Magdalene to heaven. </li><li>  White marble chapel by sculptor Francois Ryud depicting the baptism of Christ.  It symbolizes purification and the beginning of a new righteous life. </li><li>  The frescoes of Jules-Claude Ziegler, which decorated the half-dome above the altar.  They depict the most revered saints, and the central place of the composition is occupied by Napoleon (this was characteristic of the art of that era). </li><li>  Statue of St. Clotilde of white marble, authored by sculptor Antoine Louis-Bari. </li><li>  Marble panels created by Vincent-Nicolas Raver, the central place on which is reserved for saints and angels. </li><li>  The organ is made by the talented and famous organist Aristide Cavaill√©-Coll.  This musical instrument differs from others in that it was created using technologies that were new to the 18th century. </li></ol><p>  The Madeleine Church is not only an important architectural, but also a cultural and historical heritage of France.  Its decoration and design is admirable, but at the same time it does not look too pompous and pretentious, but sets up for a peaceful and philosophical mood. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.la-croix.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sculpture &quot;Ascension of St. Magdalene&quot;" class="if uuid-2537578" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54146/2537578.jpg"></div><h2>  The Eiffel Tower </h2><p>  One of the main attractions of Paris and the symbol of France is the Eiffel Tower.  Millions of tourists are delighted with her visit.  It was designed and built by <span>Gustav Eiffel</span> as an entrance to the World Exhibition, which took place in Paris in 1900. </p><p>  The Eiffel Tower reaches 324 meters in height and is one of the tallest structures in the world.  Tourists can dine in the restaurant, which is located there;  take the elevator to the observation deck and enjoy the city view. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hotelwaldorftrocadero.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The Eiffel Tower" class="if uuid-2537588" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54146/2537588.jpg"></div><h2>  The louvre museum </h2><p>  This is one of the most famous museums in the world.  The Louvre exhibits more than 300 thousand exhibits.  There you can find some of the most famous and great works of art.  It was originally the residence of the French kings. </p><p>  With the relocation of the French court to Versailles in the 18th century, the Louvre became a museum.  The first collections were created from the personal acquisitions of Fratsisk I and Louis IV.  Constantly in the halls 35 thousand exhibits from a huge collection are exhibited.  It is in the Louvre that the famous "Mona Lisa" by Leonardo da Vinci is located. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mylittleadventure.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Louvre Museum" class="if uuid-2537592" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54146/2537592.jpg"></div><h2>  Notre Dame de Paris </h2><p>  Also known as Notre Dame Cathedral and is one of the main attractions of Paris.  This attraction was especially famous after the release of the Hugo novel.  Notre Dame de Paris is one of the outstanding examples of the Gothic style in architecture. </p><p>  Throughout its existence, the greatness of the cathedral fell into decay.  But in 1920, the inhabitants of the city carried out restoration to restore its former splendor.  Notre Dame Cathedral still delights the French and tourists. </p><h2>  Bus tours to Paris </h2><p>  They are very popular among tourists because they combine comfortable movement and the opportunity to see all the main attractions.  Bus tours to Paris often include a trip to several French provinces. </p><p>  Tourists choose this way of travel also because they have the opportunity to visit not only France, but also other European countries.  Of course, most people want to visit Paris, which is one of the most beautiful and romantic cities in the world, to plunge into its atmosphere and see all its famous attractions. </p>
