  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Camp "Bonfire", Samara: address, conditions of improvement, prices</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>Camp "Bonfire" (Samara)</span> is one of the most popular health centers in the region, because it is located in the green zone within the city district.  For many parents, this is a favorable factor, especially when there are children of primary school age.  But in 2018, he was not included in the register of health facilities due to the lack of a sanitary and epidemiological passport.  Parents can only hope that all problems will be resolved by the summer of 2019. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Children are not delivered to the Koster children's camp (Samara) by special transport, because you can get to it by city bus.  It is located in an oak grove in the immediate vicinity of the b / o "Dubki".  This is exactly the name of the stop where you need to exit. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-zoom="16" data-type="roadmap" data-lng="50.221767415344175" data-lat="53.2785615895282"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/8/2/0/6/8206.png"></div><p>  Institutional address: st.  Through, 7. It can be reached from anywhere in the city: from pl.  Revolution - bus number 232, from the railway station - number 50, from the a / s "Aurora" - number 392. In the immediate vicinity there is a large transport interchange of the urban district - Barboshina Polyana. </p><h2>  brief information </h2><p>  The wellness center turned 55 years old, but in recent years it existed solely through the implementation of vouchers.  It was this circumstance that did not allow the administration to properly prepare it for the summer season of 2018.  Campfire camp in Samara conducted three shifts and target races of various children's clubs and organizations annually.  Only in 2017, 924 teenagers rested here in the age range from six to eighteen years.  Most of the vouchers were sold under the state contract through the Internet portal and purchased by parents at a reduced price. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="vk.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://vk.com/koster63?z=photo-1036266_338151640%2Falbum-1036266_200319422%2Frev"><img itemprop="image" alt="Children's Health Camp &amp; quot; Bonfire &amp; quot;" class="if uuid-2769354" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40637/2769354.jpg"></div><p>  The camp has several residential buildings, showers, a sports area, a stage and gazebos for events.  There is a swimming pool on the territory, which in the 2017 season no longer functioned due to non-compliance with safety requirements.  The main advantage of the camp is the natural environment.  An ecological trail has been laid through it, allowing to carry out interesting activities in the fresh air. </p><h2>  Problems </h2><p>  At Sign.org, a collection of signatures is currently being organized so that the Campfire camp (Samara) is saved as a children's health center and transferred to the ownership of the municipality.  Why did the townspeople organize such an action? </p><p>  The administration recognized the impossibility on its own to update the material and technical base of the institution and to ensure the safety requirements for minors staying on its territory.  An examination of the condition of the children's complex and overhaul are required. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vk.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://vk.com/koster63?z=photo-1036266_338152743%2Falbum-1036266_200319422%2Frev"><img itemprop="image" alt="Children's camp &amp; quot; Bonfire &amp; quot;" class="if uuid-2769350" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40637/2769350.jpg"></div><p>  Despite the assurances of the interim governor of the region, D. Azarov, to take control of the property, residents still fear that a favorably located plot of land will be bought out by private individuals.  Instead of a children's institution, the practice of building elite mansions in the green zone may continue. </p><h2>  Camp "Bonfire" (Samara): reviews, prices </h2><p>  VKontakte has a group of a health complex, which includes about 4.5 thousand participants.  These are those who have been to the camp in previous years.  They are happy to upload photos and publish reviews about the happy days of their stay at Koster Koster.  Most admit that children here are interested, educational work is at its best.  This is evidenced by the desire of the guys to visit here again.  The administration carefully reviews the reviews and tries to eliminate the shortcomings.  So, in one of the messages it was said about the shortcomings in the organization of the arrival of children.  The administration responded immediately, after which no further complaints were received. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sodb.ru" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.sodb.ru/node/540"><img itemprop="image" alt="Camp holiday" class="if uuid-2769321" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40637/2769321.jpg"></div><p>  What are the shortcomings of the townspeople in the camp "Bonfire" (Samara)?  The prices for permits in 2017 amounted to 18,000 rubles, while parents would like to see repaired toilets, a basketball court and a working pool.  I want to believe that the region‚Äôs administration will keep its promise, and the health complex will be ready to accept children in the summer of 2019. </p>
