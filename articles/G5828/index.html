With the advent of new and more advanced technologies, protection began to appear in more "down to earth" gadgets. </p><p>  Of course, a good half of shockproof and waterproof smartphones still have a fat and unattractive look, but manufacturers have made the main emphasis on protection against water.  While the physical part fell on the shoulders of films, cases, handbags and other accessories, without which the phone looks quite presentable and does not differ much from its usual counterparts. </p><p>  We will try to understand this issue and outline the list of the best waterproof smartphones.  Consider the important technical characteristics of the models, their advantages and disadvantages, and also pay attention to the main selection criteria. </p><h2>  Difficulty choosing </h2><p>  All <span>waterproof smartphones,</span> both inexpensive and premium, fall under the international standard, which just indicates the degree of protection of the gadget from water.  The general classification is quite impressive, and it does not include a small list of conditions, but we are only interested in two classes - IP67 and IP68.  The latter are just related to the segment of smartphones and fully reflect the characteristics we need. </p><h2>  IP67 </h2><p>  IP67 waterproof smartphones can survive the short-term immersion of the device to a depth of 1 meter, and are also completely protected from dust.  That is, the continuous operation of the phone in this mode is not assumed, nor is it guaranteed by this standard. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In simple terms: dropped into the water - picked up, wiped with a handkerchief and went on.  In addition, waterproof smartphones that support this standard can work in the rain, that is, it is like water, but not immersion, but something in between.  But, again, abusing conversations on a cell phone in a downpour is not worth it. </p><h2>  IP68 </h2><p>  Here we have maximum protection against moisture, which implies immersion and correct operation of the device at a depth of more than 1 meter.  In this case, you can safely go diving and at the same time respond to SMS. </p><p>  Neither moisture nor dust can get into a waterproof smartphone and disrupt its operation.  You can even talk for hours on end in the pouring rain, and your gadget will not care.  Naturally, devices that meet this standard are much more expensive than devices of class IP67. </p><h2>  Manufacturers </h2><p>  Many companies are engaged in the production of waterproof smartphones, but not everyone gets really high-quality gadgets in all respects.  For some, for the sake of protection, functionality or performance suffers, while others even put a fake mark on the received standard.  So in this case, it is better to trust trusted and well-established brands. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pulse.ng" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone manufacturers" class="if uuid-2447310" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2447310.jpg"></div><p>  Here we have already familiar companies that have repeatedly proved their worth and have launched more than worthy gadgets on the market.  These are devices from Samsung, Sony, Apple and LG.  Reviews about waterproof smartphones from these manufacturers are completely positive.  Moreover, the devices are obtained not only protected, but quite complete - with a good set of chipsets and attractive appearance. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Reviews about other manufacturers, alas, are not so flattering, so the choice of series should be approached especially carefully.  Otherwise, you will get either no performance with proper protection, or a plain brick that barely fits in your pocket. </p><p>  Next, we have a specific list and review of waterproof smartphones, which includes the most popular models with high-quality "stuffing" and a lot of positive feedback from users.  All gadgets can be found in free sale both in online and offline stores, so there should be no problems with "touch". </p><p>  The rating of waterproof smartphones is as follows: </p><ol><li>  LG V30 +. </li><li>  <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> S8. </li><li>  Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact. </li><li>  Samsung Galaxy A5. </li><li>  Apple iPhone X 256GB. </li></ol><p>  Consider the participants in more detail. </p><h2>  Apple iPhone X 256GB (IP67) </h2><p>  For many, the iPhone has been and remains the most coveted device, and the army of fans of "apples" is growing very quickly.  The tenth series turned out to be pretty and after the conservative models of past years it looks pretty fresh. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.takealot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone 10" class="if uuid-2447317" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2447317.jpg"></div><p>  The gadget received a very good set of chipsets, so it has absolutely no problems with performance.  In addition, we have a waterproof smartphone with a good camera.  Separately, it is worth noting the front peephole, which received a sensor that allows you to scan the user's face in three planes for subsequent unlocking of the gadget.  The main camera received a technical component almost identical to the average ‚ÄúDSLRs‚Äù, as well as functional, so there is no need to complain. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The device meets the IP67 standard and is not afraid of short-term immersions in water.  Also pleased and the battery life of the device.  Here we have a waterproof smartphone with a powerful battery, which in normal mode can go without a power outlet for days. </p><p>  One of the most powerful spoons of tar is the cost of the gadget.  An intelligent smartphone on the Android platform with the same standard of protection can be bought at two, or even three times cheaper, so the "apples" are very, very expensive. </p><p>  Estimated cost - about 85 000 rubles. </p><h2>  Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) / (IP68) </h2><p>  This model from a venerable producer, unlike the previous respondent, boasts a more than affordable price tag for the available characteristics.  Given that waterproof gadgets have never been low cost, in this case we have not only a secure, but also a high-performance smartphone at a very reasonable price. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.xtremeskins.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung Galaxy" class="if uuid-2447312" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2447312.jpg"></div><p>  As for the appearance, there is nothing to complain about: the glass covers look very fresh and attract the eye.  Of course, they collect fingerprints like a vacuum cleaner, but whoever interferes with taking and rinsing the gadget with a stream of water, the benefit of the IP68 standard fully contributes to this. </p><p>  There are also no questions about the device‚Äôs performance: the interface works smoothly, even without a hint of braking or lags, and applications run quickly and also go without delay on the FPS.  Although in especially "heavy" games you will have to reset the graphics settings to average values. </p><p>  The display, like that of other noble Samsung, came out worthy: bright, with good viewing angles and various useful "tricks", like Always-on-Display and Samsung Pay.  So there‚Äôs simply nothing to complain about.  Nothing bad can be said about the cameras - not "SLRs", but they work out quite worthy. </p><p>  Estimated price - about 20,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact (IP68) </h2><p>  Designers of the Sony brand, apparently, are working on the same wavelength with colleagues from Apple and almost categorically do not accept interference in the appearance of their gadgets.  Yes, the exterior of the models can be called brutal and attractive, but only a good half of users are already fed up with it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="estore.sonymobile.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sony smartphone" class="if uuid-2447311" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2447311.jpg"></div><p>  Nevertheless, the army of fans of the brand is impressive, and many turn a blind eye to such conservatism.  In addition, the performance of gadgets and the "filling" as a whole has always been distinguished by a qualitative component.  The XZ1 Compact was no exception. </p><p>  A powerful processor (Snapdragon 835) will digest everything that you offer it, and will not even choke.  There are simply no lags, friezes and subsidence on the ‚ÄúFPS‚Äù here: the interface, along with third-party applications, works like a clock, that is, as the developer intended.  Also distinguished were the cameras, which received an excellent matrix, which fully supports the super slow motion mode. </p><p>  As for protection against water, the IP68 class allows you to bathe and drown your smartphone without regard to dust and dirt.  I didn‚Äôt let the battery down either.  The battery capacity is enough for a couple of days of moderate load. </p><p>  Estimated cost - about 25,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Samsung Galaxy S8 (IP68) </h2><p>  This is another sensational representative of the venerable Samsung brand.  The flagship model in the first place can boast of its excellent screen, made using Super AMOLED technology.  This made it possible to achieve an aspect ratio of 18: 9 at 5.8 inches. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bestbuy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="galaxy s8" class="if uuid-2447315" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2447315.jpg"></div><p>  Also pleased with the appearance of the device.  S8 is like a breath of fresh air after conservative ‚Äúapple‚Äù models or the same ‚ÄúSony‚Äù.  Judging by user reviews, the design of the gadget is just eye candy, and the phone itself is simply nice to hold in your hands. </p><p>  The smartphone's performance did not disappoint either.  A powerful set of chipsets allows you to run the most "heavy" gaming applications without looking at the graphic settings.  There are no questions to the cameras either: an excellent matrix, high-quality shooting and an abundance of related functionality. </p><p>  Estimated price - about 45 000 rubles. </p><h2>  Features of the model Samsung Galaxy S8 </h2><p>  The only fly in the ointment that particularly annoys the domestic consumer is the assistant call button.  On our open spaces, it does not work in principle, but often pops up on the screen when accidentally pressed, which is very annoying. </p><p>  As for protection from water, everything is fine here as well.  IP68 certification allows you to calmly ‚Äúbathe‚Äù your smartphone without fear of damage.  The battery life has an average, so for a couple of days moderate loads of the gadget should be enough. </p><h2>  LG V30 + (IP68 + punch) </h2><p>  This is a rare exception when shockproof and waterproof characteristics are qualitatively implemented in one smartphone.  Here we have a typical flagship from a famous brand.  The gadget's performance is at the S8 level from Samsung, which means that there will be no problems launching even the most demanding applications. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bhphotovideo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone lg" class="if uuid-2447314" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2447314.jpg"></div><p>  The device received an excellent matrix with the current 18: 9 ratio on OLED technology.  So you don‚Äôt have to worry about image quality, as well as viewing angles.  Separately, it is worth noting the latest generation communication modules that swing almost 5G and ideally withstand all wireless protocols. </p><p>  But the main difference between the model and other flagships and "divers" is the protection against shock.  Of course, hammering nails with a smartphone or dropping it from a height of several floors, as happens with massive gadgets of the MIL-STD-810G standard, will not work, but it will survive the fall on the asphalt. </p><h2>  Distinctive features of LG V30 + </h2><p>  It is also worth noting the <span>speaker system</span> perfectly implemented in the phone <span>,</span> which will delight any music lover, especially if you connect to it a branded headset that comes with the device.  In addition, the camera, which had a record aperture of f / 1.6 in this segment, was very pleased.  The output pictures are of excellent quality, even in adverse weather. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone lg v30" class="if uuid-2447313" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2447313.jpg"></div><p>  As for battery life, here we have excellent results.  The gadget received one of the most capacious batteries in its class, which is able to work calmly for three, or even all four days in moderate mode. </p><p>  It will be useful to pay attention to the number of awards received by the smartphone at specialized exhibitions, as well as an abundance of flattering reviews from users.  Yes, buying a phone will cost a tidy amount, but the gadget fulfills the money invested in it in full.  Moreover, the brand very often holds all kinds of promotions, where this flagship also participates, so about once a month you can come across a very good offer at branded points of sale.  In general, this model rightfully takes first place in our ranking. </p><p>  Estimated cost - about 50,000 rubles. </p>
