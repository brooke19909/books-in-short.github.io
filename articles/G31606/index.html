    <h2>  Tourist village "Cedar Island" (Altai Mountains): reviews </h2><p>  The guests of the complex like the location of the base, as well as its large, beautiful, clean and well-groomed area.  Cobblestone paths are laid between the cottages.  Many nice, cozy corners where you can sit.  The location itself is one of the best on the banks of the Katun.  Settle guests in the cottages of the base "Cedar Island" quickly and without delay.  Large parking, enough space for everyone.  Good staff in the restaurant, hearty breakfasts.  The dishes on the menu are also quite good - several types of fish and meat.  Sometimes they even give game.  The staff are responsive.  In summer, the houses are very good, and near the base there are many islands and sandy beaches.  It is best here to relax in large companies that occupy the entire cottage.  Then the price is negotiated with the owners especially, and depends on the season and the occupancy of the base. </p>
