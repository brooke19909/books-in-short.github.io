He delights and amazes anyone who comes here.  Sightseeing in the city is enough for 20 vacations.  And many tourists come for a short time.  During this time, it is impossible to see everything.  Therefore, what to visit in Rome in 3 days, you need to think in advance, and leave the rest of the attractions for the next visits. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sights of Rome" class="if uuid-2553935" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39114/2553935.jpg"></div><h2>  The eternal City </h2><p>  The city, in which all roads lead, was built by Emperor Romulus in 753 BC.  It was a tiny peasant settlement, which was destined to turn into a powerful power.  The ancient Romans were much more interested in war than in art.  Simplicity and modesty were most valued.  And the heroes of the stories were harsh and disciplined wars. </p><p>  It is not known whether Rome would become a cultural center, if not for neighboring Greece.  After the conquest of this country, the level of education has changed significantly.  From Greece, noble patricians wrote themselves highly educated slaves.  A flood of philosophers, architects, poets, actors, sculptors and educators poured into Rome. </p><p>  Noble citizens did not spare money for training.  They studied grammar, exact sciences, philosophy, theatrical art.  And among themselves, educated citizens spoke Greek. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In Rome, new temples and palaces begin to be built.  They are decorated with Greek statues.  The Romans absorb the culture of the conquered peoples.  At the same time, they retain their own unique spirit.  Without exaggeration, we can say that the <span>Roman Empire</span> gave mankind an outstanding culture and made a huge contribution to the development of civilization. </p><p>  For a long time there is no longer the people who inhabited this power.  Despite her power, she was destroyed.  One can only try to recreate the lifestyle of the ancient Romans from the preserved monuments of antiquity.  Places worth visiting in Rome are everywhere you go. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="41.90278349999999" data-lng="12.496365500000024" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="10"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/5/7/1/4571.png"></div><h2>  Public transport </h2><p>  The fastest way to get to Rome is by plane.  It is better to book a taxi from the airport in advance.  It will be much cheaper than looking for a car directly upon arrival. </p><p>  It is recommended to rent a car only if you plan country trips.  Otherwise, the money will be thrown to the wind.  In time to visit most of the sights in Rome, you can also use public transport.  But the city is unusually beautiful, so it is best to study it during hiking. </p><p>  Metro has three branches.  It starts working at 5:30, the last train leaves at 23:30, and on weekends the underground services can be used until 1:30. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.theaa.ie" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rome public transport" class="if uuid-2554018" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39114/2554018.jpg"></div><p>  There are about three hundred bus routes in Rome.  They begin to work at the same time as the subway.  Only 20 lines function at night.  Intervals between buses are 30 minutes. </p><p>  Tickets can be purchased at special vending machines, tobacco or newsagents, at large stations, and at night routes - from the driver.

Of course, the Colosseum.  The huge amphitheater is one of the most significant buildings of the empire.  Its wall consists of three tiers.  Once, each of them was decorated with columns made in different styles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  On the first tier was the emperor‚Äôs bed and the place of the patricians.  Magnificent statues made by the best craftsmen were installed.  In addition, the sculptures were located around the perimeter of the building, and its outer walls were decorated with marble slabs. </p><p>  The modern Coliseum has lost its splendor, but retained greatness.  You can watch it for 12 ‚Ç¨.  This price also includes a tour of the forums and the Palatine Hill.  Since this is one of the most popular tourist destinations, you will have to stand in a huge line of people who want to visit the Colosseum in Rome. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gkkroma.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Spanish square" class="if uuid-2553941" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39114/2553941.jpg"></div><h2>  The most beautiful squares of Rome </h2><p>  City squares are those places in Rome that you should definitely visit.

He later became a Christian church. </p><p>  The main mystery of the temple is its arch - it is the largest, not reinforced concrete dome in the world.  How he survived two millennia is incomprehensible.  Modern builders claim that the life of concrete does not exceed 600 years. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rom-info.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Roman Pantheon" class="if uuid-2553960" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39114/2553960.jpg"></div><p>  The temple is illuminated with a hole in the dome, 9 meters in diameter.

Nowhere is this dish prepared like in its homeland.  Therefore, a pizzeria must be visited in Rome. </p><p>  Most institutions that are located in the city center offer a low-quality product.  These pizzerias are designed for hungry tourists, not gourmets.

It‚Äôs hard to find a free table there, you need to book in advance.  But even if there is no place, fragrant pizza can be taken away. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bucketlist127.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Best Pizza in Rome" class="if uuid-2553955" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39114/2553955.jpg"></div><p>  You can try the most delicious pizza in such establishments: </p><ol><li>  Sforno.

They are working on its creation manually, in gelatories.  It is served immediately after cooking.  Each master has his own special recipe. </p><p>  The most ancient jelateria of Rome is Fassi.  The institution was officially opened in 1880.  This happened after King Vittorio Emanuel tasted a gelatto from a cart of a street vendor named Fassi.  The crowned lady really liked the dessert.  He helped the merchant open an ice cream parlor.  It is currently located at the Palazzo Fredro. </p><h2>  Italian shopping </h2><p>  Art, architecture and excellent Mediterranean cuisine are far from all that Italy is famous for.
