Despite the fact that they are not so popular, from this they do not become less valuable.  Any vacationer can swim there, sunbathe and just take a walk and enjoy the beautiful scenery. </p><h2>  The main features of the beaches </h2><p>  Japan is an island nation completely surrounded by the ocean.  The beaches are diverse - everyone can choose to their taste.  There are places with white sand, with tropical vegetation, even with black volcanic sand, and others. </p><p>  Most of the island is located in the Asian monsoon zone.  Therefore, the climate is mild, humid, i.e. subtropical.  Only in northern Hokkaido is the harshest climate.  A distinctive feature of the beaches of Japan is an underdeveloped infrastructure with a high level of technological development in the country.  But there is everything you need for relaxation: sun loungers, a shower, drinks and places for cars. </p><p>  Ideal cleanliness reigns on the beaches of Japan, because its inhabitants are very concerned about the preservation of the environment.  They strive to preserve some corners in the most natural form, therefore they do not expand the tourist infrastructure.  <span>The resorts of Japan</span> with beaches attract tourists with their green islands and white sand.  Fans of calm and beautiful nature should go to the Land of the Rising Sun. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cntraveler.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wild beach of japan" class="if uuid-3215765" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54146/3215765.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of the beach and swimming seasons </h2><p>  The swimming season begins in July and ends in early September, despite the hot weather this month.  The water in the ocean is warm - within +23 ... + 25 ¬∞ , but the locals no longer swim.  One possible reason is the periodic influx of jellyfish colonies. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Tourists who want to swim in the ocean start swimming in May.  But some believe that the best time to swim is from late August to mid-October.  Air and water temperatures remain optimal for swimming. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.japantimes.co.jp" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful landscape" class="if uuid-3215777" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54146/3215777.jpg"></div><h2>  How to relax on Japanese beaches </h2><p>  Men are most often found on the beach in Bermuda to the knee.  Women's swimwear is also conservative in style.  In the understanding of most Japanese beach holidays consists of walks, barbecue and active sports. </p><p>  Also, most of the locals do not just swim in the ocean, and is engaged in "riding the waves."  For this, not only surfboards are used, but also water mattresses, circles and other devices.  Many men swim well. </p><p>  One of the popular attractions on the beaches of Japan is water games and surfing.  Locals take all the rules very seriously and abide by them.  Therefore, tourists will not see the Japanese swimming for the buoys or swimming after the closing of the swimming season was announced.  The Japanese tan is not popular.  Therefore, everyone rests under umbrellas and do not go purposefully to take sun baths. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.tripadvisor.com/TravelersChoice-Beaches-cTop-g294232"><img itemprop="image" alt="beach holidays in Japan" class="if uuid-3215754" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54146/3215754.jpg"></div><h2>  Okinawa Prefecture </h2><p>  If you want to visit the beaches of Japan, then you should know: some of the most popular are located in <span>Okinawa Prefecture.</span>  This is the southernmost prefecture in the country.  Tourists often compare the islands of this archipelago with the famous Hawaii.  Okinawa is considered a real Japanese sea pearl: it is very beautiful there, plus everything, it is easy to get to this prefecture by domestic flight. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  On the island of Ishigaki are some of the best beaches in Japan.  There are very beautiful landscapes, and in the bay of Kabir amazingly white sand.  But unfortunately, swimming is prohibited there, so the Ishigaki island is suitable for those who want to simply admire the local beauties. </li><li>  Iriomote Island - Located next to Ishigaki.  Due to the fact that it is practically not populated, real tropical jungle and mangroves reign there.  Only on Iriomote you can meet rare breeds of wild cats, but they are not so easy to see.  Locals recommend riding the waves at low tide from the Yubu Island towards Hoshizuna Beach: there you can see grains of sand in the form of stars - an amazing and beautiful sight. </li><li>  Taketomi Island is the smallest, but it has a very luxurious beach hotel.  In Taketomi you can admire the incredibly beautiful scenery with "star" sand.  Be sure to visit the beaches of "Nishihama" and "Kondo". </li></ol><p>  There are other islands in Okinawa Prefecture worth visiting with no less beautiful landscapes.

There are no less picturesque places than in Okinawa Prefecture: </p><ol><li>  Yakushima Island has beautiful views and is the southernmost of the four main islands of the country.  There is one of the "wild" beaches of Japan.  The island is completely covered by tropical forests, in which the oldest trees in the world grow.  By the way, connoisseurs of Hayao Miyazaki‚Äôs creativity will especially like it: it was Yakushima who inspired him to create the famous anime ‚ÄúPrincess Mononoke‚Äù.  This island is also the habitat of large-headed sea turtles. </li><li>  Ibusuki Beach is known for its natural baths of hot springs of volcanic origin.  This place is suitable for those who like hot sand and who want to relax in such springs. </li></ol><p>  Kyushu Prefecture has some of Japan's most interesting beaches.  Pristine nature, sources of volcanic origin - all this attracts tourists and local residents. </p><div class="photo" data-original="theodora.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beach on Kyushu island" class="if uuid-3215758" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54146/3215758.jpg"></div><h2>  Shikoku Island </h2><p>  If the purpose of your visit to Japan is the sea and the beach, go to Shikoku Prefecture. </p><ol><li>  Naoshima is located on the Shikoku coast in the Inland Sea.

But you can easily get on a kayak and enjoy the rest. </li><li>  If you take a walk towards the southern coast of Shikoku, you can find yourself at Asakawa Odzuna Beach.  It is not as popular as others, so it is ideal for those who need a secluded and relaxing holiday.  It is on this beach that sea turtles come to lay eggs. </li></ol><p>  Shikoku Prefecture will appeal to lovers of a relaxing holiday and those who do not care about comfort, and most importantly - unity with nature. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.env.go.jp" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.env.go.jp/en/nature/nps/park/ashizuri/guide/view.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="beach on shikoku island" class="if uuid-3215761" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54146/3215761.jpg"></div><h2>  Honshu island </h2><p>  This prefecture also has some of the most famous beaches in the Land of the Rising Sun: </p><ol><li>  If you want something exotic and unusual, head to the southwest - there are Tottori sand dunes.

But those who decided to see also natural attractions, in reviews of the beaches of Japan, note that they are no worse than the famous Hawaii.  Also, some of them have the opportunity for surfing and diving.
