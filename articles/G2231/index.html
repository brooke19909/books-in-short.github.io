    <p>  Broken manufactory is only one way of organizing production in factories.  In order to better understand it, consider all the others.  In general, manufactories themselves appeared on the European continent as early as the 16th century.  Initially, they formed in the city-states of Italy.  A little later in many other countries - England, France, Holland. </p><p>  The first manufactories in the world appeared in Florence.  They were engaged in the production of cloth and wool.  Chompi worked for them - special wool combers who worked at the textile mills at that time.  <span>Shipbuilding yards</span> were common in Genoa and Venice <span>.</span>  But in Lombardy and Tuscany, silver and copper mining mines developed. </p><p>  One of the main differences between manufactories and other similar enterprises was that they were completely exempted from shop regulations and any restrictions. </p><p>  <span>In Russia, the first manufactory</span> was the Moscow Cannon Yard, which appeared no later than 1525.  It employed many workers of various specialties - blacksmiths, casters, carpenters, soldering irons.  Soon after, the Armory was organized.  Enamel and clothing production, chasing silver and gold were already concentrated in it.  The third Russian manufacture was the Khamovny Dvor, on which linen was woven, and the fourth - the Mint. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How did manufactories come about? </h2>

    <p>  There were several reasons that led to the opening of manufactories in Europe and Russia.  Firstly, this is a large-scale association under the roof of one workshop of a large number of artisans of all kinds of specialties.  Due to this, it was possible to establish the entire process of manufacturing the product in one place. </p><p>  Secondly, the emergence of manufactories was facilitated by the association of artisans of a single specialty in a common workshop.  As a result, each of them could perform a continuously defined operation. </p><h2>  Broken Manufactory </h2>

    <p>  There are several basic forms of manufactories.  One of the most common is a <span>diffuse manufactory.</span>  <span>This is a</span> special way of organizing production when the owner of the capital (most often it was a large merchant-entrepreneur) provides raw materials for subsequent processing to smaller village artisans (they were often called homeworkers). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Examples of diffuse manufactory are often found in textile manufacturing.  They can also be found in those places where shop restrictions did not apply.  As a rule, the rural poor, who at the same time had at least some property, went to a scattered manufactory, the definition of which you already know.  It could be a house, a small plot of land.  But at the same time, they were not able to provide for their families themselves, so they were forced to look for additional sources of income. </p><p>  With this type of manufacture, the worker received raw materials, for example, wool.  After that, he processed it into yarn, which was further taken from him by the manufacture, transferring it to another specialist for further processing.  He was already turning yarn into fabric. </p><h2>  Centralized Manufactory </h2>

    <p>  This is another way of organizing production in the Middle Ages.  In a centralized factory, workers processed raw materials together, while being in the same room. </p><p>  This type of manufactory is most widespread in those sectors of industrial production where the technological process involves the joint work of a large number of workers (from several tens to a couple of hundred people).  First of all, it is mining, printing, metallurgy, paper industries, production of sugar, porcelain and faience. </p><p>  In this case, the wealthy merchants and some successful shop masters became the owners of such manufactories.  As a rule, large manufactories of this type were created with the participation of the state.  So the work was organized in France. </p><h2>  Mixed Manufactory </h2><p>  There is also the concept of mixed manufacture.  With this type of production, single parts were made by single artisans, and assembly was already done in the workshop under the supervision of a master.  This type was in demand in the production of complex products.  For example, hours. </p><h2>  Factory Differences </h2>

    <p>  To compare diffused and centralized manufactories, it is necessary to find out their features.  The centralized type of production is characterized by the territorial unity of the entire production cycle.  The bottom line is that all operations and stages of production are carried out in one room belonging to the capitalist, which provides jobs for employees. </p><p>  It should be noted that the features and differences of the dispersed and centralized manufactures are difficult to fit into the table, since there are a huge number of them.  Therefore, we continue to consider only the most basic ones.  With a scattered type of production, the goods are, to a greater extent, produced outside the enterprise itself.  Tasks are simply handed out to artisans, each of whom works at home.  Moreover, they can live even in different villages.  At the enterprise itself, only the final creation of products is carried out.  This type does not require large premises for workers.  But here more careful control is needed over people and the tasks they perform.  This is the main feature of the dispersed and centralized manufactories. </p><h2>  Leading countries for economic development </h2>

    <p>  Manufactories became widespread during the era of great geographical discoveries.  Accordingly, intensive economic development was observed in those countries that were directly involved in these processes. </p><p>  It all began in 1492, when the Spanish navigator Christopher Columbus discovered a new mainland - America.  The next important step was taken in 1598 by the Portuguese traveler Vasco da Gama.  He paved the previously unexplored path from Europe to India.  And at the beginning of the XVI century, Fernand Magellan made the first trip around the world in history. </p><p>  After all these events, European trade could officially be called world trade.  In the first place, Portugal and Spain became the major colonial powers, whose seafarers were the first to make significant geographical discoveries.  At the same time, the business of Arabs, Venetians and Turks was in decline, which before that had actually monopolized the trade market with other continents. </p><p>  After some time, the economic center of the European mainland moved first to Holland, then to England, and later to the north of France.  It was in these countries that trade was developing by leaps and bounds, and new large industrial enterprises were formed. </p><p>  The next step was the relocation of manufacturing centers to the American continent.  Europeans began to actively develop gold and silver mines, sugar and tobacco plantations.  African slaves began to be brought to America centrally, which ensured the final result.  As a result, the Netherlands and England got the most profit from this.  In terms of economic development, these countries quickly overtook Spain and Portugal, which before that were in first place.  The states of the Iberian Peninsula, in many respects, also lagged behind because feudal relations in society were preserved there. </p><h2>  Manufactories in Russia </h2>

    <p>  In Russia, manufactories began to appear under Peter I. By type they were divided into patrimonial, merchant, state, peasant.  For several years, the new emperor rebuilt industry from small peasant and craft farms to manufactories.  At this time, about two hundred new factories appeared in our country.  Russian industry in those days, of course, had capitalist features, but mainly used the labor of involuntary peasants, which made it a feudal enterprise. </p>
