One of the simplest explanations will be the following: it is financial compensation for wages and other payments to those citizens who were insured, and due to various factors, including age, are no longer able to provide for themselves. </p>

    <p>  There are three types of labor pensions worth knowing about: </p><p>  - TA due to disability; </p><p>  - TP by age (old age); </p><p>  - TP associated with the loss of a breadwinner. </p><p>  The financing of pension payments is based on insurance contributions from employers.  Women who have reached the age of 55 years and men who have overcome a 60-year milestone can count on retirement.  These are fairly clear rules that give a simple answer to the question - what retirement age is relevant in the Russian Federation now.  But even if the citizen, as it were, reworked, this will not be left without attention. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the moment, the pension fund uses a rather complicated formula for calculating payments, but this is due to the desire to take into account various factors that may affect the amount of payments.  But, in general, trying to understand how to calculate an <span>old-age pension,</span> you need to consider the key indicators that are used in the calculation.  These are the following elements: </p><p>  - <em>warhead (base part).</em>  It is established by state bodies, taking into account the presence of dependent family members, restrictions on the labor process and age. </p><p>  - <em>LF (funded part of the retirement pension).</em>  This part is formed from the income from investing pension funds in the RF PF and voluntary insurance contributions. </p><p>  - <em>MF (insurance part of the pension).</em>  It directly depends on the pension capital, which, in turn, consists of two parts: this is the amount of insurance premiums after 2002 and the estimated pension capital before this period. </p><p>  In general, two blocks of information about a citizen are used in the calculation ‚Äî before and after the pension reform.  And ordinary people who want to figure out how to calculate their future retirement, <strong> </strong>  This fact must be taken into account. </p><p>  Further, this topic will be considered in more detail, taking into account factors that are relevant for various categories, including the military. </p><h2>  What is important to consider before calculating </h2><p>  To clearly understand how to calculate a future pension, you need to pay attention to some nuances on which the size of payments depends.  So, different groups of citizens and the calculation conditions will be slightly different: </p><p>  - Those who are retired, continue to work, can count on the fact that payments in their case will not be canceled and, moreover, gradually increase. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  - If a citizen is preparing for the end of the labor period and has worked a lot before the reform, then his experience and experience will be converted into points without any financial damage. </p><p>  - There are people whose age is already close to retirement, but they have not officially worked for 15 years.  This category of citizens, like people who do not have any experience at all, will be able to receive exclusively social pensions. </p><p>  - It is important to know that active work in two jobs will not bring tangible benefits.  This is explained by the following fact: the total number of points that will be awarded will actually remain at the level of citizens who receive official salaries from one employer. </p><p>  - Thinking about how to calculate the pension yourself, it is worth remembering that the illiterate distribution of interest between funded and insurance pensions can lead to certain losses.  The size of payments will be larger only if the priority category is accumulation. </p><p>  Well, it is quite obvious that the so-called salary in an envelope significantly worsens the pension prospect, since it significantly reduces the size of contributions. </p><h2>  About the points system and key changes </h2><p>  It is important to be aware that <span>pension reform</span> has made some changes to the accrual system, but all of them relate only to old-age payments.  In this area, those parts that made up the whole are now independent, separate elements of the calculation.  We are talking about insurance and labor pensions.  It is the insurance form that is determined by taking into account points.  To accumulate the required number of them, you need to make regular contributions to the category of insurance pension.  But it is important to take into account the fact that such changes are relevant for citizens whose labor activity was started in 2015.  Those who actively worked long before this period may not worry about changes in the system. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  But for young people, this will mean that in a process such as calculating a pension, the average salary will not be the only determining factor.  In general, in order to understand what kind of pension you can count on, you need to consider three components: </p><p>  - duration of work experience; </p><p>  - retirement date; </p><p>  - amount of deductions. </p><p>  If it was important for the previous generation to have only deductions in the required amount and at least 5 years of formal work experience, for young people the more complex system of requirements is relevant. </p><p>  First of all, the period of required labor activity has increased; every year it will grow until it reaches the 15-year mark.  This moment should come in 2025. </p><p>  Now - more specifically about the requirements for those who wish to receive a retirement pension: </p><p>  - First of all, you need to reach retirement age.  For women, it is 55 years old, while men will have to work up to 60. </p><p>  - It is necessary to work out a minimum length of service.  It is about a period of 6 to 15 years. </p><p>  - The final condition is the presence of the required number of points, which is 30 or more. </p><p>  Points are awarded automatically.  This will take into account such indicators as the size of contributions, seniority and the age at which a particular citizen will retire. </p><p>  Pension calculation formula <strong> </strong>  relevant for young people, should include all of these indicators.  If there is a lack of points or experience is too short, then the exit to a well-deserved rest is delayed by 5 years.  And in this case the form of pension - social or labor - will not be of key importance. </p><p>  Those who are actually completing their careers or are ready to cease their activities in connection with the approaching retirement age should not worry.  Although the indicators will be recounted, they either will not affect the size of the pension, or will lead to its increase. </p><h2>  The ability to receive bonuses </h2><p>  Under current law, citizens under certain conditions will be able to get extra points.  Such bonuses are awarded in the following cases: </p><p>  - When caring for children with disabilities.  For each year of such care, 1.8 points are awarded. </p><p>  - When a citizen performs military service in the army of the Russian Federation.  Here, 1.8 points for each year of service will also be counted. </p>

    <p>  - Women on maternity leave can also count on bonuses.  In such a situation, the accrual scheme changes slightly.  The traditional 1.8 ball brings the first year of the decree.  The next 365 days give the opportunity to get 3.6 points.  The third year of parental leave raises the level to 5.4 points.  If the duration of the decree exceeds a three-year period, then for each subsequent year the state will accrue 5.4 points. </p><p>  - Bonuses will also be available to those who care for a relative whose age exceeds 80 years.  Here the charges remain at the standard level (1.8). </p><p>  Continuing the theme of balls, we must once again draw attention to the importance of seniority.  As was written above, according to the old system, it was not a key indicator, where the size of contributions played a large role.  Now the situation has changed: in the formation of such a regular monthly allowance as a pension, an additional payment for seniority <strong> </strong>  will have one of the key values.  That is, those who worked for a long time will be counted as their long-term labor activity, which will have a direct impact on the size of the pension. </p><p>  If we talk about how points are calculated, then you need to pay attention to the following formula: </p><p>  <em>(IPO in year N / NGO in year N) * 10.</em> </p><p>  where IEP should be understood as individual contributions of a citizen to a pension fund, NGOs mean the norm of deductions, and the letter N is used to indicate a specific year. </p><h2>  Calculation scheme </h2><p>  Speaking about future payments to people who are close to retirement age, it is worth using a different scheme than in the case of young people who still have a lot of work to do. </p><p>  If a citizen of the Russian Federation began his career before January 1, 2002, then the following pension calculation formula is relevant for him: </p><p>  <em>P = FBI + MF1 + MF2 + CB.</em> </p><p>  Under the FBI you need to understand the fixed base amount of the pension, which is established by the state. </p>

    <p>  SCH1 is the insurance part of the pension for the calculation of which the contributions made by the employer until 2002 are used. </p><p>  SCH2 - insurance part, consisting of contributions after 2002. </p><p>  As SV, the valorization amount is determined and depends on the number of full years of experience. </p><p>  If you paint the calculation algorithm in stages, then the picture of the process will be somewhat complicated. </p><p>  So, first of all, the seniority coefficient is taken into account, which will have a direct impact on the size of the pension as a result.  It is calculated as follows: 0.55 units are assigned to men over 25 years of service before the reform (2002) and women over a 20-year period.  If this limit is exceeded, 0.01 units of the coefficient are added for each year, while this indicator cannot exceed the mark of 0.20.  So, in the framework of the topic ‚Äúhow to calculate future retirement‚Äù, initially you need to pay attention to seniority. </p><p>  Next, the calculation of the ratio of the salary of a future pensioner to the average earnings in the country 2000 - 2001  As an alternative, data can be used for any 60 months of work experience without interruptions. </p><p>  The size of the ratio should not exceed the level of 1.2.  If we are talking about the inhabitants of the far north, then this indicator will fluctuate in the region of 1.4-1.9 units.  This largely depends on the ratio to the salary centrally established in a particular area. </p><p>  At the next stage, the average earnings received are multiplied by a coefficient and an amount of 1671 rubles.  The last figure is the average monthly salary in the country for the 3rd quarter of 2001, which was approved for calculations.  The result is the amount of the pension recalculated in accordance with the new legislation. </p><h2>  Preferential pension </h2><p>  In this case, the question ‚Äúhow to calculate the pension yourself?‚Äù Is also relevant.  But in order for the independent calculations to be true, you need to perform several sequential actions. </p><p>  - For starters, it‚Äôs worth getting information about your position - does it belong to the category of preferential ones.  You can get this information on the PF website, which contains a list of professions that allow specialists to go on a well-deserved rest earlier than other citizens. </p><p>  - If the desired profession was found in the list, then further steps will be reduced to determining specific periods of labor activity, which are counted as seniority.  At this stage, it is important to pay attention both to the length of service and to the institution within whose walls you had to work, since there is also a list of enterprises related to the preferential category. </p>

    <p>  - <span>Having calculated the experience</span> and having dealt with the data about the former employer, you need to check whether the information received complies with the requirements of the current legislation.  Next, you should find out how many points guarantee the amount of worked years, taking into account the tariffs of pension contributions.  This information can also be found in the PF. </p><p>  - The received number of points must be multiplied by the pension coefficient, and as a result, the size of the preferential pension will be obtained. </p><h2>  Use of electronic service </h2><p>  Those who want to go the simple way, it makes sense to pay attention to the pension calculator, which is located on the official website of the RF PF.  This program will greatly simplify the process of calculating the required indicators. </p><p>  This service takes into account all relevant introductory notes that may affect the size of the pension and the time it takes to take a vacation.  All that is needed is to fill in all the proposed fields, which is a simple task. </p><p>  The pension calculator allows you to get the most objective picture.  When making calculations, he takes into account, for example, military service.  And although this period is not defined as seniority, a Russian citizen receives 1.8 points for it. </p><p>  All years devoted to official work are taken into account.  The exception in this case is maternity leave and maternity leave.  By the way, points for leave for child care are also taken into account. </p><p>  It is worth noting the fact that a citizen of the Russian Federation can receive a pension bonus of 25% if he has lived in the countryside and worked in the agricultural sector over the past 30 years. </p><h2>  What to do with Soviet experience </h2><p>  Many are interested in the fact how they will take into account the length of service acquired during the USSR, and whether it will have any meaning at all.  Without this information, it is difficult to understand how to calculate a pension for a woman born in 1961 <strong> </strong>  and other citizens who began working during the Soviet era. </p>

    <p>  First of all, it should be noted that the experience that was obtained before 2002, including before the formation of the Russian Federation, is taken into account.  If before the reform the number of working years reached the mark of 27, then a coefficient will be calculated for them.  Its size will consist of two parts: 0.55 for 20 years of service until 2002 and 0.01 for every 12 months in excess of the indicated norm, which will be 0.07 for a seven-year period.  As a result, the coefficient to which the salary will be transferred will be 1.2. </p><p>  But, unfortunately, for many citizens, the Soviet salary for calculating pensions is not actually taken into account.  Instead, the average wage for the country in the period from 2000 to 2001, which was equal to 1647 rubles, is taken into account.  The Soviet salary is deducted in order to accurately determine retirement capital.  To these indicators will be added deductions and experience recorded after the reform. </p><p>  On average, a citizen who has worked for 35 years and received a salary of 20,000 rubles.  will be able to rely on a pension of 35% of its size, that is, a little more than 7,000 rubles.  This, perhaps, not quite a rosy example of calculating pensions will be relevant for those citizens who have already worked actively during the Soviet era.  The only plus is that when working in retirement age, payments are saved. </p><h2>  Military personnel </h2><p>  The process of determining the size of the pension for this category of citizens has its own characteristics, which must be taken into account.  Therefore, understanding how to calculate a military pension, you need to know that in this case the pension calculator will take into account the following indicators: </p><p>  - The <em>length of service.</em>  The duration of labor activity has the most direct impact on the size of payments.  Only at the expense of this indicator can the military subsidy be increased by 50%.  Moreover, each irregular year brings an additional 3% premium. </p><p>  - <em>Disability resulting from a disease.</em>  In this case, the premium may reach 75%. </p><p>  <em>- Obtaining disability while serving in the army of the Russian Federation.</em>  In such circumstances, the pension can be increased by a maximum of 130%, but what exactly will be the size of the premium depends on the group received after a medical examination. <strong> </strong></p><p>  Speaking about how to calculate the pension of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, it is worth noting that it is formed in fact in the same way as the military.  Here, also, the <span>length of service</span> is taken as the basis of calculation <span>.</span>  Such factors as salary by special rank and position influence the increase in the level of payments. </p><h2>  How are things with IP </h2><p>  To obtain the right to <span>retirement, individual entrepreneurs</span> must have an experience of 15 years.  It is important to clarify the fact that the periods when contributions were made to the Pension Fund are determined as an experience, and it does not really matter whether active entrepreneurial activity was carried out at that time or not. </p>

    <p>  At the same time, FEs will be counted in the experience of the same periods as in the case of other citizens (decree, time in the army, caring for the disabled, etc.). </p><p>  As for <span>retirement points,</span> they will need at least 30 to retire. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  So, understanding how to calculate an old-age pension, we can draw the following conclusion: the state is aimed at the objective formation of the size of payments to different categories of citizens.  That is why there are so many introductory words in the calculation formula.    ,        -      . <strong> </strong></p>
