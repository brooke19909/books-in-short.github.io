    <p>  Sberbank of Russia is a unique financial institution that offers its services throughout the country.  Bank branches are located not only in almost every city of the state, but also successfully operate in the CIS countries, Germany and Switzerland, China, Turkey and India.  The range of financial services offered is very wide, which allows the institution to be classified as universal.  The partnership provides traditional deposits and a variety of loans, bank cards and money transfers, insurance and even brokerage services.  Back in 2013, about 43.3% of all deposits of the population fell to the share of the financial enterprise.  As for the volume of the state loan portfolio, it accounted for 32.7% and 32.1% (loans to individuals and legal entities).  Citizens of the country are willing to cooperate with the enterprise and do not even think about the question of whether Sberbank is the Russian bank. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Innovation at a financial institution </h2>

    <p>  Sberbank has always tried to keep up to date, improving the quality of customer service and trying to offer them innovative products.  The financial institution did a good job, giving its customers the ability to remotely manage their accounts.  Thanks to remote channels, such as Sberbank Online online banking and Mobile Bank SMS service, it has become much easier to distribute your funds and control financial flows.  Sberbank is the owner of the largest network of ATMs and terminals throughout the country.  The active participation of the institution in various social programs stimulating the development of national science and culture was noted.  For most, it simply does not matter who owns Sberbank of Russia, as its management and owners are excellent at coping with all tasks. </p><h2>  Monopoly or the result of regular efforts? </h2>

According to statistics, every second country contributor is a client of the institution.  The situation with loans is similar.  More than 30% of loans in the state are issued through the Security Council of the Russian Federation.  It is incorrect to say that the bank acts as a monopolist.  The history of the development of a financial organization in the coming decades will reach the mark of 200 years.  The institute's own capital is about 1.6 trillion rubles.  Considering the question of who owns Sberbank of Russia, we can say that it does not have a single owner, moreover, almost everyone can buy a part of the shares of a large financial structure. </p><h2>  Who is represented by the owner of the bank? </h2>

    <p>  The main owner of the financial institution is the <span>Central Bank of the Russian Federation,</span> in fact, the domestic government.  Its share in the authorized capital of the bank is 50%, but plus one voting share.  If we estimate the percentage of ownership in voting shares, then it will be equal to 52.32%.  A smaller half of the shares are owned by 270 thousand different <span>individuals.</span>  One tenth of the shares are owned by individuals.  A quarter of the shares of a financial institution are owned by foreign investors.  It‚Äôs very problematic to say who the owner of Sberbank of Russia is, because the institute‚Äôs shares are systematically bought and sold on the MICEX and RTS exchanges since 1996.  In the first quarter of 2007, the bank's management decided on an additional issue of auction papers, which allowed to increase the authorized capital of the enterprise by 12%.  In monetary terms, this figure corresponds to 230 billion rubles.  It can be noted that about 40% of all operations under the MICEX are directly related to the shares of the country's largest financial institution. </p><h2>  Why is it difficult to answer the question of who owns Sberbank? </h2><p>  Due to the fact that less than half of Sberbank shares are in free float, it is very difficult to reliably name their owners.  This information can be provided by employees of a financial institution, and even then only in that situation if the person who is interested in this information intends to purchase shares of the organization itself.  The list of those who own Sberbank of Russia is systematically changing for the reason that the purchase of shares of the latter, in most situations, is carried out for the purpose of earning.  This leads to a permanent change of ownership.  Today, the strategic and operational management of the institute is carried out simultaneously by three authorities: the Shareholders Meeting, the Supervisory Board and the Management Board of the bank.  The post of <span>chairman of the board</span> belongs to German Gref. </p><h2>  What does the federal law say? </h2>

    <p>  As of November 1, 2014, the CBR is the owner of 52.32% of Sberbank's voting shares.  If we consider in detail the question of who owns the Central Bank of Russia, we can note the ‚Äúguardianship‚Äù by the state over Sberbank.  About 47.68% of the shares are in public circulation today.  In accordance with federal law No. 86, the reduction or alienation of the share of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation in the authorized capital of Sberbank, which will lead to a reduction in the share of shares to less than 50% plus one voting share, can be carried out only on the basis of the federal law itself.  A reduction in the share of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation in the authorized capital is allowed, which will not lead to a reduction in the number of shares to less than 50% plus one voting share.  This decision can only be made after prior approval by the Russian Government. </p><h2>  First change in equity </h2>

    <p>  Until the decision was made regarding the sale of part of the shares of Sberbank of Russia in 2012, the CBR owned about 60.25%.  Only 39.75% of the shares were in public circulation.  Despite the change in the percentage of owners of a financial institution, answering accurately and unequivocally to the question of who owns Sberbank of Russia is problematic.  We can say that important decisions were made and are made by the state in the person of the Central Bank.  The rest of the shares are not aimed at dividing ownership, it serves to increase the profitability of a financial institution. </p><h2>  How to buy shares of Sberbank? </h2>

    <p>  Shareholders of Sberbank of Russia, as mentioned above, have been buying a share in the ownership of the country's largest financial institution since 2006 on the domestic MICEX and RTS stock exchanges.  Today <span>, securities</span> are traded on the Moscow Exchange and on the London Stock Exchange.  You can become a shareholder by contacting any bank branch located in the region where you live.  Registration of ownership is carried out in the presence of a document confirming the identity of a citizen of Russia.  When buying stocks on the stock exchange, you should know that their value can change dramatically not only within a few days, repeated changes in the price can be recorded during the day.  Considering the question of who owns the shares of Sberbank of Russia, we can talk about the large number of individuals whose list is constantly changing.  People do not consider stocks as ownership of the country's largest financial institution, but rather as a trading tool, through the sale and purchase of which you can get a stable income. </p>
