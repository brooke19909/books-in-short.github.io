They are sure that Kotva is fully consistent with the declared four quality stars.  Most of all, the guests liked the convenient location of the hotel in a fairly calm and quiet place, but not far from the mass of shops, restaurants, cafes and local attractions - the historic city of Nessebar. </p><p>  Extremely positive impressions were left by the hotel rooms themselves.  All tourists acknowledged that they were recently renovated and literally shine with novelty and cleanliness.  However, a little confused holidaymakers with the quality of room cleaning.  So, sometimes the hotel staff left the beds empty or did not replace the dirty towels thrown on the floor. </p><p>  As for food, in general, tourists were satisfied with the taste and quality, as well as a wide selection of dishes.  Those who ordered only breakfast at the hotel also did not complain, since there are a lot of restaurants near Kotva where you can eat deliciously at a very reasonable price. </p><p>  Our compatriots also liked the pools on site.  In their reviews, tourists note that the water here is always clean, and there are enough sunbeds and umbrellas for everyone.  Children are happy to frolic on the slides of a mini water park. </p><p>  As for the beach, here the opinions of tourists differ slightly.  So, someone was very pleased with the proximity of the beach (five minutes on foot), fine sand and a gentle entry into the sea.  However, some vacationers were embarrassed by the large number of vacationers on the beach, and therefore it is not always possible to find free sun loungers and umbrellas. </p><p>  In general, the majority of tourists from Russia and other CIS countries, the Bulgarian four-star hotel ‚ÄúKotva‚Äù, left, mainly a positive impression.  They would recommend this hotel to their friends and family. </p>
