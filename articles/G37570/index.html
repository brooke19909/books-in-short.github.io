The Russian Federation includes more than a thousand cities, and each is interesting in its own way. </p><h2>  Kazan is one of the most beautiful cities in Russia </h2><p>  The capital of the Republic of Tatarstan - the city of Kazan - is considered one of the most beautiful cities in Russia.  The city has a rich centuries-old history: it was founded at the beginning of the eleventh century.  Tourists come here to see the famous Kazan Kremlin and the Millennium Square.  The city has a truly unique culture: it is a multiconfessional settlement, the most common are Russian and Tatar cultures.  In Kazan, you can see the Annunciation Cathedral of the Kazan Kremlin, Epiphany Cathedrals, Peter and Paul Cathedrals, the Church of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, the Kul-Sharif Mosque, as well as the Galeev, Apanaevskaya, Sultanovskaya mosques.  Tourists are drawn here because the cultures here are wonderfully intertwined: Orthodox and Catholic churches peacefully coexist with mosques. </p><p>  In addition, Kazan is known for its beautiful streets, theaters and museums. </p><p>  Every year more and more tourists come to this beautiful city, and not only residents from neighboring regions come here: guests from far corners of Russia and also from abroad are not uncommon. </p><h2>  Hotel "Fatima" </h2><p>  Hotel "Fatima" (Kazan) is a three-star hotel located in the very center of the capital of the Republic of <span>Tatarstan.</span>  <span>The hotel</span> has a very good location, as it is located next to one of the main attractions of the city - the Kazan Kremlin.  In addition, not far from the hotel are the <span>National Museum of the Republic of Tatarstan, the</span> Kazan Circus, the Central Stadium, the Pyramid Cultural and Entertainment Complex, as well as the famous Bauman Street, where you can find a large number of shops and entertainment shopping complexes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  Hotel "Fatima" in Kazan is located at: st.  Karl Marx, house 2, near the metro station "Kremlin" (about 800 meters) and "Ploshchad Tukaya" (about 1 km). </p><p>  The hotel is just a fifteen minute walk from the train station and a forty minute drive from <span>Kazan Airport</span> : </p><ul><li>  Distance to the city center: 800 meters. </li><li>  Distance to the airport: 24 km. </li><li>  Distance to the train station: 1.5 km. </li></ul><p>  In addition to the fact that the hotel has a good location (within walking distance from the main sights of the city), hotel staff organize excursions for guests to the most interesting places in Kazan. </p><p>  The hotel has parking spaces for guests traveling by personal transport.  Guests who prefer public transport can not worry about finding city buses: the Aviation Institute stop is located next to the hotel, where buses number 22, 28, 83 and 89 stop. </p><h2>  Hotel Fatima in Kazan: contacts </h2>

    <p>  Guests describe the hotel staff as the most polite of what they met in their life.  The hotel rooms are clean, comfortable, they are cleaned on time and do not forget to change bed linen and towels.  People staying at the Fatima Hotel also note a good price / quality ratio.  The rooms are decorated in a restrained style, but it is pleasant to stay in them: they are always clean. </p><p>  If a person is accustomed to luxurious rooms with a chic interior, buffet breakfasts <span>,</span> then he would be better off choosing some other hotel.  Naturally, the price for accommodation will be significantly different from the price of rooms in the Fatima hotel.  Hotel "Fatima" (Kazan) was created for real tourists: it is comfortable, clean, with conditions close to home (which is very pleasant for guests). </p><p>  The hotel accommodates both tourists (this can be young couples, families with children or a large group of young people), as well as people who came to the capital of Tatarstan on a business trip.  The latter, as you know, due to their lifestyle, are quite picky in terms of service and food.  However, even businessmen and people who arrived in Kazan at work, note the high quality of guest service and very tasty food.  It should be noted that there are quite a lot of people in the cafe located on the territory of the Fatima Hotel.  This means that the food in the hotel is really delicious and good.  Only more expensive than in neighboring cafeterias and restaurants.  That is why some guests prefer not to overpay for local (albeit very tasty food), but go straight to the neighboring pizzeria or cafe, also located nearby. </p><p>  People who choose economy class rooms (single, double or triple), who have to use a shared shower room and toilet, located on the same floor, note the complete absence of queues for the bathroom. </p><p>  Many tourists prefer to use the services of hotel staff, who gladly make excursions for them to the most important sights of the city of Kazan: the Kazan Kremlin, the National Museum of the Republic of Tatarstan, the Kazan Circus, the Central Stadium, the Cultural and Entertainment Complex called Pyramid, as well as the famous Bauman Street, where tourists can find a large number of shops and entertainment malls. </p><p>  Someone writes that the hotel is too small and difficult to find.  However, most are sure that it is not possible to find a better location for the hotel that it has now: the hotel is located in the very center of Kazan, not far from the Kazan Kremlin and Millennium Square, but at the same time it is not noisy (which means that guests can relax after saturated excursions both day and night, and no one and nothing will interfere with them). </p>
