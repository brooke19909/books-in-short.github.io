The area occupied is 13,812 square kilometers.  Despite this, not every country can boast of such a huge number of beautiful places of both natural and man-made origin.  Montenegro is also famous for its coast, because the southwestern part of the state is washed by the Adriatic Sea. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.citiestips.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Castles and beaches of Montenegro" class="if uuid-2319323" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2319323.jpg"></div><h2>  Geography and climate </h2><p>  The state is conditionally divided into three parts: </p><ul><li>  the coast, where all the conditions for a vacation in Montenegro are organized; </li><li>  the plain is the center of the state where the largest and most significant cities are located: Podgorica and Niksic; </li><li>  mountain range. </li></ul><p>  In the country, the total coastline stretches for 300 kilometers, the length of the beaches is 73 kilometers, there are 14 islands in the sea.  In Montenegro there are more than 10 rivers, the longest is Tara, its length is 83 kilometers.  Many tourists come to the banks of this river: it is the most beautiful, the water in it is always around +15 ¬∞ C. Tara is famous for its rapids, so they go here for rafting on rafts.  Despite the fact that the river is on the UNESCO list, you can fish on it, and there are many fish here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are about 40 lakes in Montenegro.  The most visited and largest is Skadarskoe, which occupies about 475 square kilometers.  There are many forests in the country, which occupy about 41% of the total area. </p><p>  The northern part of the state has a continental climate, while the southern part has a Mediterranean climate, summers are hot and winters are very short.  In the mountains, summers are warm, but not hot, and winters are snowy. </p><p>  The summer holiday season in Montenegro begins in May and ends in October.  In the winter season they go to the ski resorts in the country.  And to get acquainted with the sights, they travel to the country all year round. </p><h2>  When is the best time to travel </h2><p>  Water and air temperature in Montenegro (in resorts): </p><ul><li>  April: air +20 <sup></sup> , water +14 <sup></sup> ; </li><li>  May: air +24 <sup></sup> , water +18 <sup></sup> ; </li><li>  June: air +25 <sup></sup> , water +21 <sup></sup> ; </li><li>  July: air +28 <sup></sup> , water +24 <sup></sup> ; </li><li>  August: air +31 <sup></sup> , water +24 <sup></sup> ; </li><li>  September: air +26 ¬∞ C, water +23 ¬∞ C; </li><li>  October: air +20 <sup></sup> , water +22 <sup></sup> . </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.visit-montenegro.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Marina" class="if uuid-2319338" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2319338.jpg"></div><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Montenegro is not only mountains and beaches, there are many beautiful landscapes and ancient buildings that fascinate with their beauty against the backdrop of magnificent nature.  No photograph will convey what a person sees firsthand. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.bespokeyachtcharter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Country view" class="if uuid-2319341" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2319341.jpg"></div><h2>  Tara Canyon </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews of Montenegro, this is a beautiful place in the country.  Rocky mountains, gorges and waterfalls.  The deepest canyon in all of Europe, the depth in some places reaches 1300 meters.  For this reason, rafting fans come here. </p><p>  Fans of beautiful landscapes should definitely walk along <span>the Dzhurdzhevich bridge</span> , which is a connecting ferry between the south and the north of the country.  This is the highest bridge in the whole state, so it‚Äôs even hard to imagine what beauties open from it. </p><h2>  Skadar Lake </h2><p>  This pond is the largest in all the Balkans.  It is located not only in Montenegro, but also in Albania.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äã390 square kilometers.  It is a natural reservoir and the only place in Europe where pelicans nest under natural conditions. </p><p>  On the shores of the lake are many monasteries and temples.  According to reviews of Montenegro, a beautiful pond, picturesque nature and ancient architectural creations make an indelible impression. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bespokeyachtcharter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Island in the sea" class="if uuid-2319344" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2319344.jpg"></div><h2>  Fortress island of Mamula </h2><p>  If you like ancient architecture, then be sure to visit the island of Mamula.  There are legends that previously the fortress, which is located on the island, served as a prison.  The name is given in honor of General Mamula, who served the Austro-Hungarian Empire and built a fort on the island, designed to protect against attacks from the sea.  The island is deserted, there are many rabbits and gulls. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  You can get here only by boat.  As a rule, visiting these places is included in the program of group excursions in Montenegro along with a trip to the Blue Cave. </p><h2>  Ostrog Monastery </h2><p>  The temple was built in the XVII century, it is a great shrine of the country.  The relics of St. Basil of Ostrog are stored on the territory of the monastery.  There are two buildings - the Upper and Lower Monastery.  Believers come here, but in order to be cleansed of sins, it is necessary to rise from the Lower to the Upper Monastery.  It is believed that from the top, St. Basil still watches over those who come, believing that people will sooner or later return to their roots. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.citiestips.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Saint stephen" class="if uuid-2319328" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2319328.jpg"></div><h2>  Car walks </h2><p>  What to see in Montenegro on your own by car?  In fact, by car you can go around the whole country, a very interesting route from the city of Budva to Kotor. </p><p>  On the way to Podgorica there are many interesting places, but it is better to go not along the mountain road, but along the tunnel and the old highway.  On the way, you will be able to see the beauty of Skadar Lake.  Further along the route will be the Daibab Monastery, which is near Podgorica.  This temple is located by the mountain, part of which is located in the mountain itself.  On the walls of the cave are the faces of the saints. </p><p>  It is recommended to leave in the morning, go to Podgorica, then to Ostrog, where even children gather.  However, a narrow serpentine leads to Ostrog, on which it is quite difficult to drive off with buses - this should be taken into account.  Since this is a holy place, then no short skirts, shorts and T-shirts. </p><p>  On the way there is the settlement of Cetinje, the former capital, so there are many attractions.  Drive to Lovcen along a narrow serpentine and remember that entry to the mountain range is paid, as this is the territory of the national park. </p><p>  There are many viewing platforms along the way, from where a magnificent view opens, it seems that you are at the top of the sky. </p><p>  A steep descent leads to the city of Kotor, from which <span>the Bay of Kotor</span> is perfectly visible <span>.</span>  On the descent, tourists are offered extreme entertainment - zip-line riding.  A little lower, after the cave, begins a new serpentine of 28 turns. </p><p>  Before reaching Kotor (a turn near the village of Trinity), you can admire the Austrian fortress of Goraja and the Tivat part of the Bay of Kotor. </p><p>  This is only a small number of places from the list of those that you can see in Montenegro yourself. </p><p>  If it is not possible to drive a car, then on all beaches and hotels group and individual tours of the country are sold. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.citiestips.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beach at the hotel" class="if uuid-2319333" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2319333.jpg"></div><h2>  Resorts </h2><p>  One of the most beautiful places in the country is the <span>Budva Riviera.</span>  Here is the resort town of Budva, the most famous on the entire Adriatic - these are sandy beaches and many hotels. </p><p>  3 km from the city is Becici - beaches with small pebbles 2 km long, it is about him that you can often hear reviews about Montenegro from visitors.  At the end of this beach is the village of Rafailovici - a whole tourist complex with developed infrastructure.  Here you can engage in active water sports or lie quietly on the beach.  In addition, the village is recognized as the best place for fishing. </p><p>  In the town of Petrovac there are beaches with red pebbles. </p><p>  6 km from Budva there is the village of Milocer.  This is one of the most prestigious holiday destinations.  Here is the former royal park.  Judging by the reviews of Montenegro, for rest here you need to stock up with enough cash. </p><p>  Nearby is the most prestigious resort - St. Stephen with extremely fashionable hotels.  Once 5 centuries ago it was a defensive fortress, which turned into a chic hotel-city.  If you settle here, then you can meet not only rich people, but also Hollywood stars.  There are many secluded coves on the coastline. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.citiestips.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City of Monterego" class="if uuid-2319327" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2319327.jpg"></div><h2>  Where to relax with a child.  Hotels with their own beaches </h2><p>  The question of where it is better to go with a child in Montenegro is not even worth asking.  You can settle in any village, all of them are suitable for families.  But, if you come to the same city of Becici, then with a child it is better to settle not on the first line, but further, where it is quieter.  Almost all the beaches in the country are gentle, so there will be no problems with children's bathing. </p><p>  Montenegro hotels with their own beach and adapted for families with children: </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td><p>  VelikaPlaza 3 * </p></td><td><p>  Located in the south of the country, near the city of Ulcinj.  The complex is surrounded by lush greenery, only 250 meters from the sea.  On the shore is soft <span>sand of volcanic</span> origin.  All hotel rooms and bungalows have all the amenities.  You can stay with meals, with breakfast and dinner. </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Becici 4 * </p></td><td><p>  The complex is located in the best resort city of the country.  It consists of 5 hotels, located two kilometers from Budva, where the beach is not as noisy as in Slavyansk.  The coastline is sandy.  It offers guests a lot of entertainment and diving. </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Island Hotel SvetiStefan 5 * </p></td><td><p>  The most famous hotel in the entire Adriatic because of the red sand on the beach.  The hotel itself is one of the few in a country of this level, so even Hollywood stars come here. </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  If you don‚Äôt like pushing on the beach, then you can choose non-peak months of the summer season, that is, June or September.  In June, most people only plan a trip, and in Montenegro it is already quite comfortable for a holiday.  In September, the weather is also beautiful, fruits ripen, so prices are falling. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.chrystal-clear.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kotor Bay" class="if uuid-2319339" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2319339.jpg"></div><h2>  Country Airports </h2><p>  Montenegro has two international airports.  The largest in the city of Tivat, the second in the capital - Podgorica, 11 km from the village itself.  Both airports accept flights from Moscow and Russia. </p><p>  Estimated prices for flights to Montenegro: </p><ul><li>  From <span>Moscow to Montenegro</span> (Tivat airport) you can fly for 3,000 rubles, to Podgorica for 6,000 rubles.  From Perm, Tyumen, Yekaterinburg to Tivat for a cost of 6,600 to 7,000 rubles.  From Rostov-on-Don to Podgorica for 16 715 rubles. </li><li>  From the capital of Russia to the city of Tivat, 2,000 km, the aircraft travels this distance in 180 minutes. </li></ul><p>  Montenegro is a resort for any wallet; here it will be cozy both for a not-so-wealthy vacationer and a guest with a big wallet.  There is not only the Adriatic clean sea, where the bottom is visible even at great depths - it is a country with a long and interesting history, with many architectural monuments among unforgettable landscapes. </p>
