And so far, interest in this game has not waned.  But what is chess?  Is it a sport, art or game?  One of the opinions says that it is, after all, a science, the basis of which is logic, because chess is a triumph of reason, which can also give aesthetic pleasure.  In this article we‚Äôll try to understand what the concept of ‚Äútaking on the aisle‚Äù implies in this interesting game.  How is this done and what does it give to a chess player? </p><h2>  Beaten field </h2><p>  Before we figure out what is the capture of a pawn on the aisle, let us familiarize ourselves with another term in chess.  The beaten field is directly related to our issue.  This field is that which is attacked vertically by the opponent's pawn in front of your pawn in the initial position.  You can make a move through the beaten field.  But that‚Äôs how the opponent gains the right to take the pawn in the same way as if it was moved only one square. </p><h2>  One field or two? </h2><p>  So, back to our question - taking on the aisle.  What do the rules of the game of chess say?  Taking on a beaten field means that the pawn has a special move, thanks to which it has the right to take the pawn from the opponent, moved immediately to two fields.  It should be noted that the battle is not the field where the second pawn made a stop, but the one that it managed to cross.  The first pawn is just on this beaten or crossed field and completes the capture exactly as if the enemy pawn moved only one square - one field. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  These are the rules </h2><p>  Such a situation can arise only when the pawn is on certain horizontals: for white - on the fifth, for black - on the fourth.  And the field that the enemy pawn crosses is under battle.  It is possible to take a pawn from the opponent only if this is done immediately, as soon as it is moved to two squares. </p>

    <p>  The capture on the aisle in chess (these rules have been negotiated for a long time) is lost if it is made by a wrong move.  And so it will be with every new party. </p><p>  If you plunge a little into history, you can find out that taking on the aisle and a beaten field was established in chess six centuries ago.  And this was simultaneously with the rule according to which it was allowed to make the first move with a pawn, and not one, but two pitches ahead.  The rationale for this rule is very simple: a pawn cannot move absolutely freely, provided that the aisle is under complete control of the enemy, not being afraid to be ‚Äúeaten‚Äù. </p><h2>  That same important move </h2><p>  The most important thing.  Taking a pass in chess is a special move of one pawn, the most important one, in which it can hit an opponent‚Äôs pawn, which is moved into two fields.  After all, it is known that a pawn can carry out its first move in the game two fields ahead.  That is, she jumps over one field. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On the "line of fire" is completely the wrong square, where the second pawn made a stop, namely the one that was crossed by it.  The first pawn will complete its capture on this crossed field as in the case where the opponent‚Äôs pawn moved only one field.  This has already been mentioned a little higher. </p><p>  So.  This will visually look like this: </p>

    <p>  A black pawn hits a white pawn, and thus stands on the beaten field, and not where the white pawn was (this happens with regular hits).  Taking on the aisle is possible only on the next move, because later this right does not apply. </p><h2>  Some conditions and rules that must be observed </h2><p>  Only a pawn can be beaten on the aisle.  Despite the fact that both the queen and the <span>rook</span> go vertically into two fields, it is not allowed to beat <span>these</span> pieces in the aisle. </p><p>  No other piece besides a pawn can take on the aisle.  This can be said to be an exclusive right, and it belongs exclusively to a pawn. </p>

    <p>  The ability to beat on the aisle is used to move this very pawn.  In other words, the next move.  And no other way.  Otherwise, the opportunity is lost. </p><p>  Since there are as many as eight pawns, theoretically there is a chance of taking as many as eight times on the aisle.  Only this applies to different figures. </p><p>  And it‚Äôs not necessary to hit the aisle.  I.e?  There are situations when taking on the aisle is a serious mistake.  What does it mean? </p><h2>  Take on the aisle.  To play effectively - doesn‚Äôt mean at all that it‚Äôs effective </h2><p>  Almost any beginner chess player is sure that taking on the aisle will be a very bright start to the game.  But do not forget at the same time that this, like all others, subsequent ones, is just one of many other moves.  He is no worse and no better than others.  And sometimes it can be a huge mistake, just like some other move. </p><p>  A striking example of this is the following photo.  So: </p>

    <p>  It clearly shows that Black made a move.  And White at the same time was tempted by the opportunity to take up on the aisle. </p><p>  Unfortunately, White has lost the rook.  The game was lost. </p><p>  In this particular case, taking on the aisle was a gross mistake.  And this was not necessary.  It was possible not to take a pawn, to play somehow differently, thereby trying to maintain the chances of winning. </p>

    <p>  Any chess player, both beginner and professional, should always remember that in this game the move is spectacular, or simply beautiful, not in every case will be the most correct and best.  You must always remember all the mentioned rules when taking the aisle during each chess game, because in another case you may encounter the most ridiculous and not very pleasant surprises, or even lose. </p>
