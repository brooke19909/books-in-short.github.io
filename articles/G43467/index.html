  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The system of international law in the modern world</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It is difficult to find any other concept that would be more extensive and diverse than the system of international law.  Our civilization, over a long period of its development, has gone a long way from tyrannical regimes and a slave system to a democratic society and the principles of observing the rights and freedoms of all citizens of the world.  A huge merit in this regard belongs both to international <span>public figures</span> and to society as a whole, which, as it developed culturally, came to the conclusion that the principle of free will should always be in the first place. </p><p>  So, the system of international law is a combination of branches of <span>international law,</span> which includes certain principles developed by the world community and underlying it.  In addition, the system of legal relations has a certain structure, which includes industries, sub-sectors and various legal institutions based on existing international law. </p><p>  It should be noted that the norms of international law are not identical in terms of the subjects and the influence on the one to whom they apply.  Despite all the efforts of the world community, many states have the right to refuse to make decisions on a particular legal aspect and regulate interactions in the state on the basis of internal norms and rules.  As a result, the system of international law is heterogeneous in its composition and may include some aspects that are implemented by different laws in different states.  An example is the moratorium on the death penalty, which is still in effect in many states.  This issue is still one of the most relevant in the system of international law, according to which many states have not yet reached an unambiguous conclusion. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>The United Nations</span> plays an important role in the adoption of world-class legislative acts <span>,</span> which periodically brings up important issues that concern most of humanity.  Thanks to this supranational structure created after the Second World War with the aim of observing the rights and freedoms of citizens, in general, a system of international law has emerged, which includes the international rights of individual states.  Each state has its own international law, according to which the state conducts foreign policy activities and interacts with other countries.  As the object of regulation of this right are <span>public relations</span> that develop between the main participants in political games on the world stage.  Moreover, it is interesting that the norms of <span>international law of</span> one and the same state can significantly differ from the domestic law of the same country.  Despite the fact that the system of international law must solve these rather slippery issues, many countries still apply double standards thanks to such a system.  All the efforts of the <span>world community</span> aimed at eradicating this, unfortunately, do not always give a tangible effect, so many difficult issues are still unsolvable. </p><p>  Being the highest order in the legal structure, the system of international law is in constant development, supplementing existing laws and principles with new legal acts.  The main positive feature of this order is that today the whole world is gradually coming to the realization that the rights and freedoms of citizens should always be put in the first place.  This common truth is known to all, but it is still very far from its full observance.  In support of this, a system of private international law was also created, which protects the rights of citizens to freedom of religion, free expression of their opinions, choice of language of communication, culture, values ‚Äã‚Äãand so on. </p>
