It is located on <span>the Sulak River</span> in the Dagestan Republic.  The reservoir is located at a distance of 140 km from the confluence of this water stream and the Caspian Sea.  Established in 1974.  During the establishment, several nearby agricultural lands and settlements were flooded: the village of Chirkey and the special village of the builders of the Druzhba hydroelectric power station.  On the map, the reservoir can be found at the following coordinates: 42 ° 58 ′ north latitude and 46 ° 53 ′ east longitude. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chirkey reservoir" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1376365.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Characteristic </h2><p>  The Chirkey reservoir in Dagestan covers an area of ​​42.5 km <sup>2</sup> .  Its coastline is heavily indented, canyons and caves are found in places.  Numerous bays and bays cut into low mountain formations.  The reservoir is located in a narrow gorge of the Sulak River.  Local picturesque landscapes vaguely resemble the <span>fjords of Norway.</span> </p><p>  The useful volume of the reservoir is 1.32 km <sup>3</sup> .  The coastline is over 85 km long.  In length, the reservoir stretches for 37.5 km, and the distance between the opposite banks is on average 7 km.  The maximum depth of this largest Dagestan reservoir was recorded at around 270 m. On the coast is the village of Chirkey, which gave the name to this reservoir, and the village of Dubki.  The zone in which it is located is seismically active.  Oscillations sometimes reach 9 points.  The facility is used for water supply and fishing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chirkey reservoir photo" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1376366.jpg" width="600"></div>

This continues until the spring.  And by the summer it rises again.  The Chirkey reservoir, the photo of which can be seen in the article, significantly changed the flow of water and reduced the amount of sediment on the river.  Sulak.  Previously, the <span>turbidity of water</span> was more than 3 kg / m <sup>3</sup> , but now this figure does not exceed 1 kg / m <sup>3</sup> . </p><p>  The reservoir carries out daily, seasonal and long-term regulation of water flows.  In summer and autumn, intense <span>waves, wind</span> and stock currents are observed here.  The pond in the winter does not freeze, the temperature in it rarely drops below +3 ° C.  Given the climatic features of the territory where Dagestan is located, the water begins to warm up already in April.  In summer, the temperature reaches +23 ° C.  Precipitation here falls no more than 350-380 mm. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chirkey reservoir in Dagestan" class="if" height="395" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1376367.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Underwater world </h2><p>  In this largest Chirkey reservoir there are 23 species of various algae.  The natural underwater wildlife was never abundant here, so not only fish, but also crayfish were artificially introduced here.  Today, such species as carp, barbel, trout, perch, and chub live in the Dagestan reservoir.  Fishing on the Chirkey reservoir is very popular. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition, this largest North Caucasian reservoir is regularly subjected to artificial stocking.  Basically, several types of trout are introduced here.  Despite the fact that fishing is very popular here (mainly carried out with swimming facilities), recreation centers and camps have not been erected on the coasts.  Tourists and locals who want to relax and fish in this artificial pond stay for the night in tents. </p><h2>  Ecological situation </h2><p>  Human activities led to sad situations - deforestation, which in the past surrounded the Chirkey reservoir.  And the point is not vandalism at all, but the fact that it was decided to make these areas more civilized and to erect new settlements in the places of destroyed green spaces.  However, this was not enough.  Due to the fact that there were no heating systems operating on blue fuel, the local population was forced to collect firewood to heat their homes.  All this led to a significant deterioration of the environmental situation, for example, to soil erosion processes, landslides.  But not everything is so sad, because visually some natural landscapes are preserved and unusually pleasing to the eye. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="chirkey reservoir rest" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1376368.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Flora and fauna of the region </h2><p>  The Chirkey reservoir is surrounded by various representatives of the flora.  Most of all there are desert bushes, wormwood, bluegrass, and hodgepodge.  And along the nearby steppes one can see a feather grass and an immortelle.  And among the animals that live on the coasts of the largest North Caucasian reservoir, reptiles are most often found.  Snakes live in the mountains, as their slopes are illuminated by the sun.  Among them, the most common are already, gyurza and snake.  In addition to snakes, some species of local lizards and turtles live here. </p><p>  The Chirkey reservoir has become home to many birds.  Among them there are both predators and waterfowl.  Some birds fly here for the winter.  In this area you can see the species that are listed in the Red Book of the Dagestan Republic.  And among mammals in the surrounding territories live wild boars, foxes, gophers, hares. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fishing on the chirke reservoir" class="if" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1376370.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Located high in the mountains of the Chirkey reservoir.  Rest here, as they say, is wild, without any benefits of civilization.  Currently, the facility is intended to meet energy needs, as well as for industrial water supply to settlements in Dagestan, including for irrigation of agricultural land.  You can get to this reservoir by personal transport.  The road in the form of a serpentine, quite narrow.  For those who do not have a car, it is recommended to use buses.  You need to get to the village of Dubki, and from there - by taxi to the reservoir. </p>
