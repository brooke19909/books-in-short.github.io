    <p>  Among the shortcomings are small portions of fruit, as well as an uncomfortable road for children to the beach: through the highway, which is always overloaded with cars. </p><p>  Service at the Macedonian Sun Hotel 3 * pleased many tourists.  Workers at the registration desk at any time with purely national hospitality try to make their clients' holidays enjoyable, prompt and tell about everything that interests the guests.  The waiters in the restaurant always serve customers with a smile. </p><p>  No less successful, many call the location of the hotel.  Walking in Kallithea, visiting cafes and taverns where you can taste Greek dishes for every taste, please yourself with strong coffee and delicious ice cream, cozy shopping streets, olives, wine, sirtaki ... All this is Greece - an amazing country in which I want to return. </p>
