Why is Red Square named Red?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The most important place in Russia is <span>Red Square.</span>  Why is that called?  There are several versions, any of which can be considered correct.  The color of beauty, a symbol of growth and magnificence is forever entrenched in the name.  Another assumption is based on the fact that this name is derived from the word "beautiful".  After all, historically important events, colorful events, fateful meetings with the heads of neighboring peoples took place here. </p><h2>  Origin Options </h2><p>  Researchers did not come to an unequivocal opinion on the question: Why is the Red Square so called?  Initially, after all, it was not of that color, because the only decision was made to accept the origin of the name from the word "beautiful".  However, it was still painted much later in bright colors, and this was done in the Soviet period. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Red Square why so called" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41986/1491999.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Why is Red Square so called?  Origin Options: </p><ol><li>  Because she is that color. </li><li>  Communists called it that. </li><li>  The road to the Red Porch goes through it. </li><li>  Why is Red Square so called?  There is also an unofficial version.  A long time ago a foreigner came to Moscow and admired the view of a beautiful place.  He was Japanese by birth and expressed his delight through the word "red".  However, he meant ‚Äúcool,‚Äù but the name was firmly entrenched.  Many perceive this case as unreal; there is constant debate around this scenario. </li><li>  The name was attached due to the trading red rows, which were a great many in Ancient Russia. </li></ol><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Why Red Square is called "Red", you can search the annals of past events.  Sources claim that the name is found in documents of the 18th century, long before the appearance of the revolutionary banner.  According to historical data, mention of the expression "Moscow is white-stone" is everywhere found. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Why is the red square called red" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33726/1492602.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the 15th century, wooden structures near the Kremlin were removed.  At first, trade was formed here, buildings gradually grew.  The first name sounded like ‚ÄúTrinity Square‚Äù, later it was called ‚ÄúFire‚Äù.  Only in 1612 does the history of the name "Red Square" begin. </p><p>  <span>On a solid platform there were riots, parades, and public gatherings.</span>  <span>There is evidence that the slabs were already long before the appearance of the concrete coating in 1930.</span>  <span>The area was covered with mud and water during the great flood, which was recorded in ancient paintings.</span>  <span>The new paving stones were laid on top and did not begin to clear a few meters of silt with the ground.</span> </p><h2>  Linguistic features </h2><p>  Why Red Square is called "Red" is not entirely clear.  After all, the Kremlin walls were bleached and the sidewalk was covered with light concrete slabs.  Finding no logical explanation, there is no other way for the origin of the name of the country's main place to come up with the word "beautiful". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Why is the red square so named" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33726/1492601.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The linguistic features of the language of that time help to understand why Red Square is so named.  The word "red" always meant something better, beautiful, unique.  So were other objects: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  The red corner is an ancient form to highlight the best place in the hut, where the icons were placed.  The school of Soviet Russia also designated the location of plants and animals. </li><li>  Red maiden - gifted with natural beauty. </li><li>  The red word is a beautiful expression. </li><li>  Spring is red - this is how the bright colors of flowering plants and the appearance of green foliage were described. </li></ul><h2>  Where else in the Russian language were similar names used? </h2><p>  It becomes clear why Red Square has such a name, if you delve into the basics of the dialect of the ancient language.  The same word is used in Old Russian proverbs, sayings.  Remained historical evidence, the so-called Prince Vladimir - "Red Sun". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Why the red square has such a name" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41986/1492004.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In Slavic languages, you can find a similar meaning of the word "beautiful": </p><ul><li>  In Bulgarian, "beautiful." </li><li>  In Serbian and Croatian "krasan". </li><li>  In Czech, krasny. </li><li>  In Slovenian krasan. </li></ul><p>  The name of the square is taken from here, as the best place in the country to emphasize the importance of the territory.  Mention of semantic meaning is given in the well-known and extant poem "The Word about Igor's Regiment".  There is other evidence of origin in linguistic science.  The Soviet period led to a shift in the linguistic meanings of words: the adjective "red" forever became associated only with color. </p>
