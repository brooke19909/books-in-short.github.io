The settlement was founded at the end of May 1953, and after several decades it grew to the size of a big city.  Today, the Yangtze is the capital of the Yanbian-Korean Autonomous Region.  In this part of Northeast Asia, there are three largest cities that are secretly called the ‚ÄúGreat Golden Triangle‚Äù.  These include Vladivostok, Sidzhen and Yangtze. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="yangtze city" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29024/2067422.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Short description of the city </h2><p>  For an ordinary person from Russia, the name of this city does not mean anything, but when translated into Russian, it means ‚Äúa happy future‚Äù.  And although the city is quite large (almost 500 thousand people live here), but by Chinese standards it is considered cozy and small.  Photos of the Yangtze city will allow you to see and appreciate all its attractiveness and beauty. </p><p>  Tourists celebrate a special atmosphere here.  Many people like that no one pays attention to them, does not bother with various offers in order to lure a foreigner more money.  In just a few days, the traveler feels almost like a local. </p><p>  Since the city is located near South Korea, a large number of Koreans live here - about 50%.  Thanks to this, the city differs from most other settlements in the country.  All the inscriptions here are made in two languages ‚Äã‚Äã- Chinese and Korean. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="yangtze city" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29024/2067421.jpg"></div>

Since more than half of ethnic Koreans live here, those who arrived in the Yangtze have the opportunity to get acquainted with two cultures at once.  For example, there are restaurants with traditional Chinese and Korean cuisines.  Being in this place, one involuntarily gets the impression that you are in two different countries at once. </p><p>  Among the attractions of the Yangtze city, it is worth noting Mount Maoershan, the highest plateau of eastern Eurasia.  Also popular places for tourists to visit are the amusement park, zoo, botanical center, water park. </p><h2>  Natural heritage </h2><p>  Some cities visit shopping centers, others visit architectural structures, while others admire the beauty presented by Mother Nature.  It is really extraordinary and majestic here, and a striking example of this is Mount Maoershan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="yangtze city attractions" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29024/2067453.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Translated from Chinese, "Maoershan" means "hat".  And in fact, from afar, the mountain looks like a hat.  It is worth noting that it is completely low, so almost everyone can climb it through a special staircase to the very top.  Passing this path, a tourist will see an incredible panorama of the city.  It is from here that it is best to start acquaintance with the Yangtze. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Locals love Maoershan very much and visit it every morning in order to do exercises at the top or just breathe in the clear mountain air.  There are also beautiful forest lands where tall pines, poplars and elms grow. </p><p>  Not far from the Chinese city of Yangtze is the highest plateau in this part of the world - Changbai.  It is located in the natural park, which is the largest in the country.  It was created three years after the appearance of the city.  In 1980, this UN plateau was included in the list of reserves of the international biosphere. </p><h2>  Yangtze City (China): Attractions </h2><p>  The water park was built in 2015 at the MDM complex, which also houses a ski resort.  It is located just 20 minutes from the center, within the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="yangtze city water park" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29024/2067458.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The cost of tickets is quite high, the admission ticket for one adult has a price of 260 yuan, admission is free for children.  However, children are considered only those who have less than 120 centimeters of growth. </p><p>  On the territory there is a small shop where a person can buy all the necessary bathing equipment.  Before entering the main zone you will have to plunge into a small pool with cool water, in which there is a special disinfectant composition. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Inside there is one pool for the smallest with two low slides.  Next is another miniature pool, with a large number of underwater jets of hot water.  In the center of it <span>is a</span> labyrinth of slides. </p><p>  The next pool simulates the sea, where waves of various sizes constantly go.  For fans of active entertainment there are two large slides.  On one of them, you can get a special mattress for free, and on the other you have to purchase it for 30 yuan. </p><p>  There are also many small cafes and fast food establishments on the territory, where very good food is sold.  In the city of Yangtze, the water park is the most ordinary, which does not differ in a wide variety of slides, but it is perfect for active pastime and getting positive emotions. </p><h2>  Amusement park </h2><p>  Tourists from Russia most often visit one of the main attractions of the city - an amusement park.  It has everything you need for a good rest: attractions, a zoo and walking areas among dense landings. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="yangtze city photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29024/2067456.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Despite the fact that there are a fairly large number of tourists, there is no need to talk about the modernity of the park.  The attractions here are very mediocre and ordinary, the zoo does not differ in a huge number of exotic animals, but the children like it here. </p><h2>  A few words about interesting places </h2><p>  A few kilometers from the Yangtze city there is a bear farm, here you can see many bears of different sizes and ages. </p><p>  Lovers of vegetation can visit the Gomao Botanical Center.  The garden is indoor and can be visited at any time of the year.  Agree, it‚Äôs nice to visit a place where fresh greens grow in the midst of a fierce winter. </p><p>  There is also a "Green" restaurant, where the main detail of the interior is vegetation.  In this institution, guest artists perform every evening.  The institution is very fond of both locals and foreigners, so there is almost always a full guest hall. </p><p>  Not far from the restaurant there are "stars" of the local public - greenhouses where you can see exotic cultures.  The botanical center also has a beautiful square; locals like to relax in it. </p><p>  Well, and, of course, which Chinese city today does not have shopping malls that have long become attractions?  The Chinese city of Yangtze may well be proud of its high-rise shopping centers, where you can buy products for every taste and budget. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="yangtze city china attractions" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29024/2067418.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  River and lake </h2><p>  A river runs through the whole city.  It conditionally divides the Yangtze into two parts and is called "Puerkhatun", which is translated into Russian as "green river".  You can get to another part of the city through one of the three bridges. </p><p>  Not far from the river is a very popular lake among the local population.  Until the end of the 80s, it was no different from most city ponds, but the authorities decided to improve the reservoir.  The shores here were lined with decorative tiles, beautiful arbors were erected, and they were built in the Korean style.  The planting of many trees turned an ordinary lake into a kind of oasis in the center of the "stone jungle".  This pond is called "youth."  Guess why? </p><p>  A must visit point in the Yangtze must be Ginseng Street, where you can buy all the currently known medicines and products made from this particular plant. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="yangtze city photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29024/2067423.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Little Korea in China </h2><p>  There are a lot of beautiful places in the Yangtze, it will not work to tell about all.  Despite the fact that, in comparison with other Chinese megacities, this settlement has a modest size and small population, the city attracts with its unusual culture, because ethical Koreans and Chinese live here side by side.  Their culture is so mixed up that many people simply do not understand what country they are in.  Geographically - China, in appearance - typical South Korea. </p><p>  The Yangtze <span>is a</span> rather interesting and unusual city, therefore, if the opportunity arises, then it is certainly worth coming here. </p>
