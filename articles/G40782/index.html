For some, he will remain just the first president of the country.  For others, he will be remembered as a talented reformer who radically changed the political and economic systems of the post-Soviet state. </p><h2>  Childhood and family of the future president </h2><p>  The official biography of Boris Yeltsin suggests that his homeland is the village of Butka, located in the Sverdlovsk region.  It was there, according to this source, that he was born on February 1, 1931. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The first president of Russia" class="if" height="311" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35049/985556.jpg" width="600"></div>  But many researchers actively dispute this fact.  Indeed, in this place, which is considered the birthplace of a politician, was a hospital.  And his family lived in a different place - located near the village of Basmanovo.  This is due to the fact that the sources include the name of both the first and second settlements.

    <p>  The parents of the first president of Russia were ordinary villagers.  My father was a builder who fell under repression in the thirties and spent a very long time in Soviet camps.  There he served his sentence.  Having fallen under an amnesty, he returned to his native village, where at first he was an ordinary builder, and after a while he took the position of head of a construction plant. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The politician‚Äôs mom was a simple dressmaker. </p><h2>  Education for the future political leader </h2><p>  9 years after the birth of the boy, the family moved to the city of Berezniki.  Here he began to go to high school.  The future first president of Russia has long been <span>a class</span> leader <span>.</span>  But to call him an exemplary student is extremely difficult.  Teachers remembered him as a pugnacious and restless boy. </p><p>  Due to the presence of these qualities in the life of Boris Nikolaevich, the first serious problem arose.  During a game with his peers, a future famous politician found an unexploded German grenade.  This find very interested him, and he made an attempt to disassemble it.  As a result, Boris Yeltsin lost several fingers on his hand. </p><p>  Later this became the reason that the well-known first president of Russia never served in the army.  After graduation, he became one of the students of the Ural Polytechnic Institute, who successfully graduated and received the specialty of civil engineer.  Despite the missing fingers on his hand, Boris Nikolaevich became a master of sports in volleyball. </p><h2>  Career politics </h2><p>  After graduating from the university, the future president of Russia became an employee of the Sverdlovsk building trust.  It was here that he first became the representative of the CPSU party, which positively influenced his career advancement.  First, the chief engineer, and soon the director of the Sverdlovsk DSK Boris Nikolayevich often attended various party congresses. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Who was the first president of Russia" class="if" height="431" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35049/985555.jpg" width="600"></div>  In 1963, at one of the meetings, he became a member of the Kirov District Committee of the CPSU.  And after some time, Boris Yeltsin represented the Sverdlovsk Regional Committee of the CPSU.  His party position included overseeing housing issues.  But the career of the future great politician was rapidly gaining momentum.

This position belonged to him for nine years. </p><p>  During this time, in the Sverdlovsk region, issues directly related to the provision of food were resolved.  Tickets for milk and other goods were abolished, some poultry farms and farms began to work.  In addition, it was precisely due to the initiative of Boris Yeltsin that the construction of the subway in Sverdlovsk began.  Cultural and sports complexes were also built. </p><h2>  <span>Political activity</span> in the Supreme Council </h2><p>  After this time, Yeltsin becomes a representative, and over time he is appointed to the post of People's Deputy and Chairman of the <span>Supreme Council of the RSFSR.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="University named after the first president of Russia" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35049/985554.jpg" width="586"></div>

    <p>  Being actually the leader of Soviet Russia, he very seriously and categorically criticized the communist system, which his voters could not fail to notice.  In addition, the future president earned respect among them after the signing of the Declaration of Sovereignty.  This document legally secured the primacy of Russian laws over Soviet ones. </p><p>  When on December 8, 1991, President of the SSR Mikhail Gorbachev was isolated and virtually removed from power, the future first president of Russia, the leader of the RSFSR, was one of the signatories of the <span>collapse of the USSR.</span>  This event took place in Belovezhskaya Pushcha with the assistance of the leaders of Ukraine and Belarus. </p><p>  This was the beginning of a career as an independent Russian leader. </p><h2>  President's career </h2><p>  After the collapse of the USSR, a lot of problems arose in the Russian state, the solution of which fell on the shoulders of Boris Yeltsin.  During the first years of independence, there were numerous problematic economic phenomena, sharp appeals of the population.  The name of the first president of Russia is inextricably linked with the bloody military conflicts that began at that time on the territory of the Russian Federation and beyond its borders. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The name of the first president of Russia" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35049/985548.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The conflict with Tatarstan was resolved peacefully.  At the same time, the settlement of the issue with the Chechen people wishing to get rid of the status of a union autonomous republic and part of the Russian Federation could not do without armed conflicts.  Thus began the war in the Caucasus. </p><h2>  Retirement </h2><p>  The presence of a large number of problems significantly lowered Yeltsin‚Äôs rating.  But despite this, in 1996 he still remained president for a second term.  His competitors then were V. Zhirinovsky and <span>G. Zyuganov.</span> </p><p>  In the country, the presence of many crisis phenomena related to the political and economic systems was observed.  The first president of Russia was sick, his rating did not rise.  The combination of all these factors led to the fact that December 31, 1999 Boris Yeltsin resigned.  After him, the chair of the <span>President of the Russian Federation was</span> taken by Vladimir Putin. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="First President of Russia Yeltsin" class="if" height="378" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35049/985547.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  After the resignation, the great politician was destined to live only eight years.  His heart disease went into a chronic stage.  This provoked the death of the great <span>politician of Russia</span> on April 23, 2007.  The first president of Russia, Yeltsin B.N.  buried at the Novodevichy cemetery, which is located in Moscow. </p><p>  Nowadays, there is a university named after the first president of Russia. </p>
