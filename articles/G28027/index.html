The hotel has its own 650 meters long beach, equipped with canopies and sunbeds, with a sand cover. </p><h2>  A bit about the resort </h2><p>  As we already mentioned, Sentido Orka Lotus Beach Hotel 5 * is located near the village of Icmeler.  Not so long ago, the village was considered part of the Marmaris resort area, but lately the region has been developing more and more and is becoming surrounded by its own tourist infrastructure.  More and more tourists come here every year, and accordingly the number of hotels is growing. </p><p>  Almost all hotel complexes of the resort have vast territories with gardens and beautiful beaches.  Since they were all built not so long ago, they are made in accordance with all modern standards. </p><p>  The climate of the resort can rightly be called ideal, because there is always a comfortable temperature.  Even in July and August there is no intense heat.  And the sea in the bay of Icmeler is always calm and clean.  The gently sloping coast makes the resort attractive for families with children.  The purity of the coastal waters attracts diving enthusiasts.  And the marine inhabitants of local waters are so diverse that they are worth seeing: sea turtles, barracudas, dolphins, eels, lobsters, octopuses and many others.  Here you can see real Mediterranean red corals. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sentido orka lotus beach hotel 5 reviews" class="if" height="243" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1980800.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The most remarkable place for divers is the seamount, which has many caves and tunnels.  Novice diving enthusiasts can work out at the diving school to improve their own level. </p><h2>  Sentido Orka Lotus Beach Hotel 5 *: reviews </h2><p>  Continuing the review of the hotel, I want to pay attention to the reviews of tourists who have already rested in it in order to understand how good it is. </p><p>  Sentido Orka Lotus Beach 5 * (Turkey, Icmeler) is located in a very picturesque place on the side of a mountain surrounded by pine forests.  Only one combination of pine needles and a sandy beach will amaze lovers of sea holidays.  This resort area is characterized by natural beauty, even the air is filled with the scent of forests and the sea.  Icmeler is preferred by those tourists who do not like sandy rocky landscapes along the coast. </p><p>  The hotel complex is located on the coast.  Its vast territory is well-groomed and surrounded by greenery.  The rooms overlook the sea, pines or overgrown mountain slopes.  Near the hotel along the coast to Icmeler there is a promenade along which you can walk or ride a rented bike in the evenings.  In general, beautiful nature is one of the main advantages for which it is worth visiting the resort. </p><p>  Hotel Sentido Orka Lotus Beach 5 * is very large.  On its territory there are many buildings.  The rooms in them are almost identical.  All of them are quite modest in size, but they are very thought out and functionally equipped.  The laconic interiors of the rooms are made in a calm range.  The apartments are connected to the central air conditioning system, which perfectly copes with its task.  But the quality of wireless Internet leaves much to be desired.  Internet in the hotel is very unstable.  It disappears with a frequency every ten minutes.  Moreover, the situation is the same in the lobby, so communicating with relatives on Skype is problematic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sentido orka lotus beach 5 marmaris reviews" class="if" height="243" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1980808.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The rest of the hotel rooms leave a good impression.  But as for the service, its level does not correspond to the declared five stars.  Room cleaning is far from regular, as evidenced by the reviews of tourists.  Even left a tip does not always save the situation.  And the quality of cleaning leaves much to be desired.  In some cases, men work as maids.  Replacing bedding and towels is also a problematic issue.  Many tourists received fresh linen only after repeated requests and applying for a reception.  The room service staff is slow and of poor quality.  It is noticeable that there are not enough working hands. </p><h2>  Catering reviews </h2><p>  For most vacationers, the issue of food is one of the main when choosing a hotel.  It is food that always causes a lot of controversy and complaints, which is logical, since well-organized food is the key to a successful holiday.  This issue is especially relevant for people who go to the resort with children.  Reviews about Sentido Orka Lotus Beach 5 * in terms of nutrition are pretty good.  Tourists note a large selection of dishes, which, perhaps, do not differ in variety, but in principle are quite acceptable.  If you are a foodie, you will not see any special dishes here, but you will not stay hungry either.  There are always fruits and wonderful Turkish desserts on the tables.  At local bars you can order drinks, their quality is quite normal.  For a change, a la carte restaurants are worth a visit. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel sentido orka lotus beach 5 marmaris" class="if" height="243" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1980816.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The main disadvantage of the main restaurant is the staff.  The waiters are extremely slow and reluctant.  Nobody offers drinks, and it’s not worth asking, because the staff does not have time to clean the tables.  According to experienced tourists, this level of service does not match the five stars of the hotel. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel ... </h2><p>  Sentido Orka Lotus Beach 5 * (Marmaris) - a beautiful complex on the sea coast, surrounded by coniferous greenery.  An incredibly beautiful place is simply amazing in the beauty of nature.  However, the general positive impression, as often happens, is spoiled by a fly in the ointment - this is the hotel staff.  According to numerous guests, the service of the hotel complex is not delivered up to standard.  The reception service is extremely slow and reluctant to respond to the requests of vacationers, sometimes you have to repeatedly apply on the same issue to resolve it. </p><p>  As for the animation in the Sentido Orka Lotus Beach Hotel 5 * (Marmaris), it is very mediocre.  There are very few good events, and they are held irregularly.  But the children's animation is very popular with young guests.  The mini-club has good educators who organize leisure activities for guests by age categories.  The hotel has a separate pool with slides for children. </p><p>  Ponds for adults are very small.  Near them there are equipped recreation areas with sunshades and sunbeds.  Near the pools, as a rule, there are absolutely no vacationers, since everyone prefers to sunbathe by the sea, especially since it is very close. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sentido orka lotus beach 5 Turkey Icmeler" class="if" height="243" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1980815.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It is worth noting that the hotel is a significant savings on staff and vacationers.  So, for example, there is no person in the hotel who helps to lift things to the floor and deliver them to the room.  Such a service is standard for every institution, even with fewer stars.  And there are a lot of such moments in the hotel.  Of course, you can close your eyes to many flaws in the service, which is what vacationers do.  However, if you are a demanding person and plan to get good service, then you should definitely look for another place to stay. </p><h2>  Coast Reviews </h2><p>  But the beach of Sentido Orka Lotus Beach Hotel 5 * (Marmaris) can be called the pride of the hotel.  The sandy coast near the hotel is one of the best in the Icmeler area.  The white sand combined with the emerald green of the forests is a stunningly beautiful sight.  The spacious beach of the hotel has a length of about 650 meters.  It has all the necessary equipment, a bar.  Even when the hotel is fully loaded, there are free sunbeds on the coast.  Thanks to the sandy bottom, the water in the sea is clean and clear.  A comfortable gentle slope makes swimming possible even for babies.  The hotel territory is located on the very shore, on the side of the mountain, if you are lucky and get a room with a view of the coast, then from the windows you will admire the stunning sea landscape. </p><h2>  Travel and entertainment </h2><p>  Resting in Sentido Orka Lotus Beach 5 * (Marmaris) (the reviews are given in the article), you can diversify your vacation with trips and sightseeing.  As in any hotel, there is a representative of a travel company who will help to understand this issue. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sentido orka lotus beach hotel 5" class="if" height="243" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1980822.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Resting in Turkey, as a rule, tourists tend to go shopping.  However, Icmeler is not the best place in this sense.  It is better to visit Marmaris, where you can buy locally produced goods - this is suede and leather products (bags, jackets, belts, wallets, etc.).  In addition, ceramics, figurines, jewelry made of silver and gold are bought here.  But to buy branded shoes and clothes in Marmaris is not worth it, because the prices are set and many fakes are sold. </p><p>  In the very center of the historical part of the city there is a famous shopping center called “Charshi”.  It is safe to buy handmade lace, fabrics, sweets, cosmetics, bath accessories, souvenirs and many other goods at quite reasonable prices.  Experienced tourists recommend shopping to this center.  Another such large store is located in the Netsel Marina area. </p><p>  Marmaris is known throughout Turkey for its unique sweets and numerous varieties of honey, which are sold in every supermarket.  It is honey that is worth buying here, since you will not find such a huge choice anywhere else.  The largest supermarkets are Tansas and Kipa. </p><p>  And, of course, in Marmaris it’s worth going to the central market.  This is a very colorful place, like any <span>eastern bazaar.</span>  The market sells leather goods, copper and bronze jewelry, original Turkish carpets, embroideries, fabrics, souvenirs and paintings, fruits, vegetables and the famous pine flounder honey.  The bazaar is located in a large two-level building, it works on Sundays and Thursdays.  Traditionally, traders reduce product prices by evening. </p><h2>  Resort Attractions </h2><p>  Going to Marmaris, it is worth seeing the fortress, which was built by Suleiman the Magnificent.  The city was chosen by the Sultan as the General Staff for the attack on Greek Rhodes.  The powerful fortification is impressive to this day.  Currently, a museum is open in it. </p><p>  Near Marmaris is a very interesting attraction - Nimara Cave.  He is named after the nymph.  In ancient times, the Greeks worshiped nymphs, believing that they live in caves, on trees and in rocks.  Currently, the cave is more like a grotto; getting to is not so easy, so you need to be prepared for a long walk. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel sentido orka lotus beach 5" class="if" height="243" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1980823.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  A very beautiful place is the island of Sedir.  The ancient history of Marmaris and the island is inextricably linked with the Egyptian Queen Cleopatra.  It is believed that once Cleopatra walked along the sandy coast of Sedir.  Legend has it that the island was presented as a gift to Queen Emperor Mark Anthony.  But Cleopatra did not really like the sand of the beach.  Therefore, the warlord in love with the queen ordered to send a flotilla to the coast in order to bring the usual Egyptian sand for Cleopatra.  Whether this legend is true or not, but such a beautiful sand cover can be found only in two places in the world - Egypt and Sedir Island. </p>
