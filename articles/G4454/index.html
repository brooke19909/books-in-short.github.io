It is in order to have a roof over your head, to use a car and various household appliances, we use the only means to get them - money.  When there are not enough of them to purchase goods, we go to the bank.  At the same time, we are trying to save money, and for this we again use the services of the above-mentioned institute. </p><p>  At the same time, in each city and settlement you can meet a representative office of not one, but several banks at once.  Take, for example, the famous and large city of Kazan.  Hospitable streets were sheltered by branches of many credit organizations in Russia. </p>

    <h2>  Liquidated and affiliated institutions </h2><p>  The list of banks in Kazan includes more than 80 institutions.  Moreover, some of them have a head office in the city.  It was in this locality that such banks as Akida, Alfa-Bank Kazan, Zarechye, Idel and many others were born.  For the healthy functioning of the lending sector, each institution of this type is issued a license, which can be revoked by government bodies in case of failure to comply with the requirements.  Such a fate affected the banks "Reef", "TatOneximBank", "Tatpromstroybank" and others.  The list of Kazan banks that were merged with other organizations is also long.  As a rule, in such cases, large financial giants "adopt" smaller institutions.  This happened with the banks SK and Tatinfrabank.  The first joined the Volga-Kama credit and financial institution.  The second found its place among the branches of AK Bars. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Local banks and CER members </h2><p>  Despite the ‚Äúout of order‚Äù, the list of banks in Kazan still contains the names of the indigenous ‚Äúcentenarians‚Äù.  These include financial institutions such as Mortgage Invest, Kara-Altyn, Network Settlement Chamber (until March 2006 it was known as Credit Kazan) and many others. </p><p>  <span>Banking</span> in Russia is regulated by various sets of rules and mechanisms.  For a more precise organization of the actions of financial institutions, various associations are created.  One of them is a <span>deposit insurance</span> system (CER).  She gathered under her "wing" a huge number of institutions, which include the banks of Kazan.  The list of institutions includes the financial and credit organizations AK Bars, Avangard, Avers, Bashkomsnabbank, Bogorodsky and many others. </p>

    <h2>  Agent Banks </h2><p>  Currently, it is impossible to imagine a wallet without the presence of any plastic card in it.  The easiest way to service this means of payment is the bank branch that issued it.  However, there are other options.  So, in the absence of a branch of the necessary institution, you can turn to another institution for help.  At the same time, this institution must have the rights to service plastic cards issued by other organizations.  Such financial credit institutions are called agent banks.  It is noteworthy that they can perform additional functions.  In particular, to act as a guarantor of protecting the interests of any syndicate of an international nature in matters of lending or issuing securities.  The list of banks in Kazan has the following institutions: Absolut Bank, AK Bars, Alfa Bank and others. </p>
