  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Connecting the washing machine to the mains: safety rules and procedure</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  After acquiring an automatic washing machine, one of the most important conditions for its safe and high-quality operation is the correct connection of the unit to the power supply network.  In case of failure of the washing unit, the manufacturer does not retain the right to warranty service and repair.  This is indicated in the user manual, which must be carefully studied and strictly observed. </p><p>  Compliance with safety rules and operating procedures will allow you to connect your washing machine to the power grid with your own hands to any zealous owner who is familiar with the basics of electrical engineering.  If this issue is of certain difficulty, then it is better to consult a specialist than to endanger your health. </p><h2>  General connection features </h2><p>  The washing machine is a high power electric appliance.  When the unit is operating, power consumption can reach from one to four kilowatts.  Therefore, when choosing a suitable model, it is necessary to consider what section the electric wires are laid in the apartment.  The safe operation of the equipment will depend on this. </p><p>  Checking the load capacity of the wiring can be carried out by measuring the diameter of the core and the material from which it is made.  Then, using a special table, you need to determine what equipment in the apartment will function normally. </p><p>  Do not connect the washing machine to the mains in the following cases: </p><ul><li>  electrical wiring and socket do not match the power of the washing unit; </li><li>  use an extension cord to connect the machine to the mains; </li><li>  simultaneously connect multiple devices to the same outlet. </li></ul><p>  Compliance with these requirements will allow you to safely operate your home helper. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Outlet Requirements </h2><p>  To avoid the occurrence of a fire hazard, the washing machine must be connected to the mains via special connectors.  Old existing outlets in the home are very often not designed to include high-power devices in the network, which can lead to overheating and often damage the washing machine. </p><p>  Of the basic requirements for the connection point of the washing unit, we can distinguish: </p><ul><li>  It is necessary to install a socket with a ground contact, designed for a current transmission of 10 to 16 A. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="anamericaninrome.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Special three-pin socket" class="if uuid-2884271" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70222/2884271.jpg"></div><ul><li>  It is advisable to use special waterproof IP65 sockets, where the first digital value indicates the degree of protection against dust, and the second figure - protection against moisture. </li><li>  If it is not possible to install a special circuit breaker, then <span>sockets with a residual current device (RCD),</span> which is mounted inside the device, are used. </li><li>  Installation of the connector must be done away from plumbing equipment (bathtub, water supply device). </li><li>  The socket should be placed at a distance of 60 cm from the floor to avoid cases of flooding of contacts. </li><li>  Do not install the outlet on the outside wall of the building to avoid condensation. </li></ul><p>  Do not connect the equipment to an existing outlet if it does not correspond to the class of the washing machine in technical parameters.  When installing the machine in a room with high humidity, the degree of protection of outlets must be taken into account. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Cable routing for connecting the washing machine </h2><p>  In the event that the home electrical network is made with wires of the wrong section and material, you will have to lay a separate line.  In doing so, the following points should be considered: </p><ul><li>  Copper wires with three conductors and a cross section of 2.5 mm are capable of withstanding a rather high load; </li><li>  the power cable must necessarily have one core, which will be connected to ground in the electrical panel; </li><li>  The washing machine is connected to the mains only with a wire that meets all the technical parameters of the model of the purchased unit. </li></ul><p>  To work on laying the cable was less energy-consuming, first of all, you should decide on the installation location of the outlet.  With a large distance from the switchboard, it is necessary to produce a long section of gating. </p><p>  In the walls of soft material, the cable channel is easily made with a hammer and a chisel.  But for work in the room where concrete reinforced partitions are installed, you will have to use a puncher and a grinder.  At the first stage, a place is prepared for installing the outlet, and then a channel is made for wiring. </p><p>  It is also possible to use special decorative skirting boards that will preserve the aesthetic appearance of the room and simplify the process of laying the cable. </p><p>  If it is difficult to do the work on preparing the mains by yourself, it is better to call an electrician at home, the prices for such services depend on the length of the cable channel. </p><h2>  Features of the residual current device </h2><p>  To increase the safety of operation, it is necessary to install a residual current device in the connection circuit of the washing machine to the mains.  This device is designed to shut off the current supply if, for any reason, a leak has occurred. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Structurally, the RCD can be combined with an electric circuit breaker, and can also be performed as a separate element of the protection circuit.  When installing the washing machine in the bathroom, the use of the device is mandatory, as this is a room with high humidity.  Unlike simple fuses, the protection device is designed for multiple use.  After its operation, the system can be returned to working condition, eliminating the cause of the malfunction. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ellgaman.am" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The protective shutdown device of the washing machine" class="if uuid-2884178" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70222/2884178.jpg"></div><p>  Structurally, the RCD consists of the following nodes: </p><ul><li>  transformer; </li><li>  network breaking schemes; </li><li>  a mechanism for self-testing; </li><li>  electromagnetic cutoff; </li><li>  instrument case. </li></ul><p>  In the power supply circuit, a protective device is connected in front of the machine.  The operating current of the protection must be higher than the trip current of the machine. </p><h2>  Network Input Machine </h2><p>  Also, to connect the washing machine to the mains, it is necessary to install an automatic machine in the switchboard to protect the wiring and the working unit from short circuit.  The calculation of the power of this device is made depending on the load of the network, as well as on the diameter of the wiring. </p><p>  A home electrical network usually includes a 16 A circuit breaker, which is safe for connecting many household appliances at the same time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="secondhand-generators.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Electrical switchboard with input circuit breakers" class="if uuid-2884204" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70222/2884204.jpg"></div><p>  After equipping the <span>electrical switchboard with</span> all the necessary protection systems, you can begin to consider how to properly connect the washing machine to the mains. </p><h2>  Grounding the washing machine </h2><p>  Grounding is also one of the types of protection of a washing machine and a person from electric shock.  In apartment buildings of an old construction, the sockets did not have an earth ground contact.  Therefore, the installation of modern washing machines is of some difficulty.  For high-quality and safe operation of the unit, you will have to pull an additional wire to the electrical distribution panel, which necessarily has a grounding bus. </p><p>  Residents of a private house can arrange their own grounding.  For these purposes you need: </p><ol><li>  The ground wire from the outlet must be brought to the base of the building foundation. </li><li>  Then, to a depth of two meters, you need to drive a piece of reinforcement into the ground, a piece of 30 cm should stick out. </li><li>  Perform a high-quality cleaning of the fittings and securely wind a piece of wire (you can weld it by welding). </li><li>  The attachment point of the ground wire is well insulated. </li></ol><p>  After the grounding device, the wire can be connected to an outlet. </p><p>  Do not ground by connecting the wires to the water and gas pipes, especially if the washing machine is in the bathroom.  Such a connection is dangerous both for the owner himself and for his housemates. </p><h2>  Machine connection via residual current device </h2><p>  To carry out work in an electrical panel, you need to call an electrician at home.  The price of the service depends on the availability of special protective equipment.  Independent electrical work in the switchboard is prohibited, as you may have to disconnect the mains power supply. </p><p>  There are two options for connecting the machine through an RCD: </p><ol><li>  Connection through a common apartment protection device.  With this method, damage to the unit will cause a complete blackout in the entire room. <div class="photo" data-original="eltstroy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Connection scheme through a common RCD of the apartment" class="if uuid-2884188" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70222/2884188.jpg"></div></li><li>  Inclusion of a separate <span>residual current device</span> in the circuit of the washing machine <span>.</span>  In this case, if a current leakage occurs, the electrical power will be turned off only in the unit circuit. </li></ol><p>  When connecting the washing machine through an RCD, the main factor is the compliance of the electrical protection parameters with the power consumption of the unit. </p><h2>  Surge Protection </h2><p>  In the user manual, manufacturers indicate the supply voltage of the unit, taking into account deviations from the nominal value (220 V +/‚Äì 10%).  Deviation of the voltage value from this indicator poses a threat to operating household appliances. </p><p>  Some models of modern units are equipped with a built-in system of protection against voltage surges, because when the power drops to 180 V, the equipment stops working. </p><p>  In order to guarantee protection of the unit against voltage drop, it is necessary to install an additional voltage stabilizer. </p><p>  At low voltage, the motor of the unit has little starting power, and it works in the mode of inrush currents.  This leads to the fact that the engine cannot overcome the starting torque, which is fraught with failure. </p><p>  High voltage is also detrimental to the engine.  Therefore, in homes where there is instability in the electrical network, care must be taken to install a voltage stabilizer. </p><h2>  Features of connecting a washing machine in the kitchen </h2><p>  Modern designers propose to equip the kitchen premises of the apartment with various built-in appliances.  Therefore, along with dishwashers, refrigerators and various ovens, the built-in washing machine in the kitchen looks very modern and beautiful. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cosycottagegravir.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Connect the built-in washing machine in the kitchen" class="if uuid-2884253" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70222/2884253.jpg"></div><p>  In apartment buildings in the kitchen, a special outlet is installed to supply power to the electric stove.  But often gas stoves are used in homes, so connecting the built-in washing machines to the mains can be done to the stove outlet. </p><p>  The process of connecting the washing machine will consist in some alteration of the power line for the washing unit. </p><p>  Built-in sockets in the kitchen can withstand the additional load of the washing machine.  It is necessary to conduct a three-wire cable to the installation site of the unit.  Work on laying the cable can be done by ditching the wall, but you can also use special boxes that will not spoil the appearance of the room and will serve as reliable protection for the cable. </p><p>  After laying the cable, it is necessary to install a protective shutdown device, as well as an automatic shutdown.  Connect two sockets, and the power of the built-in <span>washing machine in the kitchen</span> must be placed at a distance convenient for connecting the unit.  Protective devices can be hidden in special junction boxes. </p><h2>  Connecting a washing machine in the bathroom </h2><p>  The bathroom is classified as a room with high humidity, therefore, special requirements are imposed on the electrical wiring in it.  The likelihood of electric shock in such a room rises very significantly, especially since people are often in the bathroom in undressed form. </p><div class="photo" data-original="finestayslovenia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Washing machine in the bathroom" class="if uuid-2884290" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70222/2884290.jpg"></div><p>  The outlet in a hazardous area is best taken out into the corridor.  But if this arrangement does not work, then it is necessary to install a waterproof socket with a cover with a degree of protection of at least IP44. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.plumbingproducts.ie" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Waterproof socket with cover" class="if uuid-2884211" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70222/2884211.jpg"></div><p>  Wires must not be laid in metal hoses or pipes.  All switchboards and switches must be removed from the premises. </p><p>  Protection against electric shock in the bathroom must be provided by grounding and protective shutdown device.  When performing grounding, you can not use water pipes, since the ingress of voltage to these elements poses a threat to the life of the owner of the premises, as well as home neighbors.  For the grounding device, it is necessary to route a separate wire to the electrical switchboard.  The diameter of the grounding conductor must be not less than the cross-section of the electric wire in the apartment. </p><p>  The residual current device must be mounted in the switchboard. </p><p>  Remember that the issue of connecting the washing machine to the mains must be taken with full responsibility and attention.  The device of all <span>measures of protection against electric shock will</span> preserve the health of family members and neighbors, as well as extend the period of trouble-free operation of the washing machine. </p>
