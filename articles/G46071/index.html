For a long time, the name of Ivan Mazepa (one of the key characters in this historical episode) personified apostasy and betrayal.  The unambiguous negative assessment of this character was hardly questioned both in tsarist and Soviet times.  Is it that from the very small </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Poltava battle" class="if" height="343" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/219781.jpg" width="600"></div>  groups that did not have public sympathy.  However, the <span>collapse of the USSR</span> and the birth of national statehood in Ukraine and Russia provoked the emergence of new ideological views.  The activities of Bogdan Khmelnitsky, the Battle of Poltava, historical portraits of Simon Petlyura, Petr Skoropadsky and other personalities were completely rethought in the new Ukrainian historiography.  This aroused and continues to raise objections from the Russian side, where a review of this kind was considered a distortion of real events.

    <p>  Poltava battle </p><p>  Usually, the activities of <span>Ivan Mazepa are</span> presented as the story of a man who came to power thanks to the condescension of Alexei Mikhailovich.  It is believed that he strengthened his influence through the patronage of Peter Alekseevich.  However, during the time of the Northern War, difficult for Russia, Mazepa transferred to the enemy camp of Charles XII.  In turn, modern Ukrainian researchers bring a number of significant details </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Poltava battle" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/219780.jpg" width="390"></div>  into the picture of this relationship.  Among others, there are facts about the plans of Peter I to reduce, and in the future completely destroy the hetman self-government in Ukraine.  Despite the fact that for the Cossack elite the treaty of 1654 was presented as an alliance of a suzerain and a vassal with preservation of the broad liberties of the Cossacks, but by no means complete submission.  Ignoring the interests of the Ukrainian side in negotiations with the Polish king, who was promised a part of the lands lost not so long ago, also did not add popularity to the king.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A critical moment was the refusal of Peter I to provide military assistance to the Ukrainians at the time of the battles, when the Swedish units were already approaching the thresholds of the Dnieper.  There are many arguments for and against.  Be that as it may, <span>the Battle of Poltava</span> (its date is June 27, 1709) was lost by the Swedes and Mazepa.  And the story, as you know, is written by the winners. </p><p>  The value of national memory </p><p>  Many people have ceased to believe in the national idea, because in recent years this term has become very common and inappropriately used by journalists and public figures.  But the Battle of Poltava in 1709 did not lose its significance and remained very important for Ukrainians to gain self-identity and statehood.  Because the foundation of any nation, except for its origin, common language and culture, is also <span>historical memory: the</span> unity of views of members of the national community on the events of the past, tragedy and victory, and national heroes.  The central events of this collective memory form a model for the formation of a national community. </p><p>  For example, among modern Jews, the model of the victim nation is being realized.  The central events of their history and the key to unity is the Holocaust and a number of other negative events that were experienced and overcome by the Jews.  In turn, in the Soviet state and partly in modern Russia </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Poltava battle date" class="if" height="255" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/219782.jpg" width="350"></div>  one of the most important tools for the unification of the nation is the glorification of the Great Patriotic War and victory in it.

    <p>  It is extremely important for today's Ukrainian ideologists and national leaders to find heroes that are common to the whole country.  Or create them.  The latter is also quite acceptable and often used.  For example, Alexander Nevsky is a positive figure for any Russian person, even if he is not familiar with his deeds. </p><p>  Despite the conclusions of modern scholars that the <span>Battle of the Ice,</span> obviously, did not have such significance as Russian historiography has attributed to it for a long time, the image is more important for the identity of the modern Russian nation than the actual events that happened in 1242.  In the end, we still celebrate February 23rd, considering, in accordance with public stereotype, his glory day of the Red Army.  Although the documents do not. </p><p>  For example, <span>Bogdan Khmelnitsky</span> is one of the few heroes who are recognized by both Western and Eastern Ukraine, who have different ideologies.  But only for the first he is a fighter with national oppression, and for the second - with the class one, which Soviet historiography made him.  Interestingly, for the aforementioned Jews, he is completely antihero, guilty of large-scale pogroms and killings of representatives of their people.  So the Battle of Poltava, which is important for both peoples rather as a symbol, rather than a real historical event, which gives rise to mutual misunderstanding. </p>
