    <h2>  Description of the new hotel complex </h2><p>  The hotel was opened in time for the start of the summer season of 2017.  It belongs to the famous Numa Hotels chain, which is known for its responsible approach to organizing leisure travelers.  This fact reassured many who purchased tours to this hotel as part of an early booking in the spring.  The hotel complex positions itself as a family, this is confirmed by reviews of Sentido Numa Bay Hotel 5 *.  Tourists claim that you can check in with children under the age of sixteen.  If you are going on vacation in the company of an older child, you can ask the staff to relocate you to a nearby hotel in the chain.  It is located next to Entido Numa Bay 5 * (Turkey / Alanya) and offers guests a huge amount of entertainment.  But with the kids in the hotel complex will be very comfortable, for them and their parents created almost ideal conditions for relaxation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The hotel area is just over ten thousand square meters.  This allows you to call the hotel compact, but on vacation with siblings it has its undeniable advantages.  In the reviews of tourists about the hotel Sentido Numa Bay Hotel 5 * more than once slips information that in the future it will be very beautiful.  After all, the whole territory is planted with palm trees and green shrubs.  However, to date, they have not yet managed to grow to the right size to create shady alleys. </p><p>  The hotel complex is located on the first coastline.  Tourists are only two hundred meters from the sea. </p><p>  A distinctive feature of the Sentido Numa Bay Hotel 5 * (holidaymakers' reviews confirm our information) is the fact that it was built just in an incredible place.  Once upon a time there was an ancient port in this bay, it was one of the busiest in this territory in about two hundred years BC. </p><p>  The hotel consists of two five-story buildings with 282 rooms of different categories. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Many travel directories give information about the Sentido Numa Bay Hotel 5 * in Alanya.  In fact, the hotel complex was built near the resort village of Avsallar.  From the hotel to its center the distance does not exceed two kilometers.  Vacationers say that in the village there are many shops and markets where various souvenirs are sold. </p><p>  If you want to go on an excursion to Antalya, then think a few times - this city has a long way to go.  The distance between the resort and the hotel complex exceeds one hundred kilometers.  However, this will become clear immediately after arriving in Turkey.  After all, to get from the international airport to your room, you need to drive 64 kilometers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Pros and Cons of the Beach </h2><p>  The bay, on the shore of which the hotel complex is located, is very picturesque.  From the windows of the rooms you can see a bewitching view of large boulders, calm waters rolling on fine sand, and ancient ruins inherited from the ancient inhabitants of these places. </p><p>  Reviews of Sentido Numa Bay Hotel 5 * contain a lot of information about the beach area.  It is the property of the hotel and is well equipped.  However, the coast in this part of the bay is extremely narrow, so by noon, when most of the guests go down to the sea, it becomes very crowded.  Many vacationers go to neighboring beaches and spend time there. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the beach consists of sand, it is not suitable for small children.  The fact is that entering the sea is replete with sharp stones.  This makes bathing difficult for babies.  Parents try to relax with them by the pool, where the kids often feel more comfortable. </p>

    <h2>  Free services </h2><p>  Tourists are always worried about what services will be available to them on site for free.  Therefore, we decided to indicate them in a separate section of the article.  All guests get the opportunity to use the Internet.  A special club is equipped for this, and those who prefer their gadgets connect to local Wi-Fi.  There are often mixed reviews about him.  Some guests are happy with the speed of the Internet, while others complain that it is extremely slow.  Perhaps this is due to the number of guests, because when fully populated, the signal always becomes weaker. </p><p>  The gym will help you keep fit.  It is available to all guests of the complex during the day. </p><p>  Also, guests can dine in a la carte restaurants once during their stay.  This service is to many tastes, because in almost all of the reviews left by tourists it is written about the delicious dishes that the hotel chefs indulged their guests. </p><p>  If desired, children can be left in the mini club.  Here unaccompanied parents take small guests from four to twelve years.  The service is provided for free, and the pleasure of such a pastime is an additional bonus. </p><h2>  Paid service </h2><p>  Among the most popular services requiring additional payment, one can single out the rent of tents on the beach and near the pools.  The fact is that not all sun loungers are installed under umbrellas, so tourists often have to lie under the hot rays of the sun.  If you want to relax in comfort, you can just rent a tent. </p><p>  Those who prefer to spend most of their time in the room will find it convenient to use room service.  One call from guests will bring drinks or, for example, snacks to the apartment. </p><p>  Paid services include calling a doctor.  If necessary, a specialist will go up to your room and examine the patient. </p><p>  Often guests take things to the laundry and dry cleaning.  The cost of this service is low, and it completely saves vacationers from household worries.  It is especially nice to forget about the daily chores when you go on vacation with your children. </p><p>  Also, for little money, guests can hire a photographer or try foreign-made drinks at the bar. </p>
