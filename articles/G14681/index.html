  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Accrual of sick leave</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Unfortunately, everyone is ill.  But in any case, it is necessary to inform the employer of his illness in order to be able to stay legally at home.  In this case, a sick leave certificate acts as an exculpatory document.  It allows us not only not to go to work, but also to receive payment for this period.  How is the accrual of sick leave? </p><p>  First of all, it is worth noting that the sick leave allows you to count on getting sickness benefits.  It can be obtained by persons working on the basis of an employment contract.  The sick leave is also paid in the event that the employee was dismissed with the subsequent onset of incapacity for work within a thirty-day period after the contract was terminated.  The accrual of sick leave primarily depends on the length of service an employee has.  If it exceeds eight years, then the payment is one hundred percent, with an experience of five to eight years, we are talking about eighty percent, and with its term of up to five years, you can count only sixty percent.  In the event of disability, the employee will receive benefits at the place of work.  If a citizen has not one place of work, but several, he can count on receiving benefits in case of illness from each of them.  Accrual of sick leave when <span>caring for a child</span> is different: you need to choose only one organization that is required to provide benefits.  Now you can consider this issue in more detail. </p><p>  The sick leave, as well as the care of the child or during pregnancy, is calculated on the basis of the average wage of the employee.  For the calculation, it is customary to take into account two calendar years before the current one in which the employee received disability.  As an average earnings, it is customary to take into account the totality of salaries, as well as bonuses, payments, compensations, bonuses received by the employee.  To determine the average daily payment, the entire amount received should be divided by 730, that is, by the number of days in two years. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The order of <span>payment of sick leave</span> depends on the average earnings.  To do this, you must first determine the amount of all charges for two years separately.  It should not exceed 415 thousand per year, since this amount is the most affordable for annual accruals.  Further, the obtained data are summarized with the subsequent division by 730. The next step is to find the product of quotient by a coefficient depending on the length of service.  Now it is quite possible to determine the amount of payments calculated by the product of the average daily earnings on the days of a citizen's disability according to the calendar. </p><p>  The allowance can be determined on the basis of the minimum wage.  To do this, you need to determine the average daily wage according to the minimum wage, then you should use the coefficient or RK, if it is a <span>part-time job.</span>  The final amount is obtained by multiplying the average daily payment and the number of calendar days included in the sick leave. </p><p>  In 2012, new principles <span>for calculating sick leave,</span> as well as <span>benefits for child care</span> and pregnancy were used.  Its features are provided for <span>maternity benefits.</span>  In this situation, the previous two years are also taken into account, but sick leave and leave should be excluded from this period, and the amount received should be divided by the worked number of calendar days upon.  The amount received is always multiplied by one hundred percent, that is, in this case, the experience of a woman is not taken into account. </p><p>  Nursing sick leave is an inalienable right of an employee, which he can use in case of illness.  The accrual of sick leave in such a situation is carried out in full accordance with the legislation of the Russian Federation. </p>
