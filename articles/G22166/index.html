Someone calls this set-top box a worthy competitor to conventional television, someone considers it a useless device that constantly pulls money from the owner‚Äôs pocket.  What do the users themselves say?  Below are their reviews about Apple TV.  We also consider in detail the principle of operation and basic settings. </p><p>  We publish an honest review and real reviews about the Apple TV set-top box, recorded from the words of the owners.  Is the novelty relevant and useful for the Russian market? </p><h2>  So what is an Apple TV?  Review and reviews </h2><div class="photo" data-original="9to5toys.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="a haven for gamers" class="if uuid-3137109" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72621/3137109.jpg"></div><p>  The world first heard about Apple TV in 2007.  At the Macworld conference, Steve Jobs himself introduced the new product.  It would seem that success is inevitable. </p><p>  Almost 11 years have passed since then.  However, in Russia, the prefix did not take root.  If practically no one needs to explain what the iPhone is, then not everyone has heard about Apple TV in our country.  Even fewer of our compatriots understand what the device is intended for and how it works. </p><p>  In fact, everything is simple.  Most often, this device is used to broadcast content (for example, video in high quality) from a computer or phone to a large television screen. </p><p>  But only this is not limited to its functions.  Apple TV also allows you to transfer content directly from the iTunes application and other similar services.  In fact, it makes an ordinary TV ‚Äúsmart‚Äù - it adds Smart-TV capabilities. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The prefix became especially popular when users were convinced that the SMART functions built into most Korean models are far from ideal.  Third-party counterparts of Apple TV also leave much to be desired.  Therefore, the device simply does not have worthy competitors who could compete with it in functionality and quality, because the reviews about Apple TV are impressive. </p><h2>  Market Launch History and Marketers Mistakes </h2><div class="photo" data-original="thinkapple.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What's inside?" class="if uuid-3137133" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72621/3137133.jpg"></div><p>  Initially, the console had a built-in hard drive of only 40 GB.  Although the maximum resolution of the video being played did not exceed 720p, this volume was already too small even then.  Negative reviews of the updated Apple TV immediately flooded the Internet. </p><p>  Already at the end of May, the company's marketers realized the mistake and a 160 GB disk was released. </p><p>  Another significant miscalculation was made.  The initial version of the software did not provide for purchases directly in the application.  This flaw was corrected as early as 2008.  And also based on feedback from Apple TV owners. </p><p>  A year later, the company completely stopped the production of a 40 GB hard drive.  The 160 GB drive seems to have established itself on the positive side.  However, already in 2010, the company completely updated the device and refused to use the internal drive as such.  This solution 4 times allowed to reduce the dimensions of the device and make it work almost silent. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How did they correct miscalculations? </h2><p>  Instead of a hard drive, the device was equipped with a built-in flash memory of 8 GB, which made it possible to cache the movie being watched.  This means that you could pause the movie, and then continue playing - you would not have to download the file again. </p><p>  Such innovations made the device cheaper.  According to research, most users were willing to pay no more than $ 100 for such a device.  And in such a simple way, the company managed to lower the price even below this limit. </p><p>  However, the experiments did not end there.  The third version of Apple TV was released in 2012.  The company's designers have completely updated the user interface.  In addition, the device now supports video with a resolution of 1080p.  This version also required significant revision.  In 2015, Apple engineers equipped the console with 32 GB or 64 GB of internal flash memory.  This opened up great opportunities for storing games and multimedia.  In addition, the operating system itself has undergone changes. </p><p>  The fourth generation of devices saw the light in 2017.  4K video and Dolby Atmos sound allow users to literally "dissolve in parallel reality." </p><p>  The result, as they say, is evident - positive reviews about the Apple TV were not long in coming. </p><h2>  Why it didn‚Äôt work in Russia </h2><div class="photo" data-original="9to5mac.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="services accessed by Apple TV" class="if uuid-3137081" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72621/3137081.jpg"></div><p>  The first versions of the console had a built-in hard drive that allowed you to record your favorite movie.  However, later the company refused to use the drive. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Apparently, analysts at Apple felt that taking a rent is always more profitable than selling a movie 1 time.  After all, I want to watch a good movie again and again.  It is enough to recall at least the tapes of the Soviet era.  How many times each of us watched "Gentlemen of Fortune" or "Prisoner of the Caucasus"?  And how many times will he look?  In many families, these films have become a good New Year's tradition. </p><p>  Therefore, all content is now played only in streaming mode.  And for each view the user pays 250-300 rubles.  The amount seems to be small.  And if you count for a month?  This is a business - nothing personal, as they say ... </p><p>  In fairness, it should be noted that the company itself explains the rejection of the built-in drive by the desire to offer the user a more compact and easy-to-use product.  Indeed, the model apple tv md199ru a, according to reviews, left the closest analogues far behind. </p><p>  But with our compatriots, American marketers miscalculated.  Do not take into account the mentality.  What to do?  Another culture - since childhood, they are used to paying for everything and do not understand how it could be different. </p><p>  But in the Russians, they have not yet gotten used to paying for a watched movie.  Apparently, this explains the low popularity of Apple TV in our country.  Although the console itself is at least worth it to pay attention to it. </p><h2>  Options set-top box Apple TV </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.aivanet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="so it looks on the TV screen" class="if uuid-3137071" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72621/3137071.jpg"></div><p>  Apple TV comes standard with: </p><ul><li><p>  set-top box Apple TV; </p></li><li><p>  Lightning standard cable (used to charge the battery in the remote control); </p></li><li><p>  power cable; </p></li><li><p>  user's manual. </p></li></ul><p>  According to company standards, each item is sealed in an individual plastic bag.  Connectors consoles are covered with plugs.  But the HDMI cable for connecting the set-top box to the TV is not included in the complex.  You will have to purchase it separately. </p><h2>  What exactly does the Apple TV do? </h2><ul><li><p>  Watch movies from iTunes and other applications in good quality and on the big screen. </p></li><li><p>  Listen to music and view photos. </p></li><li><p>  Access to the cloud - the prefix allows you to access your photos in iCloud and view them on your TV. </p></li><li><p>  Synchronize any Apple gadget and TV.  For example, you can run the game on a tablet or PC, and broadcast the image on a large screen. </p></li></ul><h2>  Set up your Apple TV </h2><div class="photo" data-original="support.apple.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="settings menu" class="if uuid-3137100" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72621/3137100.jpg"></div><p>  It‚Äôs not necessary to call the wizard to set up Apple TV.  Apple has specifically designed the interface in such a way that an ordinary user could cope with the setup. </p><p>  Connecting an Apple TV set-top box to a TV </p><ol><li><p>  We connect the HDMI cable to the console and the TV.  Only after that we connect the Apple TV to the network. </p></li><li><p>  The Apple logo should appear on the screen.  Using the volume control and the button in the middle, use the remote control to select the desired language. </p></li><li><p>  Now you need to connect the console to the Internet.  Apple TV automatically scans for available Wi-Fi networks - select the one you need from the list and enter the password.  You can connect to the router directly - using a cable. </p></li><li><p>  Now you need to give your consent to the transfer of data to Apple.  Personal information is not transmitted.  However, you can safely refuse - it will not affect performance in any way. </p></li><li><p>  Install Home Sharing on your computer.  This application has a simple and intuitive interface that will make the data transfer process as comfortable as possible. </p></li><li><p>  Now synchronize the PC, TV and set-top box with each other (as a rule, this process happens automatically, you just need to wait until the corresponding message appears). </p></li></ol><h2>  How to ‚Äúmake friends‚Äù Apple TV and iPhone </h2><p>  In order for everything to work out, you need to use an iPhone with the iOs7 or later operating system.  Unfortunately, older versions of the operating system do not support the iBeacon option. </p><p>  Step-by-step instruction: </p><ol><li><p>  Turn on Wi-Fi on the iPhone and connect to the wireless network. </p></li><li><p>  Turn on bluetooth.  The corresponding slider is located in the "settings" menu immediately below Wi-Fi. </p></li><li><p>  We bring the iPhone to the console.  A pop-up window appears on the screen, click ‚Äúyes‚Äù. </p></li><li><p>  Now you need to log in with your Apple ID.  The system will ask a couple of questions, after which data synchronization will begin.  The process will not be displayed on the screen - this is normal.  Everything runs in the background, you just have to wait. </p></li></ol><h2>  Connecting Apple TV to a computer </h2><div class="photo" data-original="support.apple.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Apple TV setup menu" class="if uuid-3137065" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72621/3137065.jpg"></div><p>  Sometimes you need to update the firmware or restore some data.  To do this, you have to connect the Apple TV to the computer.  Preferably MacOS is installed on the PC.  Windows users will have to additionally install the appropriate application. </p><p>  The procedure is as follows: </p><ol><li><p>  Disable the Apple TV box. </p></li><li><p>  Disconnect the HDMI cable and others. </p></li><li><p>  Using a micro USB cable, connect the set-top box and the computer through the appropriate connector. </p></li><li><p>  Launch the iTunes application on your PC and find it in the Apple TV menu. </p></li></ol><h2>  How to upgrade firmware? </h2><p>  Everything is simple - this is done through the Option command, then Restore in iTunes.  Now the system will ask you to specify the name of the firmware file that you want to install.  You need to select the one you need and click Choose - then everything will happen automatically. </p><p>  An important nuance: you need to pay attention to the firmware file having the .ipsw extension.  Download it easily on the Internet. </p><h2>  How to recover data? </h2><p>  In the Apple TV window, select the Restore button.  After the system asks you to confirm the operation, click Restore and Update.  The procedure will take several minutes. </p><h2>  Pros and Cons of Apple TV </h2><p>  What makes console users delighted?  According to the reviews of the owners themselves, this: </p><ul><li><p>  concise and intuitive interface; </p></li><li><p>  simple and easy to use remote control; </p></li><li><p>  handy if you have a collection of your favorite movies and music in iTunes; </p></li><li><p>  viewing photos and games on the "big screen"; </p></li><li><p>  built-in catalog of games and programs. </p></li></ul><p>  However, as mentioned above, Apple TV has a very significant minus for the Russians - it is ‚Äúimprisoned‚Äù exclusively for licensed content.  True, there are few films and music that are distributed free of charge.  But the quality of such content, as a rule, leaves much to be desired.  This means that you will have to pay for each viewing of an interesting movie or a track you listen to. </p><p>  However, our compatriots have found a way out.  The console supports YouTube content, and it is known to be free.  You just need to wait until someone uploads the desired movie to their channel.  Yes, watching a movie on the day of the premiere is unlikely to succeed.  But in a few days the film will surely be able to be watched absolutely free.  Here already everyone makes a choice for himself. </p><h2>  Popular models and owner reviews about them </h2><p>  Why do we need the Apple TV set-top box and how to set it up, in general, figured out.  Below we consider popular models and owner reviews about them.  Let's start with the Apple TV 32GB.  Of course, we are talking about the 3rd generation model, with built-in flash memory.  Reviews about Apple TV 3 in 2015 and today are, as they say in Odessa, two big differences.  But first things first ... </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitaltrends.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the console needs good acoustics" class="if uuid-3137121" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72621/3137121.jpg"></div><p>  So, an anonymous survey was conducted, in which 96 respondents participated.  Each of them has a different ‚Äúexperience‚Äù in using the gadget.  Nevertheless, 95% of respondents said they were satisfied with the purchase and would recommend Apple TV to their friends.  And only 2 people were disappointed. </p><p>  As you can see, there are practically no reviews for the Apple TV 32GB with a minus sign. </p><p>  In addition to the survey, it was carefully promoting the Internet space.  Unfortunately, owners of Apple TV 32GB reviews are not very willing.  To gather information, I had to study more than 30 specialized sites and about 10 more thematic forums where Apple technology enthusiasts share their experiences. </p><p>  As a result, the following statistics were collected: </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;" width="7%"><p>  Year </p></td><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;" width="33%"><p>  % positive reviews </p></td><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;" width="20%"><p>  % neutral reviews </p></td><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;" width="40%"><p>  % negative reviews </p></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;" width="7%"><p>  2015 </p></td><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;" width="33%"><p>  95 </p></td><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;" width="20%"><p>  3 </p></td><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;" width="40%"><p>  2 </p></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;" width="7%"><p>  2017 </p></td><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;" width="33%"><p>  90 </p></td><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;" width="20%"><p>  6 </p></td><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;" width="40%"><p>  4 </p></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;" width="7%"><p>  2018 </p></td><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;" width="33%"><p>  85 </p></td><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;" width="20%"><p>  10 </p></td><td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;" width="40%"><p>  5 </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  As you can see from the table above, in 2015, 95% of owners of Apple TV 32GB were 100% satisfied with the purchase.  Compared with the previous model, the amount of internal memory was increased 4 times.  This allowed you to quickly access your favorite games and music and use the gadget even without an internet connection. </p><p>  However, the amount of internal memory was still not large enough.  This was noted by approximately 5% of owners of Apple TV 32GB.  Some of them decided that this ‚Äúlack‚Äù was leveled out by new ‚Äúchips‚Äù with which the company once again pleased its customers.  For example, a remote control with a minimum number of buttons that works like a computer mouse.  Or an updated operating system that allowed you to download your favorite movies many times faster. </p><p>  Only 2% of owners who posted reviews online returned the purchase to the store.  Someone was dissatisfied with the quality, someone did not like the new design.  But the majority of the dissatisfied acquired the Apple TV 64GB - the memory factor was the deciding factor. </p><p>  However, in 2018, the situation changed radically.  Only 85% of owners who posted reviews on the network were satisfied with the device.  The model is outdated and could not justify its hopes.  Reviews about Apple TV 4 left no chance for 3rd-generation consoles.  And this despite the rather low price. </p><p>  The feedback from the owners of Apple TV 4K is truly amazing.  The high-definition image and deep surround sound from the moment of release captivated the audience. </p><p>  The amount of internal memory is just enough, nothing hangs.  And the updated operating system allows you to access your favorite content even faster.  However, it is worth considering that the new product places high demands on the quality of the router and Internet connection.  The happy owners of the Apple TV 4K 32GB media player, according to reviews, often do not think about this. </p><p>  It will be very disappointing to pay a lot of money for the updated device and spoil the impression of watching slow Internet. </p><p>  In addition, experts advise using good acoustics.  For example, the speaker system of the same company Apple.  This will allow you to feel the full depth of the sound and get real pleasure from watching your favorite movie. </p><p>  I like the novelty not only for lovers of quality films and music.  Apple TV 4K 32GB - a true paradise for gamers.  It is enough to start the game on the computer and by pressing 1 button you can broadcast the sound and image to the big screen, and in real time - without freezes. </p><p>  The novelty also has significant disadvantages.  According to reviews, Apple TV 4K 32GB does not offer such a wide selection of films and games.  It makes sense to buy a console with 4K support, if you still have to watch the content in HD quality?  This problem is especially relevant for the Russian-speaking space.  In fairness, it should be noted that the built-in store includes several thousand films and games with a resolution of 4K.  However, this is not enough for Apple TV 4K 32GB users - the reviews speak for themselves. </p><p>  In addition, there is no Russian Siri - you won‚Äôt be able to control the device with your voice.  For Russians, this is a significant minus.  Some users complain about the sound.  Like, in the iPhone, the quality is better and somehow there are few settings. </p><p>  Nevertheless, almost everyone notes that the Apple TV 32GB 4K is much more stable than any SMART TV set-top box on the Android operating system.  On the built-in Smart-TV, there can be no talk at all. </p><p>  As a proof, here are a few reviews found on the vastness of the network: </p><p>  Those who previously purchased the Android prefix were terribly upset by its quality.  Something constantly hung, braked, flied.  But the new 4K version is a delight for many.  Whoever tried it, never regretted it, and some have since abandoned digital TV and everyone only watches via the Internet. </p><p>  According to users, in fact, the new model differs from the previous model only in its ability to reproduce content with a resolution of 4K.  If your TV does not support this format, then there is no point in the device.  It is better to save and take the previous version, which will cost almost 2 times cheaper. </p><p> Many believe that for those who have not used the "apple" gadgets before, out of habit, management may seem a little uncomfortable.  But, as users assure, after an hour of active work with the remote control, the fingers already automatically perform the necessary actions.  You get used very quickly.  And then you don‚Äôt understand how I used to torment with all these buttons. </p><p>  Many say that on the console, the standard sound is slightly worse than on the iPhone.  For many, the main disadvantage lies in the lack of a built-in assistant in Russian.  Unfortunately, in 2018, Siri does not speak Russian in the Apple TV set-top box.  This is terribly inconvenient for those who are used to controlling voice gadgets.  Yes, and enter the text so much faster and more convenient.  Perhaps this is the only serious drawback. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Summarizing all of the above, we can conclude that the Apple TV is a useful and interesting device.  This small ‚Äúbox‚Äù is capable of many things: transmit streaming video and sound to the big screen in real time, store games and videos, provide access to high-quality licensed content in Internet applications.  That's just "sharpened" it under licensed content.  And lovers of "freebies" are unlikely to be enjoyed. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, the Apple TV media player is much more stable than any set-top box on the Android operating system.  Therefore, there are practically no analogues to this device.  Therefore, it is not cheap - the latest version with 4K support will cost Russians 14-16 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Although more profitable offers can be found on the market, it is still better to make such a purchase from an authorized seller.  Unless, of course, there is a desire to get a copy collected in the basement instead of the original device. </p><p>  In principle, Apple TV is a completely independent device.  An ordinary TV (without SMART-TV support) becomes ‚Äúsmart‚Äù with its help - you can watch movies and listen to music in various online applications.  However, owners of gadgets with a ‚Äúbitten apple‚Äù prefix gives several times more options. </p><p>  Apple TV 4k, according to reviews, is most often used for watching movies.  For lovers of quality music, the standard sound can be a little frustrating.  And there are not as many settings as we would like - there are only 3 modes.  Therefore, experts recommend immediately connecting a good speaker system.  And, of course, they recommend the same manufacturer. </p><p>  In Russia, the prefix is ‚Äã‚Äãnot so popular, but it is rapidly conquering the market.  Gradually, people get used to paying for licensed content, they just have less and less choice.  Yes, and quality requirements have grown significantly lately.  "Pirates" are no longer able to satisfy user requests to the fullest - many prefer to pay money and enjoy viewing than spoil their nerves.  And over time, Apple TV sales in our country will only grow. </p><p>  This is clearly indicated by the reviews of the owners, who for the most part are completely satisfied with the purchase and recommend it to friends. </p><p>  However, there are nuances.  For example, to purchase Apple TV 4K in reviews is recommended only to those who have a TV that supports this format.  Or in the near future they are planning such a purchase.  Otherwise, it makes no sense to overpay and it is better to purchase the previous version, which (according to the owners) from the new one, in fact, is no different. </p><p>  It should be added that, in addition to the version with 32 GB of memory, there is Apple TV 64GB.  There are not so many reviews about the model.  In addition to the amount of internal memory, it is almost no different from the younger version.  Apple TV 4K 64GB, according to reviews, can not yet afford an ordinary Russian.  Or people are simply not ready to pay so much for extra gigabytes. </p>
