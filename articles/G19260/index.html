Phuket Island, Thailand</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A wonderful vacation, no doubt, can be organized by visiting the island of Phuket, Thailand.  A tour to this resort on average costs two and a half thousand dollars for two.  The amount depends on which hotel you intend to settle in, how far it is from the sea, and what kind of meal plan is provided.  Most of the ticket price is a flight.  Cheaper than two thousand dollars, you most likely will not find a ticket.  It is logical to assume that now you are wondering what to see in Phuket. </p><h2>  Where can I stay on vacation? </h2>

There are many establishments on the island of Phuket for any person who has both a large income and an average.  There are hotels with their vast territory for vacationers, such as those in Egypt (mainly five stars), and there are those that look like ordinary five-story houses with a rooftop pool.  A little tip: do not set a goal to check into a five-star hotel (especially if you are a person with an average income).

    <h2>  It‚Äôs not necessary to check into the most expensive hotel </h2><p>  Believe me, there is something to see in Phuket and outside hotels.  After all, you came to relax and get an impression of this amazing place, and not to spend all the time in a five-star hotel.  So it is better to opt for hotels with three stars.  Moreover, the living conditions there are by no means bad, as you might think at first.  There is one condition when checking in: you need to make a hundred dollars deposit for the duration of your stay, this is, so to speak, insurance.  In the event that property damage is caused, the hotel will keep this money for itself.  But if during your stay there will be no damage, then upon departure they will be returned.  The rooms in these hotels have a standard suite: a large bed, a balcony, air conditioning, a <span>combined bathroom,</span> safe, TV, kettle, fridge.  All available drinks at the bar are paid. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to move around the city? </h2>

In Thailand, left-hand traffic, therefore, it is a little unusual to sit in the driver's seat and be a passenger at the same time.  By the way, taxis are quite inexpensive.  About two dollars, for this price you can get to almost any coast.  It‚Äôs better to travel the whole company or meet someone from your hotel so that you can pay for the fare together.  It will also save you money.  A pleasant impression leaves riding in a tuk-tuk.  This is a small minibus without glasses, having only handrails.  Some drivers, seeing that the passengers are Russian, include Rosenbaum.  It‚Äôs good to hear the performers you know during the trip.  Thais are lovers of hobbies, so adrenaline along the way is provided to you.

    <h2>  Great places on the island </h2><p>  Beaches are something that everyone can see in Phuket on their own.  On the island there are many sandy areas, and almost each is not like the other.  For example, the nearby beaches of <span>Patong (Patong</span> Beach), Karon (Karon Beach), Kata (Kata Beach).  Patong has a sandy beach, but there are often big waves.  It is better to relax on this beach with companies, since all the infrastructure located nearby is aimed at entertaining large groups of people.  Unfortunately, it is rather heavily polluted. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

One of the best places is Karon - white sand, emerald water, the environment of tourists does not cause a negative.  This beach is suitable mainly for couples with children, for couples who would like to retire and have a good time.  The place is quite clean, a lot of arbors.  There are no noisy establishments with entertaining events, only a bewitching landscape and a calm swaying of the waves.

    <p>  They come to rest on these beaches both in summer and in winter.  The only thing that can upset the pastime in Phuket in the winter is that at such times plankton is massively bred, which unpleasantly stings.  It does not cause any irritation on the skin, but you will still feel an unpleasant burning sensation (as after nettles). </p><h2>  What about excursions? </h2>

Holidays on the island can not be fully enjoyed without taking all sorts of excursions.  They are offered by local excursion companies.  Your attention will be invited to rest on the <span>Similan Islands.</span>  Awesome place to spend time with your family.  Especially newlyweds will like these islands.  There are no entertainment facilities, but there is a beautiful coast with white sand, the color of the water is turquoise, and the purity is such that it seems as if you are floating through the air.

    <p>  Another popular excursion is the city of Khao Lak.  It usually includes a trip to a pineapple farm, a trip to the cave, which houses a huge Buddha statue, riding on a bamboo raft, elephants and visiting a small waterfall.  All this is included in one excursion for little money, but you will have enough impressions of it for life. </p><h2>  Traveling to neighboring islands </h2><p>  There is also the fact that you should definitely look at Phuket.  Excursion to the islands of Phi Phi should not pass you by.  Firstly, the legendary film "The Beach" was shot here with Leonardo DiCaprio, and secondly, they are on the UNESCO list as the most beautiful place on earth.  But there is an unpleasant side of this excursion.  Since it is common in almost all of Thailand, the flow of tourists here is enormous.  Usually people are brought here in the morning, and by noon on the islands there is nowhere to drop an apple.  At the same time, the tour includes diving with equipment, access to the coast with monkeys, where you can feed them directly from the boat, and on the way back you will be brought to the island, which appears at low tide and disappears at high tide.  No less attractive is an excursion to <span>the James Bond Islands,</span> where you will not be bored. </p>

Phuket is an island with many places to eat.  Probably, nowhere else can you find such a variety of restaurants, but, basically, it is, of course, Thai cuisine.  Almost on every corner there are establishments in which you will be offered a wide variety of dishes suitable for any size of wallet.  Of course, since this is an island, the menu will be dominated by seafood.  But if you are a lover of meat dishes, then there will be no infringement in this regard.

    <p>  The fact that you need to look at Phuket on your own is without fail one of the most visited establishments - the Jang Ceylon shopping center, every tourist is convinced.  Here you can buy absolutely everything, the complex is simply huge.  For people who want to save on food, this place will be a godsend.  The fact is that there you can buy a fairly large marine fish for very little money and ask to be cooked on the spot.  This is very convenient for those who spent almost all their savings at the beginning of their vacation, and you need to somehow get out in order to reach the departure.  Anyway, in this shopping center you can walk for hours and not notice how time will pass, while you have not bypassed even half of this building. </p><h2>  For those to whom measured rest is not suitable </h2>

"What to see?"  - This question will disappear by itself when you find yourself in this place.  Phuket Town is a lot of parks, Chinese and Thai temples, attractions such as Soi Romani, Chinpracha House, City Administration, On-On Hotel, Phuket Museum, Philatelic Museum, Museum of Chinese Life.
