    <h2>  Description of Hainan Island </h2><p>  This island in the Middle Kingdom is the second largest after Taiwan.  And it is located in a tropical climate zone on the same latitude with Hawaii, for which it received the name "Eastern Hawaii".  Its area is thirty-four thousand square meters.  The population is about eight million people.  The capital of the island is the city of Hayoku.  Once it was a small provincial town, but now it is a beautiful modern metropolis.  The leisure industry is developing rapidly.  Since the reign of the Tang Dynasty, it has become the custom that all routes along the island begin in the city of Hayoku. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are two more cities on the island that are especially loved by visitors - these are Sanya and Tunzha.  Sanya is located in the very south, surrounded on three sides by mountains, and on the fourth it is washed by the azure tropical sea.  Tongzha is interesting in that the indigenous population of the island lives here - the Miao and Li peoples.  Ethnographic villages are located here, in which the life and rites of the indigenous population are represented.  Few people will be indifferent to a country such as China, and rest on Hainan Island - all the more so.  It has everything: mountains, waterfalls, lakes, thermal springs, bays, beaches, entertainment, fashionable hotels and much more.  All in order to make your holidays in China (Hainan Island) unforgettable.  If we talk about local cuisine, then many tourists are sure to try four famous dishes: crab "Hele", black goat meat "Dunshan", chicken "Wenchang" and the famous Chinese duck. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in China Hainan Island" class="if" height="212" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13530/437967.jpg" width="294"></div>

In the south of the island there are three bays, where tourists mainly rest: Dadonghai, Sanya and Yaluvan.  The city of Sanya mentioned above is located in the center of the bay of the same name.  Hotels are located across from the beach.  And it should be noted that this bay has the longest coastline, with a length of more than twenty kilometers.  From the recreation area to the city about eight kilometers.  <span>Dadonghai Bay,</span> which means "large east sea", is located three kilometers from the city of Sanya.  The coastline stretched for several kilometers.  It has everything that your heart desires: beaches with white sand, palm trees, the cleanest sea, bars and dance floors, cozy restaurants. </p><p>  Hotels are located in the coastline area.  This bay is considered one of the most beautiful in China.  Dragon Bay - Yaluvan - is located twenty-eight kilometers from Sanya Bay.  The twenty-kilometer beach has a crescent shape.  Over the southern part of the bay, high cliffs of bizarre shape hang.  The distance from the city of Sanya is approximately twenty-eight kilometers.  Each zone has its own advantages and disadvantages.  So, on the beaches of Dadonghai Bay is always very crowded.  In addition to tourists, locals come here, because very often sun loungers and umbrellas are not enough for everyone.  The pluses include an abundance of entertainment both in the afternoon and in the evening.  In Yaluvan, nothing will disturb the peace of vacationers, here tourists remain almost alone with nature.  But the disadvantages include the fact that in the evening there is absolutely nothing to do.  From entertainment there are only pools on the territory of hotels and restaurants.  Those who wish to have fun to the full will have to go to the city.  And it‚Äôs a little expensive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tours to china hainan island" class="if" height="408" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13530/437969.jpg" width="600"></div>
