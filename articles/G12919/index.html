They are considered one of the best since the days of the USSR.  The mountain resorts of Georgia, their features, diversity and the services they provide will be described in the article. </p><h2>  Bakuriani </h2><p>  One of the very first mountain resorts is Bakuriani.  It is located next to the village of the same name.  The Bakuriani ski resort was created on the northern slope in the Borjomi Gorge, on the Trialeti Range of the Caucasus Mountains. </p><div class="photo" data-original="snow.ge" data-author=": " data-source="https://snow.ge/ski-resorts-georgia/photos-the-ski-resorts-georgia/bakuriani-photos.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel in Bakuriani" class="if uuid-3141680" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3141680.jpg"></div><p>  The resorts of Bakuriani and Borjomi are interconnected by a narrow-gauge railway and highways.  An interesting fact is that the bridge connecting them on one of the sections of the road was designed by Gustave Eiffel, who is known for all of his Paris Tower.  And in the XIX century Bakuriani was the residence of the emperor. </p><p>  At one time, this ski resort claimed that the Winter Olympic Games would be held here. </p><h2>  Trails and sports facilities </h2><p>  In the ski resort of Bakuriani there are several sports facilities and tracks.  Here are the high-mountain indoor and outdoor ice rinks, which host hockey matches and ice skating competitions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.skigeorgia.ge" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.skigeorgia.ge/georgian-french-experts-designing-olympic-biathlon-track-bakuriani/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ski slopes in Bakuriani" class="if uuid-3141670" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3141670.jpg"></div><p>  The height difference here is from 1,780 to 2,850 m. For experienced skiers, Mount Kokhta is suitable.  Its slopes have sections of varying complexity, for example, the Kokhta-1 track, which reaches 1.5 km in length, consists of red and black segments, which indicates its high complexity.  The degree of slopes on it is 52 °, beginners are not recommended to ride here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Kokhta-2 track reaches a length of 3 km and also has a red section, which is why it is better for professionals or those who are good at skiing or snowboarding to ride it.  For beginners, the Plateau track is best suited, which has short and gentle slopes.  On it, even those who first started skiing will feel quite comfortable. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The general infrastructure of the Bakuriani ski resort is under development and currently does not reach the European level.  However, the hotels have 4 stars and comply with European standards.  A room in such a hotel will cost from 5 to 7.5 thousand rubles, there are also hotels in which the price for a room varies from 2.5 to 3.5 thousand rubles.  Most often, three meals a day are included in the price. </p><p>  The resort has a library, indoor tennis courts, restaurants, cafes and antique taverns.  Guests are offered a wide range of services relating not only to ski holidays, but also to the tourist destination.  So, for example, if you wish, you can go to the sources of Borjomi, to the mountain lake Tabatskuri, to the ancient Georgian temple Timotesubani or the medieval monastery located in the caves - Vardzia. </p><h2>  Tetnuldi </h2><p>  At the beginning of 2016, a new tourist complex was opened on the slope of Mount Tetnuld.  He became the youngest ski resort.  Tetnuldi has a height difference from 2,260 to 3,040 m. This resort is developing, at the moment its capacity is 7 thousand guests per season, which lasts from early December to late March. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pandotrip.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tetnuldi Mountain Resort" class="if uuid-3141654" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3141654.jpg"></div><p>  This place differs from Bakuriani in that the tracks here have a high level of difficulty.  In other words, they are more suitable for professional riders.  Beginners are advised to ride here with an instructor who will tell and show all the difficult sections.  The longest track is 9.5 km long. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  A distinctive feature of Tetnuldi is its modern infrastructure.  The resort has a spa center, massage parlors, upscale restaurants, a sports complex and billiards.  It provides services at the highest level. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thenaturaladventure.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels in Mestia" class="if uuid-3141688" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3141688.jpg"></div><p>  However, it should be noted that currently there are no hotels directly in the resort itself.  You will have to rent a room in Mestia and get to Tetnuldi by your own car or hotel transfer.  A hotel room will cost from 2 to 3 thousand rubles.  The price will include breakfast and dinner. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Soon, the resort administration promises to build a comfortable hotel and guest houses so that tourists do not spend their time on the road to the ski resort. </p><h2>  Hatsvali </h2><p>  In 2011, the Hatsvali ski resort was opened.  It is small (chamber), for which they like a certain category of vacationers.  Here you will not meet a large number of tourists, the bulk prefer Tetnuldi, which is located nearby. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thenaturaladventure.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.thenaturaladventure.com/activities/mestia-and-the-trails-of-svaneti/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hatsvali slopes" class="if uuid-3141705" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3141705.jpg"></div><p>  The elevation difference in Hatsvali is from 1 865 to 2 447 m. For the convenience of holidaymakers, a small hotel is built near the lower ski station, there is a cozy restaurant with national cuisine, as well as ski equipment rental. </p><p>  As noted earlier, this resort is very compact, but this is not only why vacationers like it.  There are quite interesting tracks that attract freeriders and snowboarders.  There is also a so-called wild track running through the forest, however, it is very dangerous due to fallen trees and elevations. </p><p>  Prices for accommodation in hotel rooms are almost the same as in Mestia.  The cost of lift services is 150 rubles.  at a time, and the price of a ski pass for a day is 650 rubles, for a week - about 3.5 thousand rubles.  The same prices for ski passes and in the ski resort of Tetnuldi. </p><h2>  Gudauri </h2><p>  One of the oldest ski resorts in Georgia is Gudauri.  It also belongs to one of the largest and most developed.  <span>The mountain resort of Georgia, Gudauri,</span> was built between 1975 and 1985, however, it is currently being reconstructed and is constantly being modernized.  To represent its scale, it should be noted that at the same time 11 thousand people can ride here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.holidayme.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels in Gudauri" class="if uuid-3141719" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3141719.jpg"></div><p>  In technical terms, this is the most developed and modern tourist complex.  It has the latest lifts and a modern cable car.  For the best arrangement of the ski slopes, new snow cannons are installed here.  The elevation difference on the resort's routes is from 1,990 to 3,239 m. </p><h2>  Trails and services </h2><p>  In total, 22 ski slopes are equipped in the mountain resort of <span>Georgia Gudauri</span> .  Their total length is as much as 57 km.  Trails are created both for professionals and for amateurs and beginners.  Four of them are intended exclusively for professionals, as they have a very high level of complexity.  The rest are perfect for amateurs or beginners, but the latter should ride with an instructor.  Also for the convenience of beginners in skiing in the resort there are special skiing schools. </p><div class="photo" data-original="transfersgeorgia.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://transfersgeorgia.com/gudauri-ski-resort-best-to-visit-georgia-at-winter-time/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Heli-ski in Gudauri" class="if uuid-3141713" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3141713.jpg"></div><p>  Mountain resorts of <span>Georgia in winter</span> attract a huge number of lovers of extreme relaxation.  In Gudauri, the tracks are perfectly adapted for freeriding, which attracts lovers of this type of skiing holiday here.  However, they also offer unique services, such as heli-skiing.  This is the throwing of skiers or snowboarders from a helicopter to any slope to the very top of the mountain, to those places where the so-called wild tracks are located.  However, before this, the rider must sign documents that remove any responsibility from the resort administration.  Extreme skating lovers spend such skating at their own peril and risk. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Gudauri has a very well developed infrastructure.

Their prices range from 2 (for a three-star room) to 6.5 thousand rubles.  (for apartments with beautiful views and walking distance from the ski lifts).  One lift will cost 150 rubles, and a ski pass per day - 1 thousand rubles.  Here you will be offered several options for ski passes, from which you can choose the one that suits you and allows you to save an impressive amount. </p><p>  In the summer, the mountain resort of Georgia - Gudauri, in addition to spa centers and restaurants, offers to spend time taking a ride on the cable car or use one of the bike trails.
