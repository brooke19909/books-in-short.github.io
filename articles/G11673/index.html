Moscow - Cyprus: time difference</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Cyprus is a paradise that gave people love, because it was here that the goddess Aphrodite was born.  She came out of the sea foam, illuminated by bright sunshine, under the sonorous singing of birds.  Everything here seems to be filled with her presence: blue sky, fragrant plants, quiet starry nights.  The cool forests beckon in their shadow, the golden beaches fill with joy and health, from the citrus orchards a delightful aroma spreads everywhere. </p>

    <p>  Everyone who goes to the island is interested in the time difference with Cyprus.  Indeed, for a comfortable stay, it is important that the body adapts easily.  Going on a trip, it is better to ask in advance in what time zone the resort is located. </p><h2>  Difference time Cyprus </h2><p>  Everyone knows that a day consists of 24 hours.  In accordance with this, our entire planet is divided into as many time zones.  The belt system also contains 24 meridians.  The zero belt, from where the countdown begins, is called the <span>Greenwich Meridian,</span> its longitude is zero.  Having studied the map of time zones, we can conclude that Cyprus has +2 hours relative to Greenwich. </p><p>  So, for people traveling Moscow-Cyprus, the time difference will be only one hour.  This has a very positive effect on the state of the body.  Moscow tourists do not have to adapt at all.  A flight in comfortable conditions takes only four hours, so on the very first day, without wasting time recovering from the road, you can plunge into this exotic world, and even the hourly difference with Cyprus does not affect your well-being. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  General description of the island </h2>

    <p>  Doctors believe that Cyprus is a place with a healthy climate.  Those who suffer from thyroid diseases often recover without any medication after living on this island for a year and a half.  The time difference with Cyprus for residents of Central Russia is not noticeable at all, it is also an important factor for restoring health, because the body does not require additional forces to adapt. </p><h2>  Sea and sun </h2><p>  All beaches in Cyprus are municipal, most often you have to pay for beach equipment.  The best beaches are in Ayia Napa.  Picturesque Nissi Beach is also attractive for its snow-white sand, and a small island is nearby in the water.  Popular in Cyprus Sand Bay, Golden Sands.  The beautiful pebble beach of Petra tou Romio stands apart.  The longest beach in Cyprus is the Ladies' Mile, it is located west of Limassol and is very popular among the local population.  On Governor's beach, beach parties are often held.  In Larnaca, Finikoudes and Mackenzie are popular.  Often hotels in Larnaca, Paphos and Limassol provide their guests with free beach equipment, but in Ayia Napa and Protaras this is very rare. </p><h2>  Where to stay </h2><p>  The time difference with Cyprus is easily determined.  Knowing that Cyprus is located +2 hours from the Greenwich meridian, being at any point, you can calculate the time of arrival to the island.  It is worth noting that the island has many hotels that receive guests around the clock.  Service categories are different, from two stars to five.  Two-star hotels are of quite decent standard, equipped with air conditioning, although this is paid extra.  Often you can meet Russian-speaking staff in hotels.  Breakfasts in 2 * continental hotels, 3-5 * - a buffet is organized.  Some hotels offer half board: a choice of lunch or dinner.  Modern 2-4 * hotels offer an all-inclusive system.  The higher the rating for Ayia Napa hotels, the greater the likelihood that the institution has its own beach. </p>
