    <p>  The way to restore health with mud has long been known.  It was discovered about two millennia ago by Greek immigrants who lived in the territory of modern Crimea.  They extracted mud from the bottom of Saxon Lakes (Black Sea coast) and used it to heal from many diseases. </p><h2>  General information </h2><p>  Historians believe that mud from Astrakhan salt ponds has been treated since the first half of the 16th century.  They began to be called Tinak lakes after Astrakhan joined the Moscow state.  The left bank of the Volga became the foundation site of a new Russian settlement.  At the bottom of local reservoirs was a thick layer of mud.  Hence their name went: Tinak Lakes. </p><h2>  Historical information </h2><p>  In 1820, wooden barracks were built near the lakes.  They temporarily lived in the lower ranks of the military, who were sent here to be treated.  The fame of the magical healing properties of Lake Tinaki spread far.  Now, representatives of the upper classes are turning to traditional medicine for help.  In gratitude for healing, the merchant Sapozhnikov built special rooms where it was possible to take mud baths.  Later, three buildings were erected to accommodate those who came for treatment.  So begins its existence a special medical institution on Tinaki. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since 1982, the institution has been under the control of trade union bodies.  From this moment, "Sanatorium No. 2" begins to work.  At the very end of the 20th century, it is already a federal state institution managed by the Social Insurance Fund of the Russian Federation. </p><h2>  Wellness Details </h2>
