The ability to play is appreciated in preference, luck is not very important here, although they play for money.  Only through one's own skill can one achieve good results in this aristocratic game.  The name preference comes from the French word preference.  It translates - "preference, advantage, superiority."  Earlier this word was used to call cards of the highest suit.  Such a term was present in other card games.  In Vista, this was the trump card, for example. </p><p>  In our time, preference has not lost its popularity.  In 1996, the Code was adopted. </p>

Among his main tasks is protecting the rights of each individual player, maintaining equal chances of winning and losing all participants.  It describes how to play, what is the compensation even in case of accidental violation of the rules of the game, and it is always adequate.  The Code teaches to fully support the adopted rules and not one iota to evade compliance.  If a player, through negligence or inattention, has violated the law, he must be prepared to accept the punishment for the violation with dignity.  As you can see, a very serious occupation is playing preference.  The rules should be strictly observed.  The Code written and accepted into the game is intended to punish for compelled violations of the rules and conditions of the game. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="preference rules" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24337/538371.jpg" width="600"></div>  As a result of different rules adopted in different territories, it was necessary to create a single Law that would regulate the game among participants from different countries.  In order to develop uniform fair rules and common terminology that would eliminate ambiguity in explaining concepts, the Code was written.  Also, this document is intended to reduce disputes that arise constantly during the game, when there is no single agreement.  In the future, it is planned to organize a Preference League.  The provisions of the Code are a kind of supreme justice, which is based on Roman law.  Participants need to know exactly how to play preference.  Rules must be learned.  Only in this case will you get a fair and productive game.  Every year, the number of people wishing to learn how to play preference is growing.  The rules of the game for beginners tried to prescribe in the Code as clear as possible.

The preference deck has 32 cards - 8 of each suit.  According to seniority, suits are arranged as follows: worms, diamonds, clubs, peaks.  This seniority matters when trading and ordering a contract (game).  Each suit consists of: ace, king, queen, jack, ten, nine, eight, seven.  When playing preference, cards are dealt two by two.  At the beginning of the game, any of the suits can be trump.  A trump card is always considered older than any other suit.  When recording, each of the stripes has its own designation.  Worms - @, E - tambourines, &amp; - clubs and –Ñ - peaks.  The names of the cards also have abbreviations: the queen, for example, D, jack - J and so on.  The digital value is written in a digit.  When ordering a game, the value is written in the first place, and the trump suit in the second.  For example, 7 @. </p><h2>  Bribe </h2><p>  The principle of fun involves playing with tricks.  This fun is known as sports preference.  Using the rules, one is assigned to pick up a bribe and record a certain amount of points.  Start the game with a move.  A move is the first card laid on the table.  After entering the worms, for example, other players put cards of hearts on the table. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="card games rules" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24337/538375.jpg" width="295"></div>  Only in the absence of a card of this suit can you lay out a trump card.  Of course, if there is no suit or trump card, then you can put any card.  Usually, if the game is ascending, then give a card of small value.  Players take turns putting cards on the table, and the oldest in seniority and trump takes all the bribe.  In preference, unlike a thousand, the game is both about taking a bribe, and, conversely, not taking a bribe.  It‚Äôs like a ladies' preference - I want, I don‚Äôt want.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Types of games </h2><p>  Games are divided into three types.  This division exists in different types of preference.  Russian preference is no exception.  In the first bribe game, you need to figure out the amount that you must take, while ordering a trump yourself or playing without a trump card.  With a meager one must try not to take a single bribe.  And in the third game, the layout, everyone should try not to take bribes.  There are games in which you need to take 6, 7, 8 or 9-10 tricks per game.  Each with his own game, having correctly assessed the chances, must play the ordered game.  When distributing, it is important to be able to choose a draw that in this situation will bring more points.  All the games that a participant needs to play are called a remote control. </p><h2>  Player Seats </h2><p>  The preference bullet begins with a rally of places.  It happens like this: everyone is pulled out of the deck on the map, and the one who pulled out the youngest and chooses the place first.  The rest are arranged clockwise in ascending order.  If two drawn cards of equal worth, then they distinguish by suit seniority.  Ace is considered the youngest of all. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sports preference" class="if" height="376" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24337/538386.jpg" width="537"></div>  If three play, and the fourth comes, then the average points between the bullet and the mountain are written to him.  The newcomer takes a seat on the left hand of the dealer and begins to take.

    <h2>  Distribution of cards </h2><p>  Card game preference has its own characteristics when dealing cards.  The one who will win will be the first to give out cards, just as the places played.  Deal cards clockwise.  The player who first starts the shuffle, having finished, puts the cards in front of the player on the right and offers him to remove and transfer the cards.  Any of the players may ask to shuffle the cards.  Having done this, he returns the cards to the dealer.  After the player on the right removes the cards, the one who deals, continues to deal.  If the cards turned upside down during the distribution, you must shuffle them.  Removing the deck must be done not in the hand, but on the table, so that when you remove the cards, at least four are left on the table.  If you violate the rules of withdrawal and distribution, you must repeat the procedure again.  If the player who is supposed to shoot is absent, then the person sitting to his right can make a shot.  When the distribution is carried out with errors, then the cards are reassigned in a new way until everything goes smoothly.  For how many cards on hand, everyone is responsible for himself, and at the end of the game, if necessary, everyone reaps the fruits of the penalty.  Therefore, it should be, as soon as the discrepancy was noticed, to talk about it even before the start of the game.  If before the start a discrepancy in the number of cards is revealed, then you can re-issue the cards, or you can add the missing card to the player.  The main thing is that the rights of a third player who does not take part in the distribution are not infringed.  In any case, if there is a loss in interest, then the dealer will compensate.  And if the player started the game with the number of cards less than necessary, he will be punished with a fine in the form of the maximum possible plus.  Claims for change are considered before the start of the game.  When a player sees a buyback before the start of the game, he does not have the right to participate in the trade.  And if the game is played, then he must pick up the first two tricks, which begin with a card from a known buy-in.  In a situation where someone mistakenly took a ransom, the guilty person shuffles his cards and allows the dealer to pull out any two.  It is forbidden to look into the bribe before the start of the game, even to the dealer.  Penalty for violation - 5 points uphill.  You can‚Äôt show your cards to opponents, as well as look into strangers.  Before starting trading, everyone is obliged to check the number of their cards and agree that there are no claims to the distribution.  After the start of trading, the discrepancy in the number of cards is recorded as a penalty to the dealer who is not dealt, but to the one who has the disorder. </p><h2>  Trade </h2><p>  Immediately after the distribution, there is such a game process as trading (or auction).  The highest bidder takes a buyback and starts the game.  The first to start trading is sitting on the left hand of the dealer.  This is called the first hand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian preference" class="if" height="434" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24337/538389.jpg" width="490"></div>  Then (clockwise) - second hand and third.  If convenient, you can call the players on the cardinal points - north, west, south, east.  Participants bargain, following the rule: everyone says how much they will be able to take bribes if they pick up the ransom, appoint a trump card and start the game.  The competition for the right to play first begins with a promise to take six bribes.  At first they say that they will take six spades, six clubs, six tambourines and, finally, six worms, and six will complete the first stage without trump cards.  Then the same thing begins, but for seven tricks.  When all but one rescued in the trade, the player who won the auction takes the buyback and can play the price that he spoke, or any other price that is more expensive than the one with which he won the auction.  Only a minuscule can not be appointed after the end of the auction, it must be traded immediately.  There is a rule: you must bargain strictly following the price ladder, you can not jump over the stairs.  This exists so that the player has an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwho has what strong suit.  Miser can be ordered only at the first move.  If a player has already started bidding and has not named a miserable, then he loses the right to order a miserable in the game.  Anyone who does not want to continue trading or can not - pass.  If the application is named and the rest are saved, then the winner must start the game, the bet must play, there is no return.  When everyone saved during the trade, they play the game - everyone tries to take as few bribes as possible.  A buy-out can be opened only to the one who won in the trade.  He takes the buyback, announces the final price, which can be no lower than the one stated during the trade, and starts the game.  If first the first and then the second hands were saved, then the third hand has the right to pick up the buyback without trading and undertakes to take any price in the game, except for a minuscule.  When a player looks into the bribe before the end of bidding, he has no right to continue to participate in the trade.  And if at the same time, damage is caused to others, then compensation is due (at the expense of the violator) to all players.  If the buyback is open to the public, and someone has not yet made a bet, then the purchase goes to someone who has not made a bet yet.  If the buy-in was opened, and two of the players did not make bets, then everyone opens the cards and assumes how many people could play the prices, and then they write this to the penalty box as a whist.  For example, someone could play nine worms, and someone could play six tambourines: 52 whists for ninefold and 7 whists write down the difference from their gain.  In situations where the player took the buyback to himself before the end of the trade, and there remains a player who has not yet bargained, the latter can shuffle the cards of the pickup and draw any two into the buyout.  Blindness can only be played by prior arrangement.  When playing the game blindly, if no one interrupted the game of seven, bribes are considered at a double price.  If after seven games the pass is ordered again blindly, then they are interrupted by eight, and the points are counted four times.  Possible trade - once in the dark.  Interrupted by the most common application and then traded at a price.  You can open the cards and continue to bargain on the stairs.  If the player won the game blindly, then he does not show anyone the buy-in.  If a game is ordered as a gear, then everyone must whist blindly, but in other games the whist is normal.  When playing blindly, the price of any game doubles.  Before a player picks up a buyback, when playing blindly, you can change the price and declare a minuscule.  Of course, then the buyback opens and a double bet disappears.  There is still such a game as a miserable miserable.  They interrupt such a game only with a ninefold bet, blind or tenfold.  With such a game, they take away the buyback without showing, they catch such a minuscule blindly, in other words, those who whistle do not open their cards.

    <h2>  Order price </h2><p>  After the trade is completed, the winner takes the buyback, puts aside, without showing, two unnecessary cards and starts the game.  It is called a point guard and can increase the price it expects to play.  If a player does not want to play or the number of cards is not equal to ten, then he is punished with a remise (fine) without two on the declared game.  When the price is ordered, it is not allowed to change the cards in the demolition.  After the first move, it is forbidden to watch the demolition.  If this rule is violated, one bribe will be punished.  And even if he played how much he ordered, then a fine is considered - without one. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ladies preference" class="if" height="419" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24337/538391.jpg" width="600"></div>  When taken more than necessary, then write down one less.  If you refuse to buy, you can be sentenced to an agreed amount of points uphill.  In serious tournaments, the rule does not apply - no one should suffer from the inability to put aces in the draw.  If a bribe was given to a player in a bribe, then the bonus is written to him as a bribe at his game.  For an ace, for example, one trick is written in the bribe, and two tricks are written for an ace and a king of the same suit.  Two aces in the buy-in will cost a premium of three bribes, and a margin will cost only one bribe.  But this rule, again, does not apply in serious rating games.  You can‚Äôt tell outsiders and gamers can‚Äôt use outsiders‚Äôs tips.

    <h2>  Minuscule </h2><p>  After trading, the winning player starts the game.  He announces, if he wants, the game is higher than ordered and begins to take bribes with or without a trump card.  If the game is minuscule, it means that the player who ordered has made a commitment not to take a single bribe.  After that, when someone won the trade on the minuscule, he reveals the cards of the buy.  After that, any two cards are demolished (demolition is not shown to anyone).  In a situation where the move belongs to the player, he does it until the opponents ‚Äúlie down‚Äù (open their cards), and if the move must be made by the whistlers, they open the cards before the first move.  There are no trump cards in the minuscule, the seniority of the cards is respected, the move goes to the player who last took the bribe.  When playing a minuscule, you can record the alignment, when with other games this is prohibited.  All of these rules help you figure out how to play preference. </p><h2>  Unpacking </h2><p>  It is played with three passes.  We must try to take the smallest amount of bribes.  Before the game, the participants agree on where the transfer will be recorded - uphill or whist.  With different types of preference, each trick costs the required number of points uphill.  If a player has not taken a single trick, they will record one trick. The one who took the least number of tricks writes the stipulated number of whists to other players. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="card game preference" class="if" height="273" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24337/538394.jpg" width="490"></div>  If not a single bribe is taken, then only one point is written.  After the end of the game, the same amount of bribes from all is written off, as in an amnesty.  There are no trump cards when unpacking, you can carry any card if you don‚Äôt have a suit.  If four are playing, then when they are unpacking, they start the game by opening the first buy-in card, moreover, the eldest by suit takes a bribe.  The second move is also done from the buy.  And only the third move is made by the player who is to the left of the one who was distributing.  The layout in the classic game is played so that all players earn some bombs.

    <h2>  Cost of games </h2><p>  With different types of preference, there are different prices for games.  The ordered prices and taken during the game are recorded in the bullet.  When recording, some scoring rules must be followed.  If with any game you‚Äôve scored more than you can record for that game, then the remaining points are written to other games or deducted from other whists.  The final score in the game is determined in whists played.  The largest amount of whists collected is an objective measure of victory.  These are the basic rules of how to play preference.  It is also worth saying that you can use to determine the winner and the number of won passes or the number of tricks on all transfers.  But in the end, the difference in whists is considered.  In the final game always follows the conversion of points in monetary terms.  After all, preference is played for money without a twinge of conscience.  This game is for this and created.  How to play preference if you can‚Äôt take risks? </p>
