    <p>  One of the most environmentally friendly areas is the island of Kos.  Attractions are scattered throughout the resort area.  The amazing creations of mankind have survived to our times.  The animal world flourishes in the province: there are delightful flamingos, huge turtles and lazy seals.  Often Kos is called a natural and architectural reserve. </p><p>  And how many ancient ruins are scattered on the territory!  For example, in the central part of the island, archaeologists found objects of the early Christian and Mycenaean era, which were subsequently exhibited in the Archaeological Museum.  Among the exhibits, a special place is occupied by a mosaic with images of Hippocrates and Asclepius.  The evidence that there was life on these lands earlier is the found cemetery with buried children of different ages. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the eastern zone, many ancient temples with amazing ornaments were found.  Also found here is the altar of Hercules and the pandemic of Venus.  And in the western part, the altar of Dionysus was excavated, as well as numerous structures with an unusual <span>mosaic floor.</span>  Scientists have found the Casa Romana mansion, decorated with frescoes and ancient sculptures.  Valuable buildings and expositions from different eras (Roman, Hellenistic, classical) are presented in the Archaeological Museum, which is located on Freedom Square. </p><h2>  Hippocrates' Plane </h2>

    <p>  Acquaintance with the island, according to locals, it is better to start with a tour of the main square, on it grows the majestic tree of Hippocrates (or wish plane).  According to unofficial sources, the ancient Greek doctor himself planted him about two thousand years ago in order to conduct disputes and exercises under his shady crowns with his friends and students. </p><p>  Some researchers believe that this tree is no more than 500 years old, but there are no supporting facts for these assumptions yet.  The plane-tree circumference is more than 14 m, it stands on a stone structure, and its bulky branches are supported by metal sticks.  Locals take care of him, who consider the tree the main shrine of the province.  Every year in the summer season, grandiose festivals are held on the square. </p><h2>  Temple complex Asklepion </h2>

    <p>  The island of Kos, the photo of which is presented in the article, is proud of the ruins of the temple of the healing god Asclepius.  After a powerful earthquake, the structure collapsed and small structures remained in its place.  Asklepion was previously a medical sanatorium and consisted of several levels. </p><p>  There was also a medical school with spring sources and majestic arches.  In the 4th century, the shrine of Asclepius was erected on the third level.  A few centuries later, wards for the sick and a cathedral of the Doric period were built. </p><h2>  Knights castle </h2><p>  The island of Kos is rightfully proud of its oldest buildings.  Excursions around the castle leave a lasting impression on tourists.  According to reliable information, the construction of the fortress began in the 14th century, and ended only in the 18th century.  This was constantly hindered by attacks from the Turks.  In the appearance of an unusual building, several architectural styles are visible.  There are ancient sculptures, old inscriptions with altars. </p><h2>  The majestic castle of Antimachia </h2>

    <p>  In a picturesque settlement, 3 km from the island, there is a Venetian building, which previously served as a haven for local residents.  The appearance of the fortress was completely preserved, even despite numerous attacks.  Before the entrance, the date 1494 is knocked out and the symbol of the knights of the Order of Malta is indicated. </p><p>  The interior is unremarkable.  There are two cathedrals of the 16th and 18th centuries and the dilapidated foundations of ancient buildings.  But what a panorama opens from the walls of the building - pristine landscapes and the blue sea! </p><h2>  What else is remarkable about the island of Kos? </h2><p>  The resort map is presented in the article, on it you can see a small piece of land.  Splendor and power strike the holy cathedrals and churches.  Numerous Muslim and Orthodox churches are of great value to the city (the Defterdar and Haji Hassan Mosques, the Church of the Holy Martyr Paraskeva). </p>
