Description of major cities in South Korea</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Republic of South Korea has long reached a high level of economy.  It is located in Asia in the south of the <span>Korean Peninsula.</span>  It is washed from all sides by the seas and the strait.  It borders on North <span>Korea (DPRK) in the</span> north <span>.</span>  For tourists, the republic is a state with beautiful sights, a high standard of living, sea resorts and mountain landscapes.  The photo of the cities of South Korea really makes you dream of a trip here.  However, a number of questions immediately arise.  Which cities do you need to visit?  What sights should not be missed? </p><h2>  The main cities of South Korea </h2><p>  The capital is simultaneously the main industrial center.  Seoul produces over a quarter of the country's total output.  Once in the city, you can notice areas whose design reminds of the traditions of the people.  But coming out of them, you immediately stumble upon modern high-rise buildings, complexes.  Tourists are attracted by the Kuepok Palace, which has preserved ancient Korean architecture. </p><p>  Busan is a city considered the main port of the state.  In its area, it occupies the second place in the country.  No cities in South Korea perform such an important function as Busan.  The name of the village is consistent with the location - "among the mountains."  Near the city center is a pine forest.  Near the last you can find the temple of Pomoso.  It is an ancient attraction, because it was built 1300 years ago.  The climate in Busan is quite mild, which attracts tourists. </p><p>  Just an hour's flight from Seoul is the ninth province - Jeju Island.  It is filled with romance and beauty, because it is isolated from the rest of the state.  It is visited by tourists from all over the world.  Jeju has a mild climate, as well as all seasons are clearly visible here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cities of south korea" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1322539.jpg" width="600"></div>

The city managed to create a sense of Western urbanism, but also to maintain its national identity.  Here you can find a huge number of skyscrapers.  The development of the city has reached such proportions that it is possible to do shopping non-stop.  For example, there are shops that have 24 floors, 7 of which are underground.  Shopping centers consist of 20 buildings.  They are located about 5 thousand stores. </p><p>  When planning to fly to Seoul, it is worthwhile to understand that in winter the mark on the thermometer can drop to a critical minimum.  However, snow and strong cold should not be expected.  In the summers it is hot enough; precipitation most often falls in July and August. </p><p>  Incheon Airport is located in the same city.  It takes direct flights from many Russian cities, such as Moscow, St. Petersburg, Novosibirsk and others. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="main cities of south korea" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1322536.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Gyeongju </h2><p>  Do not find the cities of South Korea better than Gyeongju.  It is constantly visited by millions of tourists and deserves such popularity. </p><p>  Kenju is located in southeastern South Korea.  Despite the fact that it is located on the hills, over the past 60 years the city has grown quite a lot.  During the reign of the Force, Gyeongju was the capital of a powerful state. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Since ancient times, the city has often been flooded due to the Hensan River.  But due to the correct actions by the government, the floods were stopped.  The last major disaster occurred in 1991. </p><p>  Gyeongju in the world received the name - the largest museum.  Here you can find 50 statues, 120 temples (some destroyed), 60 pagodas, 16 stone lamps.  Mount Namsan is the center of Buddhism.  If there is an insatiable desire to get acquainted with history, then the rest of the cities of South Korea will wait - you need to go immediately to Gyeongju! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="major cities of south korea" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1322537.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Incheon </h2><p>  Incheon is only 25 km from Seoul.  It is rightly called the largest in the country.  Over the entire period of its existence, it has turned from a small settlement into a large center.  The first mention of Incheon suggests that people inhabited these territories long before our era.  Even then, the city was a small settlement, where mostly fishermen lived.  And now it is recognized as the most important sea and air center of the country.  Incheon Airport is the main transportation hub throughout South Korea.  Now about 2.5 million people live here.  There are skyscrapers, many hotels and holiday homes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="photo cities of south korea" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1322538.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In fact, all the cities of South Korea can hit the eye of a tourist.  In provinces that are not distinguished by a huge population, it is best to travel to those who want to get acquainted with the country's historical heritage, its culture and way of life.  Those who pursue modernity and technology should stay in one of the cities described. </p>
