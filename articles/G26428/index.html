The 10-inch device impressed the market with its aesthetics, compactness and lightness.  It is worth noting that not only the design and display, but also the internal characteristics, underwent a change in the new tablet model.  Here, Samsung went on with the many fans of the line. </p><h2>  General characteristics </h2><p>  The P5200 is based on a single-chip system called Clover Trail +, which was developed by Intel.  Consequently, the device platform will be characterized by mobility and performance for many years to come.  Representatives of the Intel brand assured their loyal users that the new technologies during the creation of Trail + made it possible to bring the sensor devices up two steps at once. <br><br>  It is worth noting that now the Galaxy 5200 Tab <span>3G 9 has</span> acquired the most powerful <span>central processor</span> of the Intel Atom line of the Z2560 series.  The total frequency of processing tasks was about 3.2 GHz.  These are not too sky-high performance indicators, however, developers have found a brilliant way out of this situation.  The processor is divided into 4 separate threads.  Therefore, information will be processed many times faster than that of predecessor models. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet galaxy 5200 tab 3g" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/732244.jpg" width="600"></div>  The Galaxy 5200 Tab 3G also has pretty good GPU specifications.  Here, two cores determine the total processing frequency of multimedia tasks at 0.8 GHz.  As for the memory chips, the internal one ranges from 16 to 64 GB, and RAM - 1 GB. <br><br>  Galaxy 5200 Tab 3G 9.1 tablet supports all the most popular interfaces, integrates with peripherals.  It should be noted that the device has an additional infrared port, a compass, an accelerometer and even a gyroscope.  Special attention should be paid to the improved capture sensor.  Thanks to Grip Sensor technology, the tablet is able to automatically optimize the head interface for left-handed users.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Design features </h2><p>  Externally, the device looks much more compact than it actually is.  The dimensions of the tablet are 24.2 by 17.1 cm. However, its thickness is only 8 mm.  This is a phenomenal indicator that no famous brand in the world can boast of.  It is important to know that there are a lot of fakes Galaxy 5200 Tab 3G on the market.  China is ahead of all other countries in this regard.  It was there that an impressive production of fake P5200s was established. <br><br>  The Chinese Galaxy 5200 Tab 3G can be recognized right away.  First of all, the thickness of the device is up to 15 mm.  Secondly, on the case there are no many company attributes of the manufacturer.  Thirdly, there are significant differences in the central interface and hardware specifications. <br><br>  Returning to the review of the original model, it is worth noting that its weight is only 504 grams.  This makes the P5200 one of the lightest tablets on the planet.  In the design of the new Tab 3, some elements are borrowed from the Note line.  The front panel immediately attracts attention.  Samsung engineers decided to move all the control buttons from the menu to the case itself.  But there is a circular mirror protection against accidental pressing.  Next to the buttons are the company logo and camera with a light indicator. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="galaxy 5200 tab 3g specifications" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/732245.jpg" width="600"></div>  The back panel is made of glossy plastic, which gives the device a neat appearance.  Nevertheless, because of this, the tablet slips noticeably in the hands.  Now it is recommended that you always keep it outside.  The Galaxy 5200 Tab 3G 64Gb has a slightly textured body, but it doesn‚Äôt even feel when touched.  From rubberizing faces as a result of development, it was decided to abandon. <br><br>  Both panels are separated by a stylish silver frame.  It is worth noting that on the top face there is now an infrared port, as well as slots for SD and SIM cards.  Now any manipulation with them will not cause any difficulties.  The slots are equipped with spring-loaded gripping mechanisms.  The power button and volume control are also located in the upper panel area. <br><br>  All faces are symmetrical, the edges are rounded.  When designing the tablet, it was decided to move the stereo speakers to the top.  This means that they will not be blocked by the hand.

The display is protected by a special mirror plate.  Unfortunately, it has a weak anti-reflective surface, that is, a low resolution filter display.  Thus, in conditions of strong exposure, the readability of the text decreases sharply.  Deteriorating display and matte surface of the display matrix, which does not accept direct rays of light.  But the screen is equipped with a special oleophobic film so that fingerprints are easily removed. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="chinese galaxy 5200 tab 3g" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/732283.jpg" width="600"></div>  The brightness level varies from 4 to 327 cd / m2.  This makes it possible to manually adjust the optimal values ‚Äã‚Äãduring the day and night.  The automatic brightness control works from the <span>light sensor of the</span> main camera of the Galaxy 5200 Tab 3G. <br><br>  The feedback from some tablet users hinted that the developers did not take any protective measures to prevent dust from entering the display.  This is an erroneous opinion, since these visible points, which at first glance look like particles of dirt, are an artificial coating defect.  It is designed to create a matte effect on the surface of the screen.  At low brightness, these points are especially visible. <br><br>  The display contrast is decent - 900 to 1. In the screen options you can find three levels of backlight: standard, dynamic and film.  When choosing one of them, the color rendition and the degree of brightness change.

The tablet is based on the new generation platform Clover Trail +.  This chipset line was presented by Intel at the international congress of mobile devices a little over a year ago.  The P5200 is equipped with a 2-core Z2560 processor, which is capable of processing tasks simultaneously with four threads at 0.8 GHz.  As for the graphic converter, it is represented by the standard 554th model of the PowerVR line. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy 5200 tab 3g" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/732247.jpg" width="600"></div>  Numerous performance tests have shown that the Tab 3 platform copes with any demanding games and applications.  Browsers load without apparent delay.  The tests were equally good at low and high resolution displays.

    <h2>  Interface support </h2><p>  The Galaxy 5200 Tab 3G tablet provides access to wireless communications through Intel's XMM6360 radio module.  This is the smallest chip that only exists in touch devices.  This was proudly announced by representatives of the Intel brand. <br><br>  Also, when developing the device, Samsung engineers decided to keep all mobile capabilities for their users.  For this, the microphone was specially located at the bottom of the tablet to improve the communication volume. <br><br>  As for wireless Internet, everything is standard here.  Wi-Fi networks are supported in the range from 2.4 to 5 GHz.  It is possible to transfer files via Bluetooth. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  The Samsung Galaxy 5200 Tab 3G has an Android OS version 4.2.2.  According to users, this is a step back in terms of interface functionality.  The fact is that the Note line uses newer versions of the operating system, which enable multitask access to programs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="galaxy 5200 tab 3g 9 1" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/732248.jpg" width="600"></div>  There are no controls in the central interface, since there are corresponding buttons on the front panel of the case.  But at the bottom of the menu there is a quick search bar for applications.  There are at least shortcuts on the desktop.  Access to full functionality is opened only in the taskbar. <br><br>  It is worth noting that the OS makes it possible to use the tablet as a phone, however, this requires special utilities.

    <h2>  Camera Features </h2><p>  Regarding shooting, the Galaxy 5200 Tab 3G reviews get twofold.  On the one hand, the rear camera is capable of delivering images with a resolution of 2048x1536 ppi.  On the other hand, 3 megapixels in the modern world of advanced technologies is already very scarce.  There are no drawbacks when shooting with maximum resolution.  This applies to the brightness of images, and grain, and contrast, and color reproduction. <br><br>  Nevertheless, the video stream is obtained of rather average quality.  The maximum supported shooting format in MPEG-4 is 720 rubles at a speed of 12 Mbps.  It is unlikely to get a clear storyboard from such a video file. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="model galaxy 5200 tab 3g" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/732249.jpg" width="600"></div>  The quality of the <span>front camera is</span> fully consistent with the available 1.3 megapixels.  It is ideal for video chat and amateur selfie.  The picture is nice, but not clear.

    <h2>  Battery performance </h2><p>  Testing the tablet battery passed without a single blot.  The battery really holds a good charge.  No wonder its capacity was increased to 6800 mAh.  And although this indicator is slightly less than that of the Note line (7000 mAh), but much less charge is spent on hardware. <br><br>  The battery lasts up to 6 hours with an average level of work.  In game or high-quality shooting mode, the charge runs out in about 4.5 hours.  In the inactive state, the device can work up to 2 days. <br><br>  The tablet is charged through a special 2A / 5V <span>network adapter</span> .  Unfortunately, there is no possibility of recharging via a USB port. </p><h2>  Expert Reviews </h2><p>  At the moment, the Galaxy 5200 Tab 3G is considered the lightest and thinnest 10-inch tablet.  Expert reviews show that this was achieved thanks to the compact configuration and new technologies for developing integrated chipsets.  The turning point of the model was the use of an infrared port and the expansion of support for an external memory slot to 64 GB.  Of the performance characteristics, the engineers distinguish the Clover Trail + chipset, which ensures smooth and stable operation of the OS at maximum requirements. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="galaxy 5200 tab 3g reviews" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/732250.jpg" width="385"></div>  Of the minuses, an unreasonably high cost is noted - about 25,000 rubles.  The experts also recorded weak Wi-Fi antenna and low-quality Galaxy 5200 Tab 3G rear camera as flaws.

    <h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  The users of the tablet primarily note such advantages as a beautiful screen, stylish design, display brightness, thickness and a pleasant to the touch back panel.  Customers also highlight the fast FPS engine in games, the speed of work with demanding applications, an intuitive interface, the convenience of ports for external cards, excellent battery power, and powerful speakers. <br><br>  What Tab 3 owners do not like is that the device is very hot and the display is poorly protected from glare.  The high price, low RAM and screen grain at minimum brightness are also on the list of shortcomings. </p>
