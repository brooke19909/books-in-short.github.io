It can be played both on a computer and on paper, and once only the second option was used, since there was no other possibility.  Not everyone knows how to play Sea Battle, because either there was no opportunity to learn, or there was no ‚Äúteacher."  In any case, such knowledge may come in handy.  The rules of the game ‚ÄúSea Battle‚Äù are simple, any person can remember them, despite their age and level of intelligence. </p><h2>  General </h2><p>  The game "Sea Battle" has long captivated many people.  It is interesting, fascinating, and most importantly - it does not require any costs.  To play with a person together, you will need two sheets of paper in a cage (preferably) and two pens (or 2 pencils). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="&quot;Sea battle&quot; on paper" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18975/394453.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  "Sea battle" is useful not only because it allows you to have a good time.  The game also contributes to the development of strategic thinking and intuition.  If you and a person know each other, you have the opportunity to apply information about the enemy.  For example, your assumptions about how he could put the ships in order to make them difficult to find, how you would set up if you were in his place can be confirmed and help to win. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  rules </h2><p>  Well, you can proceed to the main part.  Now you will learn how to play Sea Battle: </p><p>  1. First you need to draw on a sheet of paper two squares measuring 10x10 cells (of course, it is easier to draw on a sheet in a cage).  Then, in both figures, put the letters from A to K on the top row (from left to right, skipping E and Y), and to the left of the squares, numbers from 1 to 10 (from top to bottom). </p><p>  2. On the left square you need to place: </p><ul><li>  1 ship, consisting of 4 cells; </li><li>  2 ships, consisting of 3 cells; </li><li>  3 ships, consisting of 2 cells; </li><li>  4 ships, consisting of the 1st cell. </li></ul><p>  Ships cannot adjoin each other neither sides, nor corners.  It is important that there is at least one free cell between them.  Ships can touch the edges of the playing field, and they should be located only vertically and horizontally (it is impossible to diagonally). </p><p>  The right square should remain empty. </p><p>  3. The goal of each player is to destroy enemy ships.  The one who walks first (by agreement or by chance (using the draw)) calls the coordinates (letter-number), looking at the right empty square.  For example, E7.  The opponent looks at his left drawing, where his ships are located, and answers: </p><p>  a) by; <br>  b) injured; <br>  c) killed. </p><p>  The first option means that the player got into an empty cell, that is, did not get anywhere.  He marks this place in his right square so as not to select it a second time (most often with a cross, but it can be done in any other convenient way), and in the meantime the move goes to the second player. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rules of the game &quot;sea battle&quot;" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18975/394450.jpg?1399851419247" width="500"></div>

Having marked the right place in his card, the person has the right to the next move until he misses.  So, if after the cry of E7 the response was ‚Äúinjured‚Äù, the player can call either E6, or Zh7, or E8, or D7 to finish off the wounded ship (by the way, this is not necessary, you can temporarily leave him alone and look for others) .  The second player again answers ‚Äúpast,‚Äù ‚Äúinjured,‚Äù or ‚Äúkilled.‚Äù </p><p>  The third option means that the enemy ship is destroyed.  If this happened on the first move, it means that it was one-deck (consisting of one cell), which can be called a great success.  If from the second (for example, after E7 the player said E6), then double-decker, etc.  After knocking down the ship, as well as after being wounded, the player walks until he receives the answer ‚Äúpast‚Äù. </p><p>  4. The move goes from one player to another in case of a miss and is delayed by one of the opponents in the event of a successful hit.  The winner is the person who first finds and destroys all enemy ships. </p><h2>  Other variations </h2><p>  It happens "Sea battle" on paper, but it happens on the computer, as mentioned earlier.  And if for the first option you need a real, lively opponent, then in the latter case you can play with robots.  True, firstly, it will not be so interesting (the enemy‚Äôs reaction when you sink his ship is priceless), secondly, the ability to peek into the enemy fleet is absolutely excluded (we all understand that some people strive to cheat). </p>

It‚Äôs important to immediately clarify all the rules, because if it is not clear to everyone how to play the ‚ÄúSea Battle‚Äù, the rules of which you came up with, nothing good will come of it, a quality game will not work.

    <p>  For example, you can add more cells to the "battlefield" (not 10x10, but 20x10, for example), after which either leave the number of ships or increase them.  You can complicate the task so much that all the ships that need to be found by the enemy are single-deck.  You can make mines, when hit by which the enemy misses one turn.  The mass of options, the main thing - to know in all measure. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

From now on, you and your friends will have something to do during boring lessons / lectures or at work, if you have the opportunity to be close to each other and write on sheets of paper.
