    <p>  We will talk about one of these in today's review.  It will be dedicated to the Asus PadFone E phone. In this article we will describe the technical characteristics of the device, list its pros and cons, and also give customer feedback who have experience with the device.  According to them, in fact, the opinion about this device will be finally formed.  In the meantime, let's go directly to the characteristics of the smartphone and begin with the configuration of the model. </p><h2>  Kit </h2><p>  Buying an Asus PadFone E, you get a white, neat box with the manufacturer‚Äôs logo and phone image on it.  Opening it, you see all the accessories that come with the device.  Their set, by the way, is quite rich - it is a charger (divided into an adapter and a cord), instructions for the phone, headphones and, of course, the device itself. </p><p>  The quality of the Asus PadFone E headset, of course, does not go further than that of any standard accessory.  The maximum that she is capable of is to give communication with the subscriber (it is unlikely to enjoy high-quality sound). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  Externally, the smartphone we are talking about is made quite simply, but with taste.  The finishing materials of the device, at least here, are more likely to relate to the budget segment - plastic on the back cover and glass on the front of the smartphone. </p><p>  The shape of the device is somewhat unusual due to the rounded edges and the complete absence of faces.  Also, a matte surface of the case leaves a positive impression, pleasant to the touch and at the same time quite practical (fingerprints will not be visible on it). </p><p>  In general, the location of the navigation elements is classic and differs little from how it is implemented on other models: there are a number of touch buttons under the screen;  the screen unlock key is placed on the top face (along with the functional opening for the headphones);  The volume change swing is located on the side of the smartphone (along with the microUSB connector). </p>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  As noted earlier, almost the entire front of the smartphone (with the exception of the glossy decorative plate at the bottom of the case) is covered with protective glass.  The solution is quite successful - such a design looks attractive. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The size of the display is not quite standard 4.7 inches (as many people think - the ideal ratio).  The screen resolution reaches 1280 by 720 pixels, which, in turn, creates a clear image with a pixel density of 312 pixels.  per inch. </p><p>  In addition to these characteristics, it is worth noting a flexible adjustment of the screen brightness, as well as a touchscreen installed on the Asus PadFone E, capable of recognizing up to 10 simultaneous touches.  If the first category allows you to comfortably use the phone both in sunny weather and in the dark, then the second creates additional opportunities for interacting with games. </p><p>  Judging by user reviews, as well as taking into account technical characteristics, the picture can be considered quite high-quality for this class of devices. </p><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  The phone operates on the basis of the quad-core Qualcomm SnapDragon 400 - a processor, each of whose cores is capable of delivering a clock frequency of up to 1.4 GHz.  The smartphone has 1 GB of RAM, which, according to users, is enough to perform basic tasks and work with some not too bulky games.  And when playing more complex graphics of performance wonders, the smartphone, of course, will not show.  In terms of response speed and speed, the Asus PadFone E A68M can be categorized as ‚Äúabove average‚Äù. </p>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The device is traditionally equipped with front and rear cameras.  The first has a matrix, the resolution of which reaches 2 megapixels: the shooting quality is noticeably worse.  As for the second, its resolution is 13 megapixels, and through various software mechanisms for improving the quality of images (autofocus, stabilization, sharping, noise reduction system), photos taken with Asus PadFone E do very well. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  As expected for devices in this segment, the model has support for two SIM cards.  Both are able to work in 2G / 3G networks, but, alas, do not receive an LTE signal - this is a noticeable minus for residents of the capital and large cities, where this communication format is available to each subscriber. </p><p>  In addition to GSM, the device also works with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and also has a GPS function for navigation and location. </p>

    <h2>  Operating system and shell </h2><p>  The base for the software operation of the device is Android OS version 4.3.  Of course, the basis was the ‚Äúnative‚Äù shell, which underwent some changes, adapted exclusively for Asus PadFone E. The smartphone display, for example, received a number of new menu panels, with which the settings became more flexible, and the functionality of the smartphone expanded significantly.  These changes affected various modules: cameras, quick navigation panels, sounds, and more. </p><p>  An option has also appeared that allows you to configure the phone when placing it on an Asus dock. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  <span>Asus</span> PadFone E <span>smartphones</span> received 16 GB of internal memory, 6 of which are occupied by standard system files.  The remaining space, about 10 GB, the user can use at his discretion, downloading personal data. </p><p>  Realizing that this amount is clearly not enough, the manufacturer connected the ability to work with a memory card, the volume of which can be up to 32 additional gigabytes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphones asus padfone e" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/1024446.jpg" width="592"></div>

    <h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  Devices manufactured by Asus were not famous for having too much autonomy due to capacious batteries.  The same situation is observed in the case of Asus PadFone E (16Gb).  Its battery has a capacity of only 1820 mAh, which is a low indicator for modern multifunction devices with energy-intensive screens and powerful processors. </p><p>  The time during which the phone can work without additional charge depends on the type of task performed by it.  In particular, if reading books can "put" the battery in 15-16 hours, then watching a video while working via Wi-Fi does it in 7 hours, and 3D games in 3-4 hours.  Thus, in comparison with similar devices, PadFone E can be called "average" in the matter of saving battery power. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Examining the recommendations and specifications left by smartphone buyers, you can come to more objective conclusions about the device.  So we will do in our case. </p><p>  So, first of all, I would like to note a large number of laudatory reviews.  People positively characterize the technical stuffing of the device, its functionality, appearance, build quality.  The phone really "behaves" well, reliably holds a signal, practically never fails.  This significantly distinguishes the model from the now popular Chinese, unstable devices. </p><p>  However, there are negative comments regarding some points regarding PadFone E. For example, this is a weak battery.  Many complain that her working time is not enough to interact with the device all day, and this causes serious inconvenience.  You can get rid of them, unless by buying an additional portable charger (the so-called Power Bank). </p><p>  Another disadvantage is considered to be a quiet speaker.  Even at maximum volume in the settings, the phone does not play sounds loud enough to be heard properly.  This, in turn, causes discomfort if you miss an important call or alarm. </p>

    <p>  A number of other reviews negatively characterize the operation of the GPS module of the smartphone, as well as strong glare of the screen in the sun and difficulties in finding and finding a cover for the device.  The last problem can be solved by placing orders in Chinese online stores. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Once again, we note that the phone manufacturing company that we described today has long been famous for high-quality equipment.  And, as many believe, the Asus PadFone E (16Gb) A68M is one such model. </p><p>  The device works stably, without interruptions and signal loss - and this is already an indicator of the efforts of developers over it.  In addition, it should be noted that the operation of individual smartphone modules, in particular - the processor, camera, GSM-receiver and others.  The body materials and their tight fit among themselves also deserve praise.  All this, of course, speaks only in favor of the model. </p><p>  She certainly has flaws, and we have listed them a little higher in the text.  However, despite them, the phone leaves a positive impression and can be considered as an option by those who appreciate the simplicity, functionality and accessibility of the device.  It is with all these qualities that the model that we have described today is endowed. </p>
