History And Modernity</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Knitted sweaters from the moment of their appearance have gone through many stages of their evolution and therefore are the most real multifunctional clothes.  It is already impossible to find such a person, regardless of gender and age, who would not have at least one sweater in his wardrobe.  Surprisingly, this wardrobe item belongs to the oldest types of clothing, along with woolen shawls. </p><p>  Nowadays, <span>knitted sweaters</span> made of wool and other materials not only protect us from the piercing wind and warm us in the cold, but also create a certain image and support <span>the clothing style of</span> their owners.  Therefore, when choosing such a warm product, we first of all think not about how it will warm, but about our preferences in the style of clothes, with which it can be combined, in which situation it is better to wear and how it will be better to take care of it.  However, at the very beginning of its appearance, this garment did not carry any image functions, but performed purely practical tasks. </p><p>  Knitted sweaters were invented as work clothes for fishermen and sailors.  During their hard work, people in these professions, despite the cold, often sweated, and sweaters helped to sweat out, and the skin remained dry.  This story is confirmed by the name itself, derived from the English word sweat - sweat.  Some historians believe that the ancient Greeks were the first to wear these clothes, but no one could prove such a fact.  Documentary evidence of wearing such clothes appeared only in the Middle Ages.  Models then did not differ in a wide variety, they were worn only by men, putting on chain mail in order to protect the body from touching metal and this also provided additional protection against weapons.  For the manufacture of sweaters in those days used the hair of hares, goats, sheep, llamas, dogs and camels. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For a long time, <span>knitted sweaters</span> were considered an object of military uniform, but at the end of the XIX century they became popular among athletes.  For the competitors, they became a truly precious discovery, they began to wear them before the start of the competition and after the competition, so as not to lose heat and not get sick.  The sweaters did not differ in the variety of shapes; they did not have fasteners and jewelry and were worn, as before, over the head.  This continued until the fans paid attention to the knitted sweaters, they began to wear them in support of their favorite team.  At the same time, drawings began to appear on sweaters and they were already perceived as an element of the wardrobe. </p><p>  Already in the twenties of the last century, sweaters came to real fame, in addition to athletes and their fans, many people began to wear them, and many women began to master knitting of men's <span>sweaters with knitting needles.</span>  The physical qualities and convenience of these warm products led to the fact that they began to be worn for a walk, dressed for work, and even as festive and elegant clothes.  Then men took the initiative from men, and the sweater was no longer considered purely men's clothing.  Women purchased such clothes for themselves, manufacturers began to expand the assortment of models of sweaters, and the color scheme expanded significantly.  Of course, women who know how to knit here gave vent to their imagination, because with hand knitting or crocheting, you can make a sweater beautiful, fashionable and original.  Unmatched needlewomen began to master a variety of patterns and patterns, it became possible to make wicker patterns, longitudinal and transverse braids, to make all kinds of color drawings. </p><p>  In a short time, this part of the wardrobe firmly became one of the items of fashionable clothes, the range of not only colors, but also drawings and decorations expanded significantly.  Fashionable accessories appeared for wearing them with sweaters, and caring mothers began to put on their favorite children <span>‚Äôs sweaters</span> .  Today, a sweater, like any other clothes and shoes, has become subject to fashion trends.  The materials for their manufacture and the most various purposes have become so numerous that they even run their eyes.  This fact pleases modern fashionistas who are used to expressing their individuality in clothes.  The abundance of decor and the widest model range make it possible to take a walk of imagination and choose a product that no one else has. </p>
