  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Who invented the incandescent light bulb, and who introduced it into our lives?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, the comfort of our lives is ensured by the abundance of technical equipment and a variety of household appliances, without which it is already difficult for us to do.  We perceive them on a subconscious level, without thinking about how they work, who was their inventor.  Man by nature always strives for more; he sets ambitious plans for himself, systematically overcoming all difficulties.  There are plenty of examples of how people, forgetting about adversity, strived forward. </p><p>  However, you should never forget about your past, especially since there are enough examples that may be useful even now.  Then there were completely different tasks, it would seem simpler and more elementary, but imagine, if there weren‚Äôt an ordinary light bulb, how would we live now?  Probably, we would not think about modern technologies, space flights and powerful computers, but still tried to establish our own life if we forgot who invented the light bulb. </p><p>  We are used to attribute inventions to specific people, although sometimes the result is a joint work of a large number of people, but, for example, who invented the incandescent light bulb that is now in every house? </p><p>  Light to every home </p><p>  It must be understood that people could not live without light, so they tried with all their might to come up with something to illuminate their homes.  In the most ancient times, bonfires, stoves and fireplaces were used, after which candles were used.  But the use of live fire carries a number of inconveniences and even some danger. </p><p>  In antiquity, clay vessels filled with olive oil with a cotton wick were used.  Later, similar lamps were used on the Caspian coast, only oil products were used as fuel.  By the way, the first <span>wax candles</span> appeared only in the Middle Ages and were considered a rather important invention for its time. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Later, with the development of science, many scientists began to struggle to solve this problem.  One of them was Leonardo da Vinci, who brought many ideas to science.  It can also be partially considered as the one who invented the first light bulb.  Although it was a <span>kerosene lamp,</span> he simply refined his ideas.  But the problem remained the same - open fire near the fuel supply, in fact, made it a Molotov cocktail. </p><p>  Light bulb </p><p>  As mentioned above, the invention of the light bulb is a long process of work.  In the 19th century, the first prototype of a safe lighting device appeared.  It was made by Russian electrical engineer and scientist Pavel Nikolaevich Yablochkov.  It is Yablochkov - the one who invented the light bulb.  Also on his account is the first electric candle.  His invention had many drawbacks, first of all, inconstant <span>luminous flux</span> and low service life.  But, nevertheless, they began to be used in droves to illuminate the streets, as well as important objects of Russia: theaters, shops, central squares, etc. </p><p>  However, in fairness it is worth noting that when asked who invented the light bulb, you can not give only one name.  After all, the device itself has come a long way in evolution.  In the period from 1840 to 1870.  many scientists worked on the creation of an effective electric lighting device, but there were no results until in 1872 luck smiled on the Russian engineer Alexander Lodygin.  He is the one who invented the <span>incandescent lamp.</span>  Already in 1873, two Lodygin bulbs appeared on the streets of St. Petersburg. </p><p>  American scientist <span>Thomas Edison</span> knew about these achievements <span>.</span>  He used the experience of Lodygin, and tried to improve it by solving the problem with durability.  He still found the right composition of the carbon filament, which allowed the lamp to burn for several hundred hours.  It can also be attributed to the inventors of the lamp, although he worked more on improvement, combining the studies of various scientists. </p>
