We charge iPhone without a charger</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today it is impossible to imagine a modern person without a mobile phone.  However, it is impossible to imagine an electronic gadget without accompanying the full-fledged operation process of additional devices, the presence of which is a must.  For example, a failed charger will obviously doom the ‚Äúdependent‚Äù device to ‚Äúenergy death‚Äù.  However, the question of how to charge an iPhone without charging, given the great popularity of the ‚Äúfruitful‚Äù Apple brand, requires special coverage.  Your attention will be presented to some of the most original technological innovations that allow you to ‚Äúpump‚Äù California gadgets with the power of electricity that their batteries need so much, of course, without the ‚Äúparticipation‚Äù of a standard charger. </p><h2>  In search of promising technologies </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to charge an iPhone without charging?" class="if" height="414" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/358782.jpg" width="550"></div></h2><p>  First of all, the issue requires some concretization.  After all, each of us knows that without the influence of a certain type of energy, not one of the well-known inventions of ‚Äúhuman genius‚Äù will be able to function.  Therefore, the question of how to charge the iPhone without charging does not yet have a full answer.  Of course, some attempts by developers to change the principle of "life support" of the phone were successful.  It goes without saying that the standard memory will undergo major changes in the near future.  The problem of ‚Äúexpedient universality‚Äù already has several fundamentally different solutions.  However, today it is still not possible to ‚Äúglobally untie‚Äù mobile units from the usual power outlets.  However, how to charge an iPhone or another ‚Äúbrainchild‚Äù of the electronic industry when there is no access to the ‚Äúbenefits of civilization‚Äù is already a realizable reality.  But the low efficiency (Efficiency) of the developed and, by the way, commercially available devices and at the same time not thorough thought out of the ‚Äúmechanism‚Äù for supplying a certain power of charge are somewhat removed from being a full-fledged alternative to a 220 W source or another nominal value of the generally accepted standard of centralized electrification.  As a result, we are witnessing an ever-increasing need for <span>alternative energy sources</span> and the genuine interest of manufacturers ... It is these facts that prompt developers to search for the most suitable technological solutions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Overview of the most efficient ‚Äúrefueling‚Äù methods without using a standard power supply </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to charge an iPhone from a computer?" class="if" height="391" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/358783.jpg?1395595254976" width="550"></div></h2><p>  <em>Method number 1</em> </p><p>  Perhaps, we will start with the most elementary, but not always affordable option for energy supply of a mobile device.

    <p>  Of course, iQ technology - definitely an innovative version of wireless charging - contributes to the effective ‚Äúfilling‚Äù of the battery capacity without the difficult moment due to the connection of a 30-pin connector.  The question of how to charge an iPhone without charging will no longer express the unrealizability of hopes.  At the same time, the comfortable method greatly facilitates many operational tasks, and in particular, is the most gentle way to restore the electric potential of a battery.  Since the wear and damage of the iPhone pad is a natural inevitability due to the intensive use of the phone, as a result of which the device often has to be energized.  The attractive design of the module, which is an intermediary element between the charging station and the battery of the mobile device, is mounted on the back of the gadget, and the installation process is not complicated and does not require special tools and installation skills.  In the market of <span>consumer goods,</span> such a <span>wireless iPhone charging</span> is a product that is presented in a variety of designer designs.  The color, texture and material of the ‚Äúintermediate device‚Äù are available to the user in almost any preference.  The only drawback of such a memory can be considered the necessarily accompanying process of ‚Äúupgrading‚Äù the device, which increases the ‚Äúwaist‚Äù of the smartphone by several millimeters.  However, sometimes the question of how to charge an iPhone is resolved not only in this way ... </p><p>  <em>Improved method number 4</em> </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="IPhone, how to charge from a computer?" class="if" height="284" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/358797.jpg?1395595702824" width="472"></div></h2><p>  Today, the iQi Mobile project introduces a slightly improved version of the new power standard.  Despite the ‚Äúfreshness of ideas‚Äù, an increasing trend in consumer demand is seen in the market for mobile devices.  Widely recognized in user circles, a qualitatively modified memory allows wireless ‚Äúpouring‚Äù of electric power into the battery of a telephone.  The main advantage of the novelty is the critically reduced induction plate (receiver).  The problem of how to charge the iPhone without charging, and at the same time not ‚Äúdisfigure‚Äù the design, becomes completely solvable.  After all, the thickness of the additionally installed element is only 0.5-1.5 mm and is practically not noticeable under a thin layer of silicone frame.  This fact sets iQi Mobile apart from previously implemented wireless power standards.  The connection condition can be considered important: a flexible connection to the Lightning port does not hinder the subsequent user actions, primarily associated with the use of a 30-pin Iphone port.  Agree, this greatly facilitates many of the moments of mandatory access to the sometimes extremely necessary system connector of the mobile unit. </p><h2>  A few arguments for wireless memory </h2><ul><li>  Lack of mechanical connection moment (direct contact). </li><li>  Possibility of safe operation in adverse environments (moisture, damp). </li><li>  Comfort of use (mainly). </li></ul><h2>  A bit about the flaws </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="IPhone Charging" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/358795.jpg?1395595390399" width="600"></div></h2><ul><li>  Cost, size and weight are increasing. </li><li>  The time parameter of the electrical energy efficiency significantly exceeds the standard version (taking into account the efficiency of the original memory). </li><li>  There is no way to use the phone while charging the battery. </li></ul><h2>  To summarize, or Energy Perspectives for iPhone </h2><p>  How to charge your device from the computer, you know.  But what about when you are on a camping trip or find yourself in a situation where there are no available standard power supplies?  Today, there are devices on sale that can charge mobile devices using alternative methods of generating electricity.  These are original technological solutions in the form of converting devices that convert mechanical, thermal, kinetic, magnetic and other types of energy into the voltage and current required by your device.  Of course, there are much more minuses and shortcomings in the available devices than we would like.  Price, weight, dimensions and other shortcomings hinder the path to achieving absolute perfection.  But time passes, and technology develops ... </p>
