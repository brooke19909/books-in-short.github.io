    <p>  In the Czech Republic, money appeared a very long time ago.  A Celtic tribe living in the vicinity of modern Prague began to mint their gold coins in about 120 AD.  Money of various denominations was used on this territory - florins, ducats, tolars, pennies, dinars, etc. And actually Czech crowns (coruna) appeared in 1919.  Some of the banknotes issued at that time were real masterpieces of fine art that not every bonist collector now has.  For example, one of the bank notes, dated 1919, is estimated at no less than half a million kroons. </p>

They paid with everything that was at hand - from the Reichsmarks to the Hungarian penge.  After the war ended, Czech crowns issued by the Benes government in exile began to be used.  But they lasted only three years.  The new communist government issued its money in 1948. These were plain-looking banknotes depicting representatives of the proletariat and the working class.  Beautiful banknotes issued before the German occupation were forever gone.

Banknotes of 1919-1935 are especially valuable.  Talented artists <span>Alphonse Mucha</span> and Maximilian Shvabinsky worked on their appearance.  For banknotes of 1,000 and 5,000 kroons issued in those years, modern collectors are willing to pay thousands of dollars.

    <p>  The Czech currency is a very interesting topic, not only for bonists, but also for tourists.  The fact is that the gullible travelers in many exchange offices of this beautiful country have already learned to cheat.  As an example: 2000 Bulgarian lei are often slipped instead of two thousand crowns.  These banknotes are visually very similar, but the cost of leu is much lower.  Another trick of fraudsters is to hand over banknotes of 50 kroons, which have long been withdrawn from circulation.  Therefore, such money can no longer be paid.  If you decide to go to this country and you will change the currency in the same place, do not be too lazy to preliminarily see what the Czech crowns look like, so that you certainly will not mix them up with the same Bulgarian lei.  Also pay attention to what money you will bring with you.  The fact is that Czech banks or exchange offices are unlikely to exchange some unknown currency for you in kroons.  For example, if you drive with <span>Belarusian rubles</span> in your hands <span>,</span> it will be difficult to sell them to you.  It is possible that the same will await the one who will bring <span>Ukrainian hryvnia</span> with him <span>.</span>  But exchanging Russian rubles for crowns is not such a problem.  If you see that they are trying to trick you at the exchange office (and this often happens), politely let you know.  If there is no adequate reaction, call the police at 112 at once. Czech koruna refers to the euro as 1: 0.04.  In other words, one unit of national currency equals four cents.  The course of the Czech koruna to the ruble is kept at the level of 1: 1.7. </p>
