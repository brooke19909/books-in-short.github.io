    <p>  Description of resorts on the coast of the <span>South China Sea</span> will help determine the choice.  Beaches are located in almost all parts of this amazing country.  The resorts of northern Vietnam are represented by the cities of Trako, Thanh Hoa, Halong and Mongkai.  The central part is famous for places such as Danang, Phan Thiet, Hoi An, Langko, Mui Ne and Shamshon.  In the southern direction are Hatien, Fukuok and Fanrang.  A diverse country is Vietnam.  Description of resorts will be below. </p><p>  In order to properly plan your vacation, you should take into account the climatic features of Vietnam.  The unique natural conditions of the country make its resorts accessible to tourists almost all year round.  The fact is that in Vietnam, like in any other Asian country, there is a rainy season.  But, if heavy rain pours in one part of the country, then in the other, as a rule, the bright sun shines.  In northern Vietnam, it rains from May to October.  This part of the country is not suitable for winter holidays, as the change of weather here is especially noticeable.  In winter, the temperature does not rise above 15 degrees. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the central part of Vietnam, the rainy season lasts until December.  At this time, it is better to refrain from traveling in this direction, since the central part is most prone to typhoons. </p><p>  The most favorable for recreation is considered southern Vietnam.  Its resorts are the most popular and receive tourists almost all year round.  Despite the fact that the rains here also pour, they are of a short-term nature.  Popular resorts in Vietnam are located in the southern part of the country. </p><h2>  Russian-speaking Nha Trang </h2><p>  This is a small town in the south of the country.  It is considered the main resort, as it is especially popular with tourists.  Here are the best beaches, exciting entertainment, interesting sights and well-developed infrastructure.  Russian tourists especially like this resort.  Locals speak Russian well, and some cafes even have a menu in Russian.  On the streets you can often see Russian-language signs.  Almost all locals are busy serving tourists.  The sea in Nha Trang is clean, the beaches are regularly cleaned.  The surroundings of Nha Trang are famous for their islands and coral reefs.  Island beaches are strewn with pebbles or coarse sand.  This is a great place for those who like to explore the underwater depths, and for those who just like to wallow under an umbrella on the sea coast. </p><h2>  <span>Beach holidays</span> in Nha Trang </h2>

    <h2>  Historic Sites of Nha Trang </h2><p>  Fans of culture and relaxation can visit the Long Son Pagoda.  The temple was built at the end of the XIX century, but a strong storm completely destroyed it.  The remains of the pagoda were transported to a safe place and restored.  On the territory of the pagoda live monks.  This is a place of amazing beauty.  It is also notable for the fact that on the top of the mountain, which leads to 150 steps, there is a majestic statue of a sleeping Buddha.  Visiting the pagoda is free, but local scammers can scam money by selling tickets. </p>
