    <h2>  Terms of use of plastic cards </h2><p>  You can get a Vozrozhdenie credit card on conditions different from other financial institutions.  Let's consider them in more detail: </p><ul><li>  Calculation of the grace period is not quite a standard way, since its duration has a different duration.  The term for refunding money to the card always approaches the end of the 25th day of the month in which you made purchases by credit card.  That is, if the money was withdrawn on November 3, then they should be returned before November 25.  If you made a purchase on November 27, then the money should be credited to the card until December 25.  What other conditions for a Renaissance credit card are provided? </li><li>  The amount of the monthly payment is at least 5% of the amount owed, but not less than 100 rubles. </li><li>  The presence of a special mobile application allows you to track accrued interest and the general status of the account.  Interest must be paid monthly. </li><li>  Money can be deposited through the cashier at the bank‚Äôs office, through online payments, at the ATM, at the Svyaznoy cash desk. </li></ul><p>  Before you make a purchase or decide to cash out, you must carefully read the contract and clarify for yourself all the contentious issues.  Anything that is unclear can be clarified by phone at the employees of Vozrozhdenie Bank. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  What is the credit card rate? </h2><p>  Different credit cards have different tariffs: it all depends on how long you have been a client of the bank, whether you have a salary card and how good a credit history is.  Withdrawing cash through an ATM is possible, but you need to remember that the bank takes a percentage for this, which is 4% of the withdrawal amount, but no less than 200 rubles.  If you use the services of a third-party ATM, this amount will increase to 400 rubles.  Clients of Vozrozhdenie Bank, who have an excellent credit history, are offered the Loyal tariff, which implies favorable conditions and a minimum interest rate. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="credit card revival reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59172/2130512.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Design and required documents </h2><p>  In order for the Vozrozhdenie credit card to be successful, you must have: a Russian passport, a completed application form, photocopies of all pages of the passport, a military ID (for the stronger sex under the age of 27 years), copies of the work book with personnel service marks, information 2 -NDFL, income statement of the entrepreneur (if the client is an entrepreneur), the borrower's declaration of funds.  All documents submitted by the client, as well as photocopies of the originals will be checked by the bank employees for authenticity. </p><p>  In addition to the presentation of the indicated documents, the client must meet certain requirements.  Namely, to be at least 21 years old, have Russian citizenship, a good credit history and registration in the region where he is going to receive a credit card.  At the bank‚Äôs office, the client fills out the application form and makes a choice in favor of the option of a credit card that suits him the most.  After signing the contract and accepting all the documents, the bank specialist will tell you when the card will be issued. </p><p>  When issuing a credit card, a bank employee and a client should find out some questions: </p><ul><li>  the client needs to make a choice in favor of the payment system - ‚ÄúVisa‚Äù or ‚ÄúMasterCard‚Äù; </li><li>  the employee must determine the limit on the card in accordance with the documents submitted (from 150,000 to one million rubles); </li><li>  the operator must inform the client about the size of the interest rate (from 18% to 26%), with which the latter must agree. </li></ul><p>  The bank employees inform the client that the card is ready by SMS message and by e-mail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="revival credit card application" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59172/2130513.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Is it possible to get a Renaissance credit card online? </h2><p>  Making a credit card through the Internet can significantly save time that can be spent on going to the bank office.  So, if you want to draw up a card online, you need to go to the official website of Vozrozhdenie Bank. </p><p>  On the site you will be asked to fill out an express form in which you must provide some information: </p><ul><li>  whether you are a legal entity or an individual; </li><li>  personal data (name, date of birth, place of residence, contact details); </li><li>  Email address </li><li>  acceptable time for a call from a bank employee. </li></ul><p>  Then you need to click on the item "Issue a credit card."  After that, you indicate data that are directly related to the loan and its execution.  First of all, a tab is filled in to confirm income, it can be a 2-NDFL certificate or a document confirming income for an individual entrepreneur.  Then you need to specify the method of receiving wages, the desired amount of credit limit on the card and the repayment period.  All information specified in the documents is checked by the bank employees, therefore, when filling out the questionnaire, the most truthful data should be indicated.  The bank may refuse to receive a credit card if during the check there are discrepancies between the data that you provided and those that are in reality. </p><h2>  How is card debt repaid? </h2><p>  In order to repay the loan amount in the right amount, you need to know the exact repayment amount.  Such information can be obtained in the "My Account", in the support service or by using an SMS request.  However, the bank informs its customers about the amount of debt automatically.  The message usually contains two amounts: one is the payment amount for the interest-free period, and the other is the minimum monthly payment. </p><p>  Money can be deposited through ATMs or cash registers, through ATMs of other banks, using an online payment service.  To make the process of depositing money through an electronic application as simple as possible, the bank‚Äôs customers can save a payment template, which is saved once and then used as needed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to activate a credit card bank revival" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59172/2130514.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  If you can‚Äôt remember the PIN </h2><p>  Restoring a PIN code requires some action.  You should call the bank service on the phone printed on the back of the card and report the problem.  In the process of talking with the operator, you will need passport and credit card information.  After a while, you can pick up a reissued card with a different PIN code.  It cannot be restored, since it is not known to any employee of the bank, it is not stored anywhere, the client receives it in a closed envelope. </p><h2>  Vozrozhdenie credit card reviews </h2><p>  According to customer reviews, the following conclusions can be drawn: a flexible line of interest rates for customers with experience or holders of debit cards is noted as the main plus of these cards.  In addition, customers are satisfied with the presence of a variety of bonus programs, a low interest rate in the first months for privileged cards, a simple registration procedure and relatively inexpensive annual service.  From the negative impressions, it should be noted that the bank is not very loyal to new customers, which predetermines very low limits for them.  In addition, usually cardholders are unhappy that the period of validity of low interest ends very quickly.  In most cases, according to users of credit multiples, subject to the conditions of the bank, and also if there is no need for very large amounts, these credit cards are the best option for customers. </p><p>  Is it worth it to open a Renaissance credit card, you decide. </p>
