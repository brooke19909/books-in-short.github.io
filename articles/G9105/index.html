    <p>  European tourists call the island "too American", here they pay more respect to the dollar than the euro.  Some complain that almost all products are imported.  On a small piece of land between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, there is not enough fresh water and fertile soil for agriculture. </p><p>  The uniformity of flora and fauna is also associated with a lack of moisture.  The area of ​​protected natural areas is gradually increasing.  On the French side, it is the national reserve of St. Martin, which includes 154 hectares of coast, mangrove forests, salt ponds and 2796 hectares of marine habitat. </p><p>  Ecotourism is becoming one of the development areas of the island of Saint-Martin.  Its main assets - the turquoise sea, blue sky and the abundance of the sun - cause sincere admiration for people who visited this corner of the tropical paradise between the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. </p>
