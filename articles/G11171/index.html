    <h2>  Qatar: general information </h2><p>  Qatar is located on the Arabian Peninsula (southwest) and is washed by the pristine waters of the Persian Gulf on 3 sides.  With the UAE and Saudi Arabia, it borders on the south.  The area is 11 thousand km¬≤, the population is about 2,258 thousand people, while the Arabs mostly inhabit the country. </p><p>  The official language is Arabic, the religion is Islam.  The head of state is the emir. </p><p>  Today's Qatar is Dubai five years ago.  The resort is developing quite dynamically, but its popularity is not very high, so the prices here are an order of magnitude lower, however, like the service.  The main feature of the resort is its absolute safety (even at night you can walk absolutely calmly here). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

Excellent quality of service, modern comfortable hotels, fabulous surrounding nature (especially from March to May and from September to January) - this is Qatar. </p><p>  Of course, next to the most popular and popular neighbors (Abu Dhabi and Dubai), Doha, the capital of Qatar, looks more modest.  Here you will not see huge crowds of tourists enthusiastically looking at local attractions (and there are fantastic skyscrapers here), you will not find numerous shopaholics scurrying along the malls and buying everything up. </p><p>  Doha is not so popular yet, and the rates for local hotel rooms are lower, but the locals have a great desire to make the rest for guests the most comfortable and unforgettable. </p><p>  Each tourist who chooses for himself a holiday in Qatar (reviews of tourists are presented below) receives an excellent quality of service, while not overpaying for the name of any resort, as for a well-known fashion brand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vacations in Qatar reviews of tourists and the sea" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10393/2008629.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  About nature </h2><p>  In hotels with a beautifully landscaped oasis and excellent service, you spend your holidays in Qatar.  Reviews of tourists most often talk about living conditions.  However, the landscapes of Qatar are not particularly attractive and bright.  The relief of the northern part of the country is represented by a low sandy plain, covered with moving dunes.  The central part of the territory is a rocky desert covered with pebble, and in some places with salt marshes.  The southern part of the state is sandy high hills. </p><p>  The peninsula is very poor in water, there are oases, but they are small and rare.  With all this, the nature of Qatar is unique. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Rest in Qatar begins with arrival.  All travelers note excellent service aboard Qatar Airways liners.  Hotels are quiet, calm, comfortable with clean sandy beaches and clear water.  Many pools on the beaches are interconnected and equipped with water slides. </p><p>  Vacationers especially note the good service, as well as the good nature and friendly attitude of local residents to tourists.  Magnificent and high-quality shopping without much fuss and crush.  Really everyone is surprised by the quiet night walks in the vicinity - no harassment with the service and unpleasant adventures. </p><p>  Good Persian Gulf in Qatar and for diving enthusiasts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vacations in Qatar" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2002179.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  About the weather </h2><p>  The climate of Qatar is tropical, continental.  Often in summer the temperature rises to 50 ¬∞ C, the coolest season is the period from December to February.  November is the beginning of the rainy season, which ends in May.  The best time for relaxing on the beaches is either April-May or the <span>autumn months.</span> </p><p>  It is considered a good vacation in Qatar in November.  Reviews of tourists about this time of the year are also the most positive, because even this month the readings of thermometers in the daytime are kept at around 25 ¬∞ .  The only minor minus is that same rainy season begins during this period. </p><p>  In the first days of April, air in Qatar warms up to 27 ¬∞ , and water during the bathing season also warms up to 27 ¬∞ . </p><h2>  A little bit about the rules of conduct </h2><p>  In any area in terms of thefts and attacks, rest in Qatar is safe.  Reviews of tourists and advice regarding the rules of conduct in this country should be taken into account and bear in mind. </p><p>  It should be remembered that the traditions of the country's population are based on the Muslim religion, so some rules must be observed.  For example, you can‚Äôt take pictures of local residents and some objects without permission.  And also women should not come to rest for a walk alone in open clothes. </p>
