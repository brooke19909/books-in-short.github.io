    <p>  Scientists have proven that ninety percent of them are astronomical or meteorological phenomena, as well as visual illusions, classified types of flying equipment or ordinary fakes from interested parties.  However, the remaining 10% of such observations is simply impossible to explain. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Scientists believe that people have observed alien ships since ancient times.  This is confirmed by numerous myths, legends and stories that describe amazing objects flying through the sky, as well as creatures that emerged from them.  Based on these stories, unfortunately, it is impossible to single out the facts that occurred in reality.  That is why ufologists focus their attention only on the study of reports that strange objects were seen above the Earth, starting only from the end of the nineteenth century.  So, in 1890, the inhabitants of the northern regions of the United States observed alien ships.  The American inhabitants describe them in the form of airship-like devices shining with bright spotlights. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  These strange flying objects flew over settlements and farms.  Some of those who watched their movement claimed to have seen even the pilots in them.  There is no consensus on the veracity of these stories.  Many scholars believe that such messages are nothing more than fictitious hoaxes.  However, there are also ufologists who consider these observations reliable. </p><p>  Alien ships were seen by pilots during the Second World War.  Often near their planes strange balls flew, emitting bright light.  These unidentified objects are called "fu-fayers".  This term was taken from the comic book magazine, popular at that time.  At first, the pilots assumed that the luminous balls are reconnaissance vehicles or the secret weapons of Nazi Germany.  However, only after the war ended it was discovered that German pilots also saw bright lights, considering them British or American latest device. </p><p>  A large number of alien ships were observed in the summer and autumn days of 1946 over Norway and Sweden.  People dubbed them “ghost missiles” and considered these objects the secret weapons of the Russians, which was created using German military programs.  The Swedish Ministry of Defense has clarified that eighty percent of such cases are nothing more than natural phenomena.  However, 20% of what they saw was never received. </p>

However, until now, many ufologists continue to question the reliability of the messages described above.  Most researchers believe that the modern era in the study of UFOs began on 06.24.1947.  It was on this day that businessman and pilot Arnold Cannet, flying over the state of Washington in the Cascade Mountains region, saw 9 strange crescent-shaped objects.

Arnold transmitted his message on the radio and, landing at the airport, he met reporters already rushing for a sensation.  Answering their questions, he described the trajectory of the UFO, saying that it looks like a flight of a plate thrown parallel to the surface of the water.  Since then, UFOs have received the name "flying saucer." </p><h2>  Types of Alien Spaceships </h2><p>  Ufologists comprehensively study the nature of behavior and the size of UFOs.  Similar studies have identified four main types of alien ships.  The first of them includes the smallest objects.  These are disks or balls with a diameter of 20 to 100 cm. Such UFOs fly at low altitudes.  Sometimes they separate from large objects, and then return to them. </p><p>  The second type of alien spaceships include small UFOs that have an egg- and disk-shaped shape.  The diameter of such flying objects is from 2 to 3 meters.  These alien ships are often noticed at low altitude.  They most often make landings and are carriers of small objects that either separate from them or return to them again. </p><p>  The third type of alien spacecraft is considered the main one.  These UFOs are disks whose diameter is from 9 to 40 meters.  The height of such a figure in the central part is 1 / 5-1 / 10 of its diameter.  These alien ships fly independently in all layers of the atmosphere, only occasionally landing on Earth.  Smaller objects are also sometimes separated from them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

As a rule, they are in the form of cylinders or cigars and are in length from 100 to 800, and sometimes even more than meters.  They are observed in the upper atmosphere, flying along a simple trajectory, sometimes just hanging in the air.  That alien spaceships of this type are landing on Earth, evidence has not yet been received.  The one who watched the “cigars” only claims that small objects are separated from these UFOs.  It is believed that large ships are able to fly in space.  This type also includes giant discs observed in some cases, the diameter of which is from 100 to 200 m.

    <h2>  The main forms of UFOs </h2><p>  Alien ships appear before the eyes of earthlings in the form: </p><p>  - disks having one or two convex sides; </p><p>  - balls surrounded by rings or without them; </p><p>  - elongated and oblate spheres; </p><p>  - objects of a triangular and rectangular shape. </p><p>  A French team of specialists studying aerospace phenomena has released data according to which round UFOs are most often found in the form of balls, disks or spheres.  And only twenty percent of alien ships look like cylinders and cigars. </p><h2>  UFO species </h2><p>  Unusual flying objects are observed on all continents of the planet Earth.  An alien ship can be described by eyewitnesses: </p><p>  - round, namely in the form of an inverted bowl or plate; </p><p>  - disk-shaped, with or without domes; </p><p>  - hat-like, similar to a bell or to Saturn; </p><p>  - pear-shaped, egg-shaped, resembling a barrel, pear or spinning top; </p><p>  - oblong, like a cigar, cylinder, spindle, torpedo or rocket; </p><p>  - peaked, resembling a pyramid, a regular or truncated cone, funnel, flat triangle or rhombus; </p><p>  - rectangular, similar to a bar, parallelepiped or square; </p><p>  - very unusual, resembling a mushroom, a wheel with or without spokes, a cross, a letter. </p><h2>  UFO Flights </h2><p>  Eyewitnesses point out that all <span>types of alien</span> ships are capable of moving in space with great speed.  In this mode, they are rebuilt instantly from a state of stationary hovering.  In addition, UFOs are astonished by their ability to make sharp maneuvers and instantly reverse the original direction.  There are many examples confirming that UFOs can fly not only in the atmosphere, but also in space.  At the same time, their movement is silent and does not disturb the environment. </p>

It seems that these objects are not obstructed by air resistance, since their body can be rotated by either side relative to the trajectory of movement.

    <p>  But the most unusual property of all types of UFOs lies in their ability to become invisible, disappearing from the observer's field of vision.  This confirms a number of recorded cases. </p><h2>  Unusual lighting </h2><p>  There are many photos of alien ships, from which one or more light rays depart.  They resemble the lights of searchlights aimed at the ground.  Some people who have observed such UFOs claim that such rays can travel back and forth, up and down.  Sometimes these space spotlights periodically “turn on” and “turn off”. </p><p>  However, there have been cases when the rays emitted by an alien spaceship showed unusual properties.  They did not disperse in space, retained the same brightness along the entire length, and ended with luminous balls.  Sometimes the light emanating from a UFO moved slowly, and then instantly pulled into an unidentified object.  Another amazing feature of such rays lies in their ability to bend, outlining in the air any angle, right down to a straight line.  Similar cases were observed both abroad and in our country. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Photos of alien ships taken by eyewitnesses indicate that most often these objects have a metallic, silver-aluminum or light pearl color.  Sometimes a cloud envelops them, visually blurring the contours of the object. <br>  UFOs, as a rule, have a shiny, like polished surface, on which there are no rivets or seams.  According to eyewitnesses, the upper side of such a ship is lighter, and the lower is dark.  Transparent domes rise above some UFOs. </p><p>  The middle part of an object often has one or even two rows of round portholes or rectangular windows.  Some UFOs emit rods similar to periscopes or antennas.  In some cases, these parts rotate or move. </p>

    <p>  Nobody managed to visit the alien ship.  There is some evidence of people claiming that they were abducted by representatives of extraterrestrial civilizations, but the authenticity of these stories is clearly questioned by ufologists. </p><h2>  Unusual find </h2><p>  An unknown object was discovered at the bottom of the Gulf of Bothnia, on the section between Sweden and Finland.  Ufologists around the world believe that an alien ship was found in this area. </p><p>  A huge object that has a circular shape was discovered by Swedish researchers of the deep sea in 2011. Scientists were searching for the wreckage of ancient shipwrecks.  At a depth of 92 meters, instead of old boxes, they discovered a rounded object of strange origin.  Its diameter is a little over 18 m. </p><p>  Researchers are confident that an alien ship that has suffered a disaster was discovered in this area.  This is indicated by a crumpled and pitted bottom around the subject.  It seems that the flying saucer, having fallen into the depths of the sea, was still trying to move. </p><p>  Many experts are sure that UFOs create many problems for ships passing in this area.  It turns off the equipment on them, and the devices simply stop working. <br>  However, this version also has its opponents.  They believe that in the waters of the Baltic Sea there is not an alien ship at all, but ordinary rocks, which over the years have taken the form of a flying saucer.  However, it has not yet been possible to confirm or refute the existing assumptions.  All attempts to go down to a strange object and explore it fail. </p><h2>  UFO in outer space </h2><p>  Mysterious photographs of unidentified objects were brought to Earth in 1972 by American astronauts participating in the Apollo 16 expedition.  On the frames clearly visible <span>luminous ball of</span> unknown origin.  After several decades, when viewing photographs of the surface of the moon, white balls were also seen on them.  There were many different versions and conjectures about this.  But the most plausible one was the explanation that these objects are nothing but alien ships. </p>

Photos with his image were published by NASA in free print.  Ufologists believe that this object, flying above the Red Planet at a low altitude, was clearly controlled by a rational creature.  It is assumed that an alien ship is captured on the frame.  It is quite possible that he was carrying out some task on Mars.

Indeed, it sometimes happens that an alien ship turns out to be either a natural phenomenon or an outright fake.  But genuine photographs are rarely of high quality and understandable, since a UFO appears always unexpectedly.  It also complicates the work of researchers.

    <p>  Ufologists have several criteria according to which the authenticity of frames with UFOs is determined.  The most basic of them is the reliability of the photographer.  In addition, to confirm his pictures, an eyewitness must provide the ufologists with genuine negatives or the camera itself.  It is also desirable that the UFO images were taken from various points. </p>
