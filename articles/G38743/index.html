    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  To start a conversation about this place is from its location.  This is really important, since few people want to stay in such a hotel, which is located on the outskirts of the city.  Seher Sun Palace <span>Resort Spa Hotel</span> 5 * is located on the first coastline, next to the sandy beach, three minutes leisurely step is enough to get to the water.  In addition, it should be noted that not far from the hotel complex is the center of Side.  Ten kilometers separates it from Manavgat, which is also a very visited place.  Antalya Airport is also located in comparative proximity.  Staying on vacation in this hotel, you can not go to Antalya - a little more than an hour will be required to get to this large and modern city. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Beach services and entertainment </h2><p>  Many people go to resorts such as Crimea, Greece, Turkey, Egypt, etc., in order to swim in the sea.  Therefore, choosing a hotel, they focus on those who are not far from the sea.  This is another reason why many people choose the Seher Sun <span>Palace Resort Spa Hotel</span> 5 *.  It was said that the hotel is near the beach.  It should be noted that it belongs to the hotel complex itself.  And, accordingly, everything necessary for a complete sea vacation - umbrellas, mattresses, deck chairs, tents and, of course, beach towels - all this is offered.  It is also worth noting the presence of a convenient entry into the sea - this is very important, especially for people with disabilities and for guests with children.  You will not have to miss the hotel either.  Here there are entertainment for every taste - water skiing, billiards, canoeing, jacuzzi, SPA-center, hairdresser, massage, catamarans, surfing.  And this is only a minimal list, other sports (volleyball, basketball, tennis, water aerobics, fitness, etc.), a Turkish bath, a steam room and much more are also offered. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews and comments </h2><p>  We must not forget about one more nuance, speaking about the Seher Sun Palace Resort Spa Hotel 5 * (Side).  Reviews - they are an extremely important aspect, since the comments of other guests who have already stayed at this place provide a more complete picture of what concerns the level of the hotel complex.  It is worth noting that guests of the hotel respond in a positive manner.  The first thing to note is a varied diet.  Three restaurants, two a-la carte, several bars, a pastry shop - all this leaves a good impression, especially for sophisticated gourmets.  People who came with children to the Seher Sun Palace Resort Spa Hotel 5 * also leave positive reviews, assuring that this place has everything for kids - two children's pools, a playground, a mini club, a separate menu in the restaurant and even stroller rental.  In general, guests claim that this is a full five-star Turkish hotel.  High-class unobtrusive service, comfortable rooms, a pleasant contingent of vacationers.  Everything you need for a relaxing holiday.  Ideal for people who are tired of the gray routine of everyday life and want to change the atmosphere and feel the taste of real life.  For lovers of more active recreation, night clubs and other institutions of a similar nature are located nearby.  In general, everything is for everyone.  Perhaps that is why the hotel, despite its relative youth (the hotel opened in 2011), managed to gain popularity among many tourists and even regular customers. </p>
