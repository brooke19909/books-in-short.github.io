    <p>  Of course, the important point when choosing a hotel becomes the location of its location.  Kapetanios Hotel Limassol has an advantage in this regard, as it is located in one of the most prestigious areas of the city of Limassol.  The luxurious beach is just 100 meters away.  Near the hotel there is a zoo, the historical center of the city, the archaeological museum and other attractions of the resort town, which will be of interest to both adults and children.  On the other hand, the place is quite calm - tourists can count on a serene pastime. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Kapetanios Limassol Hotel (Cyprus): general description </h2><p>  This is a small hotel, which consists of one multi-storey building.  The last thorough repair was carried out here in 2002, but the hotel looks beautiful, and one can hope for the benefits of modern civilization. </p><p>  A small but cozy area adjoins the building.  Part of it is reserved for pools and terraces.  Here you can stroll along neat paths and mowed lawns, admire the vibrant colors and exotic trees. </p><h2>  How many rooms are there in a hotel? </h2><p>  Hotel Kapetanios Limassol Hotel 3 * is small - on its territory there are 75 rooms.  For the most part, these are spacious standard rooms with city or sea views.  However, there are several large family apartments, which consist of a bedroom, a living area and a small but fully equipped kitchen, which is convenient, because sometimes children need to cook separately.  By the way, the large room is designed for shared accommodation of two adults and two children. </p><h2>  Photo and a brief description of the amenities in the rooms </h2>
