Today we will talk about a man with a capital letter, who did not live at the best time, but who managed to bring his ideas through time and reach out to descendants.  In order to get to know this person better, we will first examine the biography of a Tatar boy who grew up in a mullah family. </p><h2>  First meeting </h2><p>  Galimjan Ibragimov is a famous Tatar writer who is considered the initiator of Tatar literature of the Soviet period.  He is a <span>hero of labor.</span>  For political reasons, he was repressed, but in 1955 he was rehabilitated.  He stood at the origins of Tatar literary affairs, and besides, he was an outstanding person who acted and was not afraid to speak when he was silent.  Everyone should know about such people who are building their era.  Galimjan Ibragimov is a man from that breed who cannot tolerate injustice and courageously throws himself into battle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Galimjan Ibrahimov" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42901/1562962.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Galimjan Ibragimov: biography </h2><p>  The boy was born on March 13, 1887 in the village of Sultanmuratovo, Ufa province.  Today this territory is the Aurgazinsky district of the Republic of Bashkortostan.  The boy was born into a mullah family.  As you know, this is a minister of the Muslim cult.  The Russian empire called the mullahs not only experts on Muslim traditions, but also educated people and teachers.  If you look at the facts, you can understand that in Russia the mullah was equated with a priest, and for good reason.  Each of them belonged to a particular mosque, while their activities were clearly regulated by decrees of officials.  At the same time, the clergy of the lower rank were called mullahs in the Caucasus. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tatar writers" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42901/1562963.jpg" width="580"></div>

At the same time, history nevertheless retained the main merits of the Tatar writer, for which he should be respected and appreciated. </p><h2>  Study </h2><p>  Galimjan Ibragimov, whose biography is very short, received a home education.  This was due to the fact that his father was a mullah - an educated man of his time.  He received his primary education at the rural Husainiya madrasah in Orenburg.  He also did not study at the Russian school in 1899 for long.  In 1906-1908 he studied at the Galia Madrasah.  It was in 1906 that the writer was first arrested, but soon the young man was released. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="madrasah galia" class="if" height="373" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42901/1562961.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Professional activity </h2><p>  Galimjan Ibragimov proved himself in various fields.  He was a writer, editor and publisher.  As a writer, he made his debut thanks to his story ‚ÄúExile from Zaki Shakird Madrasah‚Äù, which was written in 1907.  This was the second year of schooling.  It is surprising that already so early a boy from the Galia madrasah wrote a full-fledged interesting story.  After 3 years, he released his first storybook, entitled "The Beginning of Spring."  His literary work had a great influence on the artistic prose of the Turkic-speaking peoples.  Tatar writers for the most part had little influence on the literary work in general, but individuals, like the one to which this article is devoted, were able to leave a significant mark in history. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tatar story" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42901/1562960.jpg" width="379"></div>

In addition, he often edited finished works.  We will not list his numerous works, since they are all in the Tatar language.  He also, together with his friend Fatykh Sayfi-Kazanli, was involved in the publication of the Volia newspaper. </p><h2>  Books on linguistics </h2><p>  Tatar writers were versatile and multifaceted people, because life taught them to be masters in several matters at once.  Our hero was the author of books on philology and linguistics.  His works were very popular, as their professional wrote.  Moreover, his writing style was simple, which was a prerequisite in order to perceive the language normally.  Not all philologists could boast the ability to explain and correctly present the material.  In total, Galimjan Girfanovich Ibragimov wrote three books on this topic: "Tatar Grammar", "Theory of Literature" and "Methodology of Teaching the Native Language".  Books were written in 1911, 1916 and 1918. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tatar lessons" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33726/1563030.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Teaching </h2><p>  Since 1913, the writer began to combine his literary activity with teaching.  This was caused by a simple everyday necessity to have some money for existence.  He began his teaching career in his first and native school.  He taught Tatar language lessons that were given to him superbly.  He was a master of the word.  Galimjan Ibragimov not only knew his language well, but also was able to brilliantly present material for children who were just starting to learn the basics. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The teaching staff and senior management could not help but notice the talent of Ibragimov.  Already in 1925, he began to head the Academic Center of the People's Commissariat of the Republic.  However, he did not stay in this position for long - only two years.  In 1927, it was removed due to political views that contradicted Soviet ideology.  The official reason was: "For vigorous nationalist activity."  In the interval between these years, in 1926, the writer became the leader of the TatATSSR delegation at the First All-Union Turkological Congress, which took place in Baku.  Professionals gathered about the Latinization of the writing of the Turkic peoples.  At this meeting, Galimjan Ibragimov voted against the Latinization. </p><h2>  Revolutionary activity </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, the hero of our article took an active life position and never was silent when a certain injustice occurred.  In 1912, Ibragimov moved to Kiev.  Soon after his arrival, a secret Muslim organization is formed in the city, which acts against the interests of the government.  After some time, it turns out that her leader was Galimjan.  The next year, he was arrested by the police, but was soon released due to insufficient direct evidence.  Despite the fact that the young man was released, for a long time he was under vigilant supervision. </p><p>  The situation in the country was tense for periods.  It is clear that it was impossible to fully express their indignation in the actions, since this was tantamount to drawing up their own sentence.  Because of this, the views and thoughts of the writer are fully reflected in his literary work. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Galimjan Ibrahimov biography" class="if" height="470" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42901/1562958.jpg" width="565"></div>

    <p>  The novel ‚ÄúOur Days‚Äù, in which Galimjan from his point of view outlined all the events of the 1905 revolution, was the first demonstration work.  Also in his work, much attention was paid to such a topic as the friendship of Tatar and Russian ordinary workers.  He wrote two novels in which he created an almost perfect image of a fighter for the right Soviet power: ‚ÄúThe Legend of Red Flowers‚Äù ‚Äã‚Äãand ‚ÄúDeep Roots‚Äù.  The first was written in 1920, and the second in 1928. </p><p>  His activities were noticed by political activists who received more and more power, and in 1917 the writer was invited to the All-Russian Constituent Assembly. </p><h2>  Creation </h2><p>  All the work of Ibragimov can be divided into several milestones: textbooks, novels, novels and plays.  A Tatar story from this writer is a kind of door to a completely different world where the power of words and the greatness of voice rule.  In order to understand how this original and talented man wrote, you should read at least one of his works - then everything will immediately become clear.  His books are understandable to children and adults.  Moreover, they are equally interesting to all age categories.  Translations into Russian of his works were made much later than the works themselves.  The difference is literally 20-30 years.  This is due to the fact that while writing Ibragimov‚Äôs books were forbidden to read, and the police did everything to completely forget such a name. </p><p>  The author‚Äôs first major work was the novel ‚ÄúYoung Hearts,‚Äù which was written in 1912, and translated into Russian only in 1980.  In this work, the author presented a full panorama of the life of Tatar people of various ranks at the beginning of the 20th century. </p><h2>  After the revolution </h2><p>  After the revolution, Galimjan continued his activities further.  He also taught Tatar language lessons and taught children the correct pronunciation.  From 1920 to 1924 he was an employee of the publishing department and a teacher at the Communist University in Kazan.  As you can see, Galimjan Ibragimov, whose biography is not very full of facts, still never sat still.  His life was constantly moving, he often changed jobs.  In addition, he was always in full view of the authorities, since his activities were often contrary to party politics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="expulsion from madrassah zaki shakirda" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42901/1562957.jpg" width="364"></div>

    <p>  In 1925, he became chairman of the Academic Center at the People's Commissariat of Education.  Until 1937, he was deputy chairman of the Muslim Commissariat. </p><h2>  Arrest </h2><p>  A calm life and work did not last long.  In August 1937, Ibragimov was arrested.  This happened in the beautiful city of Yalta.  Everything happened quickly: at first he was handed over to the city police department, and then delivered to Kazan.  Here he was locked up in a prison hospital, as they say, without trial.  Unfortunately, this is not just a speech revolution, but a reality.  No one conducted the trial, and there was no sentence.  Just at one fine moment all the books of the writer were deleted from the libraries, and his name was forbidden to remember.  That's how simple it was: once - and there is no longer such a person. </p><p>  It is probably difficult to speak, but soon the writer died.  January 21, 1938 he was gone.  Whether this was a consequence of torture and bullying or a natural death is difficult to say, since all the information is classified, and even the closest people of Ibragimov do not know how things really were.  This story ended very sadly, although a person lived a decent life.  There are many different opinions about why Ibragimov died so early and so quickly.  To find out the exact cause of the death of a great man is unlikely to ever succeed.  Only after his death was the writer rehabilitated, in principle, like many other people whose name was erased from the pages of history. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  Galimjan Ibragimov, whose biography ended very tragically, is still immortalized in culture.  In Kazan, a posthumous monument to the writer was installed, which is located in the Arskoye cemetery.  The Kazan Institute and the avenue in the city are also named after Ibragimov.  In 1987, a museum named after him was opened in the activist‚Äôs native village.  In Kazan, a bust of the writer was established and there is a functioning gymnasium of his name.  In honor of this man, a street in Ufa is also named, and there you can see a memorial plaque.  Tatar artist Hanif Khabibrahmanov made a bas-relief of Galimjan. </p><p>  Summing up the article, it should be said that we do not always know about the best people who are worthy to take an example from them.  Often such personalities are ‚Äúburied‚Äù in history due to the fact that their speeches cut the ears of the rulers.  It is a pity that in the past it was so easy to cross out a person and throw him over the side of life.  Many prominent personalities who were even rehabilitated posthumously, nevertheless, did not take in the consciousness of society the role that was destined for them by fate.  A modern democratic society should not allow such disgrace. </p>
