  <section class="page js-page"><h1>LCD "English Mile": reviews, description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  St. Petersburg is the Northern capital, a city with a unique history, architecture, not like any other city in the country.  This is a metropolis that attracts people from the most remote parts of Russia, which is why there is nothing strange or surprising in that its residents need modern, comfortable housing.  Currently, the real estate market of St. Petersburg is on the rise, there are new residential complexes and housing estates with their own infrastructure. </p><p>  One such project is the English Mile LCD.  Reviews about the project are numerous, quite positive, and all this is largely due to the undeniable advantages of the project, its features.  Within the framework of this material, we will evaluate the complex, all its main components, features, and also get acquainted with the opinions of those who have personally visited the object and purchased a dream apartment there. </p><h2>  about the project </h2><p>  LCD "English Mile" - an island of calm in the middle of a noisy and crowded metropolis.  That is how many experts in the real estate world describe it.  A fenced and guarded area equipped with a video surveillance system allows you to organize a separate space with its own unique atmosphere and ensure high security for every resident of new buildings.  The concept of dividing the territory into sectors allows everyone to find here a paradise for themselves in order to live, relax and play sports. </p><p>  The construction of residential buildings is carried out according to a monolithic technology with a pile foundation, which guarantees impeccable quality and reliability for each building.  And this is not all that a developer can please and surprise their customers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="spb.avaho.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="english mile prices" class="if uuid-3209710" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3209710.jpg"></div><p>  On an area of ‚Äã‚Äã220,000 square meters, it is planned to build eight-and ten-story comfort class residential buildings, as well as two kindergartens, a school and a shopping center in several stages. </p><h2>  Developer </h2><p>  The builder of the English Mile is Glorax Development, a well-known construction company in St. Petersburg.  On her account dozens of unique author's projects, each of which occupies an impressive area.  The developer knows everything about what modern housing should be for residents of a metropolis. </p><p>  The use of advanced technologies, copyright architecture, attention to details and preferences of modern buyers are the principles that the company adheres to and which allow it to occupy a leading position in the real estate market of St. Petersburg. </p><h2>  Architecture </h2><p>  All those who have long dreamed of settling with their family in a real British garden got this opportunity.  Glorax Development Company fully decided to realize the dreams of citizens and proposed a project where real ladies and gentlemen will live - an area with unique author's architecture in the spirit of old London. </p><div class="photo" data-original="english-mile.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="english mile spb" class="if uuid-3209709" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3209709.jpg"></div><p>  Laconicism using clear lines, fairly calm color combinations is what is characteristic of the project.  Vivid elements, color accents reminding us of London will be stylized playgrounds, English shops, gardens, yards, laden with greenery, as well as chic paths with massive lanterns.  Some time ago, no one could have imagined that such a beautiful and spectacular real estate would appear in the city.  The English Mile is a unique project for St. Petersburg. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  All buildings are built using monolithic technology, and the facades are lined with red-brown ceramic bricks, adding sophistication and gloss.  In order to give the complex dynamics, it was decided to finish the upper floors with light sand tinted stucco, and decorate the facades with spectacular bay windows and high window openings. </p><h2>  Technology </h2><p>  All those who are watching the construction of the English Mile are probably familiar with the advanced technologies underlying the concept.  It would be strange and surprising if the project did not differ from those of its closest competitors and was not as high-tech and modern as the English quarter should be. </p><p>  So, the monolithic technology with brick cladding was not chosen by chance at all - it became an ideal option for the harsh and unpredictable climate of the Northern capital.  The wall thickness is 45 cm - it is represented by the 20 cm wall itself, a 13 cm layer of mineral wool, a ventilated gap and a facing layer.  From extraneous sounds and noise from the busy streets of the city, buildings are protected not only by rather thick walls, but also by high-quality double-glazed windows with maximum energy efficiency.  All entrances are equipped with high-speed elevators, the operation of which is accompanied by a minimum level of noise. </p><div class="photo" data-original="2017-spb.urbanawards.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="british mile construction progress" class="if uuid-3209711" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3209711.jpg"></div><p>  In all apartments, horizontal heating was installed, which will save residents from pipes and will make it possible to realize even the most original design idea.  Vertical risers are hidden in special mines located on the stairwell, they are freely accessible.  The process of hot water formation takes place right in the house, water heaters are installed in the basement of the buildings, providing each inhabitant with water of a comfortable temperature.  All apartments have water meters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Krasnoselsky district of St. Petersburg was not accidentally chosen for the construction of the English Mile residential complex.  Reviews of residents of the city and the district as a whole confirm that today it is the best and most comfortable place to live.  Construction is underway along the Petergofskoye Shosse, from the east the facility is adjacent to the Sosnovka River and a network of picturesque lakes, just north of the complex is the Gulf of Finland - a favorite place for residents of St. Petersburg, a place for peace of mind and peace.  Just a few kilometers in the direction of the Petergofskoye Highway there are gorgeous park-architectural ensembles, squares with rare plant species.  And finally, to the business card of the city, Peterhof, only 25 minutes away by personal or public transport. </p><div class="photo" data-original="prn.spb.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd english mile" class="if uuid-3209708" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3209708.jpg"></div><p>  Largely thanks to the location, the project was awarded so many positive reviews.  Modern residents of the metropolis, suffering from bustle and endless noise, really dream of living in a quiet, calm and comfortable place, a kind of oasis in the middle of a crowded city.  And the personification of all these dreams was the English Mile project. </p><p>  The reviews of the first people who managed to visit the facility accentuate a lot of attention on the atmosphere, you literally forget about what is located outside the complex: it is so calm and easy here. And all this without loss in comfort.  So where exactly is the complex?  Address "English Mile": St. Petersburg, Peterhof highway, 123. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="59.84569080000001" data-lng="30.115062999999964" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/1/5/5/17155.png"></div><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  The residential complex "English Mile" (St. Petersburg) is perfectly located, and from any point of view.  First of all, it is surrounded by the most popular and greenest parks of the city, as well as the Gulf of Finland and the most valuable cultural and historical sights of the city. </p><p>  If you look at the location of residential buildings relative to the motorways, the possibility of leaving the Peterhof Highway on the Krasnoselskaya or Tallinn Highway, from where all roads and roads literally open to residents, will become obvious.  If future newcomers to the family do not have a personal car, they will be able to use the subway or any other type of public transport (the nearest stop is only a few minutes away).  Routes are enough to get to any point of the city without the slightest difficulty. </p><h2>  Apartments, layouts </h2><p>  Apartments in the English Mile are represented by a variety of areas and planning decisions.  The developer really tried to take into account the wishes and taste preferences of modern citizens as much as possible, giving them the opportunity to live in spacious and comfortable apartments, where you really want to return after a hard working day.  Here you can buy a standard studio, a one-, two- or three-room apartment, or take a look at the unique Euro 2 option for St. Petersburg, which implies the combined space of the kitchen and living room.  Such a variety facilitates the choice, allowing you to choose the best option in all respects. </p><div class="photo" data-original="spb.avaho.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="english mile address" class="if uuid-3209719" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3209719.jpg"></div><p>  The principle of an increased level of comfort is inherent in each layout of the English Mile, which is why even in one-room apartments there is a separate bathroom, rooms with bay windows and open terraces have appeared.  In some apartments, pantries and walk-in closets are allocated, which will be an excellent replacement for cramped and uncomfortable closets cluttering up the space. </p><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe apartments varies from 22 to 94 square meters, the price of the apartment also depends on the layout, the level of illumination, due to which it will be possible to find the optimal ratio of price and quality. </p><h2>  Finish </h2><p>  All apartments are rented without finishing, but if desired, the developer will undertake the preparation and implementation of the design project of any complexity.  He has sufficient experience and qualified personnel, which allows us to perform all work at the highest level. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The nearest infrastructure is presented within a kilometer from the English Mile residential complex.  It is represented by many preschool institutions, schools, clinics and medical centers, as well as commercial facilities.  Recall that the complex includes the construction of two kindergartens for 95 children and a comprehensive school for 550 children with in-depth study of the English language, but until they are built, residents will be able to use the developed infrastructure of the district. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="english mile builder" class="if uuid-3209721" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3209721.jpg"></div><h2>  Parking </h2><p>  First of all, parking will be organized for 74 cars, including for small vehicles and motorbikes, a guest parking will appear outside the complex.  And already in the second stage there will be a multi-level parking for 309 cars. </p><h2>  Beautification </h2><p>  Those wishing to purchase property in the English Mile can be calm - the construction is carried out on the principle of comfort and safety.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa free and closed from transport yard with various zones is fully consistent with it.  Playgrounds in the yard are planned to be divided by age groups, and for those who have pets in the family, places for their walking and training are provided.  In addition, full recreation areas in the shade of greenery will be organized on the territory. </p><h2>  Issue price </h2><p>  Comfort-class housing cannot be cheap a priori, especially if the complex is being built in such a prestigious area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSt. Petersburg.  Nevertheless, many potential residents are interested in whether it is possible to purchase real estate here, what are the real prices.  The English Mile, contrary to popular belief, is an affordable comfort class project. </p><p>  So, the cost of small compact studios starts at 2.7 million rubles, while a spacious three-room apartment of 80 square meters, designed for a large family, can be bought for 7 million rubles.  As you can see, the cost is at the level of other projects, but the comfort that you get from living is difficult to compare with something.  The developer cooperates with the largest banks in the country, which allows you to purchase the coveted square meters with great benefit. </p><h2>  Opinion of the townspeople </h2><p>  What did the English Mile LCD end up with?  Responses of citizens, perhaps the best assessment of the project.  Incidentally, he made a splash, riveted a lot of attention. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.domofond.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="english mile residential complex spb" class="if uuid-3209712" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3209712.jpg"></div><p>  So, the first phase of the project has already been commissioned and put into operation, the apartments are populated, respectively, we can draw the first conclusions.  The first thing that absolutely everyone notes is the impeccability of the chosen location.  The complex is really surrounded by parks - I don‚Äôt want to go for a walk.  If we talk about noise from the roadway, it is compensated by high technology - residents are at least comfortable.  As for transport accessibility, there are a couple of shortcomings.  Construction is currently not completed, the area is relatively new, so the roads are mostly temporary, but they still collect congestion in the morning and evening.  But in the short term, the problem should be solved in favor of the residents. </p><p>  There are enough infrastructure facilities in the district: until their own kindergarten and school have been built, the children of residents visit nearby educational institutions.  By the way, it is possible to arrange children in them without problems and difficulties.  There are enough shops in the area, new outlets are opening every month, so at the moment you can buy almost everything here. </p><p>  Pleased residents and apartments: they are spacious, thought out every square meter of area.  Property owners have the opportunity to control every stage of the work, everyone notes that even apartments without any decoration have smooth walls, high ceilings and are fully consistent with the description, as well as the attached photographs.  And those who took advantage of the developer‚Äôs offer and ordered a turnkey finish were satisfied. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  So, the English Mile project (St. Petersburg) is fully consistent with the title of the comfort class project, which is confirmed by numerous reviews of buyers and residents.  This is a great option for both young and ambitious people, and for large families with small children, because all the conditions for the most comfortable life of a modern city dweller are created here: developed transport accessibility, infrastructure, excellent environmental conditions, spacious bright apartments.  Moreover, the complex looks spectacular, its territory is landscaped, organized space for recreation, entertainment and sports, I really want to come back here, I want to spend my free time here. </p><p>  If you want to see for yourself all the advantages of the project, be sure to sign up for a viewing, take a look at the territory of the complex, available for buying an apartment with your own eyes.  A system of discounts and regular promotions from the developer will save and finally purchase the apartment of your dreams in an excellent area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSt. Petersburg. </p>
