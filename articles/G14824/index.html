  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Interpersonal conflicts: essence, causes and typology</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Interpersonal conflicts are conflicts that arise in the sphere of people in the process of their psychological and <span>social interaction.</span>  Based on this understanding, it becomes clear that in any society the likelihood of their occurrence is quite high.  Especially when you consider what are the causes of interpersonal conflicts and their typology. </p><p>  The prerequisites for their occurrence can be divided into three large groups: </p><ul><li>  psychological; </li><li>  personal; </li><li>  socio-psychological. </li></ul><p>  The psychological causes of conflict lead to the formation of incompatibility.  This phenomenon appears when: </p><ul><li>  there are contradictions in <span>life goals,</span> motives, ideals, worldview, values; </li><li>  ideological, political, life and other attitudes do not coincide; </li><li>  people do not combine in the type of temperament and character. </li></ul><p>  Interpersonal conflicts may arise due to personal reasons, which are based on the <span>individual psychological characteristics of</span> their participants.  The following conditions can lead to their appearance: </p><ul><li>  parties to the conflict evaluate the behavior of the other (s) as unacceptable and incorrect; </li><li>  some people have a low level of communication competence - they do not consider it necessary to see a way out of a particular <span>conflict situation</span> ; </li><li>  Among personal qualities, it is necessary to highlight what interferes with communication: insufficient level of psychological stability, underestimated or overstated <span>claims</span> ; </li><li>  the presence of conflict choleric type of temperament or excessive severity of certain character traits. </li></ul><p>  The third group of causes of conflict, socio-psychological, is very large.  Among the main reasons are the following: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  distortion and loss of information in a situation of interpersonal communication; </li><li>  roles in the process of interaction between people are improperly balanced, that is, someone begins to feel discomfort in communicating with other (s); </li><li>  there are different ways of assessing the personality and activities of another person, as well as value orientations; </li><li>  it is possible that there are complex interpersonal relationships, someone's desire for power, as well as incompatibility. </li></ol><p>  Types of interpersonal conflicts can be distinguished in accordance with several classifications. </p><p>  The most common is the typology of the scope, according to which there are: </p><ul><li>  conflict in public places (on the street, in a store, public transport, etc.); </li><li>  family, </li><li>  conflict in the organization. </li></ul><p>  Interpersonal conflicts can also be divided in accordance with the motivation of the behavior of its participants.  Resource conflicts are distinguished when people ‚Äúshare‚Äù what is necessary for human survival.  Value conflicts are associated with the presence of mutually exclusive cultural stereotypes, beliefs, beliefs, assessments, and relationships. </p><p>  Quite interesting is the classification according to the criterion of truth and falsity.  In accordance with it, one can distinguish: </p><ul><li>  accidental conflict, when a negative interaction arose in accordance with easily changing reasons; </li><li>  genuine conflict exists and can often be "drawn out"; </li><li>  one can speak of a biased form when another, invisible one is hidden behind a real conflict; </li><li>  a latent conflict may be in a ‚Äúsleeping‚Äù state for a long time, but sooner or later it must either disappear or develop into a genuine one; </li><li>  the false option exists due to errors of understanding and perception. </li></ul><p>  When resolving any option, the basic provision will be that all participants need to sit at the ‚Äúnegotiation table‚Äù.  In the event that people try to constructively communicate and agree among themselves, interpersonal conflicts can be resolved. </p>
