  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pancreatic enzymes</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  We learn about the functions and role of the pancreas back in school when studying anatomy.  With the help of this organ, <span>digestive system</span> enzymes are produced that are involved in the breakdown of the main nutrients: fats, proteins and carbohydrates. </p><p>  <span>The pancreas</span> is the second largest in the digestive system (the first is the liver).  This organ performs two main functions in the body: intracretory and exocrine. </p><p>  Intra secretory function is responsible for the production of hormones that are involved in carbohydrate metabolism.  One of the most famous hormones is insulin. </p><p>  During the work of exocrine function, pancreatic enzymes are secreted, their further synthesis occurs.  It is these components in an inactive form that enter the pancreatic juice into the duodenum and are activated there under the influence of bile and other enzymes - enterocytes produced by the cells of the intestinal mucosa.  Pancreatic enzymes are found in the juice of this gland, which also contains water, mucus, minerals and bicarbonates, which neutralize the acidic environment of the stomach. </p><p>  <span>Pancreatic juice</span> containing food enzymes in an inactive form enters the duodenum through the duct, which is located inside this gland.  To facilitate the activation of digestive system enzymes, both ducts of the glands (pancreas and liver) open in one place there. </p><p>  The pancreas is located behind the stomach, has an oblong shape, delicate structure and consists of three parts: tail, body and head.  It is because of the specificity of its location that it is very difficult to feel the gland through the anterior abdominal wall (stomach).  And the main symptom in diseases of this organ is girdle pain, which radiates to the lower back or upper abdomen.  This can signal the pathology of the organ either too early activation of pancreatic enzymes, or increased pressure in its duct. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Pancreatic enzymes are the main processing units in the body for proteins, fats and carbohydrates.  These components of the digestive system include lipase, protease, amylase, maltase and lactase.  So, lipase promotes the breakdown of fats, amylase, maltase and lactase - carbohydrates, protease - proteins.  As you can see, it is in the processing of basic nutrients by the corresponding enzymes that the main function of the pancreas lies. </p><p>  Pancreatic enzymes may vary in quantity depending on the volume and nature of the diet.  If a person chooses <span>carbohydrate food</span> as his priority <span>,</span> then iron produces more amylase and fewer other enzymes.  However, one should not abuse such a useful function of the gland and one should try to maintain a certain balance in nutrition in order to avoid acute and chronic diseases of this organ. </p><p>  Thus, it is necessary to strictly monitor the diet (to strive to eat at the same time), the food should be balanced in the content of fats, carbohydrates and proteins.  And, of course, in no case overeat!  The synthesis of enzymes is a complex process and can be upset with the slightest overload of the pancreas. </p><p>  Very serious changes in the human body, including the digestive system, can occur with a sharp loss or rapid weight gain.  So, in case of weight loss, foods that contain purine substances should be excluded from food due to the ability to destroy lipase with acidic <span>gastric juice.</span>  Namely, this leads to poor digestion of fat. </p><p>  When comparing the <span>action of enzymes</span> on digestion, specialists established a high activity of all their groups during work, both in alkaline and acidic environments.  It is for this reason that each person, regardless of their state of health, needs to eat raw vegetables and fruits in sufficient quantities. </p>
