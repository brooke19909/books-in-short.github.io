This truth is familiar to everyone - both an adult and a child.  But not only the animal can be a true friend of man.  Indeed, for many children a toy dog ​​plays this role.  The advantage of such toys is that they can be sewn a large number, completely different from each other.  All that is required for this is the pattern of the toy (dog) and the fabric you like. </p><h2>  Variety of choices </h2><p>  Current toy dog ​​models are significantly different from those that parents could sew or buy for their children many years ago.  Now such crafts can be found in completely different designs.  They can be plush, fur and fabric, and the material does not have to be plain.  On the contrary, children are more fond of dogs stitched from colored fabrics or even with small drawings on them (flowers, hearts, etc.). </p><p>  The choice of model, size and appearance - all this is selected taking into account the age requirements of the child.  In any case, do not sew too big toys, but it is better to give preference to those that the child can carry for a long time in his hands.  The rest is suitable for any pattern of toys (dogs).  If a beginner takes on the job, you don’t need to use too complex schematic images, with a lot of small details.  Otherwise, you may not understand their proper arrangement. </p><h2>  Cute fluff </h2><p>  Toy dogs made of fur have been popular for many years.  Because they are most like real animals.  Therefore, in the collection of every child should be such a toy.  For small children, it is best to sew a puppy, not an adult dog.  Below is a pattern of a dog toy that will appeal to any child. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  As you can see from the picture, it’s not difficult to sew such a puppy, because it is made from simple parts.  To stitch pattern elements, you need to take thin dense threads so that the seams do not separate during the game.  You can use any material to fill the toy.  But it’s best to pick up a packing that is not too dense, as the toy will have to be washed often, and cotton wool or other similar material will dry for too long.  To make eyes and a nose for a toy friend, you need to purchase special parts.  But if these are not available, then they can be replaced with buttons, beads or embroidered with threads. </p><h2>  Color splendor </h2><p>  Toys look very interesting and unique, for the sewing of which they use natural fabrics of various colors.  They will not only be able to entertain the child with the game, but will also cheer him up with an unusual design.  And how such a craft is made will help to figure out the pattern of the dog (toy), shown below. </p>

    <p>  Parts of the pattern can be made from the same material, or combine them with fabrics different in color and structure.  The more unusual the toy will look, the more interesting it will be for the child.  If desired, such a dog can sew a beautiful collar made of bright material or tie a ribbon bow. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As can be seen from the pattern, the circles under the puppy's eyes are painted differently.  It is specially designed to give the face a more touching appearance and soft forms.  But if such an image is not to the liking of the needlewoman, then the details can be made the same. </p><h2>  Perfect choice </h2><p>  To sew a puppy out of any fabric, it is not necessary to look for an image of such a toy.  Indeed, a beautiful fabric crafts can be made using any pattern of a toy dog.  For example, this pattern of a dog’s toy is suitable not only for making a <span>plush animal,</span> but also for <span>crafts made of felt</span> and other materials. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dog soft toy pattern" class="if" height="453" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46256/1722170.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  You can also make several identical toys in one pattern, just picking up different colors, as indicated in the figure.  Although they are made according to the same model, they look completely different.  Pay attention to how you can sew the eyes of an animal.  In one case, they are closely located, and in the other, they are at a distance and have spots under them.  Also a feature of this drawing (a pattern of a toy dog ​​from fabric) is the ability to sew different legs.  An animal can be made sitting, or it can be made to its full height. </p><h2>  Fashionable Dachshund </h2><p>  Dachshund dogs stitched in the Tilda style look unusual and pretty.  With such crafts, you can play, or you can make them part of the interior of the room.  They are distinguished by the simplicity of cut and the brightness of the image.  It is very easy to stitch them using the schematic image.  Below is a pattern of a dog (toy) dachshund, which consists of a minimum number of details. </p>

    <p>  To decorate the face of the finished product, you need to use blush, embroidery threads and small black beads.  Blush is needed for drawing cheeks toys, beads - for the eyes, and threads - in order to embroider the nose of a dachshund.  For sewing this type of dog it is necessary to use natural fabrics (cotton, linen, etc.). </p><p>  If there is no beige fabric available, it can be obtained by dyeing white, using tea leaves, infusion of black coffee or onion husks.  Such a pattern of a soft toy is very interesting.  A dog, sewn with his own hands, can be used as a roller for a sofa or as a pillow. </p><h2>  Girlfriend Outfits </h2><p>  In particular honor for all children are toys that have clothes.  It should not be sewn to the craft, but should be easily removed and dressed.  Especially this activity attracts girls.  Therefore, complete with the toy should be replaceable outfits.  Thus, the pattern of a soft toy (dog) must take these requirements into account, accordingly, it must have the necessary parameters. </p>

    <p>  In this schematic drawing, there is no pattern of clothes available, but you can easily do it yourself.  Also, such a model of the dog allows the craft to stand thanks to the large feet.  To give greater stability to the legs, you need to put insoles from thick cardboard on the bottom of the feet, under the lining.  Many people like this pattern of toys.  Self-made dogs can be very unusual - to have their own face. </p><h2>  Unusual solution </h2><p>  Soft toys can be made not only from cuts of fabrics, but also remade from other things.  For example, ordinary socks when performing certain actions will turn into a charming dog.  The brighter this item will be, the more beautiful the toy created from it will turn out.  And the most interesting thing in this method of sewing is that for the manufacture of crafts do not need a pattern of soft toys (dog), but only a phased list of actions is needed. </p>
