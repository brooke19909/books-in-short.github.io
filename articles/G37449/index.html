    <p>  Location, as you know, can be both an advantage of the hotel and its disadvantage.  So where is the Helya Beach Spa 3 * resort?  Skanes is a beautiful tourist village located just 1 km from the lively Monastir.  And it is here that many tourists prefer to stay. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Immediately it is worth saying that this is a calm area - most of it is occupied by hotels, cafes and shops.  The distance to the city center is only 8 km, which can be overcome in a few minutes by public bus, taxi or even a comfortable train.  The journey from the local airport also takes no more than 20 minutes, which is very convenient, because after the flight you would rather want to get to a comfortable room and relax.  The distance to the equally famous city called Enfida is 63 km, but Tunisia is located 170 km. </p><p>  In any case, tourists consider the location profitable, because you can enjoy the silence, while not feeling divorced from civilization. </p><h2>  Hotel Helya Beach Spa 3 * (Monastir): description of the territory </h2><p>  In their reviews, travelers say that the hotel complex pleasantly impresses with its well-groomed, cleanliness and original architecture.  The hotel itself consists of one large five-story building with snow-white walls, built in a rather original style.  Elevators work inside, and the interior itself creates a feeling of space and luxury. </p><p>  The hotel area is very large - there are terraces, sports grounds, swimming pools, and even your own garden.  Of course, everything here is decorated with exotic flowers, lush bushes and trees, in the shade of which it is so pleasant to relax.  By the way, Helya Beach Spa 3 * hotel was built in 1994.  In 2013, a complete reconstruction was carried out throughout the territory, so today guests can enjoy modern design and equipment. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What do the numbers look like?
