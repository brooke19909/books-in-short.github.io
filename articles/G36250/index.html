Everyone who has been there describes it in their own way.  For some, it is a land that smells of tarry forest.  Those who have been on vacation on the lakes speaks of the incomparable beauty of places with pointed "eyelashes of firs over the blue eyes of the lakes."  Fishing enthusiasts talk about cold transparent ponds rich in fish.  Leaving home, each takes with him an incredible amount of impressions, leaving a piece of his soul there in return.  After reading this article, you may also want to go to North Karelia. </p><h2>  Finland is near </h2><p>  Everyone who arrives will find a vacation option for themselves.  Whether he will be active and sporty in a ski resort, or whether you limit yourself to catching grayling and <span>lake trout,</span> depends on the option of your chosen vacation.  In North Karelia, a customs station of Suoperya has been opened, through which you can get to the northern part of Finland, the Ruka-Kuusamo region.  The nature of Finnish Karelia is no different from Russian - the same snow drifts in pine-spruce forests.  In the lakes there are pike and perch.  Throughout the 300-kilometer border, where the Russian National <span>Park Paanaj√§rvi</span> borders on the Finnish Park Olanka, nature is picturesque and equally beautiful. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="north karelia" class="if" height="428" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/1882786.jpg" width="600"></div>

In the pine forest, caps of hills rise; under the trees you can see the growing Calypso orchid.  In the riverbeds on alluvial (alluvial) meadows in the summer, migratory birds nest their birds and flutter rare species of butterflies.  In the park you can meet bears and deer.  Lynx and wolverine live in these parts.  Walking along the paths of the park, you can go to the clearing with berries and mushrooms that are allowed to collect.  In addition to the usual wild berries of strawberries and blueberries, interesting northern berries of the prince (arctic raspberry) and crowberry, belonging to the heather family, with leaf needles grow in the park. </p><h2>  Routes offered in the park </h2><p>  In the park, for the movement and recreation of tourists, there are trails in the spruce forest and bridges over the rivers.  On the equipped areas of the park, you can set up a tent for a couple of nights for free or accommodate under a canopy.  There are designated areas for making fires, there are braziers and firewood.  The park has numerous water and hiking routes.  One of them, 80 km long, is the most popular in North Karelia and is available all year.  The route is called the Bear Trail.  Typically, tourists pass it in eight days.  On the trail there will be moss covered old trees of the ancient forest, canyons and stormy mountain streams. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="northern karelia finland" class="if" height="444" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/1882806.jpg" width="600"></div>  Those who are looking for adventure - they will meet them in the form of six suspension bridges that need to be overcome.  There will be stairs, bridges and narrow wooden decks on the way, providing passage in hard-to-reach places.  There are forest huts on the Bear Trail in which people walking along the trail can relax and make a fire in a certain place.  No less interesting is the one-day route along the Kitka River.  He is also with trials in which you need to overcome three suspension bridges and walk on wooden floors in hard-to-reach places, and where necessary, climb rope ladders.

    <p>  Situated from the north on the lake, two Finnish towns are attractive for tourists, each in its own way.  In Nurmes, you can get acquainted with traditional Finnish life, visit artisan shops.  Good fishing in these places of northern Karelia.  Inveterate fishermen value these fish-rich places.  Here, trout and pale are good for spinning.  Roach and perch are pecking at a fishing rod.  The shallows are rich in whitefish and grayling. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In Valtimo, tourists will be interested in a ride on reindeer sledges, and they will also be fed Karelian wickets - rye cakes stuffed with. </p><h2>  Dreamland </h2><p>  To celebrate the New Year in Finland is becoming a tradition for many tourists, especially if a family with children goes on vacation.  In this case, you need to go to Lapland.  In the "magic land" you can spend the winter holidays with all the New Year attributes - snow, frost, fluffy spruce and Santa Claus, who lives nearby, to extend the child's years of childhood and his faith in magic.  It is here, in the winter of North Karelia, that you can immerse yourself in a fairy tale, especially if you get here in the fifth season, the twilight season is Kaamos (polar night).  At this time, the sky is painted in real ultramarine color, which makes staying in Lapland truly magical.  And here - snowy hills and silver spruce, creating an atmosphere that the Finns call Lapin taika, or ‚ÄúLapland magic‚Äù.  It will be interesting for children to get into the "official residence" of Santa Claus, which since 1985 moved closer to the Arctic Circle. </p>

    <h2>  Zoo Ranua </h2><p>  The capital of the fabulous country of Lapland is located beyond the Arctic Circle.  This is a small town of Rovaniemi with its attractions.  Here is the northernmost zoo in the world.  In it, the conditions for keeping animals are as close to natural as possible.  The zoo has approximately 60 species of wild arctic animals.  To get to know the inhabitants of the zoo closer, special wooden walkways have been laid for visitors, which are either above the aviaries or pass alongside them.  Everything is provided and done in the zoo so that the human influence is the least, and the animals feel comfortable.  Arriving in Finland in the winter and falling into this zoo, you will get a unique opportunity to watch animals that, having changed their fur for winter, often leave their enclosures.  The white (polar) bear at this time is in its element. </p>

    <h2>  Finland for adults </h2><p>  What is Finland interesting for adults in winter?  Here we will focus on ski resorts with impressive elevations and black slopes.  If you are a skier, there are many places in Finland where you can ski.  Each resort has trails for beginners and children.  If you had a vacation with your family in Lapland, you don‚Äôt have to leave in search of a ski resort.  She became the most revered tourist resort during the winter season.  Here on the hills there are slopes of any complexity for skiers and for snowboarders.  The simplest tracks are laid on knolls for children. </p><p>  The ski season lasts from October to May.  The snow on the slopes is real, like winter itself.  By the way, the peak of the ski season in Lapland falls on a polar night lasting two months.  The artificial lighting of the slopes completely compensates for the lack of natural daylight.  The atmosphere of this ski resort in Finland, thanks to its fabulous nature, offers a relaxing holiday.  Snow Park is an integral part of any European ski resort.  In Lapland there is such a park.  Snow jumps and a children's park are arranged in it, where children can learn to jump and perform tricks under the supervision of trainers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Finland in winter" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/1882863.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Services at ski resorts </h2><p>  What are the good winter ski resorts in Lapland?  The fact that they have rental offices offering a full range of services and all ski equipment.  It‚Äôs not at all worth taking the equipment with you when leaving for vacation in North Karelia.  With housing in the resorts there are no problems.  You can rent a log cottage with a hot sauna, where you can steam up after time spent on the slopes. </p><p>  Resorts include snowshoeing, safari snowmobiles, dog and <span>reindeer sledding.</span>  There is cross-country skiing for hire and everything for winter fishing. </p><h2>  Snowland </h2><p>  Returning from a trip, of course, you will tell how you had a good time in Finland.  But the most exciting moment in the story will be how you visited the unique, the only complex in the world of ice and snow.  And for the story to be true, you really should go there. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="north karelia" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/1882938.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Snowland is located in the village of Lainio, famous for its ice sculptures, a restaurant that sits on chairs made of ice, two ice bars and an Arctic disco.  And here you can admire the northern lights, while at the Kakslauttanen in a glass igloo.  The hotel is next to the Saariselka hill.  Hotel guests sleep or lie on reindeer skins and look at the sky. </p><p>  Having been to Finland in North Karelia, I want to go to this beautiful snowy country more than once. </p>
