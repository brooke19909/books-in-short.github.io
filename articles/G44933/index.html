The island is even more interesting for its rich history and many preserved sights.  The capital of Cyprus is Nicosia, founded in the eighth century BC.  e., in antiquity was an independent state, then turned into a village.  In the tenth century, the city began to regain its former power in order to become the political center of the kingdom in two centuries. </p><h4>  The capital of Cyprus is a white city </h4><p>  This city is the only large settlement located not on the coast, but in the central part of the island.  The capital has several names: the official is Nicosia, but the Greeks prefer to call it Lefkosia ("White City"), and the Turks living in its northern part - Lefkosa.  The very first name of the city was Ledra, but after its almost complete destruction, it was rebuilt and became Lefkon, from which Lefkosia subsequently descended. </p>

Only in the sixtieth year of the last century did he receive the long-awaited independence.  The culture of Cyprus and its capital was influenced by Christianity, Catholicism and Islam.

Built in the 16th century with a defensive purpose, they are perfectly preserved and replenished the numerous attractions of Cyprus that have remained from earlier times.  Gates were built in the walls, the most famous of which today is Famagusta.  They are located in the capital, and not in the city of the same name, now located on the territory of the Turkish community. </p><p>  One of the monuments of modernity on the territory of Nicosia is the residence of Archbishop Makarios the Third, a man who held an honorary position at a fairly early age and became the first president of an independent republic.  For visitors, this place is interesting by the Art Gallery located in the palace. </p>

    <p>  Nicosia, which is natural for the capital, is the cultural and economic center of the city, it has a lot of restaurants, shops, museums and galleries.  A characteristic feature of the city is that it belongs to two states: the Independent Republic of Cyprus and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h4>  The capital of Cyprus and the military conflict with Turkey </h4><p>  Unfortunately, military conflicts did not bypass Cyprus, and the most recent of them is still fresh in memory, and it cannot be considered completely completed. </p>

The Greeks were evacuated from the territory occupied by the enemy.  The capital of Cyprus was divided in two by a green line, indicating a ceasefire and became the border between the territories.  Today, the northern part of the island is the partially recognized <span>Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.</span>

    <p>  Since both sides are interested in the influx of vacationers, tourists can cross the green line that passed along the main street of the city without any problems, but a passport is required.  Since prices in the northern part of Cyprus are significantly lower than in the southern part, the export of goods from there is limited. </p><p>  The Turkish part of the island, despite external circumstances, attracts travelers.  The natural conditions of this territory are considered even more attractive than the Greek.  Tours to northern Cyprus until recently seemed like amusement for adventure lovers who want to see the fenced area of ‚Äã‚ÄãVarosha - the Famagusta district, which until 1974 was the island‚Äôs tourism center, and now called the ‚ÄúDead City‚Äù, which conflicting communities have not been able to share for almost forty years . </p><p>  Today, when the parties are gradually opening the borders, the possibility of relaxing in the Turkish part of the island no longer seems unbelievable.  Resort cities, such as Kyrenia and Famagusta with their beautiful beaches and new hotels, not too spoiled by the attention of tourists, welcome guests.  From a cognitive point of view, northern Cyprus is no less interesting than southern Cyprus. </p>
