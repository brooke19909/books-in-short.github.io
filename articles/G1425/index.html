Once Montenegro was part of Socialist Yugoslavia, and all resorts here were organized in accordance with socialist standards.  However, everything changed when the country became independent (2006), and also expressed a desire to join the European Union.  Over the next few years, it has transformed: on magnificent beaches, as if from sand, comfortable Montenegro 5 * hotels - 3 stars, giant hotel complexes, villas, etc. have grown. Among them you can find hotels belonging to international hotel brands, and this, of course , speaks in favor of the resorts of Montenegro and increases its prestige as a tourist country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="all inclusive Montenegro hotels" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/450304.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Tourism and hotel business development </h2><p>  Since 2006, the tourism sector as one of the most promising sectors of the country's economy has come under special state control and has begun to develop rapidly.  Almost all of the already existing best <span>hotels in Montenegro</span> were reconstructed, and those that spoiled the overall panorama with their appearance were demolished.  In order to get closer to European standards, it was decided to build modern conceptual hotels using the latest technology.  Soon, new fashionable Montenegro all-inclusive hotels appeared on the first beach lines.  Among them you can see both budget three-star, and four- and five-star luxury hotels and complexes.  Each of them has its own pool (s), spa, playgrounds for various sports games, restaurants and cafes, a well-equipped beach, etc. Of course, even the best hotels in Montenegro are slightly inferior in service to similar hotels in Turkey or Spain but they were already able to achieve a high level of service for the Croatian and Bulgarian coast.  Thus, if Montenegro develops at such a pace, it may soon become one of the most competitive resort countries in Europe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the best hotels of Montenegro" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/450310.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Features of rest in Montenegro </h2><p>  Holidays in this amazingly beautiful country, which is called Montenegro all over the world, and only in Russia - Montenegro, will appeal to all lovers of both beach and educational tourism.  If you are only interested in water activities or a lazy vacation by the pool or by the sea, then you should not go here, but rather choose a country with a less rich history and culture.  And Montenegro itself is an open-air museum, and not visiting at least some of its many attractions is simply blasphemy.  By the way, all-inclusive Montenegro hotels, besides high-class hotel services, organize interesting excursions for their guests to both historical and natural sights of the country.  And here, believe me, there is something to see for inquisitive tourists.  The people of Montenegro, in spite of everything, could bring their rich culture through the centuries, preserve numerous architectural monuments, etc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Montenegro holidays all inclusive hotels" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/450308.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Montenegro: rest.  All Inclusive Hotels </h2><p>  The best resort in Montenegro is the <span>Budva Riviera: a</span> picturesque white and red city, bewitching nature, <span>turquoise sea,</span> well-groomed magnificent beaches.  There are many cozy and quiet bays, on the banks of which the best all-inclusive Montenegro hotels are built.  Some of the world's famous hotel service brands have already taken a fancy to the shores of Montenegro, which is rightfully considered one of the most environmentally friendly countries in Europe, and built their own hotels on secluded beaches.  Naturally, in their interior and exterior, as well as in the level of service, they fully correspond to the concept of these hotel brands.  Thus, tourists who want to get acquainted with the sights of the beautiful Adriatic, but at the same time prefer to relax in world-famous hotel brands, can pre-book a room in one of them.  These hotels include the brand new ‚ÄúSoho Hotels &amp; Resort‚Äù, the Splendid Conference &amp; SPA Resort 5 * hotel, Mediteran 4 * and others. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Montenegro hotels all inclusive prices" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/450307.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The best resorts of Montenegro </h2><p>  The Riviera includes several dozen small resorts with their own luxurious beaches, among which the most popular are Becici, Mogren, Slavenska plaza, Yaz, Ulcinj, Kralichina Plaza and others. It is in these resorts that you can find hotels that have received their treasured ‚Äústars‚Äù from international experts "  Of course, among them there are still few hotels whose signs adorn 5 stars, but quite a lot of four-star ones.  By the way, the best hotels in Montenegro all inclusive can even be three-star.  Of course, the service in them cannot be compared with what Turkish Antalya offers its guests, however, it is quite acceptable.  But Montenegro, being a truly European country, can offer its tourists something more, namely rich European traditions and real Mediterranean flavor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Montenegro hotels 5 *" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/450306.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Montenegro, all-inclusive hotels: prices and services </h2><p>  How much does a room in a hotel of the highest category in Montenegrin resorts cost?
