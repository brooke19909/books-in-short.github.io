The essence of this term is rather simple and does not hide a complex definition.  Let's get acquainted with what it is and consider some types of devices and their history. </p><h2>  Definition Appears </h2><p>  The meaning of the word player is worth looking for in the English language, since it completely repeats the sound and meaning of the original.  The word comes from player - player or player.  In the case of media devices we are talking about the first version of the value.  A player is a portable or stationary device for playing soundtracks or videos (video player).  In Russian, you can meet several variations of the spelling of a given word, and all of them will be correct - player, player.  However, the meaning of the word player does not change from this - it is all a matter of transcription. </p><p>  Another variation of meaning is the multimedia player.  This word will be applied to software that plays digital files. </p><div class="photo" data-original="infodiario.co.mz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Meaning of the word player" class="if uuid-2321018" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39808/2321018.jpg"></div><h2>  History </h2><p>  The history of this device lasts a long time, because even gramophones are players to some extent.  But in the usual sense, players began to appear in the 70s.  The first successful devices were devices from Sony.  The rapid development of this market from cassette players to digital began in that era.  Now the meaning of the word player is slightly changing due to modern technology.  People prefer not to carry another device with them to listen to music, to replace it with a smartphone or tablet. </p><p>  At the end of the 20th century, the first MP3 players began to appear.  They were very expensive, so these devices received universal popularity much later.  From 2000 to 2008  the market developed at a frantic pace.  Additional functions, color screens, and much more began to appear in the devices. </p><p>  With the advent of touch screens and multifunction devices on iOS and Android, the relevance of players as separate devices has fallen dramatically. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.apartmenttherapy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What is a player?" class="if uuid-2321020" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39808/2321020.jpg"></div><h2>  Classification </h2><p>  Conventionally, all players can be divided into two categories - portable and stationary.  The first include compact devices that you can take with you.  The easiest and most convenient option is a small MP3 player, which you can take with you for a run, instead of a smartphone with a large display that will hamper the movement. </p><p>  To stationary belong DVD-players, consoles, earlier - cassette players.  Devices connect to TVs or monitors and are used to watch discs, movies or television. </p><p>  Now you know what a player is, what types of players are and have plunged a little into the history of this device. </p>
