    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Rest in the Best Semiramis 5 * hotel (Tenerife) is not without drawbacks.  Traveler reviews focus on the following: </p><ul><li>  after September 30, the air conditioners do not work, but the weather is still hot, which is why it is impossible to stay in the room even with an open balcony; </li><li>  near the hotel there is a busy track, the noise of which not only interferes with relaxation, but also drowns out the sounds of the sea; </li><li>  due to the lack of mosquito nets, many mosquitoes fly into the room; </li><li>  Wireless Internet is very slow and constantly shuts down;  lack of private parking; </li><li>  poor sound insulation in the rooms; </li><li>  the restaurant often serves unwashed fruits; </li><li>  Considering that the main contingent of vacationers is pensioners, one should not expect vivid entertainment; </li><li>  the hotel is located far enough from the sea (you have to walk about half an hour on foot); </li><li>  drinks are not included in the dinner price (you have to pay extra for them); </li><li>  the entrance to the hotel, located on the lower floor, closes at 21:00 (to get to the hotel through the upper entrance, you have to make an additional hook); </li><li>  too few tables on the open terrace of the restaurant (you need to come in advance to take places); </li><li>  the restaurant has no air conditioning, and the windows do not open, and therefore it is very stuffy and there is the smell of food; </li><li>  bedding is rarely changed; </li><li>  in all rooms up to the 5th floor the sea view from the windows is blocked by a high fence; </li><li>  the stairs leading to the ocean are too steep and in disrepair; </li><li>  the hotel needs redecorating; </li><li>  paid use of the safe; </li><li>  the room does not have an iron or an electric kettle (even for an additional fee these devices are not provided); </li><li>  old beach towels; </li><li>  there are no single rooms (you need to either pay for the apartment in full or agree to share it); </li><li>  dirty carpet; </li><li>  the ventilation in the corridors does not work well. </li></ul><p>  If you do not have high expectations for the five-star status of the Best Semiramis 5 * hotel (Puerto de la Cruz), a vacation here will completely satisfy you.  It is worth noting that this is a rather old institution, remote from the beaches.  Nevertheless, the ocean view compensates for this drawback. </p>
