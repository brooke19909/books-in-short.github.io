    <h2>  Near the sea ... </h2><p>  Sheraton Rhodes Resort 5 * is on the first line.  It consists of a white multi-level building with elevators.  It is perfectly inscribed in the relief of the mountain.  From the center of the famous Rhodes, famous for medieval architecture and the fortresses of European knights, it is only four kilometers away.  Charter and regular flights from Moscow and (in season) St. Petersburg, as well as from the mainland, arrive at the island's international airport.  From there, as a rule, a shuttle service delivers travelers to the hotel, especially since traveling from Diagoras is about fifteen kilometers.  Since the island is very close to Bodrum, this picturesque Turkish resort is often visible from the hotel rooms and from the veranda of the main restaurant. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sheraton hotel" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/531118.jpg" width="600"></div>

There are wonderful animators who will find something to entertain your offspring with.  One of the hotel's bonuses is that children under thirteen years old can stay in the room with their parents for free, provided that you do not need to put an extra bed.  For newlyweds, they bring fruit and champagne to the room, and can also move them to a suite.  Birthday men are supposed to have a cake.  Internet in the territory is free, in the room - for the money. </p><h2>  Greek cuisine in the Rhodes "five" </h2><p>  The Sheraton Hotel in Ixia is famous for its gastronomic diversity.  It operates on a "boarding house" system, although only breakfasts can be borrowed here.  Therefore, drinks for lunch and dinner must be paid.  The main restaurant "Castelliania" has a veranda, so guests can have a meal in the air, enjoying the breeze and looking at the sea.  Here they only have breakfast and dinner.  The sunsets are especially beautiful in this restaurant, but then you need to come to the evening meal early, otherwise all the tables in the part where they are better seen will be occupied.  They serve mainly Greek dishes, and there are also special offers for vegetarians. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sheraton Rhodes" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/531124.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  And the restaurant, open only at lunchtime - Mediterranean - is located in the garden, near the main pool.  Here you can savor various Mediterranean goodies.  You can also have dinner in the Italian restaurant Llonda.  Two bars with drinks, cocktails and snacks - one at the lower pool, and the second in the lobby - open until one in the morning.  The food is extremely tasty, great choice, all the freshest.  For breakfast, meat and fish cuts are served, among other things, for dinner there are many types of meat, including lamb.  A lot of different sweets, ice cream and fruits.  Meals will be long, but you will not regret even once. </p><h2>  Pool, sea and other pleasures of life </h2><p>  The beach at Sheraton Rhodes Resort is private and is right behind the garden.  Aliens are not allowed here.  Between the beach and the hotel there is a beautifully designed underground passage across the road.  However, no noise is heard at the hotel.  There are several pools - three in the open air, and one under the roof.  They are at different levels, and in one there is a jacuzzi.  Sun loungers by the pool should not be occupied with towels.  The administration periodically removes them.  Most of the guests, as tourists write, mainly accumulate in the pools.  At sea, they are much smaller, so there are enough sunbeds for everyone.  The thing is that the Aegean northwest coast of the island has its own wind rose.  The sea here is often worried, and swimming is good only for experienced vacationers.  But here it‚Äôs not hot to sunbathe.  For the convenience of entering the water there is a wooden staircase with a railing.  The water is very clear and clean.  The beach is constantly cleaned.  There is a surf school.  You can buy fruits and sweets from local farmers. </p><h2>  About staff </h2><p>  The people who work at the Sheraton Hotel (Rhodes) are extremely welcoming and helpful.  Everyone is friendly and speak English.  Very nice waiters.  They make sure that there are no queues and crushes in the restaurant, they will always tell you where there is a free table.  Although our compatriots are still few there, there are Russian-speaking employees at the reception.  They will help you to solve any question, ask about whether you like everything here and if there are any problems.  Great housekeeping, maids smiling, polite.  The service is attentive and fast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sheraton rhodes resort reviews" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/531125.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What's around </h2><p>  There is no doubt where guests of the Sheraton Hotel go for walks.  Rhodes is a city, a historic UNESCO site that attracts everyone with its amazing beauty.  This is an excellent shopping place, including the purchase of not very expensive fur coats.  In addition, many stroll to its center in the evenings on the boardwalk.  There are good and inexpensive taverns, bars, night clubs, discos, casinos.  The hotel organizes various excursions - trips by bus and car, boat trips, even helicopter flights around the island.  You can ride to the other end of the island to swim on beaches with calmer waves. </p><h2>  Sheraton Rhodes Resort: reviews </h2><p>  Tourists like this good network hotel, first of all, due to the stylish interior, thoughtful design and architecture, beautiful views, clean and spacious pools, comfortable sun loungers and delicious food (often in the author's version), quick and friendly staff, as well as the fact that Mostly Europeans rest there.  Large and comfortable rooms are highly praised - wicker furniture, textiles in white and brown tones, light green pillows, <span>panoramic glazing.</span>  From the upper floors a great view of the sea.  The territory itself resembles the tropics.  Everywhere palm trees, figured pools with bridges and an island.  Great reviews about shops on its territory - you can buy high-quality beach accessories and swimwear, creams and so on.  This is a place where they recommend having a great time.  It is not noisy, very positive.  After eleven in the evening all animation parties and shows subside, and you can sleep peacefully.  Although this is one of the most windy parts of the island, you can relax and swim in the pools on the territory. </p>
