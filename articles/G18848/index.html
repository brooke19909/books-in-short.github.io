The largest geographical discoveries</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Russian pioneers and travelers of the 19th century made a number of outstanding discoveries, which became the property of not only Russian, but also foreign, world science.  In addition, they made a significant contribution to the development of domestic knowledge and did a lot to facilitate the training of new personnel for the development of marine research. </p><h2>  Background </h2><p>  Russian discoverers and travelers of the 19th century made their discoveries largely because in this century the need was identified for the search for new trade routes and opportunities to support Russia's communication with other countries.  In the late XVIII - early XIX centuries, our country finally strengthened its status in the international arena as a world power.  Naturally, this new position expanded its geopolitical space, which required new studies of the seas, islands and ocean coasts for the construction of ports, ships and the development of trade with foreign countries. </p>

    <p>  The Russian explorers and travelers of the 19th century took place as talented sailors just at the very time when our country achieved access to two seas: the Baltic and the Black.  And this is no coincidence.  This opened up new prospects for marine research and gave impetus to the construction and development of fleets and marine affairs in general.  Therefore, it is not surprising that already in the first decades of the century under consideration, Russian discoverers and travelers of the 19th century carried out a number of outstanding studies that significantly enriched Russian geographical science. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Plan around the world expedition </h2><p>  Such a project was made possible largely due to the successful military operations of our country at the end of the 18th century.  At this time, Russia got the opportunity to build its fleet on the Black Sea, which, of course, was supposed to stimulate the maritime industry.  At that time, Russian navigators seriously thought about paving convenient trade routes.  This was further facilitated by the fact that our country owned Alaska in North America.  It was also necessary to maintain constant relations with her and develop economic cooperation. </p><p>  I.F.  Kruzenshtern at the end of the XVIII century presented a plan for a world expedition.  However, then he was rejected.  But just a few years after the accession of Alexander I, the Russian government showed interest in the plan presented.  He received approval. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yuri Fedorovich Lisyansky" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1271014.jpg" width="408"></div></h2><h2>  Training </h2><p>  I.F.  Kruzenshtern came from a noble family.  He studied in the Kronstadt Naval Corps and, as his apprentice, took part in the war against Sweden, having proved himself well then.  After that, he was sent for an internship in England, where he received an excellent education.  Upon returning to Russia, he presented a plan for a world expedition.  Having received approval, he carefully prepared for it, purchased the best instruments and equipped ships. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  His closest assistant in this matter was his friend Yuri Fedorovich Lisyansky.  He made friends with him in the cadet corps.  A friend also established himself as a talented naval officer during the Russian-Swedish war of 1788-1790.  Soon, two ships were equipped with the names "Neva" and "Hope".  The latter was led by Count Nikolai Rezanov, who became famous thanks to the famous rock opera.  The expedition set sail in 1803.  Her goal was to explore and explore the possibility of opening new trade routes from Russia to China and the coast of North American territory. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian sailors" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/1271172.jpg" width="498"></div></h2><h2>  Swimming </h2><p>  Russian navigators circled Cape Horn and, having entered the Pacific Ocean, were divided.  Yuri Fedorovich Lisyansky led his ship to the North American coast, where he recaptured the merchant Russian city Novo-Arkhangelsk captured by the Indians.  During this journey, he also carried out for the first time in the history of navigation a sailing ship around South Africa. </p><p>  The ship "Hope" under the direction of Kruzenshtern went to the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãJapan.  The merit of this researcher is that he carefully explored the shores of Sakhalin Island and made significant changes to the map.  The main <span>purpose of the trip</span> was to explore the <span>mouth of the Amur River,</span> in which the leadership of the Pacific Fleet had been interested for a long time.  Kruzenshtern entered the Amur estuary, after which, having explored the coast of Kamchatka, he returned to his homeland. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="great discoverers" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/1271163.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Kruzenshtern's contribution to science </h2><p>  Travelers of Russia have significantly advanced Russian geographical science, bringing it to the world level of development.  <span>This expedition</span> attracted the attention of the general public.  After the end of the journey, both wrote books in which the results of their research were presented.  Kruzenshtern published Traveling Around the World, but the atlas with hydrographic applications that he released is of particular importance.  He filled many white spots on the map, conducted valuable research on the seas and oceans.  So, he studied the pressure and temperature of water, sea currents, tides. </p><h2>  Social work </h2><p>  His further career was closely connected with the marine corps, where he was first identified as an inspector.  Subsequently, he began to teach there, and then in general he headed it.  On his initiative, the Higher Officer Classes were created.  Later they were transformed into the Maritime Academy.  Kruzenshtern introduced new disciplines in the educational process.  This significantly increased the quality of teaching marine science. </p><p>  In addition, he helped organize other expeditions, in particular, contributed to the plans of another prominent explorer O. Kotzebue.  Kruzenshtern took part in the creation of the famous Russian Geographical Society, which was destined to occupy one of the leading places not only in Russian, but also in world science.  Of particular importance for the development of geography was the Atlas of the South Sea that he published. </p><h2>  Preparing a new expedition </h2><p>  Kruzenshtern several years after his journey insisted on a thorough study of the southern latitudes.  He proposed to equip two expeditions to the North and South poles, two ships in each.  Prior to this, the explorer <span>D. Cook</span> almost came close to the Antarctic, but ice prevented him from going further.  Then the <span>famous traveler</span> suggested that the sixth continent either does not exist or is impossible to reach. </p><p>  In 1819, the Russian leadership decided to equip a new sailing squadron.  Thaddeus Faddeevich Bellingshausen, after a series of delays, was appointed its head.  It was decided to build two ships: Mirny and Vostok.  The first was designed according to the plan of Russian scientists.  It was durable and water resistant.  However, the second, built in the UK, was less stable, so it had to be remade, rebuilt and repaired more than once.  The preparation and construction was led by Mikhail Lazarev, who complained about such a discrepancy between the two ships. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Thaddeus Faddeevich Bellingshausen" class="if" height="293" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1271007.jpg" width="210"></div></h2><h2>  Journey south </h2><p>  A new expedition set off in 1819.  She reached Brazil and, circling the mainland, went to the Sandwich Islands.  In January 1820, the Russian expedition discovered the sixth mainland - Antarctica.  During maneuvers around it, many islands were discovered and described.  Among the most significant discoveries are the island of Peter I, the coast of Alexander I. Having made the necessary description of the coast, as well as the sketches of animals seen on the new mainland, Thaddeus Faddeevich Bellingshausen sailed back. </p><p>  During the expedition, in addition to the discovery of Antarctica, other discoveries were made.  For example, participants found that Sandwich Land is a whole archipelago.  In addition, the island of South Georgia was described.  Of particular importance are the descriptions of the new continent.  From his ship Mikhail Lazarev had the opportunity to observe the earth better, so his conclusions are of particular value to science. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mikhail Lazarev" class="if" height="410" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/1271153.jpg" width="330"></div></h2><h2>  The value of discovery </h2><p>  The expedition of 1819-1821 was of great importance for domestic and world geographic science.  The discovery of a new, sixth mainland, turned upside down the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe geography of the Earth.  Both travelers published the results of their research in two volumes with the appendix of the atlas and the necessary instructions.  During the trip, about thirty islands were described, magnificent sketches of the views of Antarctica and its wildlife were made.  In addition, the expedition gathered a unique ethnographic collection, which is stored at Kazan University. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian discoverers and travelers of the 19th century" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1271013.jpg" width="375"></div></h2><h2>  Further activities </h2><p>  Bellingshausen subsequently continued his naval career.  He participated in the Russian-Turkish war of 1828-1829, commanded the Baltic Fleet, and then was appointed governor of Kronstadt.  An indicator of recognition of his merits is the fact that a number of geographical objects are named after him.  First of all, the sea in the Pacific Ocean should be mentioned. </p><p>  Lazarev also distinguished himself after his famous trip to Antarctica.  He was appointed commander of the expedition to protect the shores of Russian America from smugglers, with which he successfully coped.  Subsequently, he commanded the Black Sea Fleet, participated in <span>the Battle of Navarino,</span> for which he was awarded several awards.  So, the great discoverers from Russia also made their outstanding contribution to the development of geography. </p>
