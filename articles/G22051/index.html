The reviews in the first lines indicate that there is an exceptionally large amount of greenery and a very good ecological situation.  The main advantage of this project is its proximity to the metro: literally three hundred meters away, the future Solntsevo metro station is being built, which they intend to solemnly open in early 2018. </p>

    <h2>  Location and infrastructure </h2><p>  Despite the proximity of transport routes, the happy owners of the Luchi LCD apartments will write reviews for a long time that they have the opportunity to truly enjoy the surrounding nature and always fresh air.  Here, the picturesque forest is very close - <span>Ulyanovsk Forest Park, a</span> wonderful place for walking.  Already now, reviews about Luchi LCD are being written mostly positive: the place seems ideal for even the largest family to live, everything in this <span>residential complex is</span> thought out to the smallest detail, both adults and children will be surrounded only by comfort, and the most cherished wishes will be fulfilled.  Residential buildings are being built simultaneously with a ramified powerful infrastructure: a shopping and entertainment center, four kindergartens, two schools, and many smaller facilities for all occasions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In many new buildings, they are currently implementing the concept of a yard without cars, and the LCD "Rays" is also grateful for the fact that silence will be ensured, children and adults will always be safe when moving inside the residential complex.  The courtyard is spacious, harmonious, the space is logically and originally filled with pedestrian boulevard, walking areas, children's and sports grounds.  And for cars under each residential building underground parking is planned, there are also small ground platforms for visitors - guest parking.  And for this, too, the creators of the LCD "Rays" reviews do not cease to praise. </p>

    <h2>  Appearance and other benefits </h2><p>  Houses of varying number of storeys with vivid color schemes, architectural diversity will have an extremely interesting, unique look.  I must admit that it could not be otherwise, yet Solntsevo still entered the borders of Moscow back in the eighties of the last century, and this area has always been considered the favorite of the most successful residents of the capital.  That‚Äôs why he settled down slowly and with taste, not forgetting not only the most necessary for a full life, but also a variety of pleasant leisure facilities.  It is surprising that in general there was a place for new construction, - mention the reviews about the Luchi LCD in Solntsevo, - earlier there was a defense enterprise on this place, here we tested domestic helicopters.  And now Muscovites will live! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  LCD "Rays" (customer reviews say that!) Will have almost everything you need on its own territory, there is everything that your heart desires.  On the territory there is a multifunctional complex with beauty salons, pharmacies, shops, in exempted from cars home areas you can perfectly relax with children, play sports, walk dogs on a special platform.  There is even a boulevard leading to the metro station.  And if two schools on the territory of the <span>residential complex are</span> not satisfied with something, then a dozen other schools and gymnasiums, swimming pools, clinics and hospitals, chain supermarkets are within walking distance. </p>

    <h2>  Construction progress </h2><p>  About metropolitan new buildings there are very interesting anonymous studies, including reviews of the "mystery shopper" about the Luch LCD.  It talks about the progress of construction, the materials used, and the project as a whole.  It is still impossible to say that the construction has reached the home stretch, but the prerequisites for the completion of the complex on time, that is, at the end of 2020, are quite real. </p><p>  <em>Construction progress:</em> </p><ul><li>  residential building No. 2 - installation completed; </li><li>  building number 1 - the frame is ready, the last floors are being built; </li><li>  No. 5 and No. 6 - insulation and decoration of facades.  These enclosures will be commissioned at the end of 2017. </li></ul><p>  Positive feedback has been received from future residents about the Rays residential complex (Moscow).  People are eager to move into their new apartments. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The former owner of these territories, the NGO ‚ÄúRise‚Äù, had a plot of 35 and a half hectares.  All this area will now belong to the LCD "Rays" (Solntsevo). </p><h2>  Customer reviews </h2>

    <p>  Much has been written about the natural environment: about the Troparevsky landscape reserve, which is located very close, about the <span>Bakovsky Forest Park.</span>  It is also mentioned that there are three schools within walking distance, among which one is the strongest, and even one is a gymnasium known for the quality of education.  The pool and cinema also add pleasant anticipations, which are reflected in the reviews.  And, of course, many buyers worry: ‚ÄúWill it really be as good as promised? And will it all be built on time? </p><p>  There is good transport accessibility even in the absence of the metro: near Borovskoye and Kievskoye shosse, MKAD interchange three kilometers away, the platform of the Novo-Peredelkino railway is much closer, where trains run to the center every ten minutes.  You can read about the LCD "Rays" (Solntsevo) expert reviews, who also note a good infrastructure development.  However, they do not pass by the fact that the complex is presented as a comfort class, which can hardly be combined with panel building, and the building here is really panel. </p>

    <h2>  Details </h2><p>  In plus reviews of buyers of apartments LCD "Rays" put the fact that the territory will be isolated and protected, with a good fire safety system.  It is also noted that the elevators will be silent (all - imported).  This is definitely comfort.  Pleases buyers and the financial side of the issue.  Of course, the apartments here are expensive, as in all Moscow new buildings, but there are different payment options, discounts, installments, mortgages. </p><p>  In total there will be nine residential buildings with parallel infrastructure, with six construction queues.  Buildings of different heights - from six to twenty-five floors (series "Europe").  One house is supposed to be a business class, the rest is comfort.  Two kindergartens will be built into residential buildings, two separately.  Construction is ongoing in parallel.  The first stage, including a school for 825 places and a kindergarten for 150, will appear in 2018.  These are two buildings - the fifth and sixth, for a total of 1789 apartments. </p><h2>  Flats </h2><p>  In total, about seven thousand apartments (825,000 square meters) from one-room to four-room (from 34 to 99 square meters, respectively) with ceilings from 2.6 to 2.75 meters high are presented for sale in the residential complex.  The apartments will be unfinished, only floor screed (ten centimeters), two-chamber double-glazed windows of PVC windows, panel radiators with temperature regulators (PRADO) and something else.  The loggias will also be glazed.  In addition, for the installation of air conditioners on the facades there will be niches for outdoor units. </p><p>  But on the stairs and in the halls the decoration is supposed to be designer: the walls with decorative plaster, tiled with tiles and panels, the floors are decorated with granite and stone, and the ceilings are suspended (Armstrong).  There will be no housing on the ground floors, only built-in commercial premises for trade, services, kindergartens and the like.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthese premises is 36176 square meters.  The elevators in each section will be OTIS 2000 - passenger and freight, from one to three per section. </p>

    <h2>  Developer </h2><p>  LSR Group has been known on the real estate market since 1993, and in different segments of the construction industry.  It is mainly engaged in the extraction of non-metallic minerals, which it turns into building materials at its own enterprises.  This company has many tower cranes - its fleet is the largest in Russia. </p><p>  LSR is engaged in construction in several regions of the country - the Leningrad Region and directly in St. Petersburg, Moscow and the region, in the Ural region and Yekaterinburg.  It was LSR that implemented the famous project in Balashikha (Sacramento), as well as the Novoye Nakhabino microdistrict (Novorizhskoye Shosse), and both residential complexes were completed on time (the latter, however, is not without complaints). </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  LCD ‚ÄúRays‚Äù in advantages, of course, has underground floors with parking lots and storerooms, as well as through entrances, from which you can easily access both the courtyard and the street.  It is also good that there are no stairs and ramps, all entrances are made at ground level.  In the halls there is a place for concierges and rooms for prams.  The disadvantage of the first building: the eight-story building will be with a single elevator, though a freight one. </p><p>  Much more excitement is caused by the fact that the constructed school may not open on September 1, 2018, when the first stages of construction are completed and the residents are already moving in.  It is not a fact that this educational institution will have time to recruit teachers and prepare for the new school year.  School on the city balance, that is, there will be no additional expenses for the education of children living in the Rays residential complex (this is a plus). </p><h2>  First of all </h2><p>  In the fifth building there are twelve sections from seven to nineteen floors.  There are thirteen entrances in the sixth building, the number of storeys from nine to nineteen.  Both buildings are of the first turn for delivery, and they are located in the very center of the complex.  Their windows do not open onto the carriageway, and beautiful views open from the upper floors.  The buildings of the first and second - second stage - are located directly on the street of Production, located along it. </p><p>  It is necessary to dwell in more detail on the features of construction using the Europe technology, which is used in the Rays residential complex.  It was developed in Western Europe, and in our country it was first used by LSR in 2000.  A feature of the technology is that the facade consists of single-layer panels sealed with a layer of plaster with insulation.  This means that the absence of panel seams should increase thermal insulation. </p>

    <h2>  Interior and exterior finish </h2><p>  The finish is very good, made on the principle of "wet facade" (the name comes from the method of application: on top of the insulation - reinforcing adhesive solution, then the primer, and on it the final layer is a rough decorative plaster).  Apartments, as already mentioned, are transferred to buyers without a fine finish, which for sure can be ordered separately (the cost is about six thousand rubles per square meter). </p><p>  This price guarded the "mystery shopper" very much, since it seemed extremely small.  The simplest finish in previous reviews was presented from twelve thousand rubles (Krasnogorsky microdistrict), for seven thousand they usually make only a rough finish.  Apparently, the point is in the materials that the developer takes at his own production. </p><h2>  Prices </h2><p>  For a long time there were no free apartments in the buildings of the first stage.  Now they are selling (and very actively) housing in the first and second buildings, the completion of which you need to wait a year and a half.  The apartments in the third stage have already entered the market, but the prices are not yet in the public domain, they can be found on request by contacting the sales office. </p><p>  Of course, now the prices in these houses are much lower than in buildings No. 1 and No. 2 (second stage).  For example, a nine-room apartment (87 square meters) in second-line houses will cost nine million, and the same in the third stage for this money is offered fully finished. </p>
