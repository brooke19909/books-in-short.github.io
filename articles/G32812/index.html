Two resorts of the country - both Hurghada and Sharm el-Sheikh - compete among themselves in attracting vacationers.  Over the past twenty years, these cities have turned into a multi-kilometer chain of beaches, built up with luxurious and affordable hotels.  They tirelessly "grow" with new resort villages.  Today we present for those who have already visited this wonderful country, and for those who are planning to come to Egypt for the first time, the Tropitel Naama Bay Hotel.  The photos of this green oasis among the sultry <span>Sinai desert are</span> simply impressive.  But what is the reality?  What is a hotel like?  Its pros and cons will be discussed below.  For analysis, we took not only official information about the hotel, but also studied the reviews of travelers staying in it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tripitel naama bay hotel 5" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/480453.jpg" width="488"></div>

    <h2>  Sharm el Sheikh - the pearl of the Sinai Peninsula </h2><p>  This resort is located right on the Red Sea coast, away from the main part of Egypt.  This is not Africa, but the <span>Sinai Peninsula of</span> Asia.  <span>Sharm el-Sheikh (Sharm-el-Sheikh)</span> is famous for its unique microclimate, which makes winter holidays possible.  Mountains close the resort from the cold winds from the north, one of which, Mount Moses, is a shrine for believers of the three world religions. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Nature endowed the coast of Sharm el-Sheikh with unimaginable beauty wealth - coral reefs, so the northern coast of the Red Sea is considered a mecca for divers.  And those who do not know how to dive, can also see the colorful inhabitants of the reefs.  In some places, corals and tropical fish can be found near the coast and get to them by swimming with a snorkel and mask.  If you compare with other places of recreation, for example, with the same Hurghada, then Sharm el-Sheikh is considered a youth resort.  It is always noisy here, there are a lot of discos, bars and night clubs in the city. </p><h2>  Where is the hotel located and how to get to it </h2><p>  Our hotel in the ranking of Hotels Sharm el Sheikh 5 * takes the middle place.  However, this is one of the favorite resort complexes for our compatriots.  The hotel is located in the resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSharm El Sheikh, namely in the bay and Naama Bay.  This location gave the name to the hotel.  Until May 2011, it was simply called Naama Bay.  The hotel is about fifteen kilometers from Sharm El Sheikh Airport.  If you take a tour to Egypt, then, most likely, a transfer to the hotel is included in the price.  You will be met at the airport, and in fifteen minutes you will be there.  If you are an avid independent traveler, then having bought a ticket for a regular flight ‚ÄúMoscow-Sharm-El-Sheikh‚Äù (costing from twenty one and a half thousand rubles) or getting hooked on a charter (a little more than sixteen thousand), you will need to take a taxi to hotel.  The distance is small, so the trip will not ruin the tourist.  The Old Town is only seven kilometers from the hotel.  In addition to taxis you can use the services of minibuses. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  General description of the hotel </h2><p>  For lovers of chain hotels, we inform that the institution belongs to the leading line of Tropitel Hotels &amp; Resorts, which has many hotels around the world.  Tropitel Naama Bay was built in 2002.  In fact, this is a large hotel complex, a real small town for a paradise holiday.  Its territory is so large that special electric cars ply on it, spreading lazy guests from restaurants or the main building to remote bungalows.  If someone does not want to walk around the territory, he can ride on it.  Officially, the hotel complex is divided into two zones: the main building (pools and other infrastructure near the main building) and the Resort (park area with bungalows). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tropitel naama bay 5 charm" class="if" height="189" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/480471.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Who is the hotel for? </h2><p>  Tourists interpret the concept of ‚Äúgood rest‚Äù in different ways.  Give someone discos and incendiary parties, and some like peace and quiet.  Tropitel <span>Naama Bay</span> 5 *, the photo of which gives an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãits vast territory, allows you to enjoy a vacation for all categories of tourists.  If you want to be in the center of all events, ask to settle you in the main building.  Everything will be at hand - restaurants, bars, entertainment centers, swimming pools and a spa area.  If you appreciate the peace and quiet, you should stay in one of the many villas (bungalows). </p><p>  The territory of the complex is divided into zones.  Experienced tourists recommend asking at the reception when checking in numbers from 601 to 700. This is the sixth zone.  She is the quietest, here you can not hear loud music and disco noise.  True, it is far from her to the main building and restaurants. </p><p>  The hotel pays special attention to family vacations.  On the territory there is a children's pool and animation for the youngest guests.  The opportunity to entertain kids is very popular with tourists who want to stay in seclusion for a while. </p><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  If you look at the Tropitel Naama Bay 5 * hotel from a bird's eye view, you can see that it resembles a flower.  In the middle is the main five-story building, made in an interesting architectural solution.  And around, like petals near the core, there are two-story bungalows.  The entire territory of the complex is very well-groomed, landscaped.  A private sandy beach with a pontoon runs through the promenade.  This hotel is located on the second line from the sea.  Hotel buildings are located 200-800 meters from it.  And again, if you want to be as close to the sea as possible - ask for a bungalow (seventh zone).  But, on the other hand, the main building is the epicenter of all the events that take place in Naama Bay.  If you get tired of stomping from a restaurant to your bungalow, remember - there are free electric cars. </p>
