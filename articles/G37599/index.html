That was the name of the lame-footed ‚Äútrue Aryan‚Äù, the brilliant manipulator of the mass consciousness, <span>Joseph Goebbels.</span>  This man left a bloody mark on history. </p><h2>  Childhood </h2><p>  Joseph was born in the family of an accountant on October 29, 1897.  Infant, he fell ill with polio and remained lame for life.  The disease also distorted the features of his face.  At school, children were reluctant to communicate with Joseph.  Due to the fact that one of his legs was shorter than the other, he could not run and jump with them like ordinary boys.  Hitler's future right hand gained authority with his mind.  He became the best student of the gymnasium.  In addition, no one dared to tease him, he immediately complained to the teachers and school leaders. </p><h2>  Failed writer </h2><p>  Goebbels was a very organized person.  He strove to be always the first, dreamed of fame and worked hard on it.  He could do many things at the same time, it is significant that he attended lectures at eight universities at the same time and traveled to them in different parts of the city.  It was important for him to have connections with high-ranking people, he could process tons of information.  In 1921 he defended his thesis, and a year later became a doctor of philosophical sciences. </p>

    <p>  He dreamed of becoming a famous writer.  He created works in different genres, but publishers did not accept them.  The only one who appreciated his creations was Maxim Gorky.  He saw in them Bolshevik ideas.  In the end, from the world of literature, he went into politics.  Goebbels did not yet know that he was Hitler's future right hand.  The name of the lame author-loser will thunder throughout the world. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  In the political arena </h2><p>  Joseph Goebbels came into politics in 1922.  He joined the NSDAP.  It was a huge breakthrough and a new life.  His career began with the fact that during the split of the party, he announced that he wanted to expel Hitler from it.  He explained this by the fact that the petty bourgeois had no place in the Nazi party.  Later, he and Adolf, having met closer, became close friends and associates. </p><h2>  The genius of rhetoric </h2><p>  He could speak beautifully and convince people.  His speeches were vibrant, and patience boundless.  He did not leave the rostrum, even when Communist workers threw beer mugs at him.  He managed to convince any negatively minded crowd to take his side.  Hitler appreciated Goebbels and realized that he was an indispensable manipulator. </p><h2>  Impresario Genius </h2><p>  Goebbels practically created Hitler.  He created for him the image of the infallible and strongly supported him.  Not a single person from Adolf‚Äôs entourage has done as much as Hitler‚Äôs right hand - Goebbels - for fascist Germany.  However, he preferred to remain in the shade. </p>

    <h2>  Goebbels love and family </h2><p>  In 1931, Joseph Goebbels married Magda Quandt.  Hitler was following him for him.  Magda was a widow and a real beauty.  Their family has become exemplary.  She bore him six children.  All this was ostentatious, as Goebbels soon gained the fame of the lame Casanova.  Joseph did not miss a single skirt.  He especially liked the young actresses.  They quickly became disillusioned with Goebbels's narcissistic sadist, but it was not easy to get away from him. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Magda was also not a saint.  It was rumored that she had many connections on the side, both with men and women.  It is likely that not all of her children were from Joseph. </p>

    <h2>  War </h2><p>  Paradoxical as it may seem, Goebbels was against a big war.  He even insisted on making peace with Stalin and, like Hitler's right hand, tried to convince him that it was worth making concessions. </p><p>  The figure of Joseph Goebbels came to the fore when German troops began to suffer huge losses.  In 1943, he delivered a grandiose speech at the Berlin Sports Palace, in which he urged not to give up at all costs.  Thanks to his oratory, the loyal ally and right hand of Adolf Hitler was able to raise the morale of the soldiers and the population.  In 1944, Joseph was able to prevent a conspiracy against the German Chancellor, and this once again proved his deep affection for him. </p>

    <p>  Adolf Hitler committed suicide on April 30, 1945.  Joseph got the opportunity to become chancellor of Germany, but he did not see the point without his Fuhrer.  Goebbels - Hitler's right hand, without Adolf - he is nothing.  The Russian soldiers were already advancing, and he took a desperate step - first he poured poison on the children, then Magda took him, and Joseph himself shot himself in the head.  The bodies of the whole family, on the preliminary order of Goebbels, were burned. </p>
