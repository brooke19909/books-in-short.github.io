This is a narrow sandy strip stretching into the sea for five kilometers.  The spit, on which the port of Posyet is located, divides two bays: Pallas and Expeditions. </p><p>  It is especially good here in the summer.  The sea is clean, without vegetation, with sandy beaches and gentle sloping into the water.  Snakeheads and crucians are found in nearby ponds, and lotus blooms on the lakes. </p>
