    <p>  The organization provides the necessary standard of living for citizens.  An FIU is an institution that pays benefits to people.  For some reason they cannot support themselves.  Not many people are interested in what the organization consists of.  But, having become acquainted with the basic principles of work, you can understand how the distribution of funds is carried out. </p><h2>  Work principles </h2><p>  <span>The Pension Fund of the Russian</span> Federation is presented in the form of an organization that provides financial support to people in the social category.  Young people starting work should also list contributions. </p><p>  And older people, because they can‚Äôt continue to work, receive a certain amount for life.  FIU is an eternal cycle that has its own principles of work.  This structure has a leader and employees. </p><h2>  Insurance premiums </h2><p>  <span>The Pension Fund of the Russian Federation</span> works thanks to national payments, which are considered its income.  This serves as the basis for opening a large number of branches.  An important place is occupied by special contributions and taxes.  Their size is approved by law. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Benefits are considered the largest expenses.  This amount is so large that the management of the organization often raises the question of where to get the money.  The main income is insurance premiums.  Every month, employers transfer specific amounts determined from wages. </p><p>  A FIU is an organization that still collects payments, even if they are not paid voluntarily.  In these cases, interest is also charged on 1 day delay.  If the payer's property was leased on the basis of a court decision or financial transactions were suspended, the Pension Fund only then submits a request for the transfer of money.  Penalty for this time is not recoverable. </p><h2>  Types of Contributions </h2><p>  Many enterprises pay 22% of the salary to the fund.  Some employees translate 8%, for example, by scientists and IT organizations. </p><p>  Agricultural producers list 21%.  Enterprises paying general contributions (22%) pay an additional 10% to the PRF budget. </p><h2>  Work with information </h2><p>  The Pension Fund carries out <span>personified accounting of</span> working citizens of the country.  According to the reform of 2002, each employee should have his own savings account.  It includes an amount of 16% of 22% transferred by employers.  The remaining 6% fall into the ‚Äúcommon piggy bank‚Äù. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Pensions </h2><p>  When the retirement age arrives, a citizen must contact the territorial branch of the RF PF.  The employees will calculate based on the amount of contributions that are on your personal account.  Surcharges approved by the state are also taken into account. </p><p>  Since money has been accumulating for many years, a correction is made for the level of depreciation.  The result is the amount of the pension of a particular citizen.  Then a pension document and payment instructions for the payment of funds are created. </p>

    <p>  The Pension Fund periodically runs various programs.  One of them is co-financing.  It has been operating for 10 years.  Citizens are encouraged to independently invest 12,000 rubles in their funded pension.  The same amount is added by the state.  For 10 years, it turns out to raise 240,000 rubles, and increase the funded part by 1,111 rubles.  Other types of programs can operate, you just need to participate in them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Other types of work </h2><p>  The main objective of the fund is to pay payments to citizens who are entitled to it on the basis of current legislation.  In addition, the institution works with issues of providing maternity capital. </p><p>  A decrease in the birth rate leads to a decrease in the number of working-age population, and this becomes the reason for the insufficient filling of the RF PF.  This is due to citizens receiving informal salaries.  Because of this, the state increases the insurance premiums of enterprises. </p><h2>  What does FIU mean for older people? </h2><p>  How should the Pension Fund of Russia work?  The FIU is considered an independent organization.  The institution must transfer insurance premiums, finance people who need social protection.  His duty is to collect money from citizens guilty of causing harm to colleagues and other people in the country. </p>

    <p>  When a person is injured, because of which he cannot work, the fund must pay a pension.  In addition, employees of the FIU must control the timely receipt of insurance premiums, as well as their competent expenditure. </p><h2>  Types of payments </h2><p>  The Russian Pension Fund funds are used to pay pensions that serve as compensation for salaries to people who cannot work.  In our country, there are several options for such payments. </p><p>  A labor pension is granted to women from 55 years old, and to men from 60 years old. A pension is accrued if the length of service is 5 years.  The FIU also provides disability and survivor pensions. </p><h2>  Structure </h2><p>  The main department of the fund is the Board.  It includes the main functional body - the Executive Directorate.  The latter performs work with the rest of the departments that are in the country.  They also include administrative-territorial and state formations.  They are located in areas. </p><p>  The Office of the Russian Pension Fund consists of urban and regional structures.  They collect insurance money, work on regional programs, and monitor funds.  They are the ones who interact with citizens.  In addition to the RF PF, the Ministry of Communications and Labor is working on pension issues.  The organization performs the appointment, redistribution and delivery of funds for payments. </p><p>  The Board is responsible for generating reports on tasks, budget, and expenses.  It acts on the basis of legislation, as well as the adopted budget.  The head of the FIU is Anton Drozdov.  He is recognized as an honored worker of the Russian Federation. </p><h2>  Foundation Issues </h2><p>  Due to the 2008 crisis, the fund stopped some payments.  To eliminate such problems, some measures began to be used.  Although it turned out to make up for the lack of funds, in 2009 the same problem appeared.  In 2010-2011  the same thing was observed. </p>

    <p>  Each branch of the Russian Pension Fund worked to overcome the crisis.  As the number of people who need to pay benefits increases, the imbalance in the work of the organization‚Äôs branches causes the situation to worsen. </p><p>  To neutralize problems, the state increases the amount of funds that are transferred to the FIU.  Strengthened work with tax and collection services.  Since 2010, insurance principles have been in force for the payment of social funds.  Instead of a single tax, special payments began to be paid.  This allowed to restore the work of the fund, improve efficiency. </p><h2>  The role of pension reform </h2><p>  Today in Russia there is a funded type pension system.  With its help, it will be possible to regulate the accumulated money, which will be issued to people in old age.  The amount of payments is determined by the time the person worked, whether the employer transferred payments.  Thanks to this, the expense of the organization is reduced. </p><p>  Funds transferred by the employer do not currently receive pension benefits.  Money accumulates, and when a pensioner does not have the opportunity to work, he will be paid a allowance in the prescribed amount. </p><p>  The storage system is more convenient than the distribution system.  The reason for this is that pension funds are recognized as property of a person, not the state.  This principle increases system reliability.  Thanks to the funded principle, the economy is normal, which is an important task for the FIU. </p><h2>  Moscow FIU Directorate </h2><p>  In each subject of the Russian Federation there is a territorial FIU.  For any questions, citizens should contact the organization at the place of residence.  The management of the FIU in Moscow is not one, each of the institutions helps residents of the capital and the region to solve all emerging issues. </p>

The work schedule is set as follows: </p><ul><li>  9:00 - 17:45 daily, except Friday; </li><li>  break: 12.30 - 13.00. </li></ul><p>  In addition to the main institution, there are other Moscow branches of the FIU, open to the reception of citizens.  As can be seen, the structure of the FIU is not so complex.  What is important in the organization‚Äôs work is how honestly citizens pay their dues.  If there is a <span>white salary,</span> then the funds are transferred to the country's budget regularly.  It must be remembered that the fund works to protect the interests of citizens of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  In addition to state funds, there are now non-state funds.  Each of them offers its own programs.  Before you join any, you must familiarize yourself with the conditions.  Funds operate on the basis of contracts. </p>
