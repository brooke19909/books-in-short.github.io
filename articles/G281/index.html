There are many options.  The flower arch can be installed in any of the garden areas.  Increasingly, designers and landscape designers use trees for this purpose.  It is both practical and effective.  The arches located at the entrances to the house, to the courtyard, to the arbor are quite interesting.  Very original tunnels (alleys) of flowers.  This will require several arches in a row.

    <h2>  About landscape design </h2><p>  Of course, there are certain rules.  If, for example, you want to install several arches at once, having built a shady alley, select structures of the same shape.  And so that they are in harmony with the structures standing nearby.  You can arrange them in a row, and enfilade.  It is better if there are seven arches - this is the ideal amount for flower tunnels.  It is believed that walks under such a vault are favorably reflected in the spiritual and even physical condition.  However, a single support, all entwined with flowers, will be incredibly attractive. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When designing a site, do not forget that you complement the already created style.  Try not to disturb it, because you need comfort, not elusive discomfort. </p>

    <h2>  Materials and installation </h2><p>  How to make an arch of flowers?  What materials are better?  Which place to choose?  Which is better - an arch for flowers made by oneself, or purchased designs? </p><p>  We will give only a few tips, and leave the choice for you - give the opportunity for imagination to roam to the fullest. </p><p>  So, a wooden arch for <span>flowers (</span> it‚Äôs easiest to do it yourself) is usually small and often seems angular.  This is a traditional design.  If you need a rustic, simple style, you can even use simple pillars.  Arches made of thin boards, several times covered with paint or ordinary stain, will fit into the modern design.  This also applies to smart metal products.  In gardens decorated in the style of "a la Japan", thick bamboo, timber, stones are more appropriate. </p><p>  Variants of arched supports can be either stationary (permanent) or seasonal.  The convenience of small structures is in lightness.  By the way, wedding arches from flowers are most often made just with the help of seasonal light designs.  However, one should pay attention to the fasteners - lightweight constructions easily overturn by a gust of wind.  The arch itself should also be strong enough, since the weight of the plants can be quite impressive.  To enhance strength and stability, it is better to fill the foundation. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

It is not advisable to make them below 2.2 m and already 1.2.  The fact is that such structures simply will not look, and even uncomfortable in principle.  Inside you can put sculptures, benches, small flower pots.

    <p>  DIY flower arch is the perfect solution.  This will emphasize individuality, which is especially important for those who do not like to repeat themselves.  If you have experience in the carpentry, or you are "friends" with metal, then, of course, it is much cheaper to make an arch yourself.  Many people prefer to buy ready-made designs, or make them to order, specifying shapes, sizes and other details in advance. </p><h2>  Choose plants </h2><p>  What is the best way to design a flower arch?  The traditional technique is vertical gardening.  <span>Curly flowers,</span> rising along the supports, create real green rooms over time.  Wisteria, five akebia, ‚Äúwild‚Äù grapes, honeysuckle, <span>round-leaved pliers,</span> silver scindapus, and clematis (hybrids of vine leaves, Tangut, violet) are quite suitable here.  Annuals are growing faster.  In areas light and warm enough at the arches, you can plant pumpkin, morning glory, bindweed, nasturtium, beans.  <span>Vines</span> look very noble (for example, <span>tekoma (campsis),</span> wisteria, honeysuckle).  The most tangible sweet aroma of these plants with the onset of sunset.  Even the fruits of plants look beautiful, some of which are also useful (actinidia, lemongrass).  An interesting accent will be the seeds of clematis.  <span>Curly roses</span> just look gorgeous <span>.</span>  These are real <span>wedding arches</span> from flowers.  They grow to three or more meters.  The arch turns out to be the most beautiful if you plant roses on both sides.  You can experiment with color (for example, red and white).  After a couple of years, the bushes intertwine and will look like one. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make an arch of flowers" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4431/442388.jpg" width="589"></div>

    <h2>  And a few tips in the end ... </h2><p>  Honeysuckle with grapes are planted only in the fed land.  For the winter, they must be removed from the arches and take cover (spruce spruce, peat will do).  They need to be protected not so much from frost as from overmoistening. </p><p>  If you plan to plant actinidia, do not place a flower arch at the apple trees. </p><p>  Protect hops from leaf beetle (periodically spray with wormwood infusion). </p><p>  If the place is too shady, opt for lemongrass, wood pliers, ivy, kirkazone - they are less picky. </p>
