A thousand years ago, the capital of the country was moved here, the emperor‚Äôs residence was here, and skillful hands of creative people were required to equip a prosperous settlement.  The most famous architects and artists worked in the main city of the state; famous figures of Japan chose it as their permanent residence.  For more than a hundred centuries, until the capital was moved to Tokyo, the city of Kyoto was the center of the country's cultural and political life. </p><p>  The prefecture, which includes 6 counties and 15 settlements, stretches for 4.6 thousand km <sup>2</sup> , and the population exceeds 2.5 million people.  The northernmost point of the administrative unit is the Tango Peninsula overlooking the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãJapan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kyoto Prefecture Description" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1559361.jpg" width="600"></div>
