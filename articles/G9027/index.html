    <h2>  Ruler‚Äôs childhood </h2><p>  Charles 6 was born on December 3, 1368 in Paris.  His parents, <span>Charles V the</span> Wise and Jeanne de Bourbon, are both direct descendants of Carl Valois.  The future king became the fifth child in a row, and the third boy in the family.  However, by the time of the coronation, Karl's two older brothers had died of illness.  And not the last tragedy that contains his biography. </p><p>  Charles <span>VI the</span> Mad lost almost all of his consanguineous relatives.  His mother, Jeanne, died in childbirth in 1378.  Two years later, the incumbent king of France, Charles <span>V,</span> also died in his bed.  Thus, on November 3, 1380, a 12-year-old boy ascended the throne, who later acquired the nickname "Beloved." </p>

    <h2>  Regent Self-Government </h2><p>  Given the young age of the king, it was necessary to choose a regent who could rule the country until he came of age.  A serious fight immediately unleashed for this post.  Fortunately, it didn‚Äôt come to the Civil War: the parties were able to agree that the brother of the previous ruler, Louis <span>I of</span> Anjou, would take the place of regent. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, the main power still remained with the Great Council.  It consisted of 50 people who represented the most successful families in France.  The army remained under the command of the main connable Olivier de Clisson.  In addition to everything, part of the power at the court passed into the hands of Jean Berry and Philip the Bold - maternal uncle Charles VI. </p><p>  Such a division led to the fact that each side wanted to snatch a bigger piece for itself.  Nobody thought about the country, each stuffed only his own pockets.  Soon the treasury was empty and the government had to raise taxes.  As a result, Paris overwhelmed a series of uprisings.  All of them were suppressed by force, which led to even greater discontent from ordinary citizens. </p><p>  The foreign policy of the regents turned out to be just as failed.  Acting alone, the king's uncles fought multiple wars on all fronts.  The only trophies obtained in these battles were the satisfied ambitions of the rulers.  As for France itself, it acquired absolutely nothing, except for exorbitant accounts for the maintenance of troops. </p>

    <h2>  Charles VI - King of France </h2><p>  Karl the Beloved began to delve into politics closer to 17 years.  He acquired such a colorful title due to his appearance.  In one of the chronicles, the historian describes the king like this: ‚ÄúThe young ruler has turned into the most handsome man in the kingdom: he is tall, strong, has a penetrating look and lush blond hair.‚Äù  It was rumored that Charles 6 could easily bend the horseshoe with his bare hands.  And also he skillfully handled a bow and liked to go hunting on weekends. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But with the formation of the ruler there were obvious problems.  The thing is that the regents did not try to raise a wise king in him.  On the contrary, they sought to lull his vigilance with magnificent feasts and entertainments.  But do not assume that Charles 6 grew up arrogant ignoramus, unaware of the elementary norms of decency.  No, contemporaries described him as a kind and polite king.  However, his unwillingness to rule the country and his complete dependence on uncles had a rather bad effect on medieval France. </p>

    <h2>  Calm time </h2><p>  Only in 20 years, Charles 6 took control of the country.  At least, he thought so, but in fact the power simply passed to others.  Instead of the regents, who were kicked out of the council, they introduced political problems to the court party of the marmusets.  For the most part, these were advisers to the previous king, who remained out of work for the past 8 years. </p><p>  The result of their reign was a slight economic recovery.  This was due to the fact that the marmusets dispersed the old corrupt officials, who for a long time devastated the state treasury.  True, in their place new ‚Äúleeches‚Äù quickly appeared, which just as godlessly continued to drink all the juices from the people. </p><p>  Therefore, despite all efforts, the party was unable to alleviate the situation in which Charles 6. found itself. France was still in a deplorable state, and the absence of a strong leader only aggravated this situation.  The board of the marmusets lasted only 4 years (from 1388 to 1392), after which the uncles of the king returned to power. </p><h2>  Captured by Madness </h2><p>  The attacks of insanity in Charles 6 began to appear after he had had a severe fever in the spring of 1392.  At first, symptoms were quite rare, and then, their severity was insignificant.  For example, Charles 6 could become abruptly irritable or allow himself to behave inappropriately in humans. </p><p>  But then madness completely swallowed him.  In moments of dementia, he became uncontrollable: he behaved like a six-year-old child, then with uncontrollable aggression attacked others.  Once the king even threw a blade at his soldiers, while killing several poor fellows. </p><p>  As a result, Charles <span data-mce-mark="1">VI</span> removed himself from power.  When his mind was clean, he led a quiet social life, and when he was again seized with seizures, he closed in his room.  Curiously, the only person who could rule the king in moments of insanity was his maid Odette de Chamdiver.  It was she who spent the last 15 years of his detached life with Karl, being his friend, doctor and lover. </p>

    <h2>  The death of the king and the consequences of his reign </h2><p>  This ruler has a rather sad biography.  Charles VI the Mad spent 42 years on the throne.  At the same time, for 30 years he was imprisoned in dementia, which did not allow him to take control of the country into his own hands.  Thus, because of him, France had to endure very difficult times. </p><p>  Torn apart by internal strife and arbitrariness, she plunged into the abyss of uprisings, civil wars and internecine battles.  By the time of the death of Charles <span>VI</span> in 1422, the country was divided into counties, which actually became independent states.  And people, exhausted by taxes and wars, only dreamed that a new, strong and independent king would come to them. </p>
