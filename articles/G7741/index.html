But the fashion for shovel-like phones was never able to kill the tablet segment.  Moreover, these gadgets are found in all categories of users: students, office workers, housewives, teachers and others. </p><p>  Most 10-inch models are seen as an alternative to a laptop.  If you need a device for surfing the net, viewing content, listening to music and games, then the tablet in this case will be a more practical solution: inexpensive, convenient and even more mobile. </p><p>  Among our compatriots, models from the segment up to 10 thousand rubles are especially popular.  The Prestigio Grace 3101 4G tablet just fits into this framework.  The Prestigio brand has been supplying the Russian market with good equipment for a long time and has earned the respect of domestic consumers.  We will see what model 3101 of the Grace series can offer. </p><p>  So, we offer you a review of the Prestigio Grace 3101 4G.  Consider the key characteristics of the gadget, its pros and cons, as well as the appropriateness of the acquisition.  Also take into account the reviews of the owners of the device. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  With its dimensions - 242 x 171 x 9.9 mm - the tablet has a weight of 545 grams.  Judging by the reviews of the Prestigio Grace 3101 4G, the gadget is convenient to use, especially when it comes to provisions on the table and knees.  Because how to keep a half-kilogram unit on weight is still quite tiring. </p><div class="photo" data-original="technosova.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet prestigio grace 3101 4g" class="if uuid-3160676" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3160676.jpg"></div><p>  The case of the device turned out to be quite thin, with rounded corners.  The back cover has a matte finish and a texture of small dots.  Thanks to this decision, the gadget does not strive to slip out of hands.  In addition, the surface itself is easily cleaned from dust, dirt and fingerprints. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The front of the tablet is completely covered with a protective glass.  Also around the perimeter is a border that slightly goes beyond the screen level.  This allows you to protect the surface from scratches when the device lies face down.  The frames around the screen can not be called neither large nor small.  They do not interfere with the work, but at the same time exclude accidental clicks on the sensor with thumbs in a horizontal orientation. </p><p>  Reviews about Prestigio Grace 3101 4G on this part are entirely positive.  The device as a whole is convenient, cute, the glass does not scratch, and the case itself does not creak and does not play.  Naturally, serious physical effects on the structure are best avoided.  Nevertheless, many believe that the case for the Prestigio Grace 3101 4G is not needed. </p><h2>  Interfaces </h2><p>  On the front of the gadget is a peephole of the front camera and barely distinguishable sensors.  Only the brand logo is located under the screen.  On the right side there is a rocker for volume control and a power button. </p><div class="photo" data-original="m.onlinetrade.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="prestigio grace 3101 4g specifications" class="if uuid-3160678" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3160678.jpg"></div><p>  On the upper edge, you can see the peephole of the rear camera with a flash, a micro-USB interface for charging the device and synchronizing with a PC, as well as a classic 3.5 mm mini-jack for a headset.  In the same area there is a cover where two SIM card slots and a place for an external SD-type media are located. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Judging by the reviews of the Prestigio Grace 3101 4G, the location of the interfaces on the tablet is quite comfortable, especially if you prefer to work with the device in a horizontal orientation.  The removable cover sits securely in the grooves where accidental departures are completely eliminated. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  In this regard, the characteristics of the Prestigio Grace 3101 4G are pleasing.  The tablet received an explanatory matrix of the S-IPS class, which quietly copes with a resolution of 1280 by 800 pixels.  Such a layout for a 10-inch gadget is enough with the head.  Even if you look closely, pixelation is difficult to detect. </p><div class="photo" data-original="otzovik.com" data-author=": , "><img itemprop="image" alt="prestigio grace 3101 4g review" class="if uuid-3160679" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3160679.jpg"></div><p>  The supply of brightness and contrast is quite decent and on a nice sunny day the screen behaves quite adequately.  But still, users in their reviews of the Prestigio Grace 3101 4G sometimes complain about the display.  In direct sunlight, the tablet acts as a mirror.  So the ideal option would be to work in the shade or indoors. </p><p>  There are no questions to the sensor.  It recognizes up to five touches and also behaves appropriately - without delays or false positives.  Viewing angles at the maximum level for the IPS-matrix - in the region of 180 degrees.  When you change the angle of color do not rush to the dance, but the picture remains as clear. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The heart of the tablet is the MT8735M quad-core processor from Mediatek, which is paired with the Mali graphics accelerator of the T720 MP2 series.  The RAM of the device is 2 GB and 16 GB internal, which by modern standards can be called the average value.  Moreover, the latter can be expanded up to 64 GB with external SD-carriers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="proshivkis.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="case for prestigio grace 3101 4g" class="if uuid-3160680" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3160680.jpg"></div><p>  Judging by user reviews, there are no questions about the interface.  Tables, icons, widgets and other regular elements are switched, launched and moved without any delays or brakes.  Points on the "Antutu" (photo above) also inspire confidence. </p><p>  Three-in-a-row games, cards, puzzles, and other not-so-demanding software also go without problems.  But serious applications, the device, alas, will not pull.  Modern races, shooters and other programs with the prefix "3D" are launched, but the graphics settings have to be reset to average or minimum values.  But given the price tag of the model, the level of performance can be called quite acceptable. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  Reviews about the cameras are completely negative.  But this is the trouble of all tablets, both in the budget and mid-price segments.  The front camera received a matrix with a resolution of 0.3 megapixels, which is enough to communicate on video messengers.  Your silhouette will be recognized, but wrinkles and pimples can not be discerned. </p><div class="photo" data-original="prestigio.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="prestigio grace 3101 4g camera" class="if uuid-3160708" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3160708.jpg"></div><p>  The main camera has 2 megapixels, which is also very small for normal shooting.  With excellent lighting and in good weather, you can make more or less high-quality.  In other cases, it is better not to turn on the camera at all. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The battery in the tablet is quite capacious - 6000 mAh.  Despite the gluttony of the Android platform, the battery life of the gadget is at a decent level compared to other competing devices. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.datagate.ee" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet battery" class="if uuid-3160677" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3160677.jpg"></div><p>  When watching a high-resolution video with a maximum brightness of the battery screen, about 8 hours are enough. In mixed mode - the Internet, music, rare games - the battery sits in a small day. </p><p>  If you use the device as an e-book and a music player, then the battery charge can be extended for three or more days.  Users, judging by the reviews, are satisfied with the level of autonomy of the gadget, especially considering the fact that premium devices with a powerful set of chipsets cannot offer this. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Consumers are generally happy with the tablet.  He fulfills his value at 100%.  Here we have good build quality, nice appearance, excellent ergonomic performance, a relatively quick "stuffing", a normal screen and a long battery life.  A set of such qualities is a rare thing in the gadget segment up to 10 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Of course, the tablet also has its shortcomings like cameras, the lack of an HDMI interface and mediocre sound, but you can put up with them and the price of the device.  So the model can be recommended to all those who need an inexpensive, but at the same time high-quality equipment. </p>
