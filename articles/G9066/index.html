To prevent this, many drivers use different means.  The most popular of them have recently become <span>discharge lamps.</span>  They are devices based on the use of <span>inert gas.</span>  Such lamps are usually divided into two types - xenon and bi-xenon.  This article will discuss how xenon differs from bi-xenon.  It should be noted that both one and the other device can improve visibility several times. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is the difference between xenon and bi-xenon" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/354631.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Such technologies are now used as standard on many executive cars.  Bixenon and xenon lamps (the difference between them is described below) provide very high-quality lighting of the track.  Familiar <span>halogen lamps</span> in this indicator lag behind very significantly.  Another advantage of discharge lamps can be called the fact that, despite their brightness, they do not blind the eyes of drivers of cars moving in the opposite direction. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Xenon concept </h2><p>  Xenon functions due to inert gas.  From conventional automobile <span>headlights, these</span> lighting devices are distinguished by the absence of a filament.  The main principle of xenon operation is based on the fact that a high voltage passes between a pair of electrodes.  It is it that makes the gas that the lamp is filled with glow.  Radiation is formed at the output, it is constant and does not change its direction.  <span>Xenon headlights are</span> quite economical, because the minimum term for their use is about two years.  As for the necessary voltage pulse for the device, it is created due to the <span>ignition unit.</span>  Compared to standard lamps, the cost of xenon is higher, but this price can be called justified, because the device increases traffic safety. </p>

    <h2>  The concept of bi-xenon </h2><p>  The first thing that distinguishes xenon from bi-xenon is the time of its appearance.  The fact is that Bi-Xenon as a type of discharge lamp was invented a little later.  A mechanism is built into it, the purpose of which is to change the direction of light radiation.  This device is a metal shutter (it is also called a "floating bulb"), the movement of which is due to the action of the magnet.  This allows you to open different areas of coverage.  Switching itself is carried out by cutting off part of the light flux.  As of today, the leading indicators in the list of the best lighting devices belong to this particular type of lamp. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="difference between xenon and bi-xenon" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/354632.jpg?1394994877383" width="600"></div>

Motorists often improve some parts of the car, including lighting.  In this regard, many of them are wondering which is better: bi-xenon or xenon?  Most experts recommend choosing a more modern first option.  At the same time, one cannot fail to note the fact that the installation of xenon headlights will also provide much better lighting compared to filament lamps. </p><h2>  Brightness, reliability and economy </h2><p>  Fundamental in lamps, such as xenon and bi-xenon, the difference, as already noted, is the organization of focusing.  By such parameters as efficiency, reliability and the degree of brightness of the light, they are the same.  In the case when the car is not equipped with dividing optics, it is better to give preference to biksenon, which can be installed even independently, without certain skills.  In this case, it is important to just read the instructions well.  As for the choice of goods, here it is necessary to pay attention to the designation of the cap. </p>

    <h2>  Dipped and main beam </h2><p>  The key for such types of lamps as xenon and bi-xenon, the difference lies in the use of lighting modes.  The fact is that the first type is used only for dipped beam.  As for bi-xenon discharge lamps, the technology used for them provides the ability to change their focal state, in other words, switch the dipped beam to the main beam, and vice versa. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  The difference between xenon and bi-xenon in monetary terms plays a significant role in the choice.  The minimum cost of a set of the first type of discharge lamps, taking into account the installation, will be about 1900 rubles, for the very simple set of the second type you will have to pay about 3000 rubles. </p><h2>  The most common combination </h2><p>  The most popular among drivers who are well versed in how xenon differs from bi-xenon is the combination that uses halogen bulbs for high beam and xenon for low beam.  The explanation for this is very simple.  The fact is that a very bright high beam is usually required only for long trips outside cities.  According to statistics, most drivers carry about 90 percent of their trips over not very long distances, usually in the settlements. </p>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Knowing the difference between xenon and bi-xenon, making a choice in favor of one or the other is quite simple.  Both types of headlights are sold in almost all car dealerships and can significantly improve driving safety.  The main thing to remember: such headlights are a source of <span>high voltage,</span> so you can not allow the operation of the car if they fail, you need to urgently contact the service center.  Otherwise, the likelihood of a fire of the device increases. </p><p>  Summing up, it should be noted that the principle of operation for xenon and bi-xenon headlights is identical.  Standard lamps of the first kind can function in both low and high beam mode.  In the second type, such an opportunity is combined in one headlight, in other words, bi-xenon is switched by adjusting the direction of the light flux.  Therefore, many experts prefer it to him.  At the same time, both technologies are modern, and most motorists make their choice based on their budget, equipment and personal preferences. </p>
