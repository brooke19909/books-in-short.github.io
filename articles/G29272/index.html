Options and procedures</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A mobile phone is a technical tool that is designed for communication between two people or a group of people.  More recently, in each apartment or house, people communicated with each other using stationary devices.  Time is running forward, and now every person has a personal cordless phone. </p><p>  However, gadgets have a big drawback.  They break down and fail.  What to do if the device is no longer needed, but it is a pity to throw it away?  Let's figure out where you can rent a broken phone for money.  Indeed, during the crisis, no one will give up the opportunity to earn a little. </p><h2>  Hand over the battery </h2><p>  The first one that comes to mind.  First you need to disassemble the phone a little and get the battery.  Today, large companies such as Svyaznoy hold shares in the disposal of technical equipment.  They arrange special ballot boxes around the city, designed for telephone batteries. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spare parts phone" class="if" height="392" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10520/1276482.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Also, the battery can be sent to a specialized workshop.  In this case, there is no need to disassemble the phone yourself.  Just give them the idle device, and the specialists will take the necessary actions themselves.  But this process will not bring us revenue.  But the question is exactly this: "Where can I get a broken phone for money?"  Therefore, you should understand further. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Precious metals </h2><p>  A mobile phone consists mainly of plastic and glass.  But modern devices also use various microcircuits and boards.  They contain a small amount of precious metals.  It is gold, silver and platinum.  However, their number is very small.  Therefore, to earn a little money, you need a large number of devices.  In addition, the extraction of precious metals must be paid.  As a result, revenue will be small. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where can I rent a broken phone for money" class="if" height="307" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41870/1274654.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  There is a lot of information on how to extract precious materials from your phone.  This will help not to pay for services, but to independently carry out all the necessary actions.  But if you do not have sufficient knowledge, then experts do not recommend conducting such experiments at home.  This can be done only by highly qualified companies in specially equipped places. </p><h2>  Ad sale </h2><p>  Any thing can always be given for money.  Everything will depend on the price.  This method is great if the phone is not in perfect condition, but you can talk to other people with it.  The answer to the question of where you can rent a broken phone for money is ad sales. </p><p>  Too many people, left without a means of communication, buy themselves an inexpensive replacement.  While their mobile phone is being repaired or checked for warranty, a busy person should be available to their partners or customers.  Therefore, he will gladly buy a slightly defective device for a short period of use. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Buying up broken phones </h2><p>  An old device, the repair cost of which is more than half its price, can be returned for spare parts.  In any large city there are companies involved in the purchase of "used" mobile phones.  The only condition for delivery is the presentation of a passport.  This will help the company not to mess with stolen items.  Paying money for such devices is small, but this is a serious reason to turn in the phone for spare parts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="broken cell phones" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41870/1274657.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Special shops and service centers conduct a full check of the device before buying it.  Broken cell phones are subject to special expertise that will help you set the price as efficiently and truthfully as possible. </p><h2>  Steps for checking the device </h2><p>  First.  During negotiations with a specialist, the client indicates the main parameters, make of the model, date of purchase and the general condition of the phone.  The master may also ask about the availability of packaging, instructions, a charger, a flash card and cable.  After analyzing these data, the owner is given the result of the assessment.  If he is satisfied, then go to the next stage. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="buying broken phones" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41870/1274655.jpg" width="600"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Second.  Inspection of the appearance and verification of performance.  After that, the specialist announces the final price for the device.  If she is satisfied with the client, then a contract is concluded.  Now the company itself will determine what to do next with the technical tool.  Send the phone for spare parts or, having repaired, put up for sale. </p><h2>  What are they doing with phones in other countries? </h2><p>  The issue of environmental pollution has been raised by ecologists for a very long time.  The main danger is batteries.  In Europe, Asia and America, there are special points where you can bring broken electronics for recycling.  Here you can also turn in a cellular device. </p><p>  Phone manufacturers themselves are involved in this process.  And the state supports them and encourages concessions or new laws favorable to firms. </p><p>  Unfortunately, in the countries of the former USSR, they are only just starting to think about this problem.  It‚Äôs difficult to hand over the phone for recycling here.  Only a few companies began to develop in this direction. </p><p>  Thanks to the considered basic options, now each owner of the device knows the basic answers to the question of where you can rent a broken phone for money. </p>
