Spain attracts fans of art, antiquities and sights, as well as lovers of lazy relaxation.  All the beaches of Spain are famous for their environmental cleanliness and well-groomed.  For this they were awarded the EU Blue Flag.  The beaches here are very different, for every taste: sea and ocean, continental and island, sandy and pebble, open to all the winds and quiet secluded bays, etc. However, all of them without exception attract tourists.  They say that here, on the coast, there are several unofficial <span>nudist beaches</span> where supporters of this worldview gather, for example, the largest of them is Vera Playa. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Spain hotels with private beach" class="if" height="430" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/442868.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Do Spain have ‚Äúown‚Äù beaches? </h2><p>  Numerous hotels are located along the entire coastline of Spain.  Here you can find both luxury deluxe hotels and more modest budget hotels.  However, believe me, in four-, even three-star hotels you will find a service that is in no way inferior to five-star in other countries of the Mediterranean.  However, if you want to find hotels in Spain with your own beach, then you are unlikely to succeed.  Why? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Spain hotels with their own beach" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/442867.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It turns out that in this southern European country the entire sea and ocean coast is considered the property of the Spanish people, therefore, no one, whether a citizen of Spain or a foreigner, having become the owner of any coastal hotel, has the right to buy a nearby stretch of beach, protect it and make it closed zone.  Therefore, if a travel agency offers you hotels in Spain with their own beach, then this is just an advertising move, a bait.  There really are no such hotels.  They are given for those hotels that are located on the first beach line, and their guests, of course, visit the beach located in the immediate vicinity of the hotel.  These sections of the coastline, as a rule, are protected and kept in complete cleanliness due to the efforts of the hotel staff, and vacationers consider them their own hotel beach.  However, if you wish, any tourist can come here, and no one can prevent this.  But this is extremely rare, because in the minds of people these hotels are fixed as hotels in Spain with their own beach. </p><h2>  Spain Resorts </h2><p>  Spain's beach line stretches for hundreds of kilometers.  It is conditionally divided into several beautiful beaches.  Here are the names of the largest of them: <span>Costa Blanca, Costa Calida, Costa Brava, Costa Teguise, Costa Almeria, Costa del Sol,</span> Marbella, Torrevieja, Costa Dorada, beaches on the islands (Canary and Balearic) and etc. Spain is a country with a well-developed tourism infrastructure, it has its own traditions and development trends in this industry.  Therefore, no matter what Spanish resort tourists go to, they will always find wonderful service, friendly attitude of local residents, delicious cuisine, and so on. As for coastal hotels, there are a great many of them - both high-class and budget ones.  In some of the resorts, the number of economy-class hotels predominates, and unpretentious young people often come here.  Naturally, life is in full swing here: night clubs, dance floors, bars, parties, water parks, etc. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The most expensive Spanish resorts </h2><p>  On the coast there are fashionable resorts in which the number of five-star hotels predominates.  Often they are located on the islands (Ibiza, Canary Islands, etc.).  Despite the fact that in this country all the beaches are the property of the state, nevertheless, in these resorts there are hotels in Spain with a "private beach".  Of course, from a legal point of view, they are not the property of these hotel complexes, and everyone has access here, but ordinary citizens are not particularly eager to make an expensive journey to sunbathe in the immediate vicinity of the "rich and famous". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="5 star hotels in Spain" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/442872.jpg" width="435"></div>

    <h2>  The best hotels of the <span>Spanish coast</span> 4 and 5 stars </h2><p>  Costa Brava (White Beach) is one of the most popular Spanish resorts.  It has a length of 212 kilometers.  Includes <span>beaches of Valencia,</span> Almeria and Alicante.  On this coast you can find mainly four-star hotels.  They are simply excellent: luxurious interiors, helpful attitude of the staff, high level of service, but nevertheless some parameters are inferior to the service that 5 star hotels provide in Spain.  On the Costa Blanca, the best hotels are Sheraton Real e Faula Golf 5 *, Hayatt Regency la Manga 5 *, Hesperia Alicante Golf and SPA 5 *.  Here, mainly star athletes like to relax and train: tennis players, soccer players, golfers.  On the vast territories of these hotel complexes there are golf, tennis and football fields, swimming pools and restaurants, etc. The hotels have academies of these sports, and everyone can attend master classes with famous athletes.  Of course, guests prefer to comfortably sunbathe at the luxurious saltwater pools.  However, many people are still attracted to the beach, the opportunity to admire the sea views, listen to the soothing sound of the surf, etc. And they naturally begin to use the beach located opposite the hotel, which, although it is not part of the complex, is, of course, its part.  Naturally, the hotels located on the first beach line in the tourist guides are presented as hotels in Spain with their own beach. </p>
