Moreover, given that in recent years in Russia, loans, loans and debts spread more and more.  Perhaps it is very difficult to meet someone who has no debt.  So where to borrow money?  How to do it?

    <h2>  For phone </h2><p>  In general, it is not so difficult to solve our current problem.  Especially if you know for what specific needs you need money: for the phone or real purchases / for life.  If only the first answer takes place, you won‚Äôt have to worry much about the solution. </p><p>  Why?  This is all due to the fact that mobile operators offer unique services of "crediting" accounts on a SIM card.  You can take on a variety of rules a small (or huge, depends on your connection and spending on it) amount of money for a SIM card.  Usually you are given a certain period of time to repay the loan, as well as to use the card.  After the expiration of the indicated periods, funds will be debited from the SIM card, and you will have to cover the minus by yourself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What is needed for this?  Simply contact the operator, use the service "Promised payment" (or something similar), and then just do not worry about communication.  Only often the question of where to borrow money is not related to a cell phone, but to real finance.  How to solve this problem? </p><h2>  Better not </h2><p>  Frankly, this is not so easy to do.  Especially when you consider the fact that sooner or later you will have to repay any debt.  Before entering into such obligations, it is better to think several times: maybe you should not do this?  Often, citizens are able somewhere to save, somewhere to earn extra money and work harder, so as not to get into debt. </p><p>  Practice shows that this service is addictive in itself.  Sometimes circumstances, of course, force one to agree to such a deal.  Just do not get involved in them.  Borrowing money is not so good as it seems at first glance.  So, before you start looking for a lender, try to weigh the pros and cons, solve the problem with finances by working part-time.  If there is no choice, you will have to really think carefully about where you can borrow money. </p><h2>  Relatives </h2><p>  The most common answer is most often a loan from relatives and loved ones.  In principle, this is a great way out.  In practice, it is very common, not documented in any way.  It is enough to ask your relatives for a loan, as they will be given to you.  Not in all cases, but very often this is exactly what happens. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The advantage of this approach to solving the problem is that often relatives forgive debts.  You will not be ‚Äúknocked out" from them; most likely they will not ask for interest.  That is, how much they took, so much they gave.  The entire loan process is based on the usual arrangement between loved ones, most often orally. </p><p>  Nevertheless, sometimes it is better to think about where to borrow money (urgently or not - it doesn‚Äôt matter), which organization to contact, rather than going to relatives for help.  It all depends on your future lender.  If he is a normal person, you should not be afraid to ask for support.  But most often it turns out that people then begin to manipulate you because of debt.  Even if you gave it along with interest, which initially was not even discussed.  Therefore, many try not to consider their relatives as those who are able to provide financial assistance.  Contacting them is disastrous.  It‚Äôs easier to find some other sources that can help fix the financial situation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where can I borrow money urgently" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1227482.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Friends </h2><p>  Where can I borrow money urgently?  Anyway, from whom can I borrow the amount you need?  Relatives, as we found out, are not the best option, even if you take money on receipt.  The human factor has not been canceled, the "creditor", most likely, will consider you from now on "for the grave of life" obliged for having once supported you. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Therefore, often citizens who think where to borrow money (small amounts) very often turn simply to friends.  This is a more interesting and common option.  Most often it is he who helps to solve the problem with the financial situation. </p><p>  As in the past case, usually such a loan is not regulated by documents.  The whole transaction takes place on mutual trust, by agreement.  Just friends are already strangers.  They, most likely, will not consider you obligated "for the grave of life" only because they helped you financially if necessary.  The main thing here is not to become impudent and repay debts at a strictly agreed time, the faster the better.  Just for the sake of decency, so as not to seem arrogant and irresponsible person. </p><h2>  Banks </h2><p>  Where to borrow money at interest?  For example, in a bank.  Here you have every right to get a loan for one or another need.  True, this process is already considered official, for it will have to work hard.  Moreover, after the conclusion of the loan agreement, you will be bound by the creditor with obligations.  And for the failure to fulfill their obligations to make payments usually follow their consequences.  They can be different - harmless warnings and reminders or direct criminal / administrative liability. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to borrow money on receipt" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1227483.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Of course, just because no one will give you money in the bank.  It will be necessary, as already mentioned, to present a certain list of documents.  A loan from a bank is a responsible business.  And the first thing you need to indicate why you take it, and also provide evidence of your solvency.  If you have no way to pay your debts, then get a refusal.  This option is suitable only for honest and responsible citizens with a good credit history. </p><h2>  Private traders </h2><p>  Where to borrow money?  Private traders!  More precisely, with private credit companies and organizations.  At the moment, they are developing quite rapidly in Russia.  Their main advantage is a minimum of documents.  But the disadvantages are high percentages.  So, if you take a large amount, get ready to give many times more than you were given. </p><p>  Citizens do not like to contact private companies.  After all, their activities are usually not credible.  More specifically, the methods that are used to obtain debt from the borrower.  Most often, illegal methods of "knocking out" money are used.  Therefore, some try not to resort to the services of private companies.  Of course, high interest on payments also have an impact. </p><h2>  On receipt </h2><p>  Where to borrow money on receipt?  Here, to be honest, there are a lot of options for the development of events.  Most often, as practice shows, if we are talking about the documentary conclusion of a transaction, you can contact any citizen.  For example, to a friend, neighbor or relative. </p><p>  It is mandatory to present a receipt, according to which you received the funds and undertake to return them within the agreed time with interest (or without them, as agreed).  If you just borrow money from friends, the process will not be too burdensome.  It is advisable to notarize the transaction, but in practice this is extremely rare. </p><p>  Where to borrow money on receipt yet?  Again, you can turn to private companies.  Just such a loan is most often used by citizens.  That is, when it comes to a receipt, you can contact any credit institution or any citizen, most likely, they will not refuse you. </p>

    <h2>  Microloans </h2><p>  Where can I borrow money urgently?  For example, the so-called microloans have recently become widespread in Russia.  Such organizations are often private, that is, they have no ties with banks and the state.  Many citizens try to apply to such associations for financial need. </p><p>  The main advantage is the almost complete absence of any documents you have for the transaction.  Do you think where you can borrow money without proof of your solvency?  For example, only if you have a passport?  Then this kind of organization is best for you. </p><p>  Only here, companies offering microloans to the population often have not the best reputation.  Why?  Because they simply deceive citizens.  For example, huge percentages will shake you.  Anyway, not a single good organization will contact the borrower without a specific list of documents.  Maybe you are a malicious deadbeat!  Are microloan and microloan companies anyway?  But what if you are simply not able to pay the bills? </p><p>  Thus, if you are interested in where to quickly borrow money, and the consequences are not so important, you can turn to similar companies.  There, you will quickly be given money with only one passport.  But what the consequences will be, one can only guess.  In any case, not everything is as simple as it seems.  Remember, in this sense you will be protected to a minimum.  Most likely, you will have problems with payments - that is, they will constantly ‚Äúpull‚Äù money from you, even if you have already given it in practice.  It is quite common for companies specializing in microcredit and loans. </p><h2>  the Internet </h2><p>  Where to borrow money in Moscow and other cities?  No matter how strange it may sound, you can always get a loan directly on the Internet.  This is a rather dubious decision, but often citizens agree to it.  Why?  Everything is extremely simple - a shortage of finances makes you take the most extreme and rash decisions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where can I borrow money" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1227485.jpg"></div>

      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  In principle, you just have to search the World Wide Web for virtual sites that are decorated in your city and provide loans and loans to your users.  This is quite common, albeit dubious.  Most often, you only need a passport, or rather, passport data.  They are entered on a special page, after which you receive money.  Usually in electronic form, to a virtual wallet or bank card.  No one will send you finances by mail, cash payment at such a reception is simply inappropriate.  That is why it does not inspire confidence in many.  After all, you are simply able to deceive. </p><p>  Nevertheless, you can always find a suitable service that values ‚Äã‚Äãits users.  Yes, now it‚Äôs a huge rarity, but it‚Äôs worth a try.  Especially if you need a little money, and even for a short time.  It is advisable to study in advance the opinions of users about a particular Internet service for lending and loans in your city. </p><h2>  Bad story </h2><p>  Where can I borrow money quickly?  This issue has already been considered.  You can use one of the above options, just for a start, weigh all the pros and cons of each approach.  But where to borrow money with a bad credit history?  It's no secret that banks and even private companies will not get involved with those who already had problems with repayments on debts.  What to do?  Is there really no way out? </p><p>  Generally, there is.  It is enough to contact private special loan and lending companies.  Most often, these are various microloan organizations.  Also, those who have a tarnished credit history can be advised to contact illegal credit companies or try to solve the financial issue with the help of their friends, relatives, acquaintances and relatives. </p><p>  In general, if you have a terrible credit history, it is better not to borrow.  After all, banks do not communicate with malicious defaulters.  And private or illegal organizations simply act illegally towards you.  Where to borrow money urgently if there are already problems with payments?  Without special consequences, as well as fears - only with people close to you, preferably against a receipt.  This is the only logical solution that can be advised. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to borrow money from bad" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1227486.jpg"></div>

    <p>  What could be the consequences of turning to "left" microcredit firms?  Firstly, if you can‚Äôt pay your debts, they will begin to knock them out of you by all means.  And this is not very good, because most often collectors work here.  Secondly, you will not be protected by law.  That is, if something happens, the law will be on the side of your creditor.  And the borrower in this situation acts only as a person who has obligations and no rights. </p><h2>  At work </h2><p>  Where to quickly borrow money?  One last tip at the moment is contacting your employer.  Often, you can arrange to get an advance payment.  Well, or just on a receipt to take this or that amount of money.  Not the most common phenomenon, but it does have a place to be. </p><p>  The same applies to colleagues - you can also agree on a loan with them at work very often.  True, all these methods are relevant only when you need a small amount.  Big money, most likely, no one will give you just like that, especially at work. </p><p>  Instead, as practice shows, you still have to go to the bank.  Only here you can get large sums for certain needs, and also feel at least somehow protected.  Indeed, in such transactions, both parties have their own obligations, as well as rights.  Thus, try to avoid a <span>bad credit history so</span> that you do not have to panic then look for sources of replenishment of funds for a certain period of time.  This is far from the best solution. </p><p>  In general, debts, as already mentioned, are bad.  It is advisable not to get into the "debt hole", it is extremely rare to ask for help even from relatives and relatives, not to mention banks and private companies.  So we figured out where to borrow money when you have a need.  In fact, you can always solve this issue, the main thing is to set a goal and persistently go to it.  Many recommend until the very last to simply look for sources of income and by all means to avoid your debts.  If you already agreed to them, then always try to fulfill your obligations on time.  Otherwise, no one will believe you for the second or third time, a loan will not be issued, even if you have a critical situation.  That's all you need to know. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to borrow money at interest" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1227487.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In general, if you learn how to properly manage your budget, then you won‚Äôt have to think about where to borrow money.  In practice, in Russia they most often deal with this issue only when the amounts are really large and they are necessary for large purchases, for example, an apartment or a car. </p>
