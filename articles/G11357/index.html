    <h2>  Climate of Cyprus </h2><p>  In order to know how to choose the right resort in Cyprus for recreation, you need to consider the climatic factor.  As a rule, the weather conditions here are considered to be among the most moderate and healthy on the planet, which is why there are such a large number of centenarians on the island.  Most of the year Cyprus is exposed to the sun.  In winter, the temperature drops to 15 degrees (the mountain climate at this time, of course, is more severe).  In the summer season, the temperature ranges from 22 to 31 degrees.  Reviews of tourists indicate that it is better to go to Cyprus in the summer.  The warm season on the island begins a little earlier than in our region, namely in May.  It is getting colder in this region in October.  In the same period, the sea begins to cool. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Snow cover on the island can be seen only in a certain area and at a certain time.  It is created artificially and used to ski.  So, in the area near Olympos in winter there are winter resorts.  Rainy time in Cyprus begins in the October days and ends in April.  You can breathe absolutely clean and transparent air here, enjoying the picturesque scenery, especially in the spring. </p>
