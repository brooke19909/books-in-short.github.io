Nokia X3-02: characteristic</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Of great interest to lovers of mobile devices was the telephone from the famous Finnish company Nokia X3.  Its main feature is that it is the only gadget that is not a smartphone that has a touch screen. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  To begin with, we will provide the Nokia X3 picking list: instructions, proprietary charger and headphones - ‚Äútablets‚Äù.  The set, frankly, turned out to be poor. </p><p>  Although the screen of the X3 is touch-sensitive, we see that the <span>mechanical keyboard has</span> not gone away: numbers and hot keys are grouped together under the display.  Of the functional, in addition to ‚Äúforward‚Äù and ‚Äúback‚Äù, there are buttons for quick activation of the music player and instant transition to SMS messages.  Note that they cannot be reassigned.  Another innovation of the developers is the location of the "0", "pound" and "asterisk" keys: now this trio is not located at the bottom of the keyboard, as everyone is used to seeing, but from the right edge.  This will take some getting used to. </p>

    <p>  A design omission is the <span>protective glass of the</span> screen, which protrudes somewhat in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe earpiece.  During the conversation, the edge of protection unpleasantly rubs against the skin, causing discomfort. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the upper right corner of the front panel is a proximity sensor.  On the right side is the volume rocker, as well as the device activation key.  At the top there is a micro-USB slot, a 3.5 mm headset jack and a Nokia branded charging hole.  Below the phone is a speaker. </p><p>  The back cover of Nokia X3 is the only part of the phone made of metal.  Under it are slots for a memory card and SIM card.  Also on the back is the camera eye. </p><p>  In general, the assembly ‚ÄúNokia X3‚Äù, the photo of which can be seen below, turned out to be of average quality: there is a certain backlash on the back of the device and there are large gaps. </p>

    <p>  Overall dimensions of the device - 48.4 x 106.2 x 9.6 mm, weight - 78 g. </p><h2>  "Nokia X3 02": a characteristic of the touch screen </h2><p>  It should be noted right away that the screen is resistant, that is, it will be possible to control it both with the help of a finger and with a stylus, which, however, is not provided in the device‚Äôs kit.  Screen sizes are 2.4 inches - not too convenient diagonal for using the sensor.  The number of pixels is 167 PPI per inch.  The display shows 262,000 colors. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Resolution 240x320 is quite a match for the size of the display, but this is perhaps the only plus.  The picture quality is average, viewing angles are small, and the image fades in the sun.  Navigating the menu is not entirely convenient;  some flaws are also observed.  For example, if there are only two menu items on the displayed screen, and we use swipe up or down, gray bars of the flipping effect will appear on the display, although there is nothing to scroll through.  It does not look very aesthetically pleasing.  Menu navigation is not too fast, which is also depressing.  One gets the impression that the sensor here is a completely superfluous function, and a standard joystick would be a much more optimal solution. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  When buying a Nokia X3, users get very meager and low-quality optics.  Despite the fact that in such a price segment the 5 megapixel looks pretty impressive, even medium quality pictures will not be possible due to the lack of autofocus.  Photos are blurry and fuzzy, especially when shooting near objects and text documents.  Only background images, for example, landscapes, are tolerable.  You will have to forget about night shooting at all, since the flash is not provided here.  There is nothing much to say about the camera‚Äôs functionality, since there are no interesting solutions. </p><p>  The camcorder can shoot videos with a resolution of 640x420 at a speed of 15 frames per second. </p>

    <h2>  Sound </h2><p>  Next in turn is the next part of the Nokia X3 review - a description of the audio player and sound.  The hotkey for activating the player unambiguously hints that the phone is tuned to music.  It should be noted that with this button you can only activate the player, you have to control it exclusively through the touch screen. </p><p>  The speaker here really came out quite loud, but its quality remains average.  The music plays well in the headphones, but you should not wait for something supernatural.  The headset supplied is frankly weak, and it will have to be replaced immediately with a new one if we want to use the phone as an FM receiver or mp3 player.  It is strange enough that the developers did not provide at least medium <span>vacuum headphones,</span> which are simply required to be supplied with music gadgets. </p>

    <h2>  Video </h2><p>  On such a small screen and with such meager resolution, watching movies on the phone is completely uninteresting.  It is suitable only for watching small clips.  However, the creators endowed the video player with many different codecs, allowing you to play popular formats, such as 3GP, H.264 / AVC, MPEG-4, WMV. </p><h2>  Memory and communication </h2><p>  By default, only 50 MB of internal memory is available to phone owners.  It will be possible to expand it using a microSD memory card;  The device supports flash drives up to 16 GB. </p><p>  Of the interfaces available Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 2.1 and USB. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The model is equipped with a 860 mAh lithium-ion battery.  The claimed battery life is as follows: talk time - 5.3 hours, standby time - 432 hours, listening to music - 28 hours, video playback - 6 hours. With moderate use, the device is quite capable of "living" without recharging for several days. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nokia X3 Feature" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27558/1083228.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Frankly, Nokia X3 is not the best solution for a Finnish company.  The touch screen is not implemented in the best way: it is inconvenient to operate it.  There are some design flaws, such as a convex protective glass and a non-standard arrangement of the keys "0", "lattice" and "asterisk". </p><p>  Of the pluses, we highlight a loud speaker, a good set of audio and video codecs, a nice design, a battery and, perhaps, everything.  There are much more minuses: a weak screen, a poor sensor, a useless camera, poor equipment, a small amount of internal memory, etc. Whether this ambiguous device is worth its 5,500 rubles, or still not, is up to users to decide. </p><h2>  Nokia X3: user reviews </h2><p>  Outwardly, the phone looks objectively pretty enough, but to many owners it seemed not very convenient.  The convex edges of the protective screen and the inconvenient location of the classic keys are noted.  The keyboard also leaves much to be desired. </p><p>  The touch screen has received various reviews: one liked this feature, others were unhappy with the decision of the creators.  Not the most correct sensor operation is noted.  Owners believe that on the Internet it would be much more convenient to be controlled using an ordinary joystick. </p><p>  As for the color rendition of the image, it points out such flaws as glare in the sun, very small viewing angles and not the brightest gamut of colors.  Recall that the display gives out only 262 thousand colors, so obviously there is no need to wait for a too saturated palette. </p><p>  Oddly enough, the camera received quite positive reviews, but everyone complains about the lack of autofocus and flash. </p><p>  The music component of the phone is mostly praised, referring to the loud speaker and fairly decent sound quality. </p>
