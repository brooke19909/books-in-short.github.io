This largely explains the relatively high international rating of banks in Kazakhstan.  Over the past years, most of them continue to develop.  In many respects, the merit of such stability belongs to the leadership of the state, which provides sufficient support through banking structures in the economy. </p><h2>  Key indicators taken into account when compiling bank ratings </h2><p>  Viability indicators are most conveniently traced by the corresponding rating of banks in Kazakhstan.  It was based on the basic financial standards of credit institutions along with the existing development dynamics of each of them. </p><p>  When compiling the ratings of the best banks in Kazakhstan, special attention is paid to the timely return of customer deposits, even when certain financial problems appear at the bank itself. </p><p>  Also taken into account is such an indicator as funding.  Sustainability of funding refers to the ratio between loans and deposits issued to customers for a particular lending institution.  Ideally, they should have approximately equal values, since this is a guarantee of financing loans already issued through attracted finance, without the use of interbank funding resources. </p>

    <p>  If the rating of banks in Kazakhstan shows that an institution is characterized by 100% funding (the term "funding" means raising borrowed capital from deposits and investments), this indicates the formation of an existing loan portfolio from deposits.  Therefore, there is no urgent need, even in case of serious fluctuations in the capital market, for its urgent repayment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Fast liquidity is another factor that will certainly be taken into account when compiling a credit rating of banks in Kazakhstan.  It reflects the ability of an institution to urgently repay short-term liabilities through the sale of its own liquid assets.  If the value is close to 100%, this is evidence of the long-term stability of banks.  With a small ratio, the situation will also not be critical - bankruptcy can be completely avoided with the proper use of funds received during the planned repayment of loans, even in times of crisis. </p><h2>  Features of bank ratings </h2><p>  When compiling a rating of Kazakhstan banks by their viability, all existing credit institutions of the country with the exception of Zhilstroysberbank are taken into account.  This is because he, regardless of the circumstances, has full state support. </p><p>  Particular success in the modern market of Kazakhstan is enjoyed by many subsidiaries of Russian credit institutions.  In general, the position of a bank in one rating or another often depends on the owner of the bank. </p>

    <h2>  The popularity of banks in Kazakhstan </h2><p>  Financial experts make up a separate rating, focusing on such an indicator as the mentioning of credit institutions.  Based on this, the ratings of popularity of banks are formed. </p><p>  QAZKOM is currently the most mentioned among banks in Kazakhstan.  Of course, recent years have not been the easiest for this credit institution.  An unpleasant factor was the downgrade of his rating to the mark "CCC" by a rating agency.  But the bank‚Äôs management managed to urgently rectify the situation and regain the previous international rating from S&amp;P to the mark ‚ÄúB-‚Äù. </p><p>  Despite serious personnel shifts in the bank‚Äôs management, updating its brand, recently it has been able to build up its existing assets. </p><p>  "People's Bank of Kazakhstan" took the honorable second line of the popularity rating from S&amp;P.  In many ways, this was facilitated by an open-type information policy.  Press conferences were regularly held here, many events in the life of a credit institution were covered.  Many experts believe that the bank owes such high rates to increased media activity of the chairman of its board, Shayakhmetova. </p><p>  Moreover, according to the results of 2016, it was Halyk Bank that managed to gain leadership in the field of retail lending.  This is one of the five most profitable banks in the country, which is also important.  His profit is increasing. </p><p>  DB from Sberbank JSC got the third place in the popularity rating.  It's no secret that this is a subsidiary of one of the largest Russian banks.  Experts are sure that such a high popularity is due to the activities of Sberbank as such. </p><p>  Housing Construction Savings Bank is a little less frequently mentioned.  It is also very popular in Kazakhstan.  There are several reasons for this, including the implementation of the Affordable Housing program from the state, which provides for the financing of housing construction. </p>

    <h2>  Analyst forecasts and general trends </h2><p>  The current situation on the world stage is ambiguous.  Of course, this is reflected in the financial sphere.  The stability of many credit institutions in Kazakhstan is lost. </p><p>  So, recently experts predicted a possible revocation of the license and Delta Bank.  Against the background of such conclusions of experts, his assessment fell to "CCC". </p><p>  Analysts tried to lower the position of Kazkom Bank in long-term credit ratings.  But, in view of the strong state financial support, a negative scenario for this Kazakhstani bank is excluded. </p><p>  In general, according to the results of 2016, there was a decrease in the ratings of many banks of the country from international agencies.  This is due to the deterioration of the credit mechanism against the background of a general recession of the country's economy.  In many difficult financial situations, many credit institutions had to make a number of cuts, which involved not only cutting money amounts for certain expense items such as advertising and business trips, but also reducing the number of employees. </p><p>  In general, due to the expected deterioration of the economic situation in the country, the main Kazakhstan banks are already taking steps to reduce their dependence on various external resources.  The policy of active use of own funds to finance all types of activities. </p>
