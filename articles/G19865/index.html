It is known that a tract refers to some part of the area that stands out from the environment. </p><p>  The mezhgorye, or gorge (or gully), 2.5 kilometers long, extends to a small pebble beach, fenced off from the rest of the peninsula by the Ostrayaya, Amzai and Sapun mountains, on the slopes of which a mixed forest grows.  Therefore, the tract has its own, different from Novorossiysk and its environs, microclimate. </p><h2>  Young and wonderful resort </h2>

    <p>  This corner of nature resembles the <span>southern coast of Crimea</span> and the Mediterranean at the same time.  The wide beam, in which there is a well-maintained urban-type village, a beautiful beach and amazing flora and fauna, represent the spa part of the complex of the city of Novorossiysk.  This paradise is located 4 km from the village of Myskhako, which means Adygea means ‚Äúa cape going to sea‚Äù, and 10 km from the hero city of Novorossiysk, of which it is a municipal entity.  It can be called a corner relatively, because the Wide beam is a fairly large resort formation - 43 objects, which include recreation centers, motels, hotels and, of course, all related infrastructure.  The local population adapted their homes for a comfortable rest of people who come to rest "savages". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Geographic data </h2><p>  Three beaches ("Lukomorye", "Surf" and a 1.5-kilometer nudist) are combined into one common, which stretches for 3 kilometers.  Its borders are the slopes of the mountains: from the north-west - Sorcerer, from the south - Ostroy.  The gorge rises from the beach to Novorossiysk, it was it that gave the name to the village and the resort area - the Wide beam.  The intermountain is really not narrow, although it is called a ‚Äúgap‚Äù on modern geographic maps, the so-called river runs along its bottom, which is rather a stream 1 meter wide.  It is called Chuhabl.  The <span>highest mountain</span> surrounding the Gorge Wide beam - Sapun (438.4 m).  Many streams flow into the river, and all of them together form a gutter with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã20 square meters.  km </p>

    <h2>  The uniqueness of the tract </h2><p>  The soil structure here is such that moisture at the roots of the trees persists for a long time, so the slopes of the mountains are covered with bright greenery.  Actually, the gorge is of interest precisely because of its vegetation, because here trees grow that are no longer anywhere in the world - for example, the <span>sacred Vitex,</span> it is also an Abraham tree, and others.  Most importantly, the Wide Beam has a wonderful, even climate - the summer is not hot, the winter is cold (left-handed bloom).  It is the mild climate that provides incomparable comfort - the air temperature in July is +28 degrees, and water - +27. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Novorossiysk wide beam" class="if" height="438" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/454052.jpg" width="600"></div>

Warm clear sea, small pebble beaches, mountains covered with forests - all this is inherent in many places of the Black Sea coast.  The microclimate of the tract is what makes this place a unique climatic resort, known (included in the relevant register) since 1908. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The traces of the Greek settlements, which archaeologists find along the banks of the gorge itself, confirm the historical information that these places are from the end of the VI century BC to the IV century BC.  e.  were part of the state of Sindica, and then, since 480 BC.  e., - in the Bosporus kingdom.  So, in 1898, on the territory of the Gorny Rodnik base (then these lands belonged to the landowner Kuleshevich), a bronze bust of the granddaughter of Mithridates the Great, the Bosporan Queen of Dynami (stored in the Hermitage) was found.  Later, these lands passed from hand to hand;  here are traces of <span>Genoese fortresses.</span>  During the war years, heavy battles were fought for these lands on these territories. </p><h2>  The first steps to a civilized vacation </h2><p>  Already since 1969, with the advent of the first climate sanatoriums, the Wide Beam, whose recreation and treatment were appreciated by pioneers, begins to be actively built up by spa and health institutions.  And in recent years, here, as elsewhere, intensive construction has been carried out - the embankment has been transformed, new resort infrastructure facilities have been updated or erected.  As a result of this, Novorossiysk itself, Shirokaya Balka and all its environs are gradually turning into places very worth visiting, which are in no way inferior to the Black Sea recreation areas of other countries. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wide beam base" class="if" height="389" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/454053.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The velvet season is especially valuable in these places, since even in the month of October the water temperature is above 19 degrees.  The Wide Beam is always crowded, because here you can find rest for every taste - for lovers of cultural entertainment, and for fans of peace and contemplative peace.  After 2002, the chapel of St. Alexei was built and consecrated. </p><h2>  Wide beam base </h2><p>  As noted above, in the huge sanatorium resort Novorossiysk, the Wide beam occupies a special place.  On its territory there are more than 40 different bases and holiday homes.  The most frequently mentioned and discussed are Black Sea, Metroclub, Seagull, Ocean and Forest Tale.  Located here, in the resort and health resort "Wide beam", the base "Surf" is also famous for the fact that it owns a beach, which can not be reached, except through the territory of the base itself.  The staircase leading to the beach, which is under a cliff about 40 meters high, has 203 steps and two rest areas.  Someone likes it, someone doesn‚Äôt at all (there are pools at the base), and she has a decent age.  But from the territory of the Priboy base, the beach itself is 20 meters wide and 800 meters long, the vast expanse of water always looks great behind it, especially when the sea phosphorizes. </p><h2>  City Beach </h2><p>  In front of this departmental beach from the side of the village of Myskhako there is a city - Lukomorye, which is especially suitable for children.  There is also a health camp of the same name.  The beach is large, fully equipped, in its vast territory (length - more than a kilometer, width - 30 meters) along the sea there are numerous water attractions.  Everything is provided, including parking for cars, there are tents and places of food.  And just above it is the newly built snow-white city embankment in the ancient Roman style, and on it, as usual, there are bars, restaurants, shops, various salons and everything that is supposed to have a modern, visited Black Sea resort. </p><h2>  Start of development </h2><p>  The Seagull is the very first recreation center built directly on the local seashore.  The wide beam then, in 1969, received its first vacationers - workers of the Novorossiysk Automobile Plant, who traveled here through the village of Myskhako.  The difficulties of access to these beautiful places forced in 1975, by joint municipal efforts, to pave an asphalt road here, and fame came to the resort. </p>

    <h2>  The democracy of the resort </h2><p>  In addition to all the above advantages of this area, there is another very attractive feature - the freshwater lake Abrau, the largest in these parts.  The legends about him are beautiful and, of course, are associated with all-conquering love (Abrau is the name of the girl), but you can learn about all this by making one of the excursions that are held in the Wide Beam regularly.  This resort is rightfully considered to be youth, because there are few old and obsolete buildings, since they were washed away by the 2002 flood. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wide beam 2014" class="if" height="472" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/454059.jpg" width="600"></div>  With the new development, the achievements and requirements of the time were taken into account, which is especially appreciated by young people.  Housing in the private sector, as well as at many bases, can be ordered without intermediaries, and this makes prices quite affordable and affordable.  The resort Wide beam met 2014 as one of the most visited places.
