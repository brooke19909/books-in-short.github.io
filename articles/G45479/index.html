    <h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Yuna Life is an entire architectural complex.  It is made in a modern style inherent in Western Europe.  On the territory of the complex there are three residential buildings, which are interconnected by an aquazone.  This is a real highlight of Yuna Life.  The water park offers wonderful water rides for guests of any age. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  Hotel Yuna Life offers spacious two-story townhouses to accommodate guests.  They are in the first building.  Their area is from ninety to one hundred and fifteen square meters.  They are designed to accommodate from two to six people. </p>

    <p>  The third building includes double rooms ranging in size from twenty to forty square meters.  At the same time, each of them is unique in its interior and design, while at the same time meeting the standards that are provided for the luxury category. <br>  All rooms have satellite TV, air conditioning, and wireless Internet (Wi-Fi).  It is worth noting that all residential premises are designed in such a way as to satisfy the highest requirements of customers.  The number of rooms is a symbiosis of the amenities and advantages of a spa stay with the warmth and comfort of home space.  Any of the living quarters corresponds to a pleasant expensive interior of a decent country house.  This is the entrance hall, and the furnished living room, and the kitchen room with various built-in appliances, and romantic bright bedrooms, which contain elements of oriental decor, and a large bathroom, which is equipped with a shower room with a jet massage or a jacuzzi.  All this creates an atmosphere of comfort, harmony and an incomparable aesthetic picture. </p><p>  From the rooms of the first and second buildings there are separate exits to the territory of the holiday home.  The landscape is made in the English classical style.  Here you can admire the Alpine slides and neatly trimmed lawns, a stone bridge that is thrown over a natural brook, as well as take advantage of the sunbathing areas, summer terraces, and sit in the open cozy lobby bar. </p><h2>  Aquazones </h2><p>  They are available in every building of the holiday home.  Moreover, their round-the-clock visits for guests of Yuna Life are absolutely free.  The aquazones have two indoor <span>pools (</span> one of them can be accessed directly from the rooms of the first building), a bath and sports complex (with a Turkish bath and a Finnish sauna), a jacuzzi and a water park.  Guests at the holiday home can take part in traditional bathing ceremonies held by high-class professionals. </p><h2>  Aquapark </h2><p>  Visitors to the holiday home find themselves in an amazing place where there is an opportunity to find any kind of entertainment to their liking.  Since April 2011, the water park (on Dmitrovka) was opened in Yuna Life.  ‚ÄúAqua Yuna‚Äù (this is what it is called) is three thousand square meters of sun, heat and good mood.  Not only a child, but any adult will always find interesting entertainment here. </p>

    <p>  The descent speed reaches fourteen meters per second.  Water cannons, four pools, waterfalls and geysers - all this is what the Yuna Life water park has at its disposal.  Reviews from its visitors indicate a great time. <br>  Birthdays and accompanying guests in the water park are offered a discount of up to fifty percent.  An adult entrance ticket for those who want to spend the whole day in the water park will cost 1,500 rubles, and a children's ticket will cost 700 rubles. </p><h2>  For surf lovers </h2><p>  More recently, the Yuna Life country club has solved the problem of those who wish to experience a sense of pleasure and admiration for riding the waves.  In this holiday home, equipment was installed that allows you to get an artificial wave.  Now in Moscow there is where to do surfing.  It is not necessary to plan expensive trips to the ocean and calculate the seasonality of the waves.  The territory of the water park, where the artificial wave is located, is a great place not only for beginners, but also for those who are professionally surfing. </p>
