Which one - it depends on the taste, but there are several mandatory requirements for such a dress.  Firstly, this is frankness, which is expressed by the openness of the décolleté, neck, legs or waist, the nudity of the shoulders and arms.  This also includes a fully-fitting silhouette.  Secondly, the fabric should be elegant and noble.  In other words, visually the evening outfit should be very different from everyday clothes and at the same time hide the flaws of the figure, exposing only the virtues of the female silhouette. </p>

    <h2>  Buy or sew? </h2><p>  A huge number of girls on the eve of any celebration face a choice: to buy or sew an outfit for an individual order.  However, few people think that sewing evening <span>dresses with their own hands is</span> not so difficult as it might seem at first glance.  Of course, some experience with a sewing machine will be needed here, but because of its lack, you should not immediately abandon such an undertaking. </p><p>  As in any business, there are advantages and disadvantages.  First of all, the biggest plus of tailoring is that a lady in exactly the same outfit will never appear on a holiday.  Agree, it is very encouraging and motivating.  The downside is this: to sew a <span>long evening dress</span> with your own hands, you have to tinker a bit, because this is quite painstaking work. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to choose a model? </h2><p>  One of the main tasks, as with the purchase of a finished product, is the correct choice of model.  Perfectly selected style can present a female figure in a favorable light.  The first step is determining the <span>type of figure.</span>  Fortunately, there are only four of them: </p><ul><li>  A-shaped physique, or "pear".  Women with such a figure have wide hips and narrow shoulders.  The main task here is to visually balance the silhouette.  Owners of such forms should give preference to the maxi length or dresses, 5 cm above the knee.  In both cases, the skirt should be in the form of a trapezoid.  In such outfits, draperies on the chest and shoulders, as well as the allocation of the waist, will be appropriate.  The neck of the boat will look great. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself long evening dress" class="if" height="271" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/365119.jpg" width="280"></div></li><li>  T-shaped physique, or "inverted triangle."  For the fair sex with this type of figure, it is better to sew evening dresses (do-it-yourself or custom-made) with an asymmetric top, which visually makes the chest lighter.  But the skirt can be decorated with draperies, pleats and ruffles.  The styles “sun”, “half-sun” and “trapezoid” will also look good.  In other words, you need to sew evening dresses with your own hands with an emphasis on the line of the hips to visually bring the figure closer to the correct silhouette. </li><li>  Build "apple".  In this figure, the shoulders and hips are proportional, but the waist does not stand out and there is a bulge in the abdomen.  An ideal option is a <span>dress with a high waist,</span> with a skirt from under the chest and with a bright emphasis on the matching line.  If complexion allows, arms and shoulders are best left open.  Dresses with a trapeze skirt can be a good option, but the waist line still needs to be overestimated.  Slender owners of such a physique are ideal for a magnificent top or bottom, as well as cases. </li><li>  Build "hourglass."  Sewing evening dresses with your own hands for such a figure is the easiest, because here the choice of models is not limited, the main task becomes the correct arrangement of accents.  It can be an open back or neckline and a huge cut on the skirt. </li></ul><h2>  How to sew evening dresses with your own hands? </h2><p>  Patterns for <span>evening wear</span> are no different from patterns for everyday wear, with the exception of the depth of cuts and all kinds of draperies, however, they are also modeled on the main blank.  To build one, measurements are first taken: chest, waist, hips, chest height and back width.  Then all these values ​​are divided into two, and a couple of centimeters is taken from the front in favor of the back of the pattern.  The obtained values ​​are transferred to the paper and draw the lines of the shoulders, side seams and tucks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY evening dresses patterns" class="if" height="389" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3663/365809.jpg?1396512649557" width="559"></div>  Professional seamstresses will not have difficulties with this, but what to do if knowledge is not enough?  This can be helped by your favorite T-shirt, which fits perfectly on the figure, naturally, then the fabric for the dress should be elastic.  So, put the shirt on the paper and draw around the contour, taking into account the already noted measurements, adjust all the slices.  At this stage, you can simulate a little, making the depth of cut or embossed seams greater.  But it’s better to still get a couple of relevant magazines (for example, the notorious “Burda”).  There are stickers with patterns for all sizes.  Choosing the right model and transferring the pattern to the material, you just have to cut and assemble the product.  When starting to cut the fabric, do not forget to leave allowances for the seams (just a couple of centimeters).  The dress is assembled in stages, after each stitched fragment, it is necessary to try on and fix the flaws.  First, embroidered relief seams, shoulder (if any), then comes the turn of the side seams, zippers and processing of the upper sections and armholes.  After that, you can pay attention to the skirt: it is also sewn along model seams and the open edges and hem are treated.  The last step is to connect the bodice of the dress with the skirt.  Well, you can decorate your outfit yourself.  Fortunately, there is no shortage of fittings today.

    <h2>  Which fabric to choose? </h2><p>  The choice of material for an evening dress needs to be approached with all responsibility, because it is he who sets the basic rules by which you will have to work.  At all times, a <span>floor-</span> length evening <span>dress is</span> very popular <span>.</span>  You can sew such an outfit from any fabric - guipure, satin with embroidery with beads and sequins, flying and flowing silk or chiffon, brocade ... The main thing is that the appearance of the material matches the purpose of the product. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY evening dresses" class="if" height="395" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/365127.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Combinations of different textures will look original, for example: the top of a dress from guipure and a chiffon fluffy skirt or a satin base with lace applications dotted with stones.  In fact, there are a lot of options, the only restriction here is imagination.  Yes, please note: the more saturated the finish of the product, the easier the style should be so as not to overload the outfit. </p>
