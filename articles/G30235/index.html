    <p>  There are two states on the peninsula: in the south - the <span>Republic of Korea</span> (capital - Seoul), and in the north - North Korea (capital - Pyongyang).  They are separated by a demilitarized line, because they are in a state of confrontation. </p><p>  The capital of the Republic of Korea is a huge metropolis with a population of up to 10 million people.  Seoul stands on the large Hangang River, the width of which reaches a kilometer.  Although the city has a very ancient history, it is almost impossible to find old buildings here: they all burned down or were destroyed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Republic of Korea is the capital" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/47323.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The capital of the DPRK - Pyongyang - is the economic and cultural center of the country with only two million people, and its name itself means "wide land" or "cozy area". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The city leads its history from the depths of centuries: it is more than two thousand years old.  Here you can see relics and monuments of the primitive period.  Some of them were created millions of years ago. </p><p>  Many historical finds in Pyongyang were discovered during excavations during the rule of the people's government. </p><p>  From ancient times, the capital of the DPRK was called the "willow city", but today, along with willows, you can see many other various trees and <span>flowering plants.</span>  Everywhere there are squares and park areas where you can meet beautiful mountain birds. </p><p>  Pyongyang is distinguished by an abundance of pompous official structures and buildings, for the construction of which the authorities spared no means, because the capital of the DPRK was originally intended to become a "showcase of the successes of socialism." </p><p>  A lot of comfortable hotels for foreigners have been built here.  Pyongyang is the venue for the most grandiose festivities dedicated to Kim Il Sung and important events in the life of the country. </p><p>  The interior design of the metro is very similar to Moscow underground stations of the thirties. </p><p>  Many <span>historical monuments</span> have been preserved here <span>,</span> such as the ruins of the walls of 427, the gates of Tedongmun and Pthonmun, recently restored, the pubilions of Pubennu and Yongwangjon - masterpieces of Korean architecture. </p><p>  Almost all of them were destroyed during the war, but were later restored. </p><p>  The capital of the DPRK is also famous for the famous bell cast in 1714: its weight is more than 13 tons. </p><p>  After the war, Pyongyang was practically rebuilt, and now such grandiose <span>public buildings,</span> such as the Bolshoi or Moranbon theaters, Mansude Palace, etc., amaze the imagination. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The capital of the Republic of Korea" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/47319.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  In the capital are all the great museums of the country.  The historical museum, built on Mount Moranbon, is famous for its exhibits: from the Paleolithic era to the present.  <span>The Museum of the Revolution,</span> created in 1948, is dedicated to confronting Koreans against foreign invaders, especially during the years of Japanese enslavement.  The Museum of Ethnography has a collection of objects from everyday life of all historical eras of Korea.  The art gallery presents several thousand paintings from the <span>earliest Middle Ages</span> to the twentieth century, although most of the expositions are pieces of modern art that glorify the socialist system. </p>
