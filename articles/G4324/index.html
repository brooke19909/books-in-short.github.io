    <p>  Oddly enough, the ‚Äúferris wheel‚Äù was designed not just like that, but out of a desire to ‚Äúcatch up and overtake‚Äù the famous <span>Gustav Eiffel</span> tower <span>.</span>  J. Ferris, who can rightfully be called the founding father of the Ferris wheel, set himself such a goal.  In many ways, it was achieved. </p><p>  The first Ferris wheel, installed in the American town of Chicago at the end of the 19th century, was 75 meters in diameter.  In 36 cabins could accommodate more than two thousand people, and the mechanism itself was set in motion by engines, the total power of which exceeded two thousand horsepower.  The main purpose of this attraction was a survey of the surroundings and "tickling nerves" in a noble public. </p>

    <p>  By the way, one of the versions of the appearance of the name "Ferris Wheel" refers to this first construction.  The thing is that the construction dates were extremely tight, so the workers had to work literally at a frantic pace.  It was from them that the name went for a walk, which later became generally recognized. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another version emphasizes the fact that in France the first Ferris wheel had thirteen cabs, hence the connection with a <span>dozen dozen</span> and generally with <span>evil spirits.</span>  There is a purely Russian version.  The thing is that in Russian parks at one time, along with the Ferris wheel, there were similar structures that rotated horizontally at a very high speed, so their visitors were literally thrown to the sides.  It was these attractions that began to be called the "Ferris Wheel", and only then this term passed to the "vertical brother". </p>

    <p>  Today, each country has its own similar design, which all citizens are rightly proud of.  In Russia, the Ferris Wheel at VDNH is considered such a structure.  Located on a significant hill, it gives visitors the opportunity to enjoy beautiful views of the Russian capital.  This building has a rather interesting history: it has been replaced several times, becoming more and more modern.  The latest <span>Ferris wheel in Moscow</span> was installed by V. Gnezdilov.  According to the memoirs of the designer, the then mayor <span>Y. Luzhkov</span> exercised personal control over this process <span>.</span>  The construction was erected on the eve of the 850th anniversary of the city and was a wonderful gift for this holiday. </p><p>  The Ferris Wheel in Moscow, like, by the way, the Ferris design, had a diameter of 70 meters, and the maximum height with which the survey was carried out was 73 meters.  A total of forty cabins were located around the perimeter, eight of which were open and gave visitors a truly unforgettable experience.  One wheel revolution was carried out in 450 seconds, so that everyone managed to enjoy the beauties of Moscow in full. </p><p>  However, time passed, and in 2012 the Ferris Wheel in Moscow lost its status as the highest in Russia.  This happened after the installation of a brand new 80-meter construction in Sochi.  Then it was decided that a new wheel will be built at the All-Russian Exhibition Center, the diameter of which will be as much as 200 meters.  Such dimensions will allow it to become <span>the largest ferris wheel in the world.</span> </p>
