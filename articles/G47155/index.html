Realtor Services</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Thousands of housing transactions are made daily in real estate.  Naturally, not everyone knows the subtleties and nuances of the procedures that are necessary for a profitable purchase or sale of apartments.  And few people understand the legal documentation of real estate objects.  All this work rests on the shoulders of specialists.  And in this regard, many are interested in the question of how many realtors charge for the sale of an apartment?  Let's consider it in more detail. </p><h2>  The intermediary market is diverse </h2><p>  Today in real estate there are many agencies that for a fee can help in the purchase or sale of housing.  Moreover, the size of the “commission” for each intermediary is different.  Reputable agencies operating on the market for many years, as a rule, dictate their rules of the game to customers and set a high percentage of remuneration. </p>

    <p>  Companies with a small staff of employees that recently started to engage in real estate business are often forced to adapt to the client and work for a small fee.  And this is only one side of the coin of the question of how much realtors charge for the sale of an apartment. </p><h2>  Factors That Affect Pricing </h2><p>  There are a number of reasons why some intermediaries ask for the amount of "x" for their services, others - the amount of "y", and still others - the amount of "z". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Firstly, the dimensions of settlements should be taken into account.  In large cities, where the income level of citizens is quite high, and the number of offers is diverse, real estate agencies work for a lot of money.  In particular, Moscow realtors, engaged in the sale of an apartment worth 30 million rubles, can evaluate their services at 500 thousand rubles.  A completely different picture is observed in regions where the number of cities is many times lower, and the size of salaries is much lower than in the "golden-headed" one.  So, how many realtors charge for the sale of apartments on the periphery?  On average, for apartments, the price of which is 2.5 - 3 million rubles, agent remuneration can vary from 40,000 to 50,000 rubles.  Naturally, for such a commission, Moscow realtors of some rating company “will not even lift a finger”. </p>

    <p>  It also happens that representatives of several real estate agencies are involved in the sale or purchase of housing, and then the costs of their fees increase significantly. </p><p>  One way or another, but this is far from all aspects of the question: “How many realtors charge for the sale of an apartment?”. </p><p>  This parameter also depends on the list of work to be performed by the agent.  Also, the size of the commission is affected by the demand for the object on the market.  The criterion of “degree of readiness of a package of a document” is also not the least here.  The size of the commission determines the factor of remoteness of the object from large cities.  Agent remuneration also depends on the method of acquiring housing (subsidy, capital, <span>housing certificate,</span> mortgage). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In other words, the percentage of realtors is determined in a strictly individual order.  On average, its size varies from 2 to 5% of the transaction amount.  The common commission amount is 3%. </p><h2>  Something More About Realtors' Salaries </h2><p>  It should be noted that in 99% of cases, a real estate agent does not receive a salary in the classical sense of the word.  As such, he has no salaries.  All his income is a fixed percentage of transactions.  Therefore, the more sold, the more received.  Well, if you didn’t conclude a single deal, then you got zero. </p>

    <p>  Another remarkable point is that the realtor does not receive his remuneration from the buyer, but from the agency in which he works.  The company signs an agreement in advance with construction organizations for the provision of services when it comes to working in the primary real estate market.  In this case, the realtor also “takes” his commission from his employer.  In general, the issue of remuneration is resolved in the framework of the relationship: "Agency - realtor." </p><h2>  “Is a developer cheaper?” </h2><p>  Many people think that if you work directly with the developer and ignore the services of a real estate office, you can save on buying a home.  In fact, in this sense there is no fundamental significance whether you are in contact with the developer “one-on-one” or with the participation of an intermediary.  The price of the apartment will be strictly fixed, and for all agencies.  The fact is that the construction organization itself provides information on the value of objects to all real estate companies with which it has concluded an agreement. </p>

    <p>  Another moment is paradoxical.  It often happens that buying an apartment through a personal partnership with a developer is more expensive than when the same mansions were purchased with the participation of an agent.  How can this contradiction be explained?  The thing is that experienced real estate experts are with developers not only in the framework of business cooperation, but also try to establish “warm” relations with them.  Naturally, having such a trump card up your sleeve, you can achieve a certain discount for your client, and then the realtor’s office will definitely fix the deal.  But then again, not every real estate agent will be able to establish friendly relations with the developer: this is only possible for experienced professionals who have been working in the market for a long time. </p><h2>  About agent commission for seller </h2><p>  If a person contacts the agency in order to sell an apartment, then a preliminary contract is mandatory with him.  And, of course, it stipulates a condition on the value of the object, so that in the future there will be no questions why the seller received exactly that amount.  And it is separately indicated how much remuneration the company will receive.  Moreover, it depends on those factors that have been described above.  In particular, on the volume of work performed.  And in this sense, the seller of the apartment has the right to choose. </p>

    <p>  He can use the full range of services of a real estate agent, which, of course, will result in a round sum, or choose several from the entire list.  In the latter case, the commission of a realtor will be small, but the budget of the landlord will not suffer so much.  Each seller has the right to choose the option convenient for him. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  To resort or not to resort to the services of a realtor?  This issue is also resolved individually.  If you decide to save on an intermediary, then be prepared to bear all the associated risks, for example, in the case of incorrect legal paperwork.  In addition, today the real estate market is operating a lot of scammers who crank up the most sophisticated scams with apartments.  Maybe it's better to turn to specialists for help and not save on them?  As you know, avaricious pays twice. </p>
