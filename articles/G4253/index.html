Marina Beach is one of the most popular properties of the city, which attracts tourists from all over the world.  There is sea and sand, the sun and a <span>joyful mood</span> - everything is like in a <span>glossy magazine.</span>  Let‚Äôs learn in more detail everything about Marina Beach in Dubai, get acquainted with reviews about this place and see painfully beautiful photos. </p><h2>  How to get? </h2><p>  Let's start with how to get to Marina Beach in Dubai. </p><ul><li>  Taxi is the most common way among tourists.  The price will depend on the area from which you get, as well as on the presence of traffic jams - as a rule, the city is in the evening.  If you go from the <span>towers of the Burj Khalifa,</span> the price of the road will be approximately 50 dirhams (about 850 rubles). </li><li>  Metro - Red Line, Jumeirah Lake Towers Station or Dubai Marina.  The beach will be another 10-minute walk from the metro; you will have to use the ground crossing.  If you do not want to go, transfer to a tram that will take you directly to the epicenter of the sea and the sun. </li><li>  From the airport, you can get to Dubai Marina in Dubai by bus F55A, which also passes through the main attractions of the city.  From Ibn Battut Mall there is a number 8 bus, also direct to Marina. </li><li>  Of course, you can get here by your own or rented car.  Parking costs 20 dirhs per hour (about 340 rubles), but if you become a visitor to local cafes, you can leave your car here for free. </li></ul><h2>  General information </h2><p>  Marina Beach in Dubai is located in the same area - Marina.  In just a few years this place has become very popular and, as a result, crowded.  The area is considered one of the most expensive in the city, and new hotels, malls, skyscrapers, apartments, etc. are constantly being built here. It is worth noting that many people call this recreation area Jumeirah Beach Residence or simply JBR.  The appearance of the beach is fascinating: on the one hand we see a blue transparent sea, snow-white sand and bright sun, and on the other, tall skyscrapers approach.  In general, the picture resembles films about the future, and thanks to this, the beach becomes atypical and very attractive. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.westgatedubai.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="aerial view of the beach" class="if uuid-2581936" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/2581936.jpg"></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Dubai Marina beach itself is free, everyone can get there.  Those who come here from other areas most often relax on towels or simply lie on the sand.  Nearby hotels offer their guests sun loungers, but "visitors" who also want to relax in comfort, pay them at very high prices (from 50 dirh per hour).  Also, the recreation area is equipped with all amenities.  There are locker rooms, showers, toilets.  Also near the beach there are more than enough restaurants and cafes, but more on that later. </p><h2>  Everything for fun </h2><p>  Due to the fact that millions of tourists come to the beach throughout the year, the entertainment infrastructure here is more than level.  At first glance, everything is standard.  It is possible to ride on a boat, on a banana, on a bun.  You can also rent a catamaran or kayak.  On the beach, Marina ride on standboards and on small sailboats.  For kids, a whole water park is built here, where you can stop by for an hour, paying 65 dirhams (about 1,100 rubles) for this, and for a whole day at a price of 95 dirhams (about 1,600 rubles).  More budget-friendly children can have fun on the inflatable playground, which is located directly on the beach.  There are many slides with a descent directly into the sea, a maze and a whole bunch of other interesting entertainments. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.at" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Marina Beach children's slides" class="if uuid-2581935" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/2581935.jpg"></div><h2>  Beach atmosphere </h2><p>  This is generally a separate issue.  Marina Beach is a place so diverse and motley that you can easily get lost and not navigate.  The point is as follows.  Mostly it is a beach.  Therefore, the vast majority of people here walk in extremely simple clothes, and most often in swimsuits.  However, a newly built promenade stretched along the beach.  This is a gorgeous place, which is built up with fashionable restaurants, bars, nightclubs and more simple summer cafes.  That is why here you can easily meet a typical "lady with a dog" and in a hat, and a barefoot Indian who will barely save up money to travel to this paradise will walk around her. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Marina Beach in the evening" class="if uuid-2581933" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/2581933.jpg"></div><h2>  Separately about restaurants </h2><p>  Given the fact that the Marina area in Dubai is a purely tourist destination, there are restaurants with a wide variety of cuisines.  There are European and Arab, Indian and Far Eastern, Italian and French.  You can find everything from exquisite delicacies to those products that we eat at home every day.  Riviera Beach Grill bar is very popular among tourists, also enjoys good fame Copper Dog Dubai.  Very atmospheric and very cozy place Areia Beach Bar &amp; Grill.  Especially visitors emphasize the very cozy and fashionable restaurant The Ciao Ristorante, which serves fine wines. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tui.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Restaurants" class="if uuid-2581937" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/2581937.jpg"></div><h2>  Beach Hotels </h2><p>  Dubai Marina Beach is one of the most expensive places in the city.  Almost every six months, new five-star hotels, new apartment towers, and new penthouses appear here.  In a word, if you are willing not to save on your vacation, then finding a decent home with all the amenities, with the sea at your side, with a pool, a jacuzzi and other benefits of civilization will be very easy.  Of the hotel names we know here are the following: Sofitel, Ocean View, Hilton and Rotana.  Of course, rooms with a view of the Persian Gulf are very expensive, but if the windows face the opposite street, you can save some money using the same benefits as everyone else.  All hotels offer their guests umbrellas and deck chairs, as well as the adjacent beach area, which is regularly cleaned from debris and algae. </p><div class="photo" data-original="traveluxblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels on Marina Beach" class="if uuid-2581930" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/2581930.jpg"></div><h2>  Traveler opinions </h2><p>  Hearing reviews about Dubai Marina from travelers who have been here means getting extremely useful information.  Is everything really so good here and there are no tricks?  But they, alas, are available.  The first one is that the beach is very crowded.  Here, not only hotel guests bathe, but also everyone who wants to enjoy the summer atmosphere and luxury.  Therefore, the water in the sea, although it is regularly cleaned, is cloudy.  The beach itself is clean - it is cleaned regularly.  It is also worth noting that alcohol is here under the so-called partial ban.  They sell it either in hotels or in restaurants that are attached to hotels.  In free-standing bars and cafes, there is no alcohol in principle.  It is undesirable to appear drunk on the beach, because if local guards or the police notice this, troubles can begin. </p>
