    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  This is the first question that a tourist planning a vacation in Sukhumi should ask.  Reviews say that the city is equally distant from the Russian and Georgian borders, and the distance from both of them is only 100 km.  Sukhumi is located on the shores of the bay of the same name in the Black Sea.  Part of the city is built up by the private sector, this is mainly Cape Red Lighthouse.  And the whole city lies in a beautiful valley surrounded by mountain ranges. </p><p>  To get here from Russia, you must initially get to Adler.  From there, you can already get a commuter train to the Abkhaz capital.  There is also a direct train that goes to Abkhazia from Moscow.  From a large number of cities in Russia there are intercity buses. </p><h2>  Excursion holidays in Sukhumi (reviews of tourists) </h2><p>  If you like to walk and learn a lot every day, then come to Abkhazia.  Here, every corner of the country is a magical miracle of nature, or a creation of man.  Waterfall and rocks, rivers and picturesque bays, stunning architectural monuments, wonderful memories will remain for life. </p><p>  The most interesting is, of course, an excursion vacation in Sukhumi.  Reviews of tourists emphasize that staying here, you can see the whole country.  The presence of the airport allows using a helicopter to fly around everything, and even to visit the inaccessible mountain villages of Pskhu.  Here people have been hunting and fishing for thousands of years, and the <span>mountain honey</span> collected in these parts is considered the best. </p><p>  The cost of the tour is not the lowest, about 20,000 rubles, but a group of about 20 people is going to.  But it's definitely worth it.  Flying over picturesque gorges, stunning snowy peaks will definitely not leave anyone indifferent. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vacation in sukhumi october reviews" class="if" height="294" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1351674.jpg" width="600"></div>
