And soon you will become the idol of the children, they will follow you on the heels , you can arrange whole contests and competitions ... And all this is only because you know the secret: how to make <span>soap bubbles</span> at home. <br><br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to make a solution for soap bubbles" class="if" height="266" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11773/130021.jpg" width="400"></div>  As adults, we know the ins and outs of the process that young schoolchildren and preschoolers have yet to learn to ensure success.  We proceed from the fact that the soap bubble is a three-layer membrane (film-water-film), due to the <span>surface tension, which</span> tends to take the most minimal form in terms of <span>potential energy</span> - the sphere.  Experimenting on the strength and elasticity of the membrane, we will learn <span>how to make soap bubbles</span> at home not only beautiful, but also long-lived. <br><br>  The short life of soap bubbles is provided by salts dissolved in water that violate the integrity of the membrane.  To remove them, it is enough to properly boil water for a soap solution, let it stand and carefully pour it into a separate bowl so that all the salts remain at the bottom.  No need to wait until the water cools down: the warmer the water, the faster the remaining ingredients dissolve in it. <br><br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to make soap bubbles at home" class="if" height="358" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11773/130020.jpg" width="500"></div>  Do not really puzzle over how to prepare a solution for soap bubbles.  The simplest composition may also be advantageous: one part of ordinary laundry soap for ten parts of water.  But this is not just once and for all established pattern.  Each Maestro of Soap Bubbles goes to his own, one and only composition experimentally.  By the way, try to apply the above recipe in the winter, as soon as the temperature drops below -7 degrees.  In this case, sunny weather is highly desirable. <br><br>  Try the following recipes and choose the best way to make soap bubbles at home:

Almost any.  In summer, they can serve as any hollow straw or blade of grass.  The artificial plastic straw through which they drink cocktails will also look stylish.  (Just remember to split the outlet end into several petals.) Many soap bubble store kits are closed with a cap that has a ring constantly immersed in the solution.  For its manufacture, you can use any thin and sufficiently rigid wire, the ring should be 4-5 cm in diameter. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Large soap bubbles at home" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11773/130019.jpg" width="600"></div>  And now we will reveal the terrible secret of the masters of the original genre and get big soap bubbles at home.  So big that they can fit a man!  Even a few!  You will need a bowl of mortar, two long sticks with round hooks at one end and a rope well moistened with mortar (twists from gauze or bandage).  The rope must be threaded into the hooks of both sticks so that there are no loose ends and its upper part is shorter than the lower.  It is advisable that the weather on the street be calm or a gentle breeze walks around the courtyard.  Take the basin out into the courtyard, thoroughly moisten the rope and conjure over the huge bubbles that shimmer with all the colors of the rainbow! <br><br>  Yes, and more.  Do not make any special secrets on <span>how to make soap bubbles at home.</span>  Then you can regularly arrange in the yard a large children's party for the title of Maestro of Soap Bubbles.  A sea of ‚Äã‚Äãjoy, excitement and positive emotions is provided!
