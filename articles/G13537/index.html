His labors are like a blazing fire in the gloom of impenetrable darkness.  After all, it was he who managed to shed light on the existing gaps in the system of national education, making it primarily accessible not only to representatives of the upper classes, but also to peasants.  Today, the famous works of Lomonosov have been translated into many languages ‚Äã‚Äãand are used in many fields.  So, what are the works of Lomonosov known? </p>

    <h2>  Chemistry </h2><p><strong> </strong>  Mikhail Vasilievich was an ardent opponent of an irrational approach to the study of chemical phenomena.  He was skeptical of the sciences of the past that did not receive a reasonable explanation.  In addition, he was opposed to the theory of ‚Äúweightless fluids‚Äù and the significance that was accorded to her in explaining all kinds of physicochemical phenomena of the time. </p><p>  Mikhail Vasilievich began to engage in <span>chemical research</span> in his student years.  He was the first to present chemistry in the form of science, not art.  He carried out most of the research in the laboratory built by his order. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  According to Lomonosov, a true chemist needs to play two roles: theorist and practice.  In other words, to find application for their hypotheses in the corresponding practical activity.  According to the corpuscular philosophy recommended by him, he subdivided chemicals into the so-called ‚Äúprinciples‚Äù, ‚Äúcomponents‚Äù and ‚Äúmixed‚Äù. </p><p>  After receiving the required preparations, in 1744, Lomonosov conducted a long series of studies on the breakdown of salts and metals.  He divided the conducted dissolution processes into two groups: with the release and absorption of heat.  Indeed, as is already known, the process of dissolution of metals in acid is characterized by heat generation, and in the process of dissolution of salts in water it, on the contrary, is absorbed. </p><p>  Lomonosov himself described the processes of dissolution from the mechanical positions inherent in his era.  It is also important to note that he described his observations very accurately, controlling chemical processes using a microscope with a 360-fold increase. </p><p>  Conducting experiments on the splitting of salts in water served as a prerequisite for the emergence of the so-called phenomenon of solvation in aqueous solutions (hydration).  Based on this phenomenon, when interacting with water, salt disintegrates into ions, and those, in turn, are closely surrounded by water macromolecules adjacent to them. </p><p>  After some time, he released the doctrine "On the metallic luster", and a little later - "On the birth and nature of nitrate." </p>

    <p>  MV Lomonosov suggested that in chemistry there are two groups of special qualities of chemical bodies.  To the first group, he attributed the bodies, which are constantly dependent on the possible interweaving of particles, to the second group - their color, crystallinity, taste, smell and other qualities. </p><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__0-vn-module__w5i"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__1-vn-module__w5i"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__2-vn-module__w5i"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__3-vn-module__w5i"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__4-vn-module__w5i"></div></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Also, this scientist studied the theory, on the basis of which, any color (except black) can be divided into three - yellow, red and blue. </p><p>  Despite the large number of <span>physicochemical experiments</span> he conducted <span>,</span> most of them remained unfinished.  In all likelihood, the reason for this was the scientist's unique versatility. </p><p>  The scientific works of Lomonosov in chemistry contributed to the formation of the necessary base for subsequent observations.  His merits in the field of physical chemistry served the formation of this science in Russia.  Lomonosov‚Äôs scientific works in chemistry contributed to such a shift in the development of this science that even after a while, the scientist‚Äôs personality received a lot of attention from his followers. </p><p>  But his main achievement was the promotion of chemical literacy.  The most striking example of such a slogan is the "Word on the Benefits of Chemistry", read by him at the Academic Assembly in 1751. </p><h2>  Physics </h2><p>  He was rightly considered the "father" of Russian physics.  The techniques and methodological views of Lomonosov had a distinctive feature.  Unlike most associates, he made extensive use of hypotheses in research and was the first to reveal the presence of molecular and atomic particles of substance in nature. </p>

    <p>  Even in his student years, he became interested in physics, or rather, in the theory of the structure of matter.  In any science, he was attracted mainly by fundamental aspects of a philosophical nature. </p><p>  Lomonosov was first suggested that there was a so-called <span>absolute temperature zero.</span>  Then, with the introduction of such a measuring device as scales, he was able to substantiate the fallacy of the opinion about the increase in the specific gravity of metals during their burning.  That was M.V. Lomonosov.  His scientific works in many ways laid a good foundation for the development of modern physics. </p><p>  It was he who first formulated the assumption about the interconnection of electric and light phenomena, about vertical flows as sources of atmospheric pressure, about the electrical origin of the aurora. </p><p>  The works of Mikhail Vasilievich Lomonosov in physics have become a significant contribution to this science.  He devoted much time to the analysis and explanation of the nature of light phenomena, as well as the doctrine of color formation.  The first who attempted to determine the relationship between the processes existing in nature was M.V. Lomonosov.  His works contributed to a tangible shift in the development of almost all areas of physics. </p><p>  He devoted much time to studying electrical phenomena.  At that time, the question of the existence of static electricity was almost not posed.  Representatives of their attitude to electricity as an inexplicable mythical fluid flowing into an electrified vessel were not to the liking of the materialist Lomonosov.  The scientist approached the explanation of the phenomenon of electricity in the same way as when interpreting the phenomena of light and heat.  Lomonosov has written several works on the study of atmospheric and static electricity. </p><p>  But this famous work of Lomonosov was not limited.  It is impossible not to mention his molecular-kinetic theory of heat, which is based on the doctrine of the organization of matter from atoms and molecules.  It is described in more detail in his essay, Reflections on the Cause of Heat and Cold. </p><p>  Such questions about the nature of physical phenomena were solved by M.V. Lomonosov.  The works and studies of the scientist in physics have led to the fact that at the beginning of the twentieth century, physics became the leading science in the field of natural science. </p><h2>  The first Russian astrophysicist </h2><p>  Interest in celestial phenomena arose in Lomonosov in early childhood, when he observed the magnificent pictures of auroras.  He glorified himself as the first Russian astrophysicist, the founder of scientific astronomical expeditions. </p>

    <p>  Already in the first years of his professional career, he brought to the world many discoveries in the astronomical field.  He carefully watched the movement of the planets of the solar system in an astronomical observatory, studied sunspots, comets and other celestial objects - such was the famous astrophysicist Lomonosov.  His scientific works to this day are especially popular among astronomical researchers. </p><p>  One of the most unique achievements of Mikhail Vasilievich in astronomy was the identification of the climate on Venus.  This discovery was the result of final observations by scientists of the rarest phenomenon - the advancement of Venus on the solar disk.  His scientific report was called: "The phenomenon of Venus in the Sun, observed at the St. Petersburg Imperial Mayan Academy of Sciences on 26 days of 1761." </p><p>  A little later, he vouched for the preparation of these observations and the subsequent departure to Siberia of two astronomical campaigns.  Astronomers of most European countries were preparing to contemplate this rare phenomenon.  In the light of these events, the Academy of Sciences for the first time participated in an event of this magnitude.  Lomonosov also conducted a series of independent observations at his observatory. </p><p>  The discovery of the atmosphere on Venus became a prerequisite for the further development of astrophysical science in Russia. </p><h2>  Metallurgy, Mineralogy and Mining </h2><p>  The main works of Lomonosov, written in the field of mining, were a unique manual for mining workers. </p><p>  The earthquake in Portugal, which claimed the lives of more than eighty thousand people, prompted him to study the causes and effects of earthquakes.  In his writings, he outlined in detail the most complex process of development of the earth's surface.  The sudden movements of the earth's crust, in his opinion, could be caused by both natural causes - tremors, volcanic eruptions, landslides - and other powerful natural disasters.  The names of Lomonosov's scientific works on ore mining are familiar to every miner or metallurgist.  For example, such a well-known ‚ÄúWord about the birth of metals from earth shaking‚Äù. </p>

    <p>  In his writings, he systematized and described the existing hypotheses about the extraction and smelting of metals.  It was he who at one time published the manual ‚ÄúThe First Foundations of Metallurgy, or Ore Affairs‚Äù.  This doctrine rightfully served as a significant find in the study of the mining industry.  He improved the well-known principles of mining, was engaged in the development of new machines and mechanisms. </p><p>  Lomonosov dreamed of conducting large-scale research activities involving other scientific representatives of our country.  Based on this, various samples of ores and minerals began to be sent from everywhere to the scientist.  In a word, about one hundred and twenty factories of Russia participated in the selection of the samples necessary for the study. </p><p>  Unfortunately, Lomonosov was not able to bring his plan to life.  This work of his was successfully completed only after the lapse of years by Academician V. M. Severgin, and the unique mineral was subsequently named lomonosovite in honor of its discoverer. </p><h2>  Optics </h2><p>  Lomonosov designed and constructed more than ten inventions in the field of optics.  He completely devoted himself to science.  Lomonosov did not stop and until the end of his days engaged in the production of instruments for night observation. </p><p>  The first who designed and built the optical bathoscope was M.V. Lomonosov.  His works have always aroused great interest among the public.  Also, the mechanism of the ‚Äúhorizontoscope‚Äù designed by him, a large device for observing far-placed objects on a horizontal surface, was not left unattended. </p>

    <p>  The technology for the production of colored glasses was also described by M.V. Lomonosov.  These works were subsequently applied in industry in the preparation of colored glass, as well as in the manufacture of parts from it.  Glass making was one of Lomonosov‚Äôs main passions.  Comprehending the mysteries of this material, Lomonosov never thought of using the results of his research for personal purposes.  Mikhail Vasilievich wanted to share the fruits of his labors with the people as soon as possible, to bring them to the benefit of the state. </p><p>  The most talented inventor and instrument-maker, the founder of Russian theoretical optics was Lomonosov.  His works gave impetus to the further development of optical science in Russia. </p><h2>  Linguistics, philology </h2><p>  At the beginning of the eighteenth century, the Russian language was full of foreign and Church Slavonic words, colloquial speech.  Lomonosov was always bothered by his cleanliness and impeccability.  He devoted a lot of time to the description of his literary canons.  The works of <span>Lomonosov in literature</span> gave rise to the notorious "Rhetoric", the publication of which seemed to be an important cultural event of that time.  In this work, a linguistic scientist mentioned that a lecturer holding an audience should pay attention to the age of the students, their gender, upbringing and level of education.  The speech of the rhetorist himself must be understandable, informative, reasoned and emotional.  "Rhetoric" was presented in plain language and was intended for the general public. </p>

    <p>  Another colossal work by Lomonosov, entitled ‚ÄúRussian Grammar,‚Äù was the first of its kind to study Russian grammar.  The first to attempt to identify the articulation norms of the Russian language was Mikhail Vasilievich Lomonosov.  His works were aimed at increasing the importance of his native language, at concentrating the spiritual heritage. </p><p>  While still a student, he wrote the essay "Letter on the rules of Russian poetry", where he described the basics of Russian versification, examined the known forms of verses and sizes. </p><p>  A later and mature essay entitled ‚ÄúA Preface on the Use of Church Books in the Russian Language‚Äù examines Lomonosov‚Äôs doctrine of the ‚ÄúThree Calmnesses‚Äù, which includes ‚Äúhigh, mediocre and low calmness‚Äù.  Each has a specific literary genre: </p><ul><li>  poems about heroism, odes, solemn speeches correspond to a high "calm"; </li><li>  theater scripts, friendly letters - average; </li><li>  low "calm" characterizes direct everyday conversations, songs, ballads. </li></ul><p>  Lomonosov is rightfully considered the creator of the Russian scientific and technical terminological base.  Scientists introduced many new formulations, created a style of scientific explanation of the material.  <span>Lomonosov‚Äôs works</span> in the field of literature are very diverse: these are poems, odes, solemn speeches, tragedies, and much more.  Most of the poetic heritage is occupied by odes written in honor of any event or person. </p><h2>  Geography and meteorology </h2><p>  Lomonosov woke up interest in geography at the beginning of his professional career.  For many decades, he was interested in the <span>Northern Sea Route</span> and the possibility of exploring it.  In a guide entitled ‚ÄúA Brief Description of Various Travels in the Northern Seas and an Indication of a Possible Passage by the Siberian Ocean to East India,‚Äù he gives a description of such a passage and independently prepares its plan. </p><p>  Lomonosov even made a promise to supply the expedition members with the necessary tools and instruments, but he was not destined to see the results of the expedition.  The campaign took place in 1765, when Mikhail Vasilievich was no longer alive. </p>

    <p>  Traveling in the polar ice, according to Lomonosov, was always hindered by the ‚Äúicy mountains in the northern seas,‚Äù which had long worried the scientist.  He presented the characteristic of polar ice, explained the possible causes.  These considerations today seem to be significant.  Inspired by the ability to comprehend the Northern Sea Route, the geographer set about compiling a map of the Arctic Ocean. </p><p>  Most of his assumptions were confirmed only after two hundred years.  Lomonosov foresaw the location of the underwater ridge, which was subsequently found and explored.  Subsequently, this ridge is named after its discoverer. </p><p>  An invaluable contribution was made to the formation of the domestic ‚Äúphysics of the atmosphere‚Äù Lomonosov.  The works on "Phenomena of the air, from the electric force occurring" talk about possible meteorological phenomena.  With special respect, Mikhail Vasilievich treated weather forecasts, insisted on the need to establish a network of weather stations. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  At the beginning of the eighteenth century, interest in Russian history began to grow in Russia.  An important role in the development of historical doctrine was played by M.V. Lomonosov. </p><p>  He was interested in the further development of the Old Russian state.  Having timely studied sources and modern periodicals, Lomonosov questioned the assumptions of historians that the Normans laid the foundation for our state. </p><p>  Lomonosov believed that the strangers were Slavs, and the great-power state began with them.  Mikhail Vasilievich made statements regarding the fact that the Russian-speaking people, even before Rurik came to power, had come a long way in the development and establishment of an original culture. </p><p>  In 1751, Lomonosov set to work on a large-scale study ‚ÄúAncient Russian History‚Äù.  Part one was released only after his death and was soon translated into many languages. </p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> In 1760, taking the annals and other significant historical documents as the basis, Mikhail Vasilievich published ‚ÄúA Brief Russian Chronicler with a Genealogy‚Äù containing an inventory of noisy epoch-making events from the reign of Rurik to the death of Peter the Great. </font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Mikhail Vasilievich loved his homeland, he sacredly believed in the strength and unity of his great people. </font></font></p>

Among other things, Lomonosov showed a lot of attention in relation to the development of agriculture and advocated population growth. </p><p>  The material well-being of the Russian state, according to Lomonosov, is completely dependent on the fulfillment by him of his economic functions. </p><p>  The special works of Mikhail Lomonosov in the economy are poorly preserved, which greatly complicates the study of his economic views. </p><p>  Based on existing work, we can conclude that Lomonosov's main focus was on studying the Russian economy.  For the benefit of society, a full-fledged economic strategy of the state was developed, illustrated by a set of practical guidelines. </p><p>  It was to him, Lomonosov, that we should be grateful for the emergence of such a discipline as Economic Geography.  Throughout his career, Lomonosov followed the traditions of the Russian economic school, significantly enriched and strengthened its position, despite the fact that many of Lomonosov‚Äôs main works did not have the necessary effect on his contemporaries.  Nevertheless, the economic ideas laid down in the works of the great scientist, and today are subject to further reflection. </p>
