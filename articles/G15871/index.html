    <p>  The Komarovsky market is loved for its cleanliness, beauty, comfort and low prices.  A variety of products are offered by enterprises of the food industry of the republic: dairies, bakeries, meat plants, confectionery factories, greenhouse farms.  In company stores, goods are sold at producer prices. </p><p>  The seasonal rows work year-round, where they buy sour cream, cottage cheese, berries, fruits, vegetables, nuts, etc. Farmers come here with home-made cottage cheese, butter, sour cream, cucumbers, tomatoes, strawberries, and other products from personal households. </p><p>  Once in the Komarovsky market, it is impossible to go home without a purchase.  But it was not always so. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The century before last on this land was the village of Komarovka.  It belonged to the princes of the Radziwills.  After the war of 1812, the village became the property of the Minsk landowner Stanislav Vankovich, and even later became part of the city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Until 1925, Komarovka was a marshland.  In the area where the urban poor lived, unsanitary conditions prevailed, and infectious diseases spread.  Where trade is now going briskly, there was a clear field on which S. Utochkin made demonstration flights. </p><p>  After draining the swamps, the area was built up with new houses and various buildings.  The Institute of Physical Culture appeared, the square of the Belarusian poet Yakub Kolas, a giant furniture store.  Trolleybuses and trams ran through the streets.  Near the Furniture House is a collective farm market, named after the former village of Komarovsky. </p><h2>  Building architecture </h2><p>  Although the Komarovsky market in Minsk was designed on the basis of the building of the <span>Chelyabinsk</span> shopping center <span>, the architectural</span> features of Komarovka are unique.  The roof was assembled from light dashboards fastened with thirty-seven ropes. </p>

    <p>  Each rope consists of one hundred and twenty-four heavy-duty <span>steel wires.</span>  Breaking strength - about three hundred tons.  Ropes are tightened around the perimeter of the edge of the roof, which makes the structure light.  The highest point of the dome is raised to a height of a ten-story building - 26 meters from the ground. </p><p>  The exterior facades are finished with colored gummed coating, golden glass and polished granite. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Komarovsky market in Minsk was designed by architects V. Aladov, A. Zheldakov, V. Krivosheev, M. Tkachuk. </p><h2>  Sculptures </h2><p>  Near the market there is a multi-stage fountain and urban sculpture.  The authors of the compositions are V. Zhbanov, A. Tukhto, O. Kupriyanov, E. Kolchev. </p><p>  The idea to decorate Komarovka with sculptures appeared in the early 2000s.  Various objects were offered to the attention of the directorate of the trading company, but the famous Belarusian sculptor Vladimir Zhbanov became the winner of the competition.  He presented the sculptures "Lady with a Dog" and "Photographer".  The objects were placed as if a bronze lady was posing in front of an old camera. </p>

    <p>  No less interesting is the sculpture "Horse", made by V. Zhbanov in collaboration with Alexander Tukhto.  It seems that the animal came to a watering place.  A small bronze sparrow was attached to the horse‚Äôs back, which unscrupulous citizens unscrew from time to time, and the city authorities have to restore the composition.  Bronze geese found their place on the steps of the fountain.  This is a joint work of Vladimir Zhbanov and Evgeny Kolchev.  Important, proud birds, like the horse, seek to quench their thirst. </p><p>  Sculptor Oleg Kupriyanov immortalized traders with seeds in the image of Komarikha‚Äôs grandmother.  A burly elderly woman not only offers goods to customers, but also feeds birds.  A signboard flaunts over grandmother from bronze: ‚ÄúKomarovsky market.  Opening hours from 9.00 to 19.00.  Monday is the day off. ‚Äù </p>

    <p>  The sculptural compositions of Komarovka became another attraction of the city.  Here children play and tourists take pictures. </p><h2>  Neighborhood </h2><p>  Komarovsky market (address: <span>Vera Khoruzhey</span> street <span>,</span> 8) is located in the Soviet district of the capital.  Nearby is a two-story Furniture House, where people come from all over the city.  Belarusian and foreign manufacturers offer beds, chairs, kitchen sets, stools and other goods. </p><p>  The kingdom of sofas and wardrobes is an independent trading facility, but due to the close proximity, the association ‚ÄúKomarovsky market - furniture‚Äù has firmly taken root in the minds of Minsk residents. </p><p>  A little further is Yakub Kolas Square, in the center of which there are monuments to the classics of Belarusian literature and the heroes of his works.  Behind the monument, the architects provided for the twin towers.  The Minsk Printing Plant is located in one building, and the computer manufacturing plant in another. </p><p>  Opposite the monument and the towers is the building of the Belarusian State Philharmonic.  Symphony orchestras, choirs, dance groups and soloists perform in the concert hall.  Here students and graduates of art schools, specialized gymnasiums and lyceums, students of the Belarusian Academy of Music give academic concerts.  The building of the Institute of Physical Education was given to the National Olympic Committee. </p><p>  The Komarovsky market sells mainly <span>food products.</span> </p>
