And this is not surprising.  Since it is one of the best and largest Russian banks engaged in consumer lending.  However, the list of services provided by him is quite wide.  Many today go to the bank to make a deposit.  Home Credit is well known.  And that is why this organization provides its customers with this opportunity. </p><h2>  "Quick income" </h2><p>  This is the first tariff that I would like to note with attention.  How is this contribution different?  Home Credit offers the following conditions: an 8 percent annual rate, an unlimited contribution amount (with a minimum of 1,000 rubles), the possibility of topping up an account - and all this for 9 months.  Interest is paid at the end of the stated period. </p>

    <p>  If, at such a tariff, a person will invest 1,000,000 rubles, then after 9 months he will receive 60,000 in profit. And if this is not replenished, there is such an opportunity, but only during the first 30 days after the deposit is opened.  It is important to keep this in mind. </p><h2>  "Profitable Year" </h2><p>  This is another fairly profitable Home Credit contribution.  As you can understand, based on the name, open it for 12 months.  The yield, taking into account the <span>capitalization of interest,</span> reaches 9.13% (this indicator is calculated in accordance with Bank of Russia Ordinance No. 3194-U of 02.27.14).  And so the interest rate is 8.75%. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The minimum investment amount, again, is 1,000 rubles, the maximum is not limited.  The replenishment function is available, but with the same conditions as in the case of the “Quick income” tariff.  But interest can be accrued monthly. </p><p>  If you count, it turns out that by investing a million, at the end of the period you can get 87,500 rubles in profit.  And this is at the standard rate, excluding interest capitalization. </p><h2>  For long term </h2><p>  There is such a contribution “Home Credit”, which is called “Maximum income”.  It is very popular among customers.  True, there is one small nuance - you can open it only in the Internet bank.  But nowadays this is not a problem. </p>

    <p>  Return on capitalization reaches 9.34%.  The standard rate is 8.75%.  And the term for which the deposit is opened is 18 months.  It turns out that having invested a million, at the end of the term a person will receive an amount of 131,250 rubles as interest income.  And this is without taking into account capitalization.  That’s even more.  Therefore, Home Credit Bank is so popular.  My account, by the way, provides access to important information that everyone should know if you want to open this contribution.  Anyway, Internet banking is a useful and convenient service. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  By the way, there is also a contribution “Capital”.  It opens for 36 months, at an 8 percent rate.  There is no capitalization, all interest is at the end of the term.  But they are rather big - 240 000 rubles profit, if you invest a million. </p><h2>  Special offers </h2><p>  Pension contribution can be safely attributed to this category.  It opens for 18 months, the base rate is 1,000 rubles.  Interest payments are monthly, and with capitalization, by the way, the rate increases to 9.34%.  You can open this deposit by presenting a pension certificate. </p>

    <p>  Another suggestion is called the “Cabinet”.  It is ideal for people who want to invest a large sum.  Otherwise, it will not work, since the minimum should be 3,000,000 rubles.  The term of the deposit is calculated in 12 months, and the standard rate is 8.9%. </p><p>  To open any of the deposits, you need a document that is an identity card.  The Home Credit Bank makes the simplest requirements for its customers.  However, each client of this organization can start a personal account, and with it, find out all the details of interest, no matter what they concern. </p><h2>  Distribution geography </h2><p>  Well, since the organization does not offer any more deposits to its customers, it’s worth a little talk about the Home Credit Bank itself.  St. Petersburg, Moscow, Elektrostal, Klin, Podolsk, Solnechnogorsk - this is not the whole list of those cities where you can find a branch or operational office of this organization. </p>

    <p>  It is worth listing the addresses of the central Moscow branches.  One is on the street.  Valovaya, d. 21, p. 125. There is still one branch on the street.  Sergius of Radonezh, d. 6. You can also find offices on the street.  Avtozavodskaya, d. 4, on the street  Truth, d. 8 building 1 and on the street.  Krasnoselskaya Verkh., D. 38/19, p. 1 </p><p>  And this prevalence is understandable.  After all, the bank has long been working in the retail banking services market.  In 2012, for example, he had 6,356 offices of a very different format and about 69,000 points of sale.  Needless to say, such devices as Home Credit ATMs, which can be found everywhere.  Since the main activity of the organization is the issuance of loans, it is worth noting that on October 1, 2013 the bank occupied about 26.4% of the lending market at points of sale in the Russian Federation.  And this is the first place! </p><h2>  About loans </h2><p>  Loans are issued here on the same simple and transparent terms on which deposits are accepted.  In each branch of Home Credit Bank, the addresses of which are freely available, the potential borrower will be told that there are more advantageous offers for people who are already clients of this organization. </p>

    <p>  So, for example, the amount of cash that they are given is from 10,000 to 850,000 rubles.  For those people who just contacted the bank, the range will be smaller - from 30,000 to 500,000. Applications are processed equally quickly - for a maximum of two hours.  But only for customers a loan can be issued for a maximum of 84 months, and for the first time applicants - for 60. But the most important thing is, of course, the interest rate.  For customers of the organization, it is 17.9%, and for all others - 19.9% ​​per annum. </p><p>  Home Credit Bank can be considered very profitable.  The addresses closest to the place of residence should be remembered and contacted if you need to use the services of profitable lending or arrange a deposit on good and flexible terms. </p>
