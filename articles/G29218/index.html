Using this type of gadget greatly facilitates driving at the time of a call, does not affect safety, and besides, this pleasure is quite accessible to everyone. </p><h2>  Voice Types </h2><p>  It is worth noting that many modern cars already come from the factory with built-in speakerphone systems, which are controlled by buttons either on the steering wheel or on the center console. </p>

How to talk in the car through the speakerphone in this way?  You just need to configure the receiver, which takes a few minutes. </p><h2>  Hands free </h2><p>  As an alternative to such a device, you can use the hands-free gadget, which is attached using the built-in clothespin or to clothes, or directly to the steering wheel.

We install a radio in the car.  If one already exists, then half the battle is done.  We fix the microphone on the sun visor or in another convenient place, but preferably from the driver‚Äôs side, and connect it to the radio.  The system is mounted.  It remains to configure: turn on the work of ‚ÄúBluetooth‚Äù on both a mobile and a tape recorder.  Next, we begin the search for a paired device, connect - you can use it. </p><p>  Special headset and accessories: </p><ul><li>  The first and most affordable device is the headset.  Pretty convenient device that can be used even outside the car.  Many models are equipped with buttons for receiving and resetting calls, as well as a volume control. </li><li>  The second device is the speakerphone in the car through the speakerphone.  Externally, the headset resembles the phone itself, but it only works as a transmitter of an <span>audio signal.</span>  The speakerphone is powered both autonomously and from the car‚Äôs cigarette lighter socket. </li><li>  The third type of device is gadgets with the Bluetooth feature.  To a greater extent, they are designed for stationary installation in a car.  You can fix such a gadget in any convenient place in the cabin, and it will work as a transmitter and as a speakerphone in a car. </li><li>  Hands free kits.  These are multifunctional devices that can be used both as a communication device and for reading various multimedia files from a phone.  The kit is equipped with various holders for easy installation in a car, a charger powered by a cigarette lighter plug.  Expensive models may have slots for connecting USB and memory cards. </li></ul><h2>  Speakerphone Jabra Drive </h2><p>  This is a popular gadget not only among motorists.  This device works as a speakerphone in the car via Bluetooth and has excellent sound characteristics.  In appearance, the device is quite overall - 104x56x18 mm, it weighs 100 grams. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  The design of the gadget is quite attractive and fits seamlessly into the interior of any car.  Its fastening is made in the form of a metal bracket, so it can be easily fixed in the cabin. </p><p>  Most of the front of the case is occupied by a speaker for negotiations, protected by a black mesh.  Along the way <span>, the speaker device</span> acts as a button to receive and reset calls.  Above the speaker button is a receiving microphone, as well as a volume control. </p><h2>  Device in operation </h2><p>  At startup, it automatically searches for a mobile phone to connect to it via Bluetooth.  Therefore, before connecting the speakerphone in the car, you need to make sure that the phone is paired with the device. </p><p>  Talking on the device is very convenient, since the quality of the transmitted audio signal is no different from the hands-free devices built into the car.  The sound is clear, without interference, and the volume is enough even to listen to music files. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to talk in the car through the speakerphone" class="if" height="301" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1154157.jpg" width="468"></div>  The microphone is equipped with an echo and noise absorption system.  Therefore, the interlocutor does not even notice that the conversation is on speakerphone.

    <h2>  Speakerphone selection options </h2><p>  Due to the large number of devices on the car market, it is quite difficult for motorists to choose a device that will meet all the requirements and properly perform its functions.  Therefore, when choosing one, it is recommended to pay attention to such factors as: </p><ul><li>  Manufacturer.  Handsfree in the car can be provided only with a high-quality speakerphone.  To do this, when choosing, you should pay attention to the country in which the device is manufactured.  It is important to note that Chinese gadgets do not have sufficient reliability and durability due to the use of low-quality materials. </li><li>  Battery capacity  It should be large enough so as not to bother with frequent charging processes. </li><li>  Fasteners.  This element should be reliable and convenient, since in the opposite case, the device may simply fall away. </li><li>  Mandatory availability of the ability to charge the device from the cigarette lighter outlet, which is more convenient than constantly removing the device and charging from other sources. </li><li>  The presence of the Russian language in the settings and use menu. </li><li>  Price.  As you know, avaricious pays twice.  Therefore, it is recommended to immediately purchase a more expensive speakerphone of good quality and use it for a longer time than buying a new one from time to time. </li></ul><p>  So, we figured out how to set up the speakerphone in the car. </p>
