It also has a fitness center, beauty salon and hairdresser. </p><p>  The complex has an amphitheater in which entertainment shows and discos are held in the evenings.

It will certainly appeal to those tourists who consider the immediate proximity to the coast a prerequisite for relaxation.  The hotel's beach is one hundred meters from the building.  It has a sand cover and is equipped with umbrellas and sunbeds.  There is a bar on the coast where you can order refreshing drinks. </p><h2>  A bit about the resort </h2><p>  Monastir was once a Roman village (Ruspina).  Currently, the city has become a popular resort, attracting many tourists with inexpensive holidays and beautiful beaches.  There are many historical attractions and thalassotherapy centers.  The city attracts with its close proximity to Sousse.  The tourist area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSkanes is moved outside the Monastir, which allowed to preserve the pristine atmosphere of the city. </p><h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  Monastir is rich in places that may be interesting for tourists.  First of all, it is worth seeing the historical center of the city.  Medina, the mausoleum of Bourguiba, Ribat.  The yacht port can be seen while walking around the city.  For those who do not like to walk a lot, taxis that work on the meter will be an excellent option. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="eden club 3 tours" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1536736.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  As a resort, Monastir has good beaches, but they are less successful than the coast of Djerba or Hammamet.  Here, you can often observe the accumulation of algae and the unrest at sea.  Therefore, lovers of perfect water open spaces are better to look for a hotel in other resorts of Tunisia.  But in Monastir built many budget hotels that are popular with tourists.  The Eden Club 3 * refers to such ones (reviews are given in the article). </p><p>  In addition to local attractions, guests can enjoy numerous guided tours.  In the city itself, you should definitely see Medina in the old city.  The Grand Mosque is its core value.  Vacationers will be interested in the wonderfully preserved Ribat fortress, which is an example of Islamic military architecture of the 8-11th centuries.  Another attraction is the mausoleum of Habib Bourguiba, in which the bodies of the first president of Tunisia and all members of his family are buried. </p><p>  In Monastir you can buy magnificent souvenirs for relatives: wooden and leather products, ceramics, oils, cosmetics.  All these products can be bought in the largest supermarket in the city of Yasmina Center, which is located in Medina. </p><p>  Monastir is a city where guests can go scuba diving, horse riding and golf.  These three sports directions are incredibly developed and popular here.  There are two international golf courses in Skanes.  As for diving, it is not as gorgeous here as in other resorts of the country, but there is something to see here.  The coast has a sandy bottom with rocky sections.  And nearby are several uninhabited islets, in the shallow waters of which you can observe the fauna.  In reefs and grottoes there are starfish, sponges, hedgehogs and a variety of algae. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="eden club 3 tunisia monastir" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1536754.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Riding enthusiasts can visit the Skanes Ranch, which runs a saddle school. </p><p>  Monastir is rich in restaurants, the best of which are located in the port area of ‚Äã‚Äãpleasure yachts.  In them you can taste the best dishes of fresh seafood, as well as get acquainted with the national cuisine of the country.  Sometimes the institutions in the city center offer more varied and tasty food than hotel restaurants. </p><h2>  Eden Club 3 * <span>(Tunisia): reviews</span> 2016 </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, I want to refer to the reviews of vacationers who have already managed to visit it.  According to tourists, the indisputable advantage of the complex is its location.  For a beach resort, an important indicator is the proximity of the coast.  In this sense, Eden Club 3 * (photos are given in the article) can be considered an ideal place, since the road to the beach does not take more than two minutes.  In general, the hotel offers a wonderful view of the sea.  Sunbathing in the recreation area near the pools, you can enjoy the beautiful coast. </p><p>  Why is the Eden Club 3 * hotel so popular among tourists?  Tours offered by vacationers have a fairly reasonable price.  Tour operators recommend it as an analogue of a four-star establishment, but at a better price. </p><p>  I would like to note that the hotel receives mostly positive reviews, which speaks for itself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="eden club 3 tunisia monastir" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1536741.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  According to vacationers, the hotel has a good staff that friendly welcomes guests.  The settlement of tourists is fast enough.  And no matter what time you arrived.  If you arrived earlier than the set time, you will be accommodated without delay, and it is not at all necessary to pay extra at the reception. </p><p>  The number of rooms in the complex is not very new, although the last renovation took place not so long ago.  In general, the apartments are quite spacious, but the furniture and sanitary ware in them is not new.  Some rooms have terraces or balconies.  Especially nice apartments with views of the coast. </p><p>  Maids clean the rooms with sufficient quality, while the presence of tips is not at all mandatory.  Towels are changed daily; bed linen is changed every other day.  The only place the cleaners do not reach is the balconies, but this is not so important. </p><p>  The hotel always has hot water.  But air conditioners are not very good at their job. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  What is the nutritional situation at Eden Club 3 *?  Reviews in 2016 confirm its worthy level.  During the meal, you can see the chef in the restaurant, who evaluates the work of the waiters and adjusts them on the go.  It is evident that he is interested in ensuring that hotel guests are satisfied with both the quality of the food and the level of service. </p><p>  According to guests, the food in the complex is better than in many four-star establishments.  Such estimates speak for themselves.  As a rule, it is food that causes a lot of controversy among tourists.  However, this does not apply to Eden Club 3 * (Tunisia, Monastir). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="eden club 3 tunisia reviews 2016" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1536738.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  All the food in the hotel is very tasty and varied, there is always something to choose for children.  Baking from the chef is incredibly popular among tourists.  The restaurant even has coffee machines.  On the tables there is always a considerable selection of meat dishes, side dishes, cakes, desserts.  But from fruit, usually there is only one name: watermelons, pomegranates or apples.  For lunch and dinner, something delicious is always prepared in the barbecue area. </p><p>  The waiters work very promptly and try to please the customers, without any hint of a tip. </p><p>  The only drawback of the restaurant is the presence of flies and mosquitoes.  But this, apparently, is a problem of a hot climate.  In principle, no one here pays any attention to insects, although one could hang Velcro for flies. </p><p>  The hotel is doing well with drinks.  Locally produced drinks are poured into bars without restriction: vodka ‚ÄúBuha‚Äù, beer, wine. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  The hotel complex has a lot of advantages, including animation.  Hotel guests do not have to be bored.  During the high season, the animation team incredibly actively works with vacationers.  The morning begins with active exercises and water aerobics, during the day, many sporting events await guests, and in the evening in the amphitheater an incendiary show program.  Animators pay attention to the smallest vacationers.  The young people from the animation team are incredibly positive and enjoyable. </p><p>  The hotel has its own water park with four slides.  According to tourists, they require repair, because during the descents all joints are felt.  But you can ride, the skin is not injured. </p><p>  The hotel staff is very polite and attentive, however, you should be aware that the local population decided to greet everyone.  Observing simple rules of courtesy, you can get along perfectly with the employees of the complex and without a tip. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="eden club 3 tunisia reviews" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1536740.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  There are a lot of insects in Tunisia.  In the morning flies get bored, and in the second mosquitoes appear.  To make the rest more comfortable, it is better to bring mosquito repellent and a fumigator. </p><p>  The hotel has its own beach, located close to the coast.  The coastline has a sand cover and a comfortable gentle entry into the sea.  There is a bar on the beach.  Sometimes algae and jellyfish appear in the water, but they do not spoil the picture too much. </p><p>  Near the hotel there is a bus stop with links to Monastir and Sousse.  In order to see their attractions, just use public transport. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Eden Club 3 * (Tunisia) (the reviews are given in the article) is an excellent budget hotel for those tourists who are looking for a relaxing holiday on the sea coast.  The complex fully complies with the price-quality ratio.  For a reasonable price, hotel guests get a good room, excellent food and relaxation on a beautiful beach. <strong></strong></p>
