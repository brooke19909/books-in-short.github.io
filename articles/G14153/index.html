  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hong Kong hotels - modern practicality combined with the romance and mystery of the East.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Hong Kong Island, now part of China, is an example of the classic Economic Miracle.  After creating a <span>free economic zone</span> on its territory in the early 80s of the last century, a cash flow literally poured here in pursuit of cheap goods.  In turn, the local industry was not long in coming and many large and small factories for the production of consumer goods and electronics were opened, and a lot of cheap <span>labor</span> contributed to this <span>,</span> thanks to which low-cost goods were produced (and still are).  The financial surge pulled along with a new infrastructure.  With unprecedented speed, new <span>high-rise buildings were</span> lined up for entire blocks <span>, the</span> vast majority of which have a design in the high-tech style that has become classic here. </p><p>  Surrounded on all sides by the waters of the warm Chinese sea, Hong Kong is a mysterious city in which daytime and especially nightlife are boiling.  Tourists from all over the world are attracted not only by beach vacations in Hong Kong, but also by the opportunity to plunge into the night world of various entertainments, where everyone can find exactly what he needs.  An important circumstance is that here, due to the cheapness of goods, it‚Äôs just a fabulous shopping experience. For lovers of this lesson, there are a lot of shopping centers scattered everywhere: from the center to the outskirts, some of them are literally on the beaches. </p><p>  Hong Kong hotels are very numerous, as the stream of thrill seekers from all over the world does not leave any of them without work.  Here you can easily rent simple 3-star rooms, as well as de-luxe and presidential suites, as well as entire penthouses at the top of skyscrapers with in-room pools, helipads and other attributes of the life of millionaires.  By the way, thanks to vigorous economic activity, Hong Kong in terms of the number of millionaires living here occupies one of the leading places around the world.  Almost all Hong Kong hotels offer very comfortable rooms equipped with the latest technology: there is always air conditioning, the vast majority of hotels provide free WI-FI access or high-speed cable Internet, cable multi-channel television. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Most tourists who come to rest prefer to spend the day on the beaches, and at night they rush to the nightly entertainment venues of the city.  Periodic shopping "races" in shopping centers and bazaars are also practiced.  Therefore, the most experienced choose Hong Kong hotels in such a way that it is easy to reach both the coast and the city center.  One of the most convenient in this regard is the <strong>Ramada <span>Hong Kong</span></strong> hotel <strong>.</strong>  Reviews of Hong Kong hotels speak of him as a very respectable place, offering 4-star relaxation with marble bathrooms, beautiful rooms, decorated in a "East" and amazing views from the windows of Victoria Bay.  The hotel is located near the Sheung Wan subway station where there is a free shuttle service from the hotel, and IFC shopping center is also completely free. </p><p>  Analyzing the reviews of vacationers about hotels in Hong Kong, we can conclude that you should not chase a special cheapness, as this has a downside.  Hotel City Garden 3 *, for example, is a classic example of this.  It is relatively cheap, but located in a very remote place.  Getting out of it somewhere is so inconvenient that it is not compensated even by a fairly good level of service.  Of the most geographically advantageous and proven in quality can be noted the <strong>Grand</strong> Hotel <strong> </strong>  <strong>Hayatt</strong> <strong>(</strong> for five stars), which many recommend for holidays in Hong Kong, as well as <strong>Y-Loft Youth Square (3 *),</strong> which although it has a three-star class, but the rooms are spacious and the staff is very friendly, the service is at a level You can get out of it easily and quickly anywhere.  In a word, actually four stars for little money. </p><p>  Hong Kong hotels are very diverse and numerous.  Therefore, before a trip to the island, it‚Äôs useful to decide what exactly is planned to be done on vacation and, based on this, choose a hotel with a proven level of service and positive reviews from those who have already been there. </p>
