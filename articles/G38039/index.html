    <p>  The history of <span>the Cathedral of</span> Palermo dates back more than fifteen centuries.  In this place in the fourth century there was a church named after the martyr Mamilian.  Then it was destroyed by vandals, and the Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary was erected in its place (in 604).  Two hundred years later, namely in 831, Palermo was captured by the Arabs, who turned the temple into a Friday mosque.  When the Normans came to the city in 1072, the building was again christened in honor of the Virgin. </p><p>  Subsequently, the temple was destroyed, and from it there remained only the column of the southern portico, located on the left, and the crypt.  Therefore, in the second half of the 12th century, a new building was built in its place - the cathedral.  Since that time, the building began to gradually expand and finish building.  Initially, it was a three-nave church with three apses.  But a hundred years later, towers were completed at the corners of the building, and another decade later a sacristy appeared in the southeast. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the time, construction work was stopped.  The construction continued only in the 14-16 centuries: </p><ul><li>  1342 - built on the four corners of the tower; </li><li>  1352 - a Gothic portal appeared on the west side; </li><li>  1426-1430 - the construction of the southern portico, decorated with lancet arches; </li><li>  15th century - a green garden was laid out on the territory; </li><li>  1575 - a balustrade was erected, decorated with statues of saints. </li></ul><h2>  Description of the Cathedral in Palermo </h2>

    <p>  The building underwent serious reconstruction at the very beginning of the 19th century.  It was then that the appearance of the Cathedral of Palermo (Italy) underwent significant changes not only outside but also inside.  For example, the low dome was replaced with a wooden carved ceiling, and the imperial and royal sarcophagi served to create a ‚Äúmemorial‚Äù zone.  The fountain, which took pride of place in the square in 1744, was decorated with statues of saints.  In different years, Roger II, kings and emperors from the house of Gauguentraufen and their spouses were buried here.  In the 12-13 centuries, the coronation of all the kings of Sicily took place in the cathedral. </p><p>  Today, the cathedral is not only the main attraction of the city, where every tourist seeks to get.  It is also the place of conversion of all believers to God.  This stunning building combines the main elements of classicism, Arabic and Gothic styles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  North facade attractions </h2>

    <p>  The northern facade of the Palermo Cathedral in Italy is the embodiment of the complexity and duration of the construction of the structure.  One wall was significantly extended, after which seven side chapels were added nearby, the tops of which are decorated with mini-domes.  As a result of such an architectural solution, the northern portico, built in 1536, merged with the general facade and lost its original purpose. </p><h2>  South facade of the cathedral </h2><p>  This part of the building especially underwent changes during the reconstruction.  If earlier here the elements of Gothic and Norman motifs prevailed, then after there became more features of classicism.  Particular attention is attracted to itself by a large dome built on the intersection of the axes of the main nave and transept.  It stands out against the background of small elongated domes adorning the side chapels and made in the Norman style. </p><p>  There are also other elements in which there are also Gothic features: false arches with battlements, a classic large dome and several small above the chapels, which were attached during the expansion of the nave, narrow loopholes, a portico with lancet arches and columns, and so on. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Inside the portico there is a portal decorated with a mosaic image of the Virgin.  Both of these elements are the work of Gambara.  The interior of the portico is also decorated with numerous marble plaques. </p><h2>  Western building facade </h2>

    <p>  This is the main part of the Cathedral, which overlooks Via Bonello.  Its western portal was built in 1352, and Gothic style predominates in its design.  It is framed by two small bell towers.  A very delicate sculptural stucco decorates them with abstract Islamic and floral motifs.  On each tier of the towers there are Arab-Norman arches and windows, which are divided in half vertically by a narrow column. </p><h2>  East facade of the Cathedral </h2><p>  This part of the attraction is made in a typical Arab-Norman style.  Bright elements in the design of the three ledges of the facade are false arches, sophisticated abstract inlays of tuff and lava, floral ornaments, battlements.  Only thanks to the two bell towers, which are the twin towers on the west side, the entire building of the cathedral looks like a single whole. </p><p>  The building of the sacristy is also designed in oriental style.  Its upper tier consists of a series of deaf windows and loopholes of arches decorated with rows of battlements on top.  From such decoration the sacristy is very similar to a real fortress. </p><h2>  Bell tower and chapels </h2>

    <p>  The bell tower, erected by the Normans, looks like a fortress.  It is connected to the cathedral by <span>pointed arches.</span>  In the 19th century, the upper part of the central bell tower was reconstructed, as a result of which it acquired Gothic features.  In the 20th century, she was crowned with a statue of the Madonna. </p><p>  Most of the relics of the Cathedral are collected in the side chapel of the Relics, located in the southern nave.  The list of cultural values ‚Äã‚Äãincludes the relics or parts of the relics of the martyrs Oliva, Agatha, Ninfa, who until the 18th century were revered as patrons of the city.  Also here are parts of the relics of Equal-to-the-Apostles Mary Magdalene.  It is impossible to get here with a guided tour, since access is blocked by a massive grate. </p><p>  The relics of Saint Rosalia, who was the patroness of not only Palermo, but of all of Sicily, are in another chapel bearing her name.  Opposite her, a valuable altar made of lapis lazuli found a place.  His chapel bears the name of the Holy Mysteries. </p><h2>  Other interior sights of the cathedral </h2>

    <p>  The cathedrals and temples of Palermo are known not only for coronations and sarcophagi.  For example, in the 18th century, astronomical observations could be made in the Cathedral Church.  Here was a special heliometer with zodiacs, preserved to this day.  Exactly at twelve o'clock in the afternoon the sun's ray falls precisely on the image of that constellation in which the sun is now. </p><p>  Outside and inside at almost every step there are various statues - the work of famous artists.  The most famous is the Virgin and Child, located in the northern nave.  It was erected in 1469 by Francesco Laurana.  Also in the Cathedral there are a lot of works by Antonello Gagini. </p><p>  The altar of the temple is made in the Gothic style.  Here is the episcopal throne, which partially managed to preserve the mosaic of the 12th century.  In the main apse of the cathedral in the 18-19 centuries there was a cycle of frescoes telling about the Norman era.  Images have survived to their days in their original form, unfinished. </p><p>  Palermo Cathedral is a unique architectural casket, which contains a large number of unique works of art from different centuries.  Marble statues, paintings by famous artists, architectural jewelry, jewelry from the imperial tombs, noble goblets and much more can be seen in this beautiful place. </p><h2>  How to get to the Cathedral </h2>

    <p>  The cathedral is located in the center of Palermo, so finding it is not difficult.  A walk from the train station takes only 20 minutes.  You can also use the services of a taxi driver or horse-drawn carriage. </p><p>  The doors of the cathedral are open for tourists daily.  From Monday to Friday, you can get inside from 8:30 to 18 hours, and on Saturday and Sunday from 11:00 to 18:00.  The only time that tourists are prohibited from visiting the cathedral is the time of the Mass.  On weekdays, it starts at 7:30 and 18:00, and on holidays - at 8:45, 9:45, 11:00 and 18:00. </p><p>  To visit the religious complex, you need to take care of the appropriate clothing: the shoulders must be covered, despite the weather outside the window.  Tourists don‚Äôt take money from visiting the cathedral.  But for the opportunity to see the treasury, the royal tomb, as well as the crypt, you have to pay: you need to buy a ticket.  Its price varies depending on the age of visitors: </p><ul><li>  for children from 11 to 17 years, the entrance costs 5 euros; </li><li>  adults will have to pay 7 euros. </li></ul><p>  This is the cost as of 2017 of a complex ticket that allows you to see all the sights.  If you want, for example, to see closer only the royal tomb, then the entry price will be lower. </p><p>  If you want to not only touch this architectural and cultural landmark with a long history, but also become a participant in the sacred action, then you should come to the Cathedral on July 15.  It is on this day that the feast of St. Rosalia comes.  On the eve of cancer, with its relics, it is carried out to the central part of the temple so that believers can bow to it.  The next evening, the cancer is carried by procession along the central streets of the city.  The procession is met in <span>Piazza</span> Villena by the authorities of Palermo, who present a holy wreath of rose flowers.  This action is symbolic and personifies the meeting of the city with the patroness. </p>
