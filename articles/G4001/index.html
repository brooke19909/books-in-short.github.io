The village is located on the Kama River and was founded in 1723.  The area under the city was inhabited in ancient times, archaeological excavations confirm that they lived here in the Stone Age.  In the XVII century  these territories belonged to the family of the merchant Stroganov. </p><p>  In 1720, Peter I issued a decree on the construction of the Yegoshikhinsky copper smelter, this date is also considered the official date of the founding of the city.  In 1878, the railway was already opened in the city (Perm-Chusovsky direction), the following years were a period of active construction of railways. </p><p>  In the late XIX - early XX centuries, the city rapidly rebuilt and became an important hub for passenger navigation of the USSR. </p><h2>  River Station </h2><p>  <span>The river station in</span> Perm was built in 1940.  Today it is an architectural monument of the city and its visiting card. </p><p>  The station is located opposite another historical building - the railway station of Perm-1 station. </p><p>  The Perm River Station building consists of three parts.  Central is the lobby and restaurant.  The hotel and the waiting room are located in the left wing.  In the right - administrative premises. </p><p>  After reducing the number of shipping in 2004, the station was closed, as the condition of the building fell into complete decline.  In 2010, the station housed a museum of modern art. </p>

    <h2>  Pre-war time </h2><p>  The city felt the need for a river station at the beginning of the 20th century, especially since the railway station building already existed.  However, the rulers who came to power in 1917, for a long time could not decide on this step.  Only in 1931 was the Kama River Shipping Company organized. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The project for the construction of a river station in Perm was commissioned by Alexander Grinberg.  This architect has already become famous for his magnificent projects, including the University of Yoshkar-Ola, the House of Soviets in the city of Gorky, the Opera and Ballet Theater in Novosibirsk.  But the leadership was constantly dissatisfied with the decisions of the architect, the project was reviewed for a long 8 years, from 1932 to 1940.  It was possible to complete it after the death of Greenberg. </p><p>  The deadlines for the completion of construction were also constantly postponed, then there were not enough funds, then specialists.  Despite this, on November 6, 1940, a river station was opened in Perm.  But even after the official opening, the deficiencies were still fixed for a long time.  At the time of the opening, there were no stairs to the pier, there were no stucco moldings and arched entrances on the building. </p><p>  Perm River Station became the second in the list of the most technically equipped, elegant and comfortable stations of that time.  The first on the list was only the metropolitan Khimki station. </p><p>  Before the war, fairs, exhibitions, social and cultural events were held here.  In the evenings, dancing evenings and New Year's children's morning performances were held. </p>

    <h2>  World War II period </h2><p>  With the outbreak of war, the situation has changed dramatically.  Almost all employees, including directors, went to the front.  And passenger traffic, on the contrary, has grown.  After all, it was through the Perm river station that people were evacuated, the wounded, goods, including works of art and documentation of military and industrial enterprises, were taken out.  In addition, a military commandant‚Äôs office, a canteen, an evacuation and sanitary center worked in the building. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  While the war was on, there was a constant turnover of personnel.  The position of leader was visited by 5 people.  Old-timers say that there was an indifferent attitude both to the building itself and to the evacuated people, their property. </p>

    <h2>  Post-war years </h2><p>  After the peace came to the country and Perm, there were no cardinal changes at the station.  Only in the 50s of the twentieth century.  partially lined the walls with marble chips, tinted something, removed the bas-relief of Stalin. </p><p>  Only in the early 60s the fence was demolished, ticket kiosks appeared, and cargo terminals were moved on.  Later, the boiler room and pipes were dismantled, the territory near the building was landscaped. </p><p>  In 1975, the station building was given the status of an architectural monument of regional significance.  Since the 80s, the ‚Äúmoral aging‚Äù of the structure has become more noticeable, in the 90s the situation worsened, the building became very dilapidated. </p><h2>  2000s </h2><p>  In 2004, it was decided to close the station.  In 2010, PERMM was given permission to place contemporary art compositions in the Perm Museum.  The company carried out redecoration and masked the deterioration of the building by the malls. </p><p>  Already in 2013, by a court decision, the museum had to leave the building, and he moved to Gagarin Boulevard, 24. </p>
