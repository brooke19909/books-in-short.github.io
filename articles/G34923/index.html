It is located in the resort area of ​​Tuapse, but quite far from this city, in the resort village of Olginka.  Those who have long loved to relax in the Krasnodar Territory claim that this resort was formerly called “Yurga” and was famous for its high level of service.  This health resort is located in a picturesque place, in the middle of a relict forest of <span>Pitsunda pine.</span>  Belongs to the sanatorium "Green Valley" FSSP Russia.  Most vouchers are distributed (at prices below cost) among employees of the Federal Bailiff Service.  But if the health resort is not fully filled, anyone can buy a tour package to the sanatorium.  And of course, the price of a ticket in this case will be market.  Let's see what kind of services the health resort provides. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Green Valley Health Resort" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1771966.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is the sanatorium "Green Valley" </h2><p>  Tuapse is located thirty kilometers from the health resort.  Therefore, reviews warn that you will have to take a taxi to the place from the station.  The nearest airport is located in Gelendzhik - it's a hundred kilometers away.  You can take a bus to the resort village of Olgino, and already from the station to take a taxi - it will be cheaper.  One way or another, you can't do without a car.  "Green Valley" - a sanatorium, which is located two kilometers from Olgino, and even on a hill (sixty meters above sea level).  Do not rush to discard this option and look for another place to relax.  If you have respiratory diseases, healing pine air will be a worthy compensation for the difficult road from the beach (three hundred meters).  There is a sanatorium at the very border of the Agri Nature Reserve.  So, the ecological situation here is the most favorable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sanatorium green valley fssp Russia" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1771967.jpg" width="600"></div>

Relict pines grow everywhere, squirrels and chipmunks run, half-tailed raccoons walk slowly.  Not only walking paths, but also medical paths are laid along the forest park zone.  Reviews assure that the territory of the sanatorium is quite vast.  But even in the most remote corners, cleanliness and order reign.  Gardeners and park designers do everything so that the eyes of vacationers delight in some kind of seasonal flowers.  In addition to pines, many exotic shrubs and trees grow on the territory, each of them has a nameplate.  The sanatorium complex consists of several six-story buildings that fit perfectly into the Mediterranean landscape.  The resort has its own outdoor swimming pool. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sanatorium green valley Tuapse" class="if" height="430" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1771969.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Rooms and board </h2><p>  Where do holidaymakers settle in the Green Valley health resort?
