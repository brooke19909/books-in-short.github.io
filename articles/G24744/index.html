Comfort and cleanliness here are provided by both people and nature itself, so nobody wants to leave this resort.  The beaches of Dubai themselves are snow-white wide strips of sand surrounded by the clear sea.  It is always warm, sunny and beautiful.  And the natural beauty is complemented by the first-class equipment that the Arabs built for their tourists.  On each beach, you can literally feel at home. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dubai beaches" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/293093.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The main feature of this Middle Eastern resort is the absence of annoying beach vendors.  Therefore, if you decide to enjoy the silence, natural harmony, which is also not without modern progress and amenities, go to the UAE.  It is also worth noting that the beaches of Dubai can adjoin some hotel or villa, and can be public.  In the first case, the equipment of the recreation area depends on the number of stars of the hotel (but, as a rule, all closed beaches are the most upscale).  In the sandy valleys of public access, umbrellas and deck chairs are located at an impressive distance from each other, there are places for changing clothes and showers, and beach restaurants are located closer to the road. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="paid beaches in dubai" class="if" height="255" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/293095.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Dubai's most popular beaches are located in the coastal Jumeirah Valley.  This area consists entirely of five-star hotels, which also include nightclubs, restaurants, beach bars and schools, where tourists are taught windsurfing and kitesurfing.  Residents of these hotels can use all of the above services for free, and those who live in other institutions will have to pay for places and drinks. </p><p>  Making out their resort, the Arabs came up with a unique thing - a beach park.  The emirate has two similar infrastructures: <span>Jumeirah Beach</span> Park, as well as Al Mamzar Park.  There are paid beaches in Dubai, staying on which ranges from 5-10 dirhams per day.  The territory of the parks has everything that a tourist may need - souvenir shops, markets, restaurants, clubs, bars, children's clubs, parking and much more.  There are also swimming pools where you can refresh yourself if the ocean is a bit stormy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dubai city beach" class="if" height="362" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/293094.jpg" width="415"></div>

    <p>  Many of Dubai's beaches are located on the bulk archipelago Mir, and it is from these places that your underwater journey can begin.  In these waters is the largest <span>coral</span> reef in the entire Persian <span>Gulf</span> , which is constantly growing and blooming.  All divers and beginners in this business are immersed in local waters in order to see this miracle.  Well, experienced divers can swim not only under the waters of the bay, but also in aquariums, among schools of wild fish and incomparably beautiful sea animals. </p><p>  Of course, in such a popular sea city, there cannot be an aqua park.  On the territory of Dubai there are as many as 4 such entertainment complexes, so every tourist can find something to his taste.  As a rule, people who have chosen a city beach for themselves often rest in such places. </p><p>  Dubai is a city that is constantly being improved, and at the same time, rest there remains accessible to everyone. </p>
