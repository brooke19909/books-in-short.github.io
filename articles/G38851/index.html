    <h2>  What it is? </h2><p>  These are analogues of ordinary stationery, most often able to perform their original functions (draw, glue, wash), but they can be eaten.  It sounds weird, but for kids, it's a great way to have fun and have fun. </p><p>  There are shops that sell such goods in finished form, but most likely children will prefer to make edible school supplies with their own hands, because the process itself is a fun game where, in addition to accuracy and accuracy, you can show your imagination and personality. </p><h2>  How to make edible school supplies? </h2><p>  It all depends on what kind of stationery item will be manufactured.  Immediately it is worth considering that the production of multi-colored pencils and markers will require more effort and financial costs, because it will be necessary to purchase or manufacture raw materials for them.  And such items as an eraser, glue, a simple pencil, plasticine, less expensive to manufacture. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What might be needed?  Any products that are at home, or for which there is enough imagination: banana, cheese, crab sticks, straws, sausages, chocolate bars, chewing gums, marshmallows, marmalade, food colors, food pencils, marzipan, sugar mastic.  In addition, a variety of empty boxes and parts of ordinary stationery, molds for ice or confectionery, a board, a ruler, a knife will come in handy. </p>

    <h2>  How to make edible school supplies with your own hands: simple recipes </h2><p>  Simple options for making a school office: </p><ol><li>  Eraser.  It can be made simply by cutting from various products (cheese, crab stick, dense filling of chocolate candy).  The shape of the eraser can be anything from a regular rectangle or a beveled parallelogram to a voluminous fruit.  It is much more interesting to cook an eraser from mastic and marzipan.  Here you can show your imagination and add different bright colors to the subject.  To do this, the finished mastic of two colors (usually blue and red) and marzipan (white) are rolled out (the thickness of marzipan is 2 millimeters, and the thickness of the mastic is about 5-7 mm) and connected to each other with a ‚Äúsandwich‚Äù so that the mastic is in the middle.  An eraser is cut from this blank.  The finished product will be exactly like the original.  You can also prepare an eraser from gelatin, sugar and dye (food).  To do this, dissolve 2 teaspoons of gelatin in hot water, add 1 tsp.  sugar and a few drops / grains of food color of any color, mix the mixture, pour it into ice molds or just in a deep plate and refrigerate.  After solidification, the mass is removed and the eraser of the desired shape is cut out. </li><li>  Glue.  How to make edible school supplies that will be absolutely similar to the original?  Edible PVA glue is prepared very simply: you need to take marshmallows marshmallows, a little milk, mix them in a deep saucepan or turk and heat over low heat, stirring occasionally.  After the mass becomes homogeneous, it is allowed to cool.  In the meantime, you need to prepare the container for edible glue.  To do this, thoroughly wash the empty PVA bottle with running water, then rinse with a solution of soda and rinse well, allow the bottle to dry.  New glue can be poured into the bubble.  Its appearance is a white and viscous mass, and if you pour it on bread or cookies and combine, then they will stick together.  Another glue option is to use chewing gums as raw materials.  They also need to be heated so that they melt, and then pour into the bubble.  Such a filling for glue can be not only white, which will amuse others. </li><li>  Pens.  To make them, there are several options.  The first is to stick a lollipop on a regular pen (if it's thin) or stick a lollipop on its stick or attach candy / marmalade / candy / chewing gum to the back of the pen so that only the edge is edible.  The second is to insert the handle bar into any edible product.  This can be a sausage, a chocolate bar, a packet of Frutella or Mentos candies (for this they have to drill a hole with a drill and a thin drill), a crab stick.  You can wrap the handle shaft with multi-colored strips of mastic, as a result, you get a big sweetie. </li></ol><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="edible school supplies" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55974/1954916.jpg" width="450"></div></h2><h2>  Difficult options </h2><p>  These options include the manufacture of sets of markers and pencils.

Warm a ball of marshmallows so that it melts, pour seeds and air rice into this mass, and then colored powder, made from previously processed products, to give color to the pencil.  Stir, place in a mold or give the plastic mass the shape of an object with your hands.  Leave to dry.  Perform this procedure for the product of each color.  After that, you can use pencils like this, or you can wrap them in a wrapping paper label to give them the look you bought. </p>

    <h2>  Useful Tips </h2><p>  How to make edible school supplies has been described above.  The main thing is to observe safety rules in the process of working and further eating such items. </p><p>  Even if a child makes "new items" in his school bag on his own, parental control must be done.  So that an edible item does not harm health (poisoning, intoxication, vomiting, diarrhea, allergies, etc.), they must be thoroughly washed and disinfected when preparing inedible parts. </p><p>  It is also worth storing such accessories separately, preferably in a food container.  The shelf life of edible items depends on the material from which they are made, but it is advisable to eat them no later than three days from the date of manufacture. </p>
