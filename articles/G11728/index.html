    <p>  For a number of reasons, the hotel is not very popular with foreign travelers.  The Russians also did not like the rest in this hotel.  They were unhappy with the early breakfast.  According to them, the meal ended at 08:30.  Many did not have time to enjoy coffee and pastries.  The maids reluctantly performed their duties.  The need to change towels and cleaning the room had to be reminded persistently. </p><p>  There was only one key.  If several adults lived in the room, then you had to contact the reception staff for help.  They temporarily issued a duplicate or opened the apartment themselves.  For breakfast served mainly scrambled eggs.  Coffee was diluted strongly with water.  The staff speaks Russian poorly.  I had to communicate with gestures. </p><p>  On the day of departure, they are evicted from the room at 11:30.  Nowhere to leave things.  Tourists were forced to while away their time in suitcases.  For stains on towels and bed linen, fines are imposed.  Their amount is deducted from the deposit.  Travelers had to wash and bleach textiles on their own.  As a result, a certain amount was still withheld.  Given the cost of living, travelers consider this attitude to guests unacceptable. </p><p>  Many guests do not recommend the hotel.  There are few reviews about it, but they are all negative.  After leaving, things forgotten in the room cannot be found.  At the same time, employees admit that they saw them. </p>
