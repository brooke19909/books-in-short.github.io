In the Russian Federation, owners of vehicles are obliged to insure the car under <span>OSAGO insurance.</span>  But not all insurance companies are conscientious insurers.  There are also scammers. </p><h2>  Acquisition of MTPL agreement </h2><p>  Verification of the MTPL policy on the basis of the SAR has become relevant.  Now most customers work with the Internet.  And 3-5 days after the purchase of the policy, you can verify its authenticity on the main PCA website. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.drive2.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="AIS SAR" class="if uuid-2610534" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2610534.jpg"></div><h2>  Accident </h2><p>  The insurance policy is required in case of a traffic accident.  If the client turned out to be the injured party, and the culprit escaped, then the base of OSAGO policies will be simply necessary.  Without police officers, the body number, chassis, VIN-code, PTS number cannot be found.  But the state registration plate can be used to verify the existence of an insurance contract.  This information will help you find out if the client will be able to receive payment from the insurance company.  Verification of the MTPL policy by PCA will speed up the receipt of information. </p><div class="photo" data-original="int-moth.us" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Traffic accident" class="if uuid-2610524" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2610524.jpg"></div><p>  Checking the MTPL policy for authenticity in the database is also useful if the client was the culprit.  If the policy turned out to be fake, and an accident occurred, the client will have to pay for the repair of the damaged car.  MTPL makes life easier for car owners, but the choice of an insurance company needs to be taken seriously, since the policy is a guarantee of payment of damage to the injured party, and we are talking about large amounts (the cost of cars and spare parts is high), which can not always be found immediately.  The MTPL policy database helps to verify documents in order to avoid further problems in road accidents. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When filling out the form online, you must specify the date.  If the client simply wishes to verify the authenticity of the document, it is necessary to indicate the date of the current day.  And if an accident occurred with a third party, you need to specify the date of the event, since it is important that the document is valid for this period of time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.scoop.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Traffic accident" class="if uuid-2610521" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2610521.jpg"></div><h2>  Basic check </h2><p>  The check of the MTPL policy on the base is carried out through a unified system of AIS RSA (automated information system of the <span>Russian Union of</span> Auto <span>Insurers).</span>  It is carried out online.  To do this, you need a minimum package of documents. </p><p>  Algorithm of actions: </p><ul><li>  Log in to the genuine PCA website </li><li>  select the item ‚ÄúVerification of the MTPL policy‚Äù; </li><li>  then ‚ÄúInformation on the status of forms‚Äù; </li><li>  in the window that opens, you need to enter the policy data - series and number;  series, presented in letters, number - in numbers; </li><li>  specify code with verification; </li><li>  click on ‚ÄúSearch‚Äù; </li><li>  The answer will be displayed on the screen. </li></ul><h2>  Answer options </h2><p>  The MTPL policy base provides several answers. </p><ul><li>  The policy is genuine, the insurance company has entered all the data into a single database.  In this case, a table will appear with the data: form status - the policy has been issued to the insured (client), name of the insurance company that sold the policy, date of verification.  Here you need to check the expiration date to make sure that it has not expired. </li><li>  The policy exists, but has expired.  A table will appear, as in the first version, but the difference will be in the fact that the column ‚Äúpolicy status‚Äù will indicate that the deadline has passed. </li><li>  The contract does not exist.  In this case, checking the insurance policy on the database will give information that the form with these numbers is missing or does not exist.  After that, you need to re-enter your data in order to avoid mistakes, as often customers make mistakes in the rooms and receive incorrect information. </li><li>  The client has submitted an application for insurance, but the contract has not yet been concluded.  In this case, the check of the MTPL policy on the basis of the PCA will give information that the form is with the insurer, the name of the company.  If the contract has not been concluded, then the status of the form will not change.  This situation occurs if the client has submitted an application for the conclusion of the contract, but the insurer has not yet made a decision. </li><li>  The client purchased the policy, but the company did not enter the data into the database.  After purchasing insurance, you need to wait 3-5 days, then search for the contract on the base.  If there is no policy in the database a week after the purchase, you should contact your insurance company for clarification.  If nothing changes, then you need to write a complaint or question to the PCA database. </li><li>  The policy was canceled.  A table with data about the form appears.  But the "status" will indicate that the contract is terminated.  Insurance companies have the right to cancel the contract if the client knowingly provided false information.  The contract is considered terminated from the moment of discovery of the provision of false information. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="maltepesigorta.com.tr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Car insurance" class="if uuid-2610522" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2610522.jpg"></div><h2>  Additional types of checks </h2><p>  OSAGO authentication on the basis of the SAR is also carried out using additional devices and other documents. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  The MTPL policy base for the <span>vehicle passport</span> number <span>is</span> checked on the PCA website.  To do this, select "OSAGO Verification", then the "Information for determining the insurer by vehicle passport" window will appear, enter the document number, a series is not necessary.  Then select the ‚ÄúFind‚Äù button, a table will appear with information in which the insurance company will be indicated.  If nothing appears, a fake document has been sold.  The PCA system recommends checking the TCP number additionally, as customers may be mistaken and the information will be distorted.  Also, most customers confuse the document numbers PTS (vehicle passport) and STS (vehicle certificate).  The series and numbers of these documents are different, you do not need to enter the STS number. </li><li>  Authentication of an MTPL policy by PCA using VIN.  The VIN code is indicated in the documents of the STS and the TCP.  On the official website of the PCA, you need to select "OSAGO Verification", "Information / Information about the victims".  In the table that opens, you must enter the VIN number, registration plate of the car, body number, chassis, and verification code.  Next you need to select "Search".  If the policy is valid, insurance information will be issued; if not, the document is fake.  When entering a VIN code, you must be careful, as it consists of numbers and English letters.  In the insurance process, you need to pay attention to writing all the information in the policy and only then put a signature.  It may happen that the document is real, but the policy itself made a mistake during insurance. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="carrrs.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Insurance payments" class="if uuid-2610523" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2610523.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of the PCA website </h2><p>  In case of an accident, disputes are possible, for determining the number of drivers included, the RSA CTP insurance base will help.  This request is included in the verification form, enter the series, driver‚Äôs license number.  If the answer is yes, the program will respond to the question in green.  But, using only the series and number of the driver‚Äôs license, there is no way to find out the MTPL policy in which it was entered. </p><p>  The PCA website allows you to find discounts if they were lost earlier.  For example, a client insured a car, but only then noticed a lack of discounts.  The policyholder must go to the PCA website, indicate the requested data: passport, driver's license (if there was a replacement, then information about past rights).  Within a week, you will receive an answer to the mailbox with information about discounts.  You need to print a letter and go to the insurance company with this document to restore the class. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lomonteandcollings.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="CTP insurance" class="if uuid-2610533" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2610533.jpg"></div><h2>  Powers of insurance companies </h2><p>  Before purchasing a policy, the client needs to check the credentials of the insurance company chosen by him.  The right to sell OSAGO insurance is licensed by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.  The list of insurance companies is constantly changing, as not everyone adheres to the standards and remains afloat.  Before buying, the client may ask the representative of the insurer to show the license for the sale of the CTP insurance product.  If they refuse him for lack of reason, then it is better to refuse to purchase a policy. </p><h2>  On a note </h2><p>  Customers who have bought fake policies have the opportunity to receive insurance benefits, but this process can take a long time.  If the court determines that the owner of the vehicle purchased the policy, paid in full, the contract was concluded, then the probability of payment will appear.  This item was indicated in the recommendations of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="maxsecurelife.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="A large number of cars, the need for insurance" class="if uuid-2610538" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2610538.jpg"></div><h2>  Clients' actions with fake policies </h2><p>  If the PCA system revealed a lack of a policy in the database, the client will need to contact their insurance company.  To do this, you need to write a free-form statement requesting an investigation within the company, attach a copy of the policy and receipt to it.  Sometimes the above actions do not help.  In this case, the competent authorities will come to the rescue, who will establish why the concluded agreement is not in the system. </p>
