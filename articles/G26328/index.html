    <h2>  Christmas tree made from tinsel </h2><p>  As a basis, you will need a paper blank.  It can be a cardboard cone.  Fold the workpiece and secure it well with glue, tape or a gun.  Since everyone can make an unusual Christmas tree in the form of an animal, be sure to involve children in this miracle.  They will be happy to help you, and the evening will be filled with vivid emotions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now the most important thing: you need to understand what kind of beast you will portray.  A mouse or elephant, a snake immediately comes to mind.  However, you can try to make another representative of the animal world.  You can focus on the symbol of the year, then the resulting crafts will be the best gifts for family and friends. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what to make an unusual Christmas tree in the form of an animal" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1836041.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Getting started </h2><p>  A cone has dried up on the table, it remains to figure out how to make an unusual Christmas tree in the form of an animal.  Let's say it will be a mouse.  Then you need to separately cut the round ears and attach them to the cone on top.  Now, on a separate piece of cardboard, depict a muzzle with eyes and antennae, glue a long nose.  Place the workpiece on the front, top of the cone.  It remains to make our Christmas tree fluffy and beautiful. </p><p>  Here again, it all depends on your preferences.  It may be green, then take the tinsel of the appropriate color.  But no one bothers to make it white or gray.  You can again snap to the main color - the symbol of the coming year.  You will need four meters of fluffy tinsel, glue or double-sided tape.  To begin, coat the cone with glue.  Now you can start wrapping.  Focus on the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe face and ears.  If the tinsel is very fluffy, you will have to cut it to make the animal recognizable.  Do not forget to make a ponytail. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  For fantasy in the kitchen </h2><p>  And we continue to think about how to make an unusual Christmas tree in the form of an animal.  To do this, you can use the simplest pasta that every housewife has.  It is best to choose tubules with slanting edges.  However, turntables are also good.  To make the tree look festive, it is recommended to paint them.  To do this, you can initially cover each part with a suitable color, or first assemble the product, and then pour it from a spray can. </p><p>  And again, we need an idea.  Since you can make an unusual Christmas tree in the form of an animal of any shape and size, you have to decide for yourself what you want to use it for.  But what if you diversify New Year's Eve by playing a puppet theater?  Then we may need a wolf and a fox. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make an unusual christmas tree in the form of an animal" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1836040.jpg" width="333"></div>

    <h2>  Getting ready for the presentation </h2><p>  Paper cones can again serve as the basis.  Now we take our pasta tubes and begin to glue it in a spiral.  It is best to take a glue gun, scotch tape and ordinary PVA will hold quite poorly.  The costume for our chanterelle trees will be quite simple.  The bottom is a red skirt that can be glued in two layers to be magnificent.  Then we just continue to fasten the pasta until you reach the very top.  It remains to apply paint.  We take a spray can and make a fiery red skirt.  The transition to the waist can be distinguished by an elegant belt of woolen thread.  The top can be made green or gold.  Now glue the ears and muzzle.  Your tree-fox is ready, you can give it to friends or play with the children in a bun.  If you take the second cone and cover it with gray paint, you get a wolf. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="] how to make an unusual Christmas tree in the form of an animal description" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1836039.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <h2>  Christmas tree made of cotton pads </h2><p>  Continuing the conversation about what to make an unusual Christmas tree in the form of an animal, you can not forget about the inexpensive and very convenient material called cotton pads.  Every housewife has them at home, inexpensive, soft and very pleasant to work with.  And to make the Christmas tree especially festive, prepare ribbons and beads for decoration.  To create a work of art, you will again need a cone base, as well as a huge number of petals, which are made of cotton pads.  To make them, take one of them, fold them in half, and then repeat the procedure again.  Secure with a stapler.  When all the petals are ready, you can start collecting the Christmas tree by sticking them from the bottom. </p><p>  Now the most interesting: we proceed to the decoration.  Each petal can be supplemented with a bead or a piece of ribbon.  You can make any muzzle again.  Separately perform hanging ears and decorate them with the same petals.  Glue them into place, and then beat as desired.  It can be a spaniel dog or an elephant. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make an unusual christmas tree in the form of an animal photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1836045.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sweet gift </h2><p>  If you plan to surprise the children who came to the holiday, then prepare for them original sweet gifts.  And again, it will not be amiss to know how to make an unusual Christmas tree in the form of an animal.  Feel free to post photos of the resulting figure on your page on social networks, maybe next year you will have many orders for a similar work. </p><p>  You will need a cone, tinsel and light but tasty sweets.  Coat the surface with glue and glue one row with tinsel, and the second with sweets.  To fix them, it is better to use a glue gun.  Then proceed as you wish.  Herringbone can be made a light shell of airy fabric, depicting, thus, a turtle, but you can leave it like that. </p><h2>  Birds to decorate the forest beauty </h2><p>  If you have a sufficient number of blanks of artificial flower petals and feathers, then feel free to start making beautiful crafts.  To do this, take a small cone and prepare for it a blank of the head of a sparrow, swallow or pigeon.  The technique will be the same.  Glue the craft with feathers, fix the ring on top - and here‚Äôs the toy, craft or the original gift is ready.  Now you know how to make an unusual Christmas tree in the form of an animal.  The description of ideas is far from complete, and you can easily supplement it by proposing other materials or your manufacturing options. </p>
