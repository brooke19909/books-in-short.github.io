It is part of the Balearic archipelago.  Next to Mallorca, she was sheltered by her smaller sister - Menorca, a tiny but famous Ibiza (Ibiza) and completely microscopic Formentera.  But this article is not about the sights of the Balearic Islands.  We are interested in Mallorca in October.  Is it worth it to go there in the middle of autumn, or is it better to wait for the opening of the tourist season 2017?  We will by no means dissuade you from a trip to Mallorca in October.  But they do not intend to mislead the description of hot and clear days.  We just talk about the weather in the Balearic Islands in mid-autumn.

    <h2>  Beach season in the Balearic Islands </h2><p>  You can go to Mallorca anytime.  It is very beautiful there all year round, always a consistently high level of service.  But if we talk about purely beach vacations, then its season officially begins in early May and ends in late September.  But not everything is so simple.  Rich tourists and students are moving out.  But the velvet season continues.  Budget tourists and West European retirees are trying to catch summer by the tail.  A beach <span>holiday in Mallorca</span> in October is possible.  And numerous reviews of tourists are proof of this.  Of course, lying ‚Äúseals‚Äù on the beach all two weeks is unlikely to work, especially at the end of the month.  The breath of autumn begins to be felt in these subtropical latitudes.  Cloudiness, precipitation, which falls mainly on the northern part of the island, and sea swell are possible.  It is difficult to characterize a <span>beach holiday</span> in Mallorca in October for the reason that the weather this month is unpredictable.  A hot, sultry summer day can be replaced by a thunderstorm in the evening with a gale of wind and rain. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Majorca weather" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1471251.jpg" width="600"></div>

All the trees are covered with lush greenery, and the sea is still quite warm.  The summer surroundings of nature are enhanced by the cloudless sky, which delights Majorca tourists in October.  The clear days for this month are an average of twenty-one.  So the curtain of the beach season can be lifted and enjoy sea bathing and sunbathing.  But to go to Mallorca for a purely beach holiday is a risky business.  It may also happen that the autumn will be rainy.  And if it starts to rain, and it passes here with Spanish expressiveness, in the form of thunderstorms, showers, accompanied by floods and tornadoes, then there will be nothing to think about.  But such days can be a couple for the whole month.  The rest of the time the weather pleases with the sun and warmth.  But, unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the sea.  October in the Balearic Islands is the stormiest month.  Therefore, during this period it is better to get to Mallorca by plane, rather than by sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Majorca october reviews" class="if" height="370" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1471250.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Temperature indicators of the first half of the month </h2><p>  October refers to the transition period.  Therefore, the temperature indicators of air and water this month are significantly different.  The beginning of October may well pass for the continuation of the velvet season.  Sometimes it‚Äôs not just comfortable warm, but unbearably hot.  The maximum temperature in Mallorca in October was recorded in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe island's capital.  It was 33.4 ¬∞ C. But usually the thermometer in the first half of October rarely crosses the line at thirty degrees, and fluctuates in the range of + 24 ... +28 ¬∞ C. Excellent indicators for those tourists who crave a beach holiday, but the same time can not stand the heat!  The Mediterranean Sea at the beginning of October also behaves pretty well.  The probability of storms is low.  And the water temperature, although lower than in summer and in September, is still comfortable: + 23 ... +24 ¬∞ C. You can do long swims, and if the excitement starts, jump on the waves near the shore.  Be sure to bring sunscreen and ... a warm sweater.  After all, in the evenings, autumn makes itself felt.  At night, the thermometer can drop to plus sixteen degrees. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Mid month </h2><p>  The weather in Mallorca in the second decade of October may remain as idyllic as in the first.  But bad weather may come.  The probability of rain is greater in the mountains of Tramontana, in the north of the island.  Leave the Formentor and Port de Soller resorts for day trips.  It is beautiful, interesting, but in the middle of October it is windy, rainy, and fogs creep in the gorges.  Temperature during the day, especially on the east and south coasts, still has a beach holiday.  In the afternoon air warms up to twenty-four in the shade.  The sea cools more slowly, and its temperature remains within 23 degrees of heat.  But after passing a storm, water can become unexpectedly cold due to currents.  For swimming, you should choose secluded bays, which are many from the southwest to the southeast of the island of Mallorca.  It is best to stay in Santa Pons, Paguera, Magaluf, Arenal, Cala Millor, Alcudia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Majorca temperature in October" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1471253.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Holidays in Mallorca at the end of October </h2><p>  During this period, autumn is already beginning to fully take over.  This is especially felt in the evening and at night.  The thermometer column can drop to plus five degrees, and in the mountains and below zero.  Morning is also very, very fresh, so swimming at dawn or after sunset does not work.  But warm things to take with you is a must.  Do not forget to grab an umbrella - Mallorca in October can meet you with a drizzling rain, or even a shower.  But, despite the increase in rainfall, quite a lot of sunny days.  Then the air warms up to twenty-three degrees.  It is quite possible to settle on the beach and take sunbaths from noon to three in the afternoon.  But to make a long swim is unlikely to succeed.  A sea temperature of twenty-one degrees will satisfy only seasoned people.  But you can plunge into the cool waters completely. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mallorca Tours in October" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1471263.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Things to do in Mallorca in October </h2><p>  The coolness that comes to the Balearic Islands in the middle of autumn allows you to combine a beach holiday with an informative one.  Unlike summer, the tourist does not need to overpower his body in order to embark on a journey through the hot Mallorca for sightseeing.  Despite the official end of the beach season, tour agencies are operating at full capacity.  And you can rent a car or use the well-established public transport for independent travel.  Families with children and youth at this time are becoming few.  Their place is occupied by pensioners from Western Europe, who in October are not interested in Mallorca as an opportunity to swim and sunbathe, but to see its sights.  Feel free to go to Valldemossa, where Chopin and <span>Georges Sand</span> passed the winter in the old monastery <span>.</span>  No whims of the weather will spoil the excursion to the Dragon Cave (in Porto Cristo) or to Cuevas del Art with the largest stalagmite in the world (in Canyamel). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Mallorca in October" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1471247.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Mallorca Mid-Autumn Events </h2><p>  It may seem incredible, but Oktoberfest is also taking place on this island.  This is done to please German retirees who are firmly established in the Balearic archipelago (Spain).  Majorca is also famous for the Tango Festival in October.  Many great dancers not only from Spain, but also Argentina and other countries come to the island to demonstrate their skills and conduct master classes.  Gourmets are also not ignored.  It is in October in Mallorca that the Tapas Festival takes place.  Famous Spanish snacks - from dried slices of bread with soft sausage, paprika and honey to huge pans with paella - will be offered for tasting to all visitors to this delicious event.  But if you want to be in the center of all events, it is better to choose resorts nearby the island's capital - Magaluf, Santa Ponsa, Arenal, Illetas, Palma Nova. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Spain Mallorca in October" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1471248.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Mallorca Tours in October </h2><p>  An important advantage of a trip to the Balearic Islands in mid-autumn is its cheapness.  Hotels in coastal resorts, hoping to catch the latest customers, reduce prices to such a level that at first such offers seem like some kind of scam.  Apartments with a kitchen can be rented for eleven days for one hundred and sixty euros.  With the end of the tourist influx, the prices for flights also decrease, which makes Mallorca more accessible in October.  The reviews claim that low cost will take you to the island and back for one hundred and sixty euros (in particular, the low-cost carrier Norvegian). </p>
