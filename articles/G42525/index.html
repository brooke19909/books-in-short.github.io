As shown by many years of practice, cheap Chinese products launched on the market by little-known brands quickly got out of favor with users.  The fault is the poor quality and lack of decent service in Russia. </p>

Characteristics, photos and owner reviews will provide more interesting information about the product, and a list of basic requirements for kitchen appliances will allow the reader to make a choice. </p><h2>  Famous Brand Name </h2><p>  It's no secret that the Korean company LG is one of the ten best manufacturers of quality equipment in the world.  Therefore, any product released under the logo of this brand a priori receives the highest rating not only from experts, but also from customers. </p><p>  And it doesn‚Äôt matter in which country the products are assembled.  Here the <span>microwave oven</span> LG MS 2043HS is assembled in China, but it is fully covered by the warranty of the official manufacturer.  You should always remember this and not be afraid to purchase products marked Made in China. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  As for the warranty and after-sales service, the company has a complete order - three years of warranty and one year of free service.  A standard set that any eminent brand is able to provide, such as Samsung, Philips, Panasonic and other, no less well-known manufacturers. </p><h2>  First meeting </h2><p>  It‚Äôs hard to call a giant box easy - the LG MS 2043HS microwave weighs almost a dozen kilograms.  And if at first it seems that the device itself will be much smaller and lighter, then after opening the package, the buyer may be confused.  Users should be prepared for the fact that huge kitchen appliances will appear in the kitchen. </p><p>  In the kit, the owner will find in addition to the oven a glass plate, several instructions and a warranty card.  Yes, it‚Äôs difficult to call the equipment rich, but, on the other hand, what else could the manufacturer please the buyer with?  In their reviews, some users note that the bundle lacks a power strip.  Yes, there is a problem with the power cord (it is short - only eighty centimeters), but this is not a problem for most buyers, since many people install the oven in kitchen cabinets that have built-in electrical outlets. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Product Appearance </h2><p>  Reasonable price and beautiful appearance are the main criteria that the buyer is looking at.  This is what attracted the attention of the <span>microwave oven</span> LG MS 2043HS.  Technical characteristics are also interesting for users, but if you prioritize between the basic parameters, the affordable price will still win. </p>

    <p>  The microwave is simple and looks very beautiful in any kitchen.  As for the build quality, it is impeccable.  It‚Äôs immediately obvious that the product belongs to a serious brand.  On the device‚Äôs body, the user will not be able to find any flaws in the assembly.  Even a mounting system is provided on the bottom of the furnace. </p><h2>  Ergonomics through the eyes of Koreans </h2><p>  The black front panel with a mirror-gloss finish looks really nice, but, as practice shows, during operation it is this flatulence that turns into the headache of the owner.  Like any other mirror, the front panel quickly collects dust and fingerprints, which are not so easy to eliminate. </p><p>  Touch control is another problem that the LG MS 2043HS microwave oven has.  The photo of this device may look beautiful with many useful buttons, but in practice, everything is very complicated.  Firstly, the owner will have to get used to the sensitivity of pressing the function keys.  They are pressed all in different ways, which often causes negative feedback from users. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Secondly, the functions themselves are few.  The control panel is large, but the choice is rather poor.  On the other hand, in a conventional microwave oven there should not be any high technologies, because the simpler the device, the easier it is to operate. </p><h2>  Consumer abilities </h2><p>  An important criterion for most buyers is the energy consumption of a household appliance.  No one wants the purchased equipment to spend a lot of electricity.  Microwave oven LG MS 2043HS takes from the network 1 kW of energy per hour.  This is quite a worthy indicator, if we draw an analogy with electric appliances such as an iron or an electric kettle. </p><p>  As for the efficiency of the furnace, it is 70%.  That is, for every kilowatt of electricity, 700 watts are converted into microwaves.  You can‚Äôt call such an indicator worthy, but it is still more effective than with cheap Chinese products, where the efficiency is about 50-60%. </p><h2>  Inexplicable functionality </h2><p>  There are several useless features that the LG MS 2043HS microwave oven has.  The technical specifications announced by the manufacturer attract the attention of the buyer with information about the existence of an economical mode that can seriously reduce energy consumption.  However, during the operation, a strange fact is discovered, which causes the negative of many users.  The fact is that in the economy mode, the digital clock is simply turned off.  Where the savings are here is not at all clear. </p>

    <p>  In general, the manufacturer devotes too much time to the built-in watch.  Only one time setting takes a whole chapter over several pages in the user manual.  It is better not to mention the timer either - its functionality is described so carefully that many users try to understand for whom LG technologists actually created this microwave oven. </p><h2>  Useful features </h2><p>  As for the merits of LG MS 2043HS, there is something to please the future owner.  Better to start with automatic camera backlight.  The built-in sensor responds to opening and closing the door, turning the bright LED lamp on and off.  The furnace is equipped with a loud speaker through which the user is notified of the completion of the task.  Also, the microwave has protection from children. </p><p>  The advantages can be attributed to the presence of the function of defrosting products.  Moreover, the process itself is quite high quality.  Judging by the reviews of many owners, this is one of the few ovens on the domestic market that does not fry meat during defrosting.  By the way, the built-in temperature sensor can turn off the device at the end of defrosting products. </p><h2>  Minor flaws </h2><p>  It is clear that many buyers want more from the LG MS 2043HS microwave oven.  The technical characteristics of such a famous device were simply obliged to contain grill and convection in their list.  However, the manufacturer upset his fans.  This is indeed a serious flaw, which almost all potential buyers pay attention to. </p>

    <p>  Also, the operation of the built-in temperature sensor is not entirely clear.  He knows how to monitor the process of defrosting products, but for some reason he does not maintain heat.  This is already strange, because this functionality is in demand in almost every housewife. </p><h2>  Recipes </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews of the owners, many find it difficult to work with embedded programs.  The manufacturer, trying to please the buyer, created special settings for the preparation of popular dishes.  Taking this functionality to the control panel in the form of special buttons and giving them beautiful names, the developers apparently expected a standing ovation from users.  But they got a negative. </p><p>  The fact is that you can work with programs in only one direction.  There are buttons on the control panel, and there is a detailed description in the instructions on how to use the functionality.  However, if the cook wants to make adjustments to the program, it turns out that the LG MS 2043HS microwave oven does not support editing settings.  Really, stupidly done. </p><h2>  Negative user reviews </h2><p>  Most potential buyers, choosing kitchen appliances in the market, are guided first by the shortcomings that the product of interest to them has.  Has them and a microwave LG MS 2043HS.  User reviews begin with the fact that the manufacturer poorly packaged his goods for safe transportation.  We are talking about a protective film, which envelops the entire body of the microwave oven.  It is removed very hard.  It is almost impossible to tear it away from the case, especially at the joints of the panels.  It seems that the case was first wrapped in film, and then assembled. </p>

    <p>  In operation, the oven also does not show its best.  The fact is that it is very buzzing.  As practice shows, the problem is in the transformer, it is he who causes unpleasant sounds.  However, according to experts, this rumble is quite justified: it would be better if an inexpensive transformer emits a rumble rather than consumes a lot of energy with low efficiency.  Here the Koreans rather strange decided the issue of quality and price of installed parts. </p><h2>  Positive feedback from owners </h2><p>  Better to start with the fact that the stove belongs to the built-in kitchen appliances.  Yes, the LG MS 2043HS microwave device can be mounted in any cabinet.  The feedback of the owners of a positive nature can be understood, because few people want such a giant to occupy all the free space on the countertop or on the kitchen table. </p><p>  A decent microwave cooling system allows you to solve issues with free space.  The side panels and the bottom of the device are one large grille.  Naturally, there are blowing fans in the microwave, which cool the transformer and are able to remove heat from all heating elements. </p><p>  Positive feedback from the owners has earned and a complete instruction manual.  Working with her is convenient and interesting.  Not a single point of the manual remained incomprehensible.  This is really a rarity, because most manufacturers are sure that the buyer is already familiar with the functionality and provide a minimum of information in their instructions. </p><h2>  Problems and their solution </h2><p>  As practice shows, LG MS 2043HS has virtually no factory defects.  At least in the service centers of our country, the indicator of inoperability of this device due to the fault of the manufacturer is less than 0.1%.  This once again confirms that the country of origin is not an important criterion. </p><p>  However, problems with this microwave oven still arise, and the human factor is to blame for this.  Firstly, the user needs to be careful with the door of the device.  No need to clap her with all her might - she perfectly closes with a flick of the wrist.  Due to constant blows, the door mount wears out, which leads to the depressurization of the camera.  Naturally, the furnace will not work in this mode. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Yes, the device LG MS 2043HS still does not have a list of useful functions that are in demand by many cooks in the kitchen.  There is no grill, convection, temperature support, and the stove is buzzing too loudly.  However, there is only one criterion that attracts the attention of a potential buyer - price.  Still, the cost of 6,000 rubles for a branded product from a famous brand quickly puts everything in its place.  Need a simple and reliable microwave?  The LG MS 2043HS stove will be the best purchase in terms of price-quality ratio.  After all, the ordinary user is primarily interested in the sought-after functionality: heating products, rather than full cooking.  A grill is already the ability of ovens, but not a device that consumes 1 kilowatt of electricity per hour. </p>
