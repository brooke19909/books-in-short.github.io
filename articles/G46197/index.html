    <h2>  The recreation center "Primorskaya": reviews of vacationers </h2><p>  Very often, people's impressions and opinions about the same place may not coincide.  This recreation center is no exception.  According to some, this is a good base with nice staff.  Nutrition is full and very diverse.  Also, the excursions that are offered here are organized quite high quality. </p><p>  But on the advice of people resting here, you need to be careful about the choice of the building in which you are staying.  For example, in the “Frigate-2” building damp is felt, as the side faces the forest. </p><p>  According to general reviews, many recommend this recreation center to those who want to have a good rest, but do not have a lot of financial resources. </p>
