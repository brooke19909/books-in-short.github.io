As a market review and expert reviews show, these kinds of gadgets are quite popular.  Their common characteristic feature is the use of a standard smartphone matrix, which is complemented by an optical lens with a zoom function.  One of the latest models in this segment was the Samsung Galaxy K Zoom.  An overview of it is presented in more detail below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy k zoom" class="if" height="463" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/549277.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The main differences from the previous version </h2><p>  The predecessor of the device was the modification of the Galaxy S4 Zoom.  Unlike her, the designers did everything possible to make the new product as similar as possible to a smartphone.  Although the diameter of the lens remained the same large, now it does not protrude so much beyond the body.  This innovation has greatly simplified the work with him as with a phone.  On the other hand, the developers had to sacrifice a rotary approach wheel for this.  Zoom control of the model is carried out by buttons designed to adjust the sound or through the display.  The lack of a protrusion on the right to support the device, unlike the previous version, became another feature of the Samsung Galaxy K Zoom.  Expert reviews indicate that now taking photos in this regard has become not so convenient.  Anyway, all these nuances allowed to significantly reduce the thickness of the device.  At the same time, the dimensions in connection with the use of a larger display, increased, while the weight remained the same - almost 200 grams. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy k zoom black" class="if" height="362" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/549282.jpg" width="600"></div>

At the same time, as practice shows, among domestic users, the most popular version with a black design is ‚ÄúSamsung Galaxy K Zoom Black‚Äù.  At the bottom of the novelty there is no compartment for placing a SIM card, additional memory and battery.  It uses a curved plastic back cover with a large hole for the lens.  It is covered with perforated dots, which not everyone likes.  For such people, a special protective cover is provided, the texture of which is made under the skin.  In the lower right part of the ‚ÄúSamsung Galaxy K Zoom‚Äù is a two-position button designed to quickly launch the camera.  With its appearance, it resembles the rest of the hardware keys and has an oblong, narrow shape.  What remains unclear is the fact that in the locked state of the device it is impossible to take a picture.  The slot for an additional microUSB memory card is on the left side.  As for ergonomics, it can not be called a dignity of the model, first of all, because of its weight and dimensions.  Be that as it may, all external changes, except for the lack of grip for the right hand, went to the device only to the advantage. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy k zoom review" class="if" height="383" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/549281.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Functionality </h2><p>  The device operates on Android 4.4.2.  Moreover, its interface is the same as that of the Galaxy S5.  These two smartphones are similar in terms of functionality.  The novelty even has a similar energy-saving mode, when activated, it switches to <span>monochrome colors.</span>  The device responds quite quickly to owner commands.  The smartphone supports many modern games.  At the same time, it does not slow down, but heats up slightly. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  One of the very first South Korean smartphones equipped with a six-core processor was Samsung Galaxy K Zoom.  The reviews of experts and the first owners of the model are an additional confirmation that it is quite fast and productive.  At the same time, one cannot but note the nuance that all six cores cannot function simultaneously.  Two of them operate at a frequency of 1.7 GHz and are used to solve the most complex tasks.  The remaining four cores are clocked at 1.3 GHz.  First of all, they are responsible for operations that do not require high power and do not consume a lot of electricity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy k zoom reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/549284.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The device is equipped with 2 gigabytes of RAM.  Largely due to them, the smartphone easily copes with almost any load.  As for the stationary memory, here the developers were greedy, having installed a drive with a capacity of 8 GB in the Samsung Galaxy K Zoom.  Moreover, about a quarter of this space is not accessible to the user, since this part is used by the system.  For a smartphone with camera functions, this is very small, so it is recommended to immediately buy an additional memory card. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The Samsung Galaxy K Zoom smartphone has a 4.8-inch display with a resolution of 720x1280 pixels.  In this indicator, the device is significantly superior to its predecessor.  It should also be noted that the density of the image also increased to 306 pixels per inch.  Thanks to all this, the image looks pretty high quality, rich and bright.  The monitor is covered with <span>Gorilla Glass,</span> which is designed to protect it from scratches and other mechanical damage.  In general, the screen in its characteristics is able to compete even with flagship modifications of smartphones. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy k zoom price" class="if" height="428" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/549285.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The main feature of which the model differs from many other smartphones is the ability to take pictures.  The 20.7 megapixel camera with tenfold zoom of photographed objects is the main highlight of the Samsung Galaxy K Zoom.  The lens review is quite extensive, and its focal length is in the range from 4.4 to 44 millimeters.  The backlight sensor, xenon flash and optical stabilization system of the device were inherited from the previous modification.  The main claims to the camera are related to the matrix, which the manufacturer here uses far from the most advanced.  As for the software component, in order to ensure the convenience of shooting, the developers have provided a number of modes, due to which it is possible to solve a variety of problems. </p><h2>  Photo </h2><p>  Speaking about creating images using this device, first of all, attention should be paid to the fact that regardless of the focal length used, the lens will extend quite noisily and for a long time.  In this regard, the sudden and quick removal of any object is out of the question.  This is a significant drawback for this kind of device.  Noises are choked by the camera quite aggressively, so a good picture in poor lighting is unlikely to work out.  Sharpness can also be called mediocre, especially in the corners.  All this suggests that for a good photographer this model would be far from an ideal solution. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone samsung galaxy k zoom" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/549283.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  The model is equipped with a removable battery, the capacity of which is 2430 mAh.  This size is enough for the whole day of the autonomous functioning of the ‚ÄúSamsung Galaxy K Zoom‚Äù only as a smartphone.  If you plan to use the camera a lot, it is recommended to take a spare battery with you. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  The Samsung Galaxy K Zoom model, the price of which at domestic points of sale has slightly decreased since its inception and is now starting at 21 thousand rubles, has become a vivid example of what will happen if you add a zoom lens to a smartphone with a good camera.  The developers did everything possible so that the new product looked more like a phone than a compact camera.  And they succeeded.  Be that as it may, if a person takes photos with his smartphone less often several times a week, there is no sense in carrying a device weighing two hundred grams. </p>
