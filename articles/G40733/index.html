  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hotels in Croatia - a pass into the world of luxury</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Croatia is a relatively young European country, but it has been the status of a well-known and beloved resort for many years.  You can already feel all its charm after an hour's stay in the country.  It should be noted that in Croatia there is everything that is necessary for a complete comfortable stay.  Firstly, it is nature and climate.  Stretching along the <span>Adriatic Sea,</span> Croatia cannot boast of a sultry climate, because the temperature in summer does not rise above 30 C. But even this heat is enough for an unforgettable vacation.  We must pay tribute to the fact that the sea here is always calm, strong storm winds, too, should not be expected.  If we talk about the nature of the country, then all its charm is difficult to convey in words.  Just imagine: a blue sky, a bright sun not shaded by clouds, immense expanses of the deep sea, cliffs covered with pine trees, and dozens of beautiful sandy beaches ....  How can you resist such beauty? </p><p>  Anyone who was lucky enough to visit Croatia will say without a twinge of conscience that this is one of the best countries, which is the best suited for family vacations and not only.  Each piece of land remembers history, and numerous buildings and structures represent the sights of the country, which thousands of tourists visit with joy every year.  <span>Holidays in Croatia</span> with children are especially popular.  Many hotels in Croatia are equipped with special playgrounds, there are many interesting things for children in major cities of the country.  The local climate is ideal for healing children and treating diseases. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Numerous Croatia hotels offer their services for accommodating visitors, and only some travelers who are not the first time to come to the country can rent an apartment, room or cottage.  Speaking of hotels.  They are no different from the hotels of many other popular European resorts.  Unless the hotels in Croatia are more colorful, many of them are decorated in national traditions.  Due to the rapid development of the tourist destination, over the past few years, numerous hotels have been built in the country that meet all international standards.  In terms of service, there are both five-star and three-star.  Thus, each tourist, in view of his financial situation, can choose the most suitable option.  All hotels in Croatia are not much similar to each other, the only thing that unites them is a high level of guest service and always friendly staff. </p><p>  How can they please their guests?  As already mentioned, an excellent level of service.  In fact, almost all hotels in Croatia are among the whole complexes.  If we talk about the most popular places for tourists to stop, then this will probably be the Hotel Laguna Materada, Eden and Amarin.  Laguna Materada in 2004 was recognized as one of the best hotels, many tourists like to stay here only because the whole complex is located in the ecologically clean coastal zone of Croatia.  One of the quietest places is Amarin, which is located at some distance from Rovinj.  Nearby is a beautiful sandy beach.  Eden is located in the ancient Zlatni Pat Nature Park.  Most recently, the hotel underwent renovations, during which the interior of the bathrooms was improved.  Apart from comfortable rooms, Croatian hotels can offer a number of additional services, such as spa centers, indoor and outdoor pools, tennis courts, dance floors, saunas, diving sites and much more.  It is best to know in advance what is included in a particular hotel before booking a room.  Numerous reviews about Croatia hotels can help you make a choice, because, as they say, what one likes will create a negative impression on the other. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It should be noted that Croatian hotels and hotels in which a considerable number of tourists also stay are not inferior in comfort.  The main difference between hotels and hotels is that their rooms are slightly cheaper, which makes them affordable for middle-income people. </p><p>  Hotel Villa Tuttorotto </p><p>  This modern Rovinj hotel welcomes every guest with a warm welcome and impeccable service.  On the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe three-story building, there are numerous rooms with a bathroom, cable TV, <span>a minibar, a telephone</span> and air conditioning.  Nearby are the beach, tennis courts, golf courses and a diving site.  If Villa Tuttorotto's comfort is neglected, then only those who are used to completely different, richer living conditions. </p><p>  Hotel Residence </p><p>  A good option for someone who came on vacation or on business in the city of Opatija.  Superior rooms, friendly staff will fulfill any wish of the guest within the reasonable.  Among the additional services, the hotel offers windsurfing, horse riding, <span>skiing,</span> hiking in local attractions and much more. </p><p>  Hotel Mediteran </p><p>  This is perhaps the best hotel in the city of Moscenica Draga.  The rooms are cozy, but of modern amenities there are only telephones and televisions.  The interior is modest, there are few additional services.  But from the hotel it will not be difficult to get to other attractions of the city and to the nearest beach.  Mediterans will not like those who are used to staying in more luxurious apartments. </p>
