Father became a sultan as a result of the fact that he remained the last living representative of a kind.  From childhood he was considered crazy and kept in prison.  Saved from death and brought to power by Kesem Sultan, who was his mother.

    <p>  The real power in the empire belonged to Kesem and the vizier.  And Ibrahim was most concerned about his own harem.  Mehmed became his firstborn, but his father did not have special feelings for the boy.  Confirmation of this is the case when, in a fit of rage, the sultan grabbed the little Mehmed from his mother‚Äôs hands and threw him into the reservoir.  The boy was pulled out of the water on time, but when he fell, he cut his forehead.  The scar on his forehead remained until the end of his life.  The sultan was deprived of power in 1648, forcibly abdicated the throne in favor of his son, and in the same year he was executed by strangulation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The mother of the nineteenth sultan was Turhan Hatice.  It is believed that she came from Slavic lands (the territory of modern Ukraine).  Before the capture by the Turks at the age of twelve, her name was Nadia.  She became a concubine of the Sultan at the age of fifteen.  For a long time she was a valid regent with her young son.  For this title she had to compete with Kesem Sultan. </p><h2>  Reign </h2>

Six years later, he ascended the throne.  The period of his infancy was replete with intrigues that his mother and grandmother wove.  The sultan was firmly entrenched with the nickname Avji, which from Turkish translates as "hunter."  This was the ruler‚Äôs favorite pastime. <strong></strong>

The Ottomans lost the Ionian Islands, Morea, Moldova, Wallachia, Hungary.  Belgrade even came under Christian control.

    <p>  The representative of the Osman dynasty personally visited the Ukrainian lands.  He led the campaign to Podillia.  Under his command, on August 27, 1672, the fortress in Kamenets fell.  As a result of this campaign, Podillia and part of Galicia fell under the rule of the Ottoman Empire.  But this was the last successful conquest of the Sultan. </p><h2>  End of board </h2><p>  Mehmed IV was not a strong ruler.  For a long time, valid and viziers ruled for him.  Their activities led to a series of defeats on the world stage and the weakening of the Ottoman Empire.  Like his father, the nineteenth sultan was ousted from the throne by the uprising of the Janissaries.  It happened in 1687.  Mehmed died in prison five years after that, namely 06/01/1693. </p><p>  After being removed from the throne, Suleiman II, who was the younger brother of his predecessor, became the Sultan.  He did not deal with the affairs of the empire, entrusting everything to his viziers. </p>
