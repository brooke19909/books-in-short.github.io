    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  Rhodes Palladium Hotel has been around for 18 years.  But, despite his considerable "age", he looks very modern and beautiful.  The snow-white six-story building, made in the traditional Greek style, rises in a green, well-groomed area with numerous pools and palm trees.  Next to the main building there are five more buildings, with which the hotel forms a large and beautiful complex. </p><p>  And there is a hotel on the island of Rhodes, which can be understood from its name.  To be more precise - in the town of Faliraki.  It is a very busy resort.  He is very loved by youth.  It takes 10 minutes to get to Rhodes from here, as well as to the airport.  In the immediate vicinity there is a clean and spacious beach with sun loungers and umbrellas.  In general, the location is good - everything a tourist needs is nearby. </p>

    <h2>  Guest Comments </h2><p>  Many tourists come to Rhodes.  Hotel "Palladium" prices are quite low (as for a 5-star hotel), so a certain part decides to stay here.  And there are simply no negative reviews about the hotel.  Everyone praises her, which, in principle, is logical. </p><p>  After all, this hotel has absolutely everything for everyone.  Babysitting, a small pool and a mini-club - for children, special rooms - for people with disabilities, excellent noise isolation - for those who appreciate silence, great food - for gourmets.  And the list goes on. </p><p>  Many are happy to talk about staff.  Very polite and smiling people work here.  Administrators are warmly welcomed, even early check-in is possible if guests arrived in the morning.  A welcome surprise awaits you in the room - a bottle of quality wine and juicy seasonal fruits. </p><p>  However, even if early check-in is impossible (for example, the room has not been vacated), then the luggage of the guests will be taken to a left-luggage office, and breakfast will be arranged for them, after which they will be taken to a room where you can change clothes.  After that, guests usually spend time on the beach. </p><p>  Daily cleaning is here, as well as linen replacement.  New towels are brought here twice - in the morning and in the evening.  Cosmetics in sets are also replenished. </p><p>  And the location is extremely successful.  An excellent beach nearby (marked with the EU Blue Flag, by the way), numerous bars, taverns and restaurants (for those who do not want to take a full board), a bus stop directly in front of the building. </p><p>  Summarizing, we can say with confidence: this is one of the best hotels in all of Rhodes in terms of price and quality.  If you want to enjoy the excellent service, comfortable rooms, excellent food and have fun from the heart - it is worth going here. </p>
