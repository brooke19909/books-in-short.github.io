    <h2>  TOP 7 best castles </h2><p>  The architecture in this country is magnificent - no doubt.  So, if we talk about all the <span>castles in Germany, you</span> get a lot of information.  They are scattered throughout the country - to look at the architecture, they go to Bavaria, Saxony, Baden-W√ºrttemberg ... but we should talk about the most beautiful castles in Germany. </p><p>  If you make the TOP-7, then in seventh place would be Johannisburg, which is located in Aschaffenburg.  Perhaps the most magnificent castle built in the Renaissance.  Hoegschwangau - in sixth place, he is in Bavaria.  By the way, it was the official residence of Maximilian II.  Stolzenfels on the Rhine ranks fifth - it was built in the middle of the XIII century, it was destroyed almost to ruins and a half century in this condition and lay until it was decided to carry out large-scale restoration work. </p><p>  Leuvenburg is in fourth place - a very romantic place and an important <span>architectural monument</span> (this is the first neo-Gothic building in all of Germany).  In third place is Eltz, the most medieval castle.  From all sides it is surrounded by a dense forest.  Hohenzollern Castle takes the second place in the rating, and Neuschwanstein rises in the first place - it is rightfully the most beautiful not only in Europe or Germany, but in the whole world.  Here are the last two fairytale castles and we should talk in more detail. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Castle in the clouds </h2><p>  Hohenzollern Castle is located next to T√ºbingen - on a high picturesque hill.  He is so unnaturally beautiful that if you look at him for a long time, it may seem that he is about to disappear, dissolve.  By the way, they call it that - a castle in the clouds.  After all, the Hohenzollern is located at the top of the Swabian Alb, and this, by the way, is 800 meters above sea level.  It is amazing how organically it fits into the landscape surrounding it.  To get to it, you will need to overcome the steep steps laid through a dense forest.  And get directly into the Hohenzollern Castle will be through the chapel.  Only half an hour lasts a tour of the construction. </p><p>  By the way, near the entrance to the castle you can try real German beer, famous all over the world.  It will be difficult to resist the temptation to sit in the beer yard, which is surrounded by an incredibly <span>beautiful garden.</span> </p><p>  By the way, in addition to the castle, there are several more buildings here, and they are much older than it.  Quite a long time ago they were destroyed by wars, and they managed to return to their original appearance only after the castle was reconstructed. </p>

    <h2>  The history of the castle </h2><p>  Many people, looking at such beauty, think about who could even come up with such a brilliant <span>architectural project?</span>  Well, the history of such structures is always interesting.  Hohenzollern Castle was built in the 11th century.  The building is pronounced <span>Gothic style.</span>  Peaked roofs, upward battlements of towers, high walls, the chapel of St. Michael - he cannot but attract attention.  By the way, Hohenzollern is fully consistent with all those ideas about knightly castles that the people had in the 19th century. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Of course, the interior of Hohenzollern is as luxurious as its appearance.  The walls are lined with natural wood of precious noble species, the ceilings are painted with amazing patterns, the massive and majestic columns are made of marble ... All this looks really rich and tasteful.  And the elegant interior is completed by elegant drapery and coffered ceilings.  Needless to say, Hohenzollern Castle is a real gem of all of Prussia. </p><h2>  Popularity </h2><p>  Hohenzollern has become incredibly popular with tourists, and among locals too.  Today, about 300 thousand people travel to these places every year.  By the way, for 12 years the castle was closed to visitors - from 1978 to 1990.  The fact is that then there was a strong earthquake, and the structure was damaged.  But today it is still majestically towering on a hill. </p><p>  Hohenzollern Castle on the map is clearly visible.  To find it, you need to carefully look at the map of the sights of Baden-W√ºrttemberg - and such exist!  Next to the castle designation, you can see the name of the communes Jungingen, Burladingen, Hammertingen.  But the Hohenzollern - the main attraction not only in these places, but on the entire federal land. </p>

    <h2>  Bavarian fortress </h2><p>  Hohenzollern Castle (Germany) is in second place among the most beautiful buildings in the country, and the first is Neunswanshtein.  His photographs are everywhere today, but even they cannot convey his perfection, which can only be fully enjoyed live.  It seems to soar on the mountains - you can fall in love with such a castle in a matter of fractions of a second.  By the way, it was recently restored (in 2009), and after these works he began to look even more elegant. </p><p>  Many are surprised by its <span>indescribable beauty.</span>  But everything is simple - because Neuschwanstein is a project of the monarch Lubwig II.  This is not a <span>defensive structure</span> , much less a place for balls and festivities.  Neuschwanstein was conceived as a miracle of architecture - this is how it turned out. </p><p>  If you want to admire the magnificent architecture, then definitely you should go to Germany.  Even if you manage to inspect not all the castles, but two or three, you can assume that life was not lived in vain. </p>
