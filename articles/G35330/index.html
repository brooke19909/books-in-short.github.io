    <h2>  Why is it so difficult? </h2><p>  Owning smartphones running any other operating system (not iOs) is hard enough to understand what is the difficulty in <span>recovering a password.</span>  But she is.  First, Apple‚Äôs security system is very serious.  Just because no one password will not allow to recover.  Secondly, there are several ways that require trial, if you already forgot your iCloud password.  What to do in this case?  Read below.  Naturally, all options are suitable only for the true owners of Apple devices, and not for those who bought a stolen smartphone. </p><h2>  Via email client </h2><p>  If it so happened that when you tried to download the application in the App Store, it suddenly became clear that the owner forgot the iCloud password (aka AppleID), then you can quickly and easily change it.  You only need to make sure that authentication is performed automatically in a standard mail application.  If it is possible to enter the mail, send messages from it and carry out other manipulations, then you can proceed with the restoration.  To do this, in the device settings, log out of accounts in the "iTunes Store, App Store" tab.  But the email client does not need to be touched, otherwise it will not be possible to recover through it.  After resetting the account, you must again try to log in to it in the settings by selecting the "Forgot your password?" Item, and then the "Send to mail" sub-item.  Attention!  If the user has forgotten the iCloud password, then you cannot reset the device to the factory settings!  This will turn it into a useless "brick". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="forgot icloud password" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/777527.jpg"></div>

The letter from Apple says that someone is trying to change the password in the account.  Naturally, if this is done on the initiative of the owner, then you just need to click on the link "Reset password now".  After that, you only need to set a new password, repeating it in a special field. </p><h2>  Account Usage </h2><p>  When a new password is set, you need to restart the device, and then enter the settings.  After that, activate the account again for all items: App Store, iTunes Store, Mail, "Photos" and others.  All those using an iCloud account.  Forgot password?  This is no longer a problem if the owner actually purchased the device legally. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="forgot iphone icloud password" class="if" height="284" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/777528.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Used Apple Gadget </h2><p>  It is much more difficult for those who bought a tablet or smartphone from a first-time buyer.  Especially if he did not log out of his account.  Apple gadgets now automatically turn on the Find iPad / iPhone feature from the time they are purchased.  And you can‚Äôt disable it without having access to iCloud.  Forgot your password or didn‚Äôt even know it?  There are two ways: contact the first owner to disconnect, or use the <span>mail client</span> again <span>.</span>  But a little differently. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Create new mail </h2><p>  If the new user has his own e-mail, then it must be added to the list in the settings.  And then order a password recovery to this address in the same way as described above.  Sometimes this does not work.  And immediately the question arises: <span>"I forgot the password on the iPhone,</span> iCloud does not work, what should I do?" </p><h2>  How to be </h2><p>  Firstly, disable all services that can only be disabled independently.  Those that do not require authentication in iCloud (forgot the password from him or did not know from the beginning - it does not matter).  Then it is advisable to enter the official website of the company, get yourself a new account (AppleID).  You can reset the old one in the AppStore without an iCloud password.  And then enter the application with the new data.  All: applications, photos and other joys of the gadget can be used. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="forgot icloud password what to do" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/777525.jpg" width="339"></div>

    <h2>  What is impossible? </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the above method has a drawback.  iCloud is not reset, so not all features are available.  So, for example, you cannot synchronize photos, videos, notes and contacts, disable the "Find iPad / iPhone" function, enter the cloud service, and create backup copies. </p><h2>  Call to company </h2><p>  You can reset your old iCloud password by calling your company.  However, there are difficulties.  Firstly, you have to prove that the device is really bought by the user.  For example, by providing a check for payment.  Secondly, you have to talk with <span>company employees for a</span> long time <span>.</span>  They are quite scrupulous in matters of safety of the company's products. </p><h2>  Precautionary measures </h2><p>  In no case should you reset the device to the factory settings if you do not have a valid account password on hand.  This leads to the fact that instead of a full-fledged smartphone or tablet on your hands will be just a piece of plastic.  And, of course, you should not go on about scammers who offer to remove all passwords for a certain amount of money.  Most likely, they will not succeed, and the device will suffer. </p>
