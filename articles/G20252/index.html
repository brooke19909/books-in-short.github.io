  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The beginning of the First World War</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>The First World War</span> is one of the longest and most significant wars in history, which is characterized by enormous bloodshed.  It lasted for more than four years, it is interesting that thirty-three countries (87% of the world's population), which at that time had <span>state sovereignty,</span> took part in it <span>.</span> </p><p>  The outbreak of World War I (the start date is June 28, 1914) gave rise to the formation of two blocs: the Entente (England, Russia, France) and the <span>Triple Alliance</span> (Italy, Germany, Austria).  The war began as a result of the uneven development of the capitalist system at the stage of imperialism, and also as a result of the Anglo-German contradiction. </p><p>  The reasons for the outbreak of the First World War are as follows: </p><p>  1. The crisis of the <span>world economy.</span> </p><p>  2. Mismatch of interests of Russia, Germany, Serbia, as well as Great Britain, France, Italy, Greece and Bulgaria. </p><p>  Russia sought to gain access to the seas, England to weaken Turkey and Germany, France to return Lorraine and Alsace, in turn, Germany had the goal of capturing Europe and the Middle East, Austria-Hungary to control the movement of ships at sea, and Italy to gain dominance Southern Europe and the Mediterranean Sea. </p><p>  As indicated above, it is generally accepted that the beginning of World War I falls on June 28, 1914, when the direct heir to the throne, Franz, was killed in Serbia.  Interested in the outcome of the war, Germany incited the Hungarian government to present an ultimatum to Serbia, which allegedly encroached on its sovereignty.  This ultimatum coincided with the mass strikes in St. Petersburg.  It was here that the French president arrived to push Russia into the war.  In turn, Russia advises Serbia to fulfill the ultimatum, but already on July 15, Austria declared war on Serbia.  This was the beginning of the First World War. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the same time, mobilization was announced in Russia <strong>,</strong> but Germany demanded the abolition of these measures.  But the tsarist government refused to fulfill this requirement, so July 21, Germany declared war on Russia. </p><p>  In the coming days, the main states of Europe will enter the war.  So, on July 18, France enters the war - Russia's main ally, and then England declares war on Germany.  Italy considered it necessary to declare neutrality. </p><p>  We can say that the war instantly becomes pan-European, and later world war. </p><p>  The outbreak of World War I can be characterized by an attack by German forces on the French army.  In response, Russia puts two armies on the offensive to capture <span>East Prussia.</span>  This offensive began successfully, on August 7, the Russian army won the battle of Gumbinem.  Soon, however, the Russian army fell into the trap and was defeated by the Germans.  So the best part of the Russian army was destroyed.  The rest was forced to retreat under enemy pressure.  It should be said that these events helped the French defeat the Germans in the battle on the river.  Marne. </p><p>  It should be noted the role of the <span>Battle of Galicia</span> during the war.  In 1914, large battles took place between the Austrian and Russian units in Gilicia.  The battle went on twenty-one days.  At first, the Russian army was very difficult to withstand the pressure of the enemy, but soon the troops went on the offensive, and the Austrian forces had to retreat.  Thus, the battle of Galicia ended in the complete defeat of the Austro-Hungarian forces, and until the end of the war Austria could not move away from such a blow. </p><p>  Thus, the beginning of World War I falls on 1914.  It lasted four years, 3/4 of the world's population took part in it.  As a result of the war, four great empires disappeared: Austro-Hungarian, Russian, German and Ottoman.  Almost twelve million people were lost, taking into account civilians, fifty-five million were injured. </p>
