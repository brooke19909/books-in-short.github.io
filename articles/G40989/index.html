Today we will talk about the button creations of the company.  The British manufacturer at the time released the Fly FF241 phone, reviews of which to date have bypassed the entire international network.  Actually, this device will be discussed today.  Today we‚Äôll change the course a bit by skipping the history of the device.  Having passed this step, we will proceed immediately to a review of technical capabilities and features.  So, what can we offer the Fly FF241 mobile phone, reviews of which you can find at the end of this article? </p><h2>  Brief Specifications </h2>

    <p>  The device has support for two SIM cards.  They can work simultaneously in standby mode.  It is logical that only one of them can be used for a voice call at the same time.  At the same time, you can make the call from an arbitrary SIM card, which also applies to sending text and multimedia messages containing photos, video clips and audio files. </p><p>  As an operating system, the OS of the family called Nucleus is installed on board the subject of our review.  This is a proprietary development of the British manufacturer of mobile phones, which is integrated into the service environment of some devices.  The phone has a lithium-ion battery, whose capacity is about 2750 milliamps per hour.  For a device that is designed to use standard functionality as an apparatus (and we are talking about exchanging text and multimedia messages, as well as making voice calls), this is a very, very good indicator, which is impossible not to mention.  Thus, in standby mode, the phone can work without additional recharging for several days. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The processor is represented by the MTK6261 D model chipset. Its clock frequency (or rather the maximum indicator) can reach 260 MHz.  If we were talking about a smartphone, then this would be critically small.  But we are talking about a different class of devices.  Namely about a mobile phone.  Therefore, we can safely say that the processor clock speed is enough to ensure that the average user is satisfied.  Yes, by the way, we note that there is only one core in the chipset. </p><h2>  Sizes, dimensions, design </h2>

    <p>  One of the best-selling variations on the market is the Fly FF241 Black mobile phone.  Reviews once again confirm this fact.  At the same time, the device turned out to be presented to a potential buyer in two colors.  The mini-competitor of the designated model is Fly FF241 White, reviews of which allow us to suggest that, in terms of acquisition, this variation will be much better.  The thing is that the case manufacturing materials for these two models have the same characteristics of impact resistance and resistance to mechanical wear.  Which, by the way, are not very encouraging.  Fingerprints will remain on the case, but on white they will be less noticeable than on black.  Actually, this is always the case, and probably that is why many users opt for the appropriate devices. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In <span>three-</span> dimensional <span>space, the</span> dimensions of the apparatus are as follows.  In height, the device reaches 126 millimeters, in width - only 51, and in thickness - 14.3 mm.  If today we were analyzing the characteristics of a smartphone, then such dimensions would become one of the most important factors that would alienate a huge number of potential buyers.  You can quite logically wonder why it is so.  In fact, everything is quite simple.  In the smartphone market, almost all manufacturers pursue the same goal: to make their device as productive as possible and as thin as possible.  Indeed, it is not for nothing that the new Apple device has undergone significant changes in thickness compared to its predecessors. </p><p>  So, let's not forget that today we are talking directly about the mobile phone.  And for devices of this class and segment, a large thickness is far from rare.  In conclusion of this microtheme, we add that the mass of the apparatus does not exceed 119 grams with its size.  If we go back to the color scheme, then nothing of the sort can be said.  Everything is very simple, cheap and boring: the device was designed in classic colors.  Only black and white, and nothing more. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  The screen resolution of the subject of our review today is 240 by 320 pixels.  Thus, we can say that the picture is displayed on the screen in the so-called QVGA quality.  The device matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãmade using TN technology.  The diagonal of the display is almost two and a half inches.  To be more precise, then 2.4.  As expected, the touch screen is missing.  Which, in principle, is logical for a button-type device.  The Fly FF241 screen, reviews of which appeared on the network almost immediately after the device entered the international arena, is made of organic glass.  No additional coatings or layers are available.  No special protection is provided.  Therefore, we advise users to use the phone as carefully as possible. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Memory </h2>

    <p>  Here, in general, everything is very bad.  Built-in RAM - only 32 megabytes.  The same amount of ROM.  The Fly FF241 cell phone, reviews of which the reader can examine at the end of our review, supports external drives.  But only in one format.  This is not even about MicroSD, but about MicroSDHC.  The maximum supported capacity of this type of memory card is 32 gigabytes.  The device‚Äôs software has a built-in function as a flash drive. </p><h2>  Communication and wireless networks </h2>

    <p>  The phone works in the GSM bands.  However, it no longer supports third-generation mobile networks.  The same applies to the standards of UMTS, KSDPA.  Should I say that the phone does not have an LTE module?  This is probably understandable.  How can we talk about working with fourth-generation cellular networks if even the third does not work?  That would be real nonsense.  The device does not have a Wi-Fi module, so it will not work to connect to wireless networks.  There is no modem either, so you cannot use the phone as an access point. </p><p>  The phone does not support operation in the EDGE and GPRS ranges, therefore, work in the international network at high speed is not possible.  It will be possible to implement it only on the basis of the WAP standard.  But, as they say, something is better than nothing at all.  It is impossible to connect an external 3G modem to the device, but it is understandable. </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  Only the main camera module is present.  Its resolution is 1.3 megapixels.  There is no front camera.  It is possible to record video clips in the resolution of 240 by 320 pixels on the main module.  Thus, the quality will correspond to the quality of the image output to the screen of the phone itself.  Recall that it is called QVGA.  An interesting fact is that not far from the main camera module, the British manufacturer decided to install an LED flash.  It can also be used as a flashlight, if you use the appropriate software.  As expected, the camera module is not equipped with an auto focus function on the subject.  Nevertheless, there is digital zoom, which, at least in some way, makes it easier to handle the device.  In some situations, it can be very helpful. </p><h2>  Multimedia features </h2>

    <p>  A media player is installed in the device as software.  It plays sound files in formats such as MP3 and WAW.  It is also possible to play files with AMR and AAC permissions.  The penultimate format is the recordings made on the voice recorder of a mobile phone, while the rest are typical of ordinary audio files, songs and melodies. </p><p>  There are no advanced playback control settings for the phone owner.  We are talking, for example, about the equalizer.  The subject of our review in no way draws on the title of a musical device, so the lack of such settings, in principle, should not be surprising.  For this there is, for example, ‚ÄúNokia Express Music‚Äù.  There already is where to turn around!  It is also impossible to loop moments in songs in order to play only the corresponding intervals.  Playlists are not created.  This may already be inconvenient. </p><h2>  Conclusion and reviews </h2><p>  As promised at the very beginning of the article, at the end of the review we give in a generalized form the words of the owners of the phone.  What can they tell us?  Based on several dozens of reviews, one clear conclusion can be made: if you are looking for a device that will be equipped with a powerful speaker, have a really capacious and efficient battery, and the additional function will include support for two SIM cards, then this model is ideal for you! </p><p>  It is these three parameters that are most often indicated in the positive reviews of the owners.  Among the other advantages are the ability to quickly turn on recording during a telephone conversation, as well as the ability to send a annoying subscriber to the blacklist in just two clicks, forever barring him from making calls to your number.  Sometimes this feature is especially convenient. </p><h2>  Minuses </h2><p>  Of the disadvantages - the dimensions of the device.  This is mainly about the thickness of the phone.  The next ‚Äúshovel" turned out at the British developer.  It was repeatedly noted by experts that the form factor in the form of a slider would have taken root much better in this case than a monoblock.  Anyway, the same can be said of any mobile phone with a screen diagonal of more than two inches. </p>
