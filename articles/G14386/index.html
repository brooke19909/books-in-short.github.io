The beaches of this village are famous not only for the entire Krasnodar Territory, but also for the whole country.  They are sandy, similar to desert dunes.  The water is clean and clear.  In Dzhemete a special climate, air rich in salt, is considered healing.  The name of the village comes from the Adyghe phrase "gold placers."  Indeed, some microns of gold come across in the sand, but the resort‚Äôs real treasure is its healing effect - the sea and climate. </p><h2>  How to get here </h2><p>  In recent years, the village of Dzhemete became part of Anapa.  Therefore, getting there is not difficult.  If you arrived in <span>Anapa by rail,</span> then from six in the morning minibuses number 114 go there. They leave often, literally every five to ten minutes.  You will pay 20 rubles, and in about fifteen minutes Dzhemete is waiting for you.  Beaches, relaxation and a comfortable stay, you can take it in your pocket. </p>

    <p>  But often the trains do not stop in Anapa, but at the Tunnel station.  From there, you can get to the city by regular bus, and then transfer to the next minibus in Dzhemete.  A shuttle bus No. 113 leaves from the airport to Dzhemete. The village itself is a good transport hub.  Transport is constantly running through it, and if you want to go to Anapa to see some sights or try other beaches, it will be very simple. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Anapa, Dzhemete beach </h2><p>  This resort is new, it began to develop about ten years ago.  But already for this short time, it was built up with guest houses, pensions, mini-hotels, where the basic modern standards for recreation were observed.  The coast is equipped - there are water rides, many inexpensive cafes.  The beaches of Dzhemete represent a ten-kilometer sand zone.  They are very wide (up to 150 meters), clean and not as crowded as in Anapa.  The coast is interesting in that it is all covered with sand dunes resembling dunes.  They are so high (almost 15 m) that they block tourists from the wind and block the living area from the water. </p>

    <p>  Dunes are covered with wild olives.  The sand here is drier than in Anapa, and therefore softer and warmer.  And the descent into the sea is very gentle.  So if you come with young children, then this is ideal for them.  The most popular beach is Central.  It is located near Pionersky Prospekt, which stretches from Anapa to Vityazevo.  It is well-maintained - with sunbeds, deck chairs, umbrellas, showers.  There is also a medical center and lifeguards. </p><h2>  Beaches of hotels and pensions </h2><p>  Many tourists prefer the coast, sections of which belong to guest houses and sanatoriums in Dzhemete.  The beaches here are small and much cleaner than those in the center.  Good coast at the guest houses "Priobye", as well as "Seahorse".  The white beach near the Tiki-Tak water park is considered the most beautiful.  It is well equipped and you won‚Äôt be bored without water activities.  And the sand here is really snow-white - quartz, river and fine. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Such beaches are good for family people, especially with children.  Not only safe bathing, but also air saturated with silver ions heals the child.  After storms, local lagoons form on local beaches, the water in which warms up to a hot state.  Children splash here with particular pleasure.  In addition, Dzhemete is located not in the bay, but in the open sea.  This also plays a role in the purity of the water. </p><h2>  Wild beaches </h2><p>  If you prefer not your own hotel or private sector, but your own tent, then this is the place for you.  After all, there are many wild beaches where there are no games, attractions and infrastructure.  There you can retire and find peace.  No wonder these places are so fond of nudists who often come to Dzhemete.  The beach, the photo of which illustrates this article, as already mentioned, consists of dunes that enclose tourists from each other and, thus, only contribute to solitude.  This gives the surrounding nature an exotic touch.  The coast farthest from civilization and close to nature is located near <span>Big Utrish.</span>  They get here on foot by sea or by boat. </p><h2>  Dzhemete Beach: reviews of vacationers </h2><p>  Tourists most often prefer a vacation in the village.  Dzhemete, from their point of view, is much better than Anapa both in price and in housing, as well as in the quality of the sea and beach.  The water here is more transparent than in the city.  The main thing is not to get to the resort during the flowering of the sea.  But mainly this happens in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãCentral Beach, and in more remote areas the water blows plankton in a couple of days. </p>

    <p>  Unlike Vityazevo, you don‚Äôt need to get to the beach, passing through countless shops.  Almost all guest houses are located directly on the coastline.  However, to the very water you need to overcome some distance along the dunes.  Vacationers are also advised not to stop near bridges and piers with their towels and mats, but to move a few tens of meters away.  The fact is that people from Anapa or other areas on boats often come to Dzhemete and, as a rule, occupy areas near their landing site.  The atmosphere on the beaches, however, is calm and even kind of homely.  Maybe that's why people here prefer to go. </p>
