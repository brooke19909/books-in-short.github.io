  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to get to Pushkino and accidentally not be in another place</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Faced with the question of how to get to Pushkino, one should not rush to answer it.  A seemingly insignificant inaccuracy in the name can lead us to a completely different city, located about seven hundred kilometers from the place where we are going to go.  The fact is that there are as many as two settlements with very similar names.  This is Pushkino in the near Moscow region and the city of Pushkin, the famous suburb of St. Petersburg, better known under its historical name Tsarskoye Selo.  To get there, you must first get to St. Petersburg. </p><p>  <strong>How to get to Pushkino</strong> </p><p>  This small town is located just 17 kilometers from the Moscow Ring Road along the famous Yaroslavl highway.  It usually takes less than an hour to get there, it depends on which point of the capital we are heading for and the number of traffic jams on our way. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get to Pushkino" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/247076.jpg" width="505"></div>  And if we don‚Äôt have a personal car at our disposal, it is quite possible to answer the question of how to get to Pushkino using public transport.  To do this, it is enough to use the bus route number 317, regularly departing from the <span>VDNH metro station.</span>  Any of the minibuses that regularly move along the Yaroslavl highway almost around the clock will do just fine.  But you can get to Pushkino by rail.  You can get there by any train that departs from the Yaroslavl station in the direction of Sergiev Posad and Alexandrov.  And you can use the long-distance train, which has a Pushkino stop on the schedule.  But in any case, the answer to the question of how to get to Pushkino by rail begins on Komsomolskaya Square in the capital.  She is the Square of three stations and Kalanchevskaya.  You can get to it through the lobby of the Komsomolskaya metro station. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get to r pushkino" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/247077.jpg" width="504"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>The city of Pushkin: how to get to it</strong> </p><p>  This is <span>an open-air museum</span> and one of the most luxurious suburbs of the northern capital.  Sometimes people come here from afar to admire the unique palace and park architectural ensemble and join the place where Russian history has been going on for two centuries.  This is the famous Tsarskoye Selo, under such a toponym it is listed in all historical and literary sources.  And getting to it is quite easy.  The great Russian poet, in whose honor this city is named, repeatedly crossed the distance to him on foot.  And even during his life, the first railway in the Russian Empire began to be built before Tsarskoye Selo.  It is functioning properly to this day.  And the easiest way to get to the city of Pushkin is for 30 rubles on one of the trains.  They depart with enviable regularity from the <span>Vitebsk railway station in</span> St. Petersburg.  But you can catch the same train at its intermediate stop at the Kupchino metro station. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pushkin city how to get there" class="if" height="378" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/247075.jpg" width="504"></div>  In addition, minibuses regularly go here from several points of the city.  And one should not be surprised if you hear the answer to the question of how to get to the city of Pushkino, where the Yaroslavl highway and Sergiev Posad will appear.  It only means that one letter in the toponym should be clarified.
