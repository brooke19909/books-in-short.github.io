Unfortunately, time did not spare her, but what was saved was of interest as a historical and cultural monument.  In the twentieth century, many rare buildings were lost, but today the estate of Sviblovo is reborn.  In 1994, the Moscow Government decided to transfer the estate and create the Sviblovsky Patriarchal Compound on its territory. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  According to ancient legend, the name of the estate is associated with the name of the governor of Svibla, who served under Dmitry Donskoy.  Compound is mentioned in the works of A. S. Pushkin, the works of N. M. Karamzin, but as Svirlovo. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sviblovo estate" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/850914.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Starting from the 17th century, these lands belonged to the Plescheevs.  Then they passed into the possession of Kravchev Peter the Great, who subsequently rose to the post of commandant of St. Petersburg, and then became governor of Moscow. </p><h2>  Main house </h2><p>  In 1704, stone chambers appeared in the estate.  The main house was built by Swedish soldiers captured after <span>the Battle of Poltava.</span>  In 1709, the Trinity Church was rebuilt from stone again.  The bell that crowned it went to the owner as a trophy from the Swedes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sviblovo estate photo" class="if" height="281" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/850917.jpg" width="445"></div>

There were spruce, linden and <span>birch alleys in it.</span>  Flower beds with various plants were planted along them.  There was a theater in this garden. </p><p>  The main house looked very picturesque from the Yauza side.  At its bend was an artificial island, which was divided into four sectors and decorated with a picturesque gazebo.  A wooden rotunda made of tez, which had a tent covering, ended with a belvedere.  And its top was crowned with a spire.  In those days, with the help of dams that were built near the island, the meadow was filled with water, and it was possible to get to the rotunda only on a wooden raft.  A walking path was laid from the house to the swimming pool.  A round platform with a recreation pavilion was organized here. </p><p>  This estate passed to the Golitsyn family after M.S. Pleshcheeva became the wife of one of the representatives of this ancient family - P. Ya. Golitsyn.  True, they did not remain the owners of the estate for long. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of the Life-Giving Trinity at Sviblovo Estate" class="if" height="370" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/850915.jpg" width="544"></div>

    <p>  In 1782, the estate was bought by Major General N.P. Vysotsky, who was the nephew of Grigory Potemkin, the favorite of Empress Catherine the Second.  In the 20s of the XIX century, the estate again transferred to a new owner.  This time they became a wealthy merchant I.P. Kozhevnikov, and in 1867 B.K. Khalatov bought it.  Its last owner before the October Revolution was his son - G. B. Khalatov. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Manor after the revolution </h2><p>  During the rule of the Bolshevik government, the estate of Sviblovo gradually began to decline - part of the park was cut down, many buildings were demolished, and those buildings that were preserved were used for household needs. </p><p>  At first, the Revkom of the local settlement was placed in the main manor house, later <span>communal apartments</span> for military personnel were arranged here, which at that time were assigned to the railway guard. </p><h2>  Manor Sviblovo today </h2><p>  Since 1997, the estate of Sviblovo, the photo of which you see in our article, has been the property of the Russian Orthodox Church.  She is gradually reborn. </p><p>  Today, the territory has been ennobled, the ponds have been cleaned, the canal located around the island has been restored.  The lost rotunda gazebo was recreated on it.  The main manor house, which was built in the style of classicism, was also restored. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sviblovo estate photo" class="if" height="303" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/850913.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Once upon a time, its front parts were decorated with graceful balconies resting on columns.  The second floor and the mezzanine were built of wood, but during the restoration they were made of stone.  The central part of the structure is distinguished by a portico, which consists of four columns. </p><p>  On two sides of the main house of the estate are outbuildings that give the building rigor and solemnity.  At the initial construction they were also wooden, but during the reconstruction they were built of brick. </p><p>  The L-shaped human wing has survived to our times.  It was built at the beginning of the XIX century on the foundation of the chambers that were built in the XVIII century.  A wooden second floor was built above it at the end of the 19th century. </p><h2>  Church of the Life-Giving Trinity in the estate Sviblovo </h2><p>  Surprisingly, this <span>ancient temple also</span> survived in the estate.  It was built in 1708 in the Baroque style.  The temple in the Sviblovo estate is distinguished by the decorative decoration of the interior, made in the same style.  True, they added some elements of architecture that are typical of Peter's time.  At the end of the 17th century, a bell tower built in the style of classicism appeared near the temple. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of the Life-Giving Trinity at Sviblovo Estate" class="if" height="451" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/850911.jpg" width="600"></div>
