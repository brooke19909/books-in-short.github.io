Now the soul asks for exotic.  The Caribbean, and among its countries the distinctive Dominican Republic - is what you need for a paradise holiday filled with a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãvivid impressions.  One of its best resorts is Juan Dolio, which houses the cute, homely, welcoming 4-star Costa Caribe Coral hotel.  Sometimes in his name the word ‚ÄúCoral‚Äù is put first, which does not change anything.  In this hotel you can relax wonderfully, most importantly, bring a good mood and more smiles.  Here it is very much appreciated by the staff and helps to get a friendly attitude and friendly smiles in return. </p><h2>  Location, resort features </h2><p>  Hotel Coral Costa Caribe Resort 3 (4 stars in brochures) is located in the Dominican Republic in the resort of Juan Dolio.  This, without exaggeration, is a paradise, combining the amazing beauty of ‚ÄúBounty-type‚Äù beaches, where you can find calm and secluded corners and lively, sparkling centers of fun.  From the <span>capital of the Dominican Republic, a</span> peculiar and beautiful Santo Domingo, it is a little more than 50 km.  Juan Dolio is considered the closest resort to the capital.  You can get there from the hotel by public transport, with a guided tour or by a rented car.  The comparatively young (founded in 1820) town of San Pedro de Macoris is even closer, where you can go to admire interesting architecture that combines a variety of styles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Costa Caribe Coral 4" class="if" height="311" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/710430.jpg" width="554"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The city and at the same time the resort of Punta Cana from the Coral Costa Caribe Resort 4 * hotel is located quite far, about 150 km, but it is there that most often planes arrive with Russian tourists.  Near the hotel, except the beach, there is nothing remarkable.  The nearest village is a 10-minute walk away.  You can go there only for the sake of inexpensive stores. </p><h2>  How to get to the hotel </h2><p>  You can get to the Caribbean from Russia only by plane.  Near Costa Caribe Coral 4 stars there are two international airports, one in Punta Cana, the other in Santo Domingo.  From the first one it takes about 2.5-3 hours, from the second - 35 minutes. The transfer cost, respectively, is very different.  But for some reason, direct flights from Russia to the Dominican capital have not yet been invented.  And there are few of them with transplants.  You can get there from Moscow by Iberia.  Departure from Domodedovo Airport to Madrid, from there to Santo Domingo.  From St. Petersburg you can fly with Air France to Paris, and then to the Dominican capital or with Lufthansa + Condor to Frankfurt and then to Santo Domingo.  Perhaps these are not the best options, but you don‚Äôt have to spend more than two hours on a transfer to the hotel. </p><p>  There are many flights to Punta Cana, with most of them direct.  Flight takes an average of 11-12 hours.  You will have to spend some time at the airport.  If you take a ticket to Costa Caribe Coral 4 * in travel agencies, as a rule, after arrival, the tour operator meets and helps to get into the necessary transport.  Although the road to the hotel is long, the views from the windows of the bus are fantastic.  Sometimes the driver stops by the souvenir shops along the way. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Coral Costa Caribe Resort 4" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/710422.jpg" width="454"></div>

They will definitely require you to buy a full tour with a round-trip, paid transfer and hotel. </p><h2>  Description of the Territory </h2><p>  Not so long ago, the full name of the hotel was Costa Caribe Coral By <span>Hilton 4</span> stars.  Now the last words have been removed, but the chic inherent in the Hilton hotel chain has been preserved.  The hotel area is very beautiful and exotic.  Everything is buried in greenery and flowers, many palm trees, there is even a pond with fish and turtles.  At the exit from the central building of the hotel (where the reception is), there are tennis courts, a casino, a small golf course.  Near the hotel there is a golf club with a larger field.  A shuttle service is available there.  Right under the palm trees is a swimming pool, in the center of which is a full-day bar.  For the convenience of guests, there are several shops on the territory (with clothes, souvenirs, food products).  In addition, every day local residents are pulled to the central building with mangoes, bananas, decorations and more.  Merchants are not imposed on anyone, and their services are quite out of place, since when making purchases you can bargain and significantly bring down prices, and other outlets are far away. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Coral Costa Caribe 4 reviews" class="if" height="323" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/710423.jpg" width="478"></div>

So, in the central building it‚Äôs hard for those who like to go to bed early, as there is a night bar nearby, in which they sing and play very loudly.  In distant buildings, peace and quiet reign, and the distance to the sea from any building is approximately the same. </p>

Here you can book excursions, rent a vehicle, pay for the Internet, hand over things for washing, call a doctor, exchange currency.

All of them are quite spacious, with windows on the sea or on the garden and pool.  The technical condition of the rooms is very different.  The hotel is undergoing renovation.  The rooms, in which the repair is already completed, have good furniture, well-functioning plumbing and electrical equipment.  If you are accommodated in a room where something is wrong, it is easily changed to a suitable one. </p><p>  For the services of guests are provided: </p><p>  - TV (there is a Russian TVC channel); </p><p>  - air conditioning; </p><p>  - fan (on the ceiling); </p><p>  - telephone; </p><p>  - iron (it can be taken at the reception); </p><p>  - safe (possibly the absence of a lock); </p><p>  - balcony; </p><p>  - refrigerator (on request). </p><p>  Hygiene rooms are equipped with a washbasin, shower, toilet.  Shampoo, soap, toilet paper replenish as necessary throughout the race.  Bottled water is also regularly brought.  Towels are changed daily.  The system is as follows: in the morning they are collected for washing, and then after 17 pm they are given out, and they strictly record in which room how many towels were taken.  These works are performed not by maids, but by individual staff, so if you suddenly forgot to bring a towel or did not leave water, you need to contact the reception. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dominican Republic Coral Costa Caribe 4" class="if" height="298" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/710425.jpg" width="511"></div>

    <p>  Concerning cleaning in Coral Costa Caribe 4 * the reviews are contradictory.  Some tourists believe that it is clearly insufficient, others are very pleased that they clean cleanly and every day.  Also, some tourists do not like that the towels are not new. </p><p>  A distinctive feature of the rooms is that all the sockets in them are designed for a voltage of 110 w! </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  In Coral Costa Caribe 4 * ("Coral Costa Caribe 4 *") the food is organized perfectly.  There is a main restaurant called Ambar, and three custom-made <span>(a la carte)</span> restaurants with Italian, Mexican and Dominican cuisines.  Everywhere everything is free, but special restaurants need to be booked in advance.  The waiters are always helpful and attentive. </p><p>  For breakfast, the main restaurant serves scrambled eggs, pancakes with and without filling, sausages, yogurts, cheese, sausage, ham, and fresh juices. </p><p>  On the lunch menu - dishes of fish, seafood, poultry, roast piglets.  Garnished with rice, vegetable <span>dishes, exotic</span> desserts from coconuts and bananas.  There is always a lot of fruit.  Bananas, passion fruit, papaya, citrus fruits, pineapples are served. </p><p>  The location of the restaurants is interesting.  Ambar is located next to the adult pool.  The food here is a <span>buffet.</span>  A dish is always enough for everyone.  You can also take water (pour into bottles from coolers). </p><p>  Italian (Rigoletto Pasta Club) is located in the lobby next to the sports bar.  In his name there is already a national Italian dish (pasta or small pasta), which is the face of this institution. </p><p>  Mexican (Santa Fe Grill) has a very good location - on the terrace of the second floor directly above the pool. </p><p>  Dominican (El Fogon) built on the beach.  Its menu has many <span>national</span> seafood dishes.  Also on the beach there is "Mango's" - a restaurant and a bar at the same time.  It serves a variety of drinks and light snacks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Costa Caribe Coral By Hilton 4" class="if" height="319" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/710427.jpg" width="431"></div>

    <p>  Coral Costa Caribe has several bars - near the central restaurant, on the beach, by the pool, in the disco club, not far from the Mexican restaurant and near conference rooms.  Rum is served in them (everyone likes it), beer, wine, a lot of all kinds of cocktails. </p><h2>  Sea and weather </h2><p>  Most tourists go to Coral Costa Caribe 4 * for the sake of the sea and beaches.  The Dominican Republic is a paradise of our Earth, where it is always summer.  Air temperature here rarely rarely drops below +30 in any month of the year.  Water temperature is always + 26-28.  The only difference in the weather is rain.  Least of them are from December to April.  The maximum is from August to October.  But even in the relatively rainy May, June, July, beach vacations are always excellent, because the showers in the Dominican Republic are powerful, but short-term, they do not affect the temperature of air and water, only humidity.  She is here about 80-90%.  Almost all tourists tolerate the heat normally, as sea breezes blow, giving a feeling of freshness. </p><p>  Juan Dolio resort is not crowded with tourists, it is always spacious on the beaches. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Coral Costa Caribe 4 Dominican Republic" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/710483.jpg" width="485"></div>

    <p>  Coral Costa Caribe Hotel has its own beach area, which differs from the neighboring ones in that there are practically no waves on the sea.  Sea water is warm and clean, there are few algae.  If you go from the beach in any direction, you can find completely secluded places.  There are no dangers in the person of local crime there.  The only nuisance that can happen is to step on the sea urchin in the water. </p><p>  Sunbeds on the hotel beach are free, but there are no umbrellas, only palm trees.  This is also part of the exotic - white clean sand, azure waters, palm trees swinging with twigs, a light sea breeze.  Violate this paradise only fruit and souvenir merchants who are present on any beach in the world.  True, here they are not intrusive. </p><h2>  Leisure on site </h2><p>  To forever remember the Dominican Republic, Coral Costa Caribe 4 * tries to provide its guests with an interesting leisure.  Their attention is offered: </p><p>  - a casino with roulette, poker tables and slot machines; </p><p>  - a pool with multiple sun loungers on the terrace (towels are provided every day); </p><p>  - Fitness Centre; </p><p>  - billiard tables; </p><p>  - sports grounds; </p><p>  - Numerous water sports (polo, diving, snorkeling, yacht regattas, canoeing, windsurfing and others); </p><p>  - golf; </p><p>  - Spa; </p><p>  - Spanish lessons. </p><p>  Every day, great animation is arranged - in the daytime on the beach, and in the evening, incendiary national dances are shown on the stage.  Always very nice and fun. </p><h2>  Leisure outside </h2><p>  All reviews about the Coral Costa Caribe 4 * hotel necessarily mention unique excursions.  Even those tourists who spent their entire vacation on the beach write about them.  You can buy sightseeing tours from Russian tour operators or from local ones (in the diving center of the hotel).  The most popular and unforgettable trips are: </p><p>  1. <em>To the island of Saona.</em>  It is the largest in the Dominican Republic.  Here you can admire unusual plants that do not grow anywhere else, amazing birds and animals, but the main trump card is starfish.  With them during the tour, everyone conducts photo shoots.  In addition, during this trip, they feed a delicious lunch with lobsters, treat them with drinks and cocktails, and have a dance party. </p><p>  2. <em>Samana</em> .  People come here to admire whales, which show real performances - they jump out of the water, make breathtaking somersaults, wave their tails.  All this takes place in a natural setting, not far from the coast in the open ocean.  Tourists admire all this beauty from the boat.  It should be noted that whales come here only from January to March. </p><p>  3. <em>Horse ride to the waterfall.</em>  This tour is suitable only for those who are in good shape. </p><p>  4. <em>To the island of Catalina.</em>  He is small but fantastically beautiful.  There are unique beaches even for the Dominican Republic, and Catalina is the best place for snorkeling.  On an excursion, they are deliciously fed, rolled along the river flowing in the mangrove jungle.  With any luck, here you can watch raccoons. </p><p>  5. <em>Santo Domingo.</em>  Not everyone likes the excursion to the capital of the Dominican Republic, although it is a unique city that takes its history from the end of the XV century.  Here you can admire very beautiful buildings, chapels, castles, towers, monasteries, visit the tomb of Columbus, go to museums, which have seven in the city.  The proximity of Santo Domingo from the hotel makes it possible to visit this city on your own, without buying a sightseeing tour. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviewed by Coral Costa Caribe Resort" class="if" height="329" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/710426.jpg" width="508"></div>

    <p>  If we talk about interesting objects near the hotel, they are not there.  Only the beach.  Therefore, in order to bring more impressions with you, visiting excursions is quite out of place. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Very good you can relax in Coral Costa Caribe 4 * (Dominican Republic).  The rating of this hotel, determined on the basis of reviews of tourists, ranges from 3.5 to 4 out of 5 possible points.  Its main advantage is an amazing beach, which is much better than in neighboring hotels.  Relatively moderate prices for accommodation and services also bribe. </p><p>  In addition, tourists include: </p><p>  - excellent food (a lot, everything is tasty and free, just enough); </p><p>  - amazing animation (especially national dances, as well as holidays organized on the beach); </p><p>  - calm, helpfulness and friendliness of the staff (they never refuse to change the number they didn‚Äôt like for the best, they help to solve all the problems that arise); </p><p>  - the opportunity to engage in numerous sports. </p><p>  People come to the hotel are very different.  Someone is positive and tries not to spoil the mood either to themselves or to others, but someone is constantly dissatisfied with something and after a rest writes a corresponding review.  Coral Costa Caribe Resort is really not a new hotel, and in local avenues declared as three-star.  According to most vacationers, the price in it is fully consistent with the quality.  And the disadvantages noted in the reviews are as follows: </p><p>  - there are rooms with old furniture, old towels and poorly functioning plumbing; </p><p>  - Executive staff, but slow; </p><p>  - the use in bars of plastic disposable cups as reusable (they are washed after use, and not clean enough); </p><p>  - lack of free internet in the rooms. </p>
