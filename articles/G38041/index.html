    <p>  It is worth saying that the name "Cro-Magnon" came from the rocky grotto Cro-Magnon, located in France.  In 1868, Louis Larte found several skeletons of people on this territory, as well as tools of the Late Paleolithic.  He later described them, after which it was found that these people existed about 30,000 years ago. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Build Cro-Magnon </h2><p>  Compared to Neanderthals, Cro-Magnons had a less massive skeleton.  The growth of early human representatives reached 180-190 cm. </p><p>  Their forehead was more straight and smooth than that of Neanderthals.  It is also worth noting that the skull of Cro-Magnon had a high and rounded arch.  The chin of these people was prominent, the eye sockets were angular, and the nose was rounded. </p>

    <p>  Cro-Magnon formed a direct gait.  Scientists claim that their physique was practically no different from the physique of modern people.  And this already says a lot. </p><p>  It was Cro-Magnon who was very similar to modern man.  <span>The lifestyle of the</span> early representatives of man was quite interesting and unusual, in comparison with their ancestors.  Cro-Magnons made a huge amount of effort in order to be as similar as possible to a modern person. </p><h2>  The earliest representatives of man are Cro-Magnons.  Who are Cro-Magnons?  Lifestyle, Housing and Clothing </h2><p>  Not only adults, but also children know who Cro-Magnons are.  We study the features of their stay on Earth back in school.  I must say that the first representative of the person who created the settlements was precisely the Cro-Magnon man.  The way of life of these people was different from Neanderthals.  Cro-Magnons gathered in communities of up to 100 people.  They lived in caves, as well as hide tents.  Representatives living in dugouts met in Eastern Europe.  It is important that their speech was articulate.  The clothes of the Cro-Magnons were skins. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  How did the Cro-Magnon hunt?  Lifestyle, tools of the early human representative </h2><p>  It must be said that the Cro-Magnons succeeded not only in the development of social life, but also in hunting.  The item "Features of the Cro-Magnon lifestyle" includes an improved method of hunting - driven fishing.  The earliest representatives of man hunted northern, as well as <span>red deer,</span> mammoths, <span>cave bears</span> , etc. It was the Cro-Magnons who were able to make special spear throwers that could fly up to 137 meters.  Harpoons and hooks for fishing were also tools Cro-Magnon.  They created snares - devices for hunting birds. </p><h2>  Primitive art </h2><p>  It is important that Cro-Magnons became the creators of European <span>primitive art.</span>  This is evidenced primarily by multi-color painting in caves.  Cro-Magnons painted on the walls and ceilings in them.  Confirmation that these people were creators of primitive art are engraving on stones and bones, ornament, etc. </p>

    <p>  All this testifies to how interesting and amazing the life of Cro-Magnons was.  Their lifestyle has become a subject of admiration even in our time.  It should be noted that the Cro-Magnons took a huge step forward, which significantly brought them closer to modern man. </p><h2>  Funeral rites of Cro-Magnons </h2><p>  It is worth noting that among the early representatives of man there were also funeral rites.  The Cro-Magnons decided to put various decorations, household items, and even food into the grave of the deceased.  They were sprinkled with <span>blood-red ocher, a</span> net was put on the hair of the dead, bracelets on their hands, and flat stones were laid on their faces.  It is also worth noting that the Cro-Magnons buried the deceased in a bent state, that is, their knees should have touched the chin. </p>

    <p>  Recall that Cro-Magnons were the first to domesticate an animal - a dog. </p><h2>  One version of the origin of the Cro-Magnons </h2><p>  I must say that there are several versions of the origin of the early representatives of man.  The most common of them says that Cro-Magnons were the ancestors of all modern people.  According to this theory, these people appeared in East Africa about 100-200 thousand years ago.  It is believed that Cro-Magnons 50-60 thousand years ago migrated to the Arabian Peninsula, after which they appeared in Eurasia.  According to this, one group of early human representatives quickly populated the entire coast of the Indian Ocean, while the second migrated to the steppes of Central Asia.  According to numerous data, it can be seen that 20 thousand years ago, Europe was already inhabited by Cro-Magnons. </p>

    <p>  Many people still admire the Cro-Magnon lifestyle.  Briefly about these early representatives of man, it is possible that they were as close as possible to modern man, as they improved their skills and abilities, developed and learned a lot of new things.  Cro-Magnons made a huge contribution to the history of human development, because it was they who made a huge step towards the most important achievements. </p>
