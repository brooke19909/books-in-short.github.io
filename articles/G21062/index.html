    <p>  In the Trans-Urals, there is a little-known Gorky Lake, it is unusually salty and in its characteristics resembles the Dead Sea, that is, it is impossible to drown in its water, and its mud is used to improve the body.  The village located next to it is called the Resort, but, unfortunately, the village is not really a resort, because the infrastructure around the lake is not developed and there are no suitable living conditions.  You can rent a corner with a local resident with amenities on the street or come with a tent.  However, this is not the only problem of the village, there are still a huge number of annoying insects that will not haunt the tourist day or night.  In the daytime these will be horseflies and gadflies, and at night - endless swarms of mosquitoes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Not far from the Kurgan is another lake called Bear.  Next to it is a sanatorium offering treatment based on healing mud and mineral waters.  Adherents of ‚Äúwild‚Äù rest in tents also come to this lake.  Some tourists come by car and find housing in the private sector (about 250-300 rubles per night), however, like any treatment, it is better to carry out therapy with mud and mineral waters under the supervision of a doctor. </p>
