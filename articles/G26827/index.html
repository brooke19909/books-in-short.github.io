According to the main technical characteristics, it can be safely attributed to the category of so-called ‚Äúsoap dishes‚Äù.  Along with this, against the background of the overwhelming majority of its ‚Äúrelatives‚Äù, the model has a significant advantage.  In this case, we are talking about an increased degree of reliability and security Nikon Coolpix AW120.  Expert reviews indicate that such a solution for devices of this class is unique. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nikon coolpix aw120" class="if" height="435" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/518074.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  general description </h2><p>  The dimensions of the camera are 110.1x66x25.8 millimeters.  The device weighs 213 grams.  The camera is available in black, orange, blue and a rather original camouflage color.  Be that as it may, one of the most popular is the first color scheme - Nikon Coolpix AW120 Black.  The novelty received a high-quality display with a diagonal of three inches and excellent clarity.  The number of points in it is 921 thousand pixels.  It should be noted that the display is coated with anti-reflective coating. </p><p>  The device uses a Nikkor lens, which has an optical five-fold zoom.  <span>The focal length</span> is from 4.3 to 21.5 millimeters.  Of course, he is far from serious modern optics.  On the other hand, he leaves many of his competitors far behind.  Largely due to the CMOS <span>type matrix,</span> good quality and contrast of photos taken by the Nikon Coolpix AW120 model are provided.  The overview of the lens is quite extensive.  At the same time, one cannot fail to note the fact that the color reproduction in the pictures is not very natural. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nikon coolpix aw120 black" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/518072.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The model is equipped with a matrix with a resolution of 16 megapixels.  Compared with the previous modification (AW110), more enlightened optics are used here.  The device is capable of bringing photographed objects up to five times, while maintaining a fairly high degree of wide-angle.  Full-resolution burst speed is almost seven frames per second.  Clear and blurry photos are created even when moving, which is facilitated by the electronic stabilizer used in the Nikon Coolpix AW120.  Customer reviews of the device are a vivid confirmation of this.  The model has a built-in Wi-Fi module.  Through it, you can quickly send pictures to a smartphone or other device that supports this function, and also control the camera remotely. </p><h2>  Durability </h2><p>  The operability of the device and its body will be preserved even if it falls from a two-meter height.  However, it is undesirable to conduct such experiments on your own, because any technique requires a careful attitude to yourself.  The model works well not only in cold weather, but also in hot hot deserts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nikon coolpix aw120 customer reviews" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/518073.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Nikon Coolpix AW120 comes standard with a lithium-ion battery, which has a full charge of about 350 shots or one hour of continuous video shooting.

The device is equipped with a GPS navigator, which tracks the coordinates of the place where pictures or videos are taken, and writes them to file properties.  If such a need arises, then on a computer you can overlay them on a map and compare them with the travel route.  It also allows you to navigate in such parameters as the location of the cardinal points, pressure, <span>altitude</span> or immersion depth at the shooting location.  Among other things, one can not fail to note the high frost resistance of the Nikon Coolpix AW120.  Customer reviews and representatives of the manufacturer indicate that the device functions normally even when the ambient temperature is 10 degrees below zero.  You can control the camera even with gloves on. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nikon coolpix aw120 review" class="if" height="486" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/518077.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Special modes </h2><p>  <span>The Nikon</span> Coolpix AW120 camera has several modes, which you need to choose based on the conditions in which shooting takes place.  In principle, the images are pretty good at any level of lighting.  The ‚ÄúNight portrait‚Äù mode is best suited for creating high-resolution photos in the dark and indoor portraits, ‚ÄúNight landscape‚Äù for sharp shots at low ISO, and ‚ÄúBack lit scene‚Äù is recommended for expressive shades.  There is another interesting shooting option here.  Underwater mode greatly facilitates the process of photographing underwater scenes.  When activated, <span>white balance is</span> automatically adjusted, and underwater images are obtained, as a rule, without distortion.  In this case, the picture is clearly visible on the liquid crystal display.  Every moment of rapidly developing events is best captured thanks to the possibility of continuous high-speed shooting.  As evidenced by the many reviews of extremely satisfied owners. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nikon coolpix aw120 reviews" class="if" height="188" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/518080.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Additional features and functions </h2><p>  The Nikon Coolpix AW120 digital camera can be used as a normal navigator, even without including the functions of creating photos or videos.  In addition, an electronic compass and a world map are built into it.  The software comes with the device.  With his help, on the basis of time and date of images, as well as coordinates, the user can independently build routes.  This is due to the <span>GPS module</span> mentioned above <span>.</span>  Nikon has created a free repository located on a special site called Nikon Image Space.  Here, every owner of a camera of this brand, regardless of modification, can use up to twenty gigabytes of space to save their pictures. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nikon coolpix aw120 camera" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/518079.jpg" width="600"></div>
