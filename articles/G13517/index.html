Game Overview</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you are new to the world of board games and have not yet had time to learn all the existing card strategies, then this article will undoubtedly be useful to you.  Today I will tell you what Innovation is.  Let this game for the first time be alienated by the abundance of terms and the complexity of the process, but do not drop it after the first attempt.  After all, the game "Innovation" to almost all of its fans opened in full only <span>from the second,</span> or even the third time.  So it‚Äôs worth the time to understand the process, as a result, you can spend your leisure time very pleasantly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is innovation" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12866/136121.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  So what is Innovation?  The game has several categories of cards: general cards, divided into 10 eras (from primitive to informational), cards of sphere of influence (five in total, issued for certain achievements) and tablets (one per player) containing brief reminders of the rules (which is very useful for a beginner) and delimiting the personal area of ‚Äã‚Äãparticipants. </p><p>  There is also a common zone, on which there are cards of the era and ten leadership cards (one from each era, corresponding dignity - from 1 to 10).  The most common victory condition is to collect the maximum number of leadership cards (acquired on influence points that can be accumulated using the properties of active era cards) and areas of influence.  This number becomes the smaller, the more people participate in the game. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But how to activate the properties, and what can they be?  In order to answer this question in the most accessible way, it is necessary to describe how the ‚ÄúInnovation‚Äù is going.  The game cannot boast of the complexity of the rounds and the variety of phases of the move, but sometimes this is more an advantage than a disadvantage.  During his turn, a player can do two actions (or the same thing twice): take an epoch card, throw a card from his hand into the game zone, activate the card from the game zone, and achieve leadership. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="game innovation" class="if" height="187" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12866/136119.jpg" width="600"></div>

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Consider each action in more detail.  Maps of the era are taken in ascending order.  That is, at first all cards of the first era are disassembled, then the second and so on (if there is no indication in the activated dogma which map should be taken).  If there are no cards of the era that is required, then the player takes a more progressive card. </p><p>  Maps of eras have resources and properties: cooperative (friendly) and aggressive dogmas.  They also differ in color, and if cards of a repeated color are discarded into the playing area, the earlier card will be closed (archived). </p><p>  What is ‚ÄúInnovation‚Äù in terms of game mechanics?  In general, the main gameplay is to activate dogmas, with which you can influence both your cards in your hand and the playing area, as well as the cards of your opponents.  The main options for activating one or another property: discard or take a card, archive it (put down stacks of the corresponding color), process it (return to the common area, under the bottom of the stack of the corresponding era), set off (move to the influence zone), move the stack ( the emergence of additional resources). </p><p>  Whether the dogma can be used by opponents depends on the amount of their resource indicated on the activated map.  When using aggressive dogma, those players whose resources in the game are less than those of the provocateurs fall under its action, and when cooperative is activated, only those who have the same or more corresponding icons on the cards in their personal gaming zone will be able to take advantage of it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="innovation game" class="if" height="180" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12866/136127.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  In general, the essence of the game is that, by activating various dogmas, to accumulate influence and not allow other players to do so, to gain leadership on the accumulated points (purchase ratio is 1 to 5, that is, you will need 5 points to acquire leadership of level 1 , and at level 5 already 25 points) and closely monitor the tables of opponents, preventing aggressive actions in your direction. </p><p>  I hope that now you have a little understanding of what ‚ÄúInnovation‚Äù is, and you will certainly test it in practice. </p>
