    <p>  Antalya resorts are located in such a way that they are easily accessible.  To get to the city of the same name, you need to take a plane, use water transport or make a trip by car.  At 12 kilometers from the city is an international airport.  True, direct access to Antalya by sea will not work.  Will have to make a transplant and overcome the remaining path on another transport.  The best hotel in Antalya is Barut Lara, which is part of the world-famous hotel chain Barut Hotels.  You can get to it by bus and taxi.  The status that almost all the resorts of Antalya have is 5 stars.  All Inclusive is the most sought after concept, and the best hotels serve their customers using this system. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  History </h2><p>  Antalya is a city with a long history.  Currently, it is completely built up with modern buildings, it has a very well-developed infrastructure.  However, this was not always the case. </p><p>  The history of Antalya began in 159 BC, when the subjects of King Attalos 2, on the orders of the ruler, went in search of the most beautiful place on the planet.  Then the city bore another name given to him in honor of the king - Attalia.  In the 13th century AD, after the Seljuks took possession of the city, it became known as Adalia.  It was changed to a name familiar to modern man in 1423, when Antalya became part of the Ottoman Empire.  And only in 1923 the Republic of Turkey was founded here. </p><h2>  What to see in Antalya? </h2><p>  Antalya resorts attract tourists not only by the large number of beaches and shops.  Arriving on the Mediterranean <span>coast of Turkey,</span> any traveler will discover the wonders of local architecture.  The most rich in monuments of architecture is the resort of Antalya (Turkey).  Since this settlement has a centuries-old history, the art of many civilizations has influenced its architecture.  Greek, Ottoman, Byzantine and Seljuk buildings are still preserved on the territory of the city. </p>

    <p>  The resort city of Antalya in Turkey is divided into two equal parts.  One of them, modern, attracts tourists with a developed infrastructure and an abundance of various shops.  The second part, or the Old Town, fascinates with monuments of ancient architecture.  This is where most of the old buildings, wooden houses are located.  What are the most popular sights of the old city? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Kesik Minaret, or the Truncated Minaret.  In ancient times, a temple was located in its place, later turned into the church of the Virgin Mary.  In the 15th century, by order of the Ottoman prince Shehzade Korkut, a mosque was built here, and a minaret was erected next to it.  In 1851, a terrible fire occurred, as a result of which the upper part of the minaret burned down.  Therefore, he got his name. </li><li>  The symbol of the city is the Yivli minaret, erected in 1230.  Its height is 38 meters.  This attraction can be seen from anywhere in Antalya.  Eight half-columns of the tower are decorated with mosaics, which is why the minaret got its name.  Translated, the word "Yivli" means "grooved." </li></ul><h2>  Alanya </h2><p>  At 120 kilometers from the international airport is a popular resort called Alanya.  This place is very popular among young people and couples.  Here you can find fairly cheap hotels, as well as beautiful long beaches. </p><p>  Antalya resorts are simultaneously cities.  So, Alanya cannot be called a large settlement, but this does not prevent it from being popular.  The city has picturesque orange and lemon gardens.  Here, fortresses of the Seljuk era are still preserved.  In the old town there are shops, fish restaurants, courtyards for tea parties and much more.  All resorts of Antalya, including Alanya, have a developed infrastructure.  This city has comfortable hotels, clubs, bars, shops and restaurants.  Nightlife is centered on the outskirts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>
