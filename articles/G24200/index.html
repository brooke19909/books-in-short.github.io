The name of this reservoir is directly related to the name of the village in which it is located.  Both the lake and the Meshchersky village in the times before the revolution belonged to the princely family of the Meshchersky.  Thus, they inherited their interesting name from the merchants at their disposal. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Meshchersky lake Moscow" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1156957.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Location and Features </h2><p>  <span>Meshcherskoye Lake (Moscow), a</span> photo of which can be viewed in the article, is located on the ground of the eponymous summer cottage village.  Its lands entered the border of the capital's administrative center in 1984.  Today, the holiday village has been transformed into a cottage.  This pond is also included in the collection of ponds located in the area.  In total, there are 6 components in the complex.  Namely, Meshchersky <span>Lake (Moscow)</span> and five artificially formed ponds along the Nawershka River (one of which is currently empty).  The lake basin was formed in the XVIII century by blocking the flow channel in the upper reaches. </p><h2>  Briefly about the lake </h2><p>  The length of Meshchersky Lake is 580 m, and its width is about 210 m. Two streets of the village, namely Ochakovskaya and Prudovaya, pass towards the south of the reservoir.  Meshchersky <span>Lake (Moscow)</span> adjoins the park of the same name, rich in interesting plants.  Here you can often meet strolling people who enjoy the surrounding landscapes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Meshchersky lake Moscow photo" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1156955.jpg" width="590"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Today, the Meshcherskoye lake is very popular among both local and visiting citizens.  In warm weather, the beach of the reservoir is filled with people, so vacationers with experience try to visit these places in the morning.  In the morning on the lake there is an opportunity to enjoy peace and loneliness.  And by lunchtime, the number of tourists is increasing significantly. </p><h2>  Animal and plant world </h2><p>  Meshchersky <span>Lake (Moscow)</span> has a sandy coastline, in places it is covered with soft grass.  The lake is surrounded by dense deciduous forest.  In some places there are marshy areas, it is undesirable for vacationers to go there. </p><p>  Also, this pond is a place for fishing lovers, as some species of fish live in it.  Among the plants growing near the pond, one can find hoofed eggs, honeysuckle, lunar, parsnip, and doveroot. </p><h2>  Conditions for vacationers </h2><p>  Meshchersky <span>Lake (Moscow),</span> reviews of which are mostly positive, is open for swimming around the clock.  Entrance to the adjacent territory, as well as swimming in the pond - are free.  In the summer, problems with entry into the territory may occur, as it is temporarily closed.  But there is always the opportunity to park a car near the lake, for example, on any street of the adjacent village.  This measure was introduced for the convenience of visitors to the beach, as well as to maintain the ecological situation. </p><p>  The beach has a high level of service.  First of all, a group of rescuers patrol the territory of the lake.  Modern amenities include changing cabins, showers, benches and toilets.  There is a <span>sports field</span> on the beach where you can play on the volleyball court.  Especially for children there is a beach "paddling pool" and a children's corner. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Meshchersky lake moscow reviews" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1156951.jpg" width="600"></div>

People from the neighboring regions of Moscow, as well as residents of the village, arrive on Lake Meshcherskoye.  Nonresident citizens visit the beach less often. </p><h2>  Meshchersky Lake (Moscow) - how to get there? </h2><p>  The nearest metro station from this beach is Slavyanskiy Boulevard.
