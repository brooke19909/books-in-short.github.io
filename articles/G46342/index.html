    <h2>  Let's start with the look </h2><p>  The entire front panel is covered by glass.  In the middle is a screen.  The frame around it is not very large and looks neat enough.  In the upper part you can see the front camera and sensors.  Under the screen is the logo of the creator and the earpiece. </p><p>  The back cover is iron.  Only on top, near the camera, is a plastic insert under which slots for SIM cards and a memory card are hidden.  Antennas are also located there.  In the lower left corner is the speaker grill. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A USB connector and Jack 3.5 for connecting headphones, users will find on top of the device Treelogic Brevis 715DC 3G.  Reviews of people indicate the convenience of this location.  On the right side of the device are the power key, a rocker for adjusting the volume, and you can also see the recess for the Reset button. </p><p>  The design of the gadget is extremely simple, does not stand out with catchy excesses and looks, although cheap, but pretty nice. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  What does the user expect in the package?  First of all, this is, of course, the tablet itself.  The manufacturer equipped the device with USB and OTG cables, an adapter for recharging.  There is also an instruction, where the main points of operation, as well as the characteristics of the device, are available. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="treelogic brevis 715dc 3g" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1125838.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Treelogic Brevis 715DC 3G: performance features </h2><p>  The processor is dual-core, at 1.33 GHz, its model is MediaTek MT8312.  The graphics accelerator is also not the latest model - Mali-400MP.  It is difficult even to recall in which year such characteristics were relevant and modern.  However, it is worth noting that the smooth operation and the execution of all necessary operations, and without special brakes, characterizes the Treelogic Brevis 715DC 3G.  The reviews of people who have already purchased it are proof of this. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In short: the available characteristics are enough to ensure that the "clean" Android "does not hang.  But it is necessary to warn consumers in advance - you don‚Äôt have to expect especially quick work from him. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  The memory in the device, frankly, is not enough.  Permanent only 4 gigabytes.  Moreover, the user, of course, is much less accessible - about 2.5 GB.  This is very small if you use the Treelogic Brevis 715DC 3G tablet as a navigator - Russian maps weigh about 3 GB. </p><p>  However, you do not need to get upset ahead of time.  This drawback was eliminated, as manufacturers built a slot for memory cards up to 32 GB.  It is worth noting that the RAM is only 512 MB, which is also not enough.  Although for simple applications this is quite enough. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet treelogic brevis 715dc 3g" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1125840.jpg" width="308"></div>

    <h2>  Channels for wireless </h2><p>  Regarding wireless communications, one thing can be said - the necessary minimum is present - and that‚Äôs all.  3G on both SIM cards, Bluetooth ver.  4.0, Wi-Fi b / g / n and GPS. </p><h2>  Display and cameras </h2><p>  Now let's look at the display of the device.  This is a <span>capacitive IPS screen,</span> with a resolution of HD, 1024x600 pixels.  Diagonal - 7 inches.  Watching videos and using the Internet on a bright and multi-color screen is a pleasure. </p><p>  As for the cameras, three words can be said about them - they are here.  Both the front and the main ones have a resolution of 0.3 MPh.  We can say that the first is quite suitable for Skype and selfie calls.  Naturally, you should not even try to dream of beautiful photos, since the pictures are just awful. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="treelogic brevis 715dc 3g specifications" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1125846.jpg" width="286"></div>

    <h2>  Features of work </h2><p>  A 2400 mAh battery lasts about 5 hours, which is very small for a portable device.  But, again, everything is relative - the main thing is to understand why it is needed in a particular situation.  In terms of software - there is a ‚Äúbare" Android 4.2.2 with a fairly small number of programs installed by the developer.  There is support for OTG. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The Treelogic Brevis 715DC 3G gadget turned out pretty good - at a budget price it offers smartphone functionality.  The large screen makes it possible to enjoy a bright and clear picture.  On a trip, the gadget turns into a good navigator, thanks to the support of navigation services.  OTG makes it possible to edit documents from a flash drive anywhere, in addition, since there is Bluetooth, you can connect a keyboard and turn the tablet into a small office station.  Well, if there is nothing to do, then the device can help pass the time for a simple, non-resource-intensive game.  As a result, we see that for its price the device provides wide functionality and is a very useful human companion in everyday life. </p>
