    <p>  VAT forms a kind of buffer providing for the additional market value of the goods produced by the enterprise.  Its calculation is based on the ratio of initial and final prices.  It was introduced in order to avoid multiple tax collection directly from the same value. </p><h2>  Interest rates </h2><p>  VAT is accrued for the sale of products and services to companies that operate in the Russian Federation.  As for foreign counterparties, as well as legal and physical persons residing in other states, completely different settlement principles are provided for them.  The table shows how much percent of VAT can be levied on citizens of the Russian Federation. </p><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td width="319"><p>  Rate </p></td><td width="319"><p>  Conditions </p></td></tr><tr><td width="319"><p>  0% </p></td><td valign="top" width="319"><p>  It is used for enterprises engaged in the manufacture of goods that are intended for sale in other countries.  <span>The tax service</span> may cancel the contributions if the IFTS had the relevant documents. </p></td></tr><tr><td width="319"><p>  10% </p></td><td valign="top" width="319"><p>  The legislation has a clause on the exemption of medical and children's products from taxes.  However, there are categories of goods that are taxed at this rate.

This percentage is charged from most individual entrepreneurs and organizations. </p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  Listing Procedure </h2><p>  Does not play a role, how much percent of VAT will be charged in each case, when it comes directly to payment.  The order of contributions is the same for all.  For counterparties that have received income in Russia, a period of a possible transfer of funds is provided, which lasts until the 25th day of the month, which follows the reporting quarter. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Each such payment is an advance payment.  Its amount is one third of the total contribution.  That is, the tax accrued for the year is divided into parts.  Therefore, payment must be made every four months. </p>

    <p>  If the goods were imported, then the accrued amount can be repaid in the next month after importation (no later than the 20th day). </p><h2>  Case Studies </h2><p>  If you know how much percent of VAT in Russia is levied on entrepreneurs and commercial organizations, it is not difficult to make calculations.  For example, there is a company that sells clothing retail.  To begin with, she must find partners who supply products to the market in bulk. </p><p>  Suppose they order 10 jackets from them for a total of 150,000 rubles.  The rate of 18 percent is applicable to this category of goods.  You can make calculations as follows: 150,000 * 0.18 = 27,000 rubles.  This amount will appear in the purchase invoice.  However, it may be deductible.  The supplier will pay it to the budget. </p>

    <h2>  Important changes </h2><p>  Certain changes were made to the VAT documentation.  How much interest in 2013 will have to pay for services related to customs clearance of goods, Russian companies have learned.  They began to be taxed at a rate of 18 percent. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Documentation was allowed directly in electronic form.  Specific electronic formats were clearly approved.  This method of reporting allows taxpayers to freely submit primary documentation to the relevant authorities. </p><p>  In accounting, sometimes there are difficulties with the calculation of tax, when a foreign company signs an agreement with the price in foreign currency or arbitrary units, and the terms of payment are specified in rubles.  A separate case is the circumstances in which an advance payment was made for the goods. </p><p>  Prior to this, the calculations were carried out as follows.  If it is reflected in the contract that the products supplied are paid in rubles, then the transaction amount is calculated at the official rate set on the day the funds were transferred.  Now the determination of the tax base is carried out earlier.  The basis is the date of shipment of the delivered goods or the day of payment for the upcoming delivery. </p>

    <h2>  In conclusion </h2><p>  People doing business should be aware of VAT rates anyway.  How many percent of the services and goods introduced by the Russian government at present, not everyone knows.  However, in modern life, this can always come in handy.  Throughout all time, people have to conduct business related to the provision of consumer services and the sale of goods. </p>
