It really appeared on world maps later than England, France or Russia.  However, its formation took place in parallel with the formation in Europe of secular national states </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="list of us presidents" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/239948.jpg" width="340"></div>  modern type.  And the events taking place on the American continent make it possible to speak quite rightly of the very rich history of the United States.  Of course, any political, military or social upheavals leave behind prominent historical characters.  And any people need the heroes of the past.  These outstanding personalities embody the unity of the history of the people, and therefore the unity and its general aspirations in the present.  That is why they are in such a hurry to perpetuate them in monuments, street names and art.  In this article we will turn to the world famous banknote - the American dollar, which reveals to us a special list of US presidents.  Those who made a significant contribution to the formation of the most powerful state in the modern world.  So, let‚Äôs denote the list of US presidents in order of increasing notes and note how the respective <span>political leaders</span> earned a ‚Äúregistration‚Äù on the notes of the world's most stable currency.  It is interesting that in the free circulation coins of only seven of the following denominations are issued: 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, $ 100.

    <p>  <strong>Thomas Jefferson immortalized on a two dollar bill</strong> </p><p>  He was a prominent figure in the struggle for independence from the British metropolis, as well as one of those who created the famous <span>Declaration of Independence.</span>  His presidency lasted from 1801 to 1809.  It was during this period that the territory of the newly minted state was significantly increased due to the purchase of French Louisiana. </p><p>  <strong>Liberator Abraham Lincoln</strong> </p><p>  The next to our list of US presidents was <span>Abraham Lincoln, whose</span> leadership was in the years 1861-1865.  Of course, everyone remembers him thanks to the abolition of slavery at the state level, which entailed a civil war, but still it was necessary for the technological, economic and social development of the state in the spirit of the times. </p><p>  <strong>Alexander Hamilton - an exception in the company of presidents</strong> </p><p>  This statesman is the only one who was not the president of the United States from the banknotes on American bills.  He is famous for his government activities in the presidential administration of Washington. </p><p>  <strong>Seventh Head of Country - Andrew Jackson</strong> </p>
