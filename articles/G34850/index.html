    <h2>  Calella </h2><p>  This is the name of the capital of one of the largest tourist centers near Barcelona.  It is located in a region called the Costa del Maresme, that is, the ‚Äúsea coast‚Äù.  Here is the hotel Medplaya Hotel Santa Monica (Calella).  This place is loved by tourists who come not only for a beach holiday, but also for traveling.  Calella is colorful, democratic and at the same time represents a wonderful transport hub.  The old town is located a little further from the sea, and the medieval castle towers - Forest of Torretes - even on a hill.  In the evening or in cool weather, you can take an interesting walk there.  From there you have a fantastic view of the surroundings.  In addition, you must visit the Church of St. Mary (sixteenth century), Dalmau Park and explore the beautiful palaces built at different times by the wealthy people of Catalonia.  In general, just walk around the city.  Any tourist will find something interesting for himself: bars (including flamenco), night clubs, taverns with fresh seafood.  All this can be found on the promenade Passy Maritim. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Medplaya Hotel Santa Monica 3" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1531858.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Should beach lovers stay here? </h2><p>  To the sea from the <span>hotel Medplaya Hotel Santa Monica 3 * (Spain)</span> walk just two minutes.  Across the road is a municipal sandy beach, equipped, clean, large, with paid sunbeds and umbrellas.  Almost the entire coast near Calella boasts Blue Flags.  In addition, you can sunbathe on your own towels.  And umbrellas are cheaper to buy in a shop with resort accessories.  Enough space for everyone, people do not lie up close.  Sunset at sea is smooth, but then the depth begins.  The sand is a little large, but it does not stick to the body.  The water is amazing azure and very clear.  There is a shower on the beach, which is very convenient, because the Mediterranean Sea is too salty.  A lot of water activities: trampolines, skis, windsurfing.  Volleyball nets, clean toilets.  The beach even catches wifi.  Nice bar with drinks and sangria.  If suddenly, beyond all expectations, the beach will be crowded, you can walk a kilometer and a half in the direction of St. Paul.  There you can also find a comfortable coast, but with secluded beautiful bays.  The farthest Calella beach - Roca Grossa - is known for its beautiful cliffs and coral reefs.  There even ride boats with a glass bottom.  It is very loved by divers, because you can watch the underwater flora and fauna.  Medplaya Hotel Santa Monica's pool has a children's area.  There are many sun loungers around, and they are always available.  The pool is well cleaned, but there is no smell of bleach. </p><h2>  Where to go from Calella? </h2><p>  Near the sea there is a promenade along which you can walk to both wild and nudist beaches, and even to neighboring towns.  Barcelona is often visited by local electric trains - Sercanas.  They are silent and comfortable.  Navigating among them is very simple.  If you stand facing the sea, then everything that goes to the right is to Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãand to the left - to the Costa Brava or Girona.  It takes about an hour to get to the capital of Catalonia, and a round-trip ticket costs no more than nine euros.  In one day you can even go to France, for example to Perpignan.  And if you are not afraid of a trip that takes several hours one way, look at the beautiful Tarragona with its monuments of Roman antiquity and the Middle Ages.  Not far from there is the Catalan Disneyland - a huge amusement park "Port Aventura".  Some railway companies even sell special tickets, the price of which includes visiting attractions.  Many tourists prefer to travel to the famous mountain of Montserrat, it is living in the Costa del Maresme.  It is convenient to get from here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Medplaya Hotel Santa Monica 3: reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1531864.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What to buy </h2><p>  Many tourists staying at the Medplaya Hotel Santa Monica have dedicated their reviews to local shopping.  Calella has many souvenir shops and boutiques with Spanish leather brand-name shoes.  But the main thing is not to forget about the siesta.  At least in Calella.  After all, from one o'clock in the afternoon to four to five in the evening everything is closed in this town, only Chinese shops with consumer goods work.  But if you want to buy figurines, magnets and similar trifles, then all this can be done in the long afternoon rest.  Take a closer look at the local ceramics.  Very good acquisitions await connoisseurs for only five euros.  And the dried fruit store will pamper you with different snacks at not too high prices. </p><h2>  Medplaya Hotel Santa Monica 3 *: reviews </h2><p>  The guests of this hotel like its convenient location, hearty, tasty and plentiful lunches and dinners, a large swimming pool.  They are very well fed, including many fruits.  Tourists claim that the food in the hotel is just like in the Egyptian, and even Turkish "five".  The hotel staff is very attentive and friendly.  You don‚Äôt have to miss in the evenings: if you leave the hotel you will find yourself in the noisy Calella, where the holiday lasts forever.  And every day you discover something new.  This hotel is good for a relaxing holiday with your loved one or family.  The area is quiet, there are no drunk youth, thundering discos until the morning, more family, authentic, Catalan atmosphere. </p>
