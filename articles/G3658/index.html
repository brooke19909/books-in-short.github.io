This is the youngest emirate with the capital of the same name.  Fujairah's sights are secluded recreational areas, picturesque nature, as well as unique cultural and architectural monuments. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dxbmarine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fujairah Attractions" class="if uuid-2552993" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49954/2552993.jpg"></div><h2>  General information </h2><p>  The only emirate among all is strikingly different from other regions of the country in many respects.  So, the nature of Fujairah is a separate phenomenon.  Unlike other emirates, green valleys and endless golden sand beaches stretch here.  There is no oil production, which only positively affects the attractiveness of the resort from a tourist point of view. </p><p>  This is the only emirate washed by the waters of the Arabian Sea (all the rest are surrounded by the waters of the Persian Gulf).  There is no place for skyscrapers and business centers.  But agriculture is well developed.  The emirate lives on the ongoing tourist flow.  By the way, the inhabitants of the UAE themselves with great pleasure prefer rest on Fujairah to other popular resorts.  There are all conditions for a secluded holiday: well-developed infrastructure, lush greenery, endless beaches, as well as unique sights of Fujairah. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="happytovisit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="weather in fujairah" class="if uuid-2552996" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49954/2552996.jpg"></div><h2>  Where to settle down? </h2><p>  On the territory of the popular resort there are many hotels of various "stardom".  There are modest fours and fashionable "monsters" of the hotel business.  ‚ÄúHilton‚Äù and ‚ÄúLe Meridien‚Äù - for true connoisseurs of comfortable rest, there are all conditions for a pleasant pastime. </p><p>  In the vicinity of Khor Fakkan there is everything that divers need.  In addition to a well-equipped base, here you can find exactly what attracts professional divers.  The underwater world of the Indian Ocean is an integral part of the nature of Fujairah, which will not leave indifferent any fan of deep-sea diving. </p><p>  Tourism in the emirate is developing well.  This is particularly facilitated by the unique sights of Fujairah, of which there are a great many.  It is worthwhile to dwell on some of them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.khayran.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Emirate of Fujairah" class="if uuid-2552999" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49954/2552999.jpg"></div><h2>  What to see? </h2><p>  Tourists should definitely visit Suk al-Jumaa (it is sometimes called the "Friday market", although it works every day).  This is a vivid example of a typically oriental bazaar with a distinctive Arabic flavor.  Here you can buy fabrics and spices, exotic goods and unusually beautiful souvenirs, as well as handicrafts and, of course, oriental carpets.  Tourists should be reminded that moderate bargaining is a familiar phenomenon, so you can safely ask the merchant to reduce the price. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Fort El Hale, built at the end of the 18th century, perfectly retained its original appearance.  The construction initially performed defensive functions.  Almost until the middle of the 20th century, the fort was the residence of Sheikh Fujairah.  Currently, it is a museum that surprises with unusual exhibitions and expositions. </p><p>  Al-Bidiya Mosque is another striking landmark of Fujairah, built in 1446 from brick and clay.  A distinctive feature is the absence of a minaret and a dome (only 4 instead of the usual 7 or 12).  The interior is not luxurious.  However, this mosque is a unique architectural monument in Fujairah. </p><p>  UAE attract various categories of tourists.  One of the most striking events are bullfights.  This is a peculiar local tradition, the popularization of which was facilitated by the Portuguese. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bayut.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fujairah nature" class="if uuid-2553005" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49954/2553005.jpg"></div><h2>  Tour program for tourists </h2><p>  Travelers who decide to visit Fujairah in the UAE should definitely visit the following places: </p><ul><li>  Etisalat Tower, which is one of the tallest buildings in the city.

Fujairah is located on the coast of the Persian Gulf at a time when all other emirates are located on the shores of the Gulf of Oman.  It is because of this that the climate of Fujairah is unusually mild, which, in turn, contributes to the development of agriculture.  The cultivation of crops in the open field is an unusual occurrence for other emirates. </p><p>  Winter is the rainy season, which cannot boast of torrential downpours.  So, for the entire period, about 80 mm of precipitation falls (for example: in the Dominican Republic, only 400 mm fall in autumn).  Wealthy residents of the Emirates often buy property in Fujairah only because the local climate favorably affects their general well-being. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cntravellerme.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fujairah Attractions" class="if uuid-2553020" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49954/2553020.jpg"></div><h2>  Holiday at the resort </h2><p>  Here is everything that even the most spoiled and demanding tourist needs.
