But for the second and third time, they want something exclusive, unprecedented.  And these, of course, are islands.  Krabi (the name of the province and its capital) in the Gulf of Andaman is the best that can be advised. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crab islands" class="if" height="274" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/275247.jpg" width="600"></div>  This is a paradise with luxurious flora and exotic fauna ... A land where, after a wave on the sand, there are many small clams and crustaceans (therefore the name is in this area), where, like bizarre mushrooms on their legs, rocks peep out from the depths of the sea ... tourists come who know exactly what can be taken from life.  Arrive from everywhere to enjoy the islands.

    <p>  Krabi Town itself is also very good.  Its center is small, but there you will find a good and cheap shopping.  The city itself is located on the mainland, but near it there are a lot of rivers, which - together with sea waters - make up the whole labyrinths in the jungle formed from mangroves.  It is very interesting to sail in boats with a "long tail" (in fact, this is a very popular means of transportation in Thailand, when the motor rises and lowers with the help of a pole to steer from shallow water). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crab islands" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/275248.jpg" width="500"></div>  In addition, there are a lot of interesting limestone caves with the remains of <span>stalagmites and stalactites,</span> as well as natural hot springs right in the rainforest.  The closest attraction is the Tiger <span>Buddhist Temple</span> (Wat Tam Sua).  One of the shrines of this complex is located on the top of the mountain, to which more than one and a half thousand steps lead.  Only the bravest ones decide on such a difficult path, especially in the heat.  But it is also not such feats that inspire guests to Thailand.

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crab Islands map" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/274131.jpg" width="339"></div>  <span>The island of Krabi</span> - so sometimes jokingly called tourists Railay.  This is another "trick" of the mainland of the province.  The peninsula, extended to the sea and separated from Krabi Town on the one hand, and the fishing village (and now the fashionable resort of Aonang) - on the other.  These wild cliffs have become the haven of many macaques that tourists love to feed.  These monkeys themselves jump from the cliffs into the water, frolic and dive - just for fun.  You can only get here by boat, since the steep mountains two hundred meters high are impassable.  On the peninsula there are several hotels, both five-star boutique and inexpensive, designed for backpackers.  You can see real islands with Railay.  Krabi is famous for its tiny, but amazingly beautiful rocks sticking out of the water.  But the island of Poda is the object of many excursions.  At their end, on the sandy shore, tourists fry meat and fish on a fire.  Or Chicken Island, similar to a chicken with a hundred-meter neck and feathers from the jungle.  A long sand spit leaves from it into the distance.  When a person steps on it, it seems that he is simply walking on water.  There are other islands here.  Krabi is often associated with the name "Hong".  This is a larger island that is farthest from land.  At one time, he suffered greatly from the tsunami, and there is a monument to the dead.  Guides show tourists the inner lake, which can only be reached through a narrow duct that disappears during high tide.

    <p>  But more than once, and not even two, you need to come here to visit all the islands of Krabi.  The map shows us that there are a huge number of them - there are large, but there are fewer.  And if you look at all the islands near Krabi Town itself, then there will still be large tracts of land, such as Koh Lanta.  And also an archipelago in the neighboring province of Pang Nga.  (including <span>James Bond Island).</span>  And even further - an hour away - are the most beautiful places in Thailand.  For example, the island of Pi-Pi, where the famous film starring DiCaprio was shot. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thailand crab island" class="if" height="370" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/275246.jpg" width="600"></div>  In a word, these picturesque and bizarre landscapes, with greenish or crystal clear blue water, white or yellow sand, rocks, where monkeys, lizards and amazing bird colors lurk, will forever remain in your memory and heart.  It is only worth seeing them once.
