  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Board Games Market: Popular Games and Their Manufacturers</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Not so far from us it took the time when people gathered together for the sake of the game, not for excitement, but for the sake of entertainment and communication.  With the advent of TV and the Internet, this type of recreation was almost completely replaced by TV shows and online communication.  But as a social being, a person continues to desire communication.  In order for people who are not used to relaxing together to feel completely bored, there is a market for board games. </p><h2>  Old friends </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.playusa.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="popular board games" class="if uuid-3136167" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98521/3136167.jpg"></div><p>  More recently, the market for board games was limited to dominoes, playing cards and lotto.  In some houses, paying tribute to fashion, chess and checkers settled.  Recently, backgammon came from Central Asia to our everyday life.  Their popularity is still undeniable.  First of all, it plays the role of the rules of the game, familiar from childhood, which do not need to be translated from another language, you do not need to delve into foreign ways of thinking in order to understand the rules. </p><p>  Board games of Russian production are affordable, which can also be written in their advantages.  Not so long ago, there were sets of games in which several types of entertainment were collected at once.  For example, chess, checkers and backgammon, for which one playing field or adapted for another game.  For beginners, this is a real find.  However, time does not stand still, and the board games market is constantly updated with new products. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How much is the pleasure of having fun chatting? </h2><p>  For those who want to spend time not only with interest, but also for the benefit of the mind and logic, or those who like to laugh heartily, and maybe for those who would like to move, everyone will find a game to their taste.  It is only necessary to familiarize yourself with the instructions before purchasing and choose the company that is suitable for the assembled company.  The cost of the so-called tincture is quite loyal. </p><p>  On the board games market in Russia, one can now find kits for any wallet.  The simplest games on the road cost from 100 rubles.  But who said that they cannot be used to communicate in a close circle?  It‚Äôs clear that the better the game is designed, the more expensive the material from which it is made, the higher the rating of the manufacturer, the more you will have to pay for it. </p><h2>  Favorites from the West </h2><p>  The most popular board games in the USA and European countries in our country are just starting to gain their fans.  Everyone probably heard names like ‚ÄúMonopoly‚Äù, created in 1934 by Charles Darrow, or ‚ÄúMafia‚Äù, the Russian version of ‚ÄúScrabble‚Äù of the popular Scrabble game in America, which appeared in 1938 thanks to Alfred Butts, but not everyone has an idea, what exactly are these games.  Someone read about them in foreign detectives, someone saw a movie.  But in America there is not a single house where there would be no kits for such a pastime. </p><p>  These game strategies, using the simplest and most accessible examples, teach children logical thinking and economic programming, composing words and whole phrases from single letters or syllables.  There are games offering to develop imaginative or associative thinking.  You can simply compete on the speed of passing the playing field or seriously try to build or capture an entire empire.  Even adults are happy to compete with each other in these areas. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  A selection of games for different ages </h2><p>  This entertainment is perfect for almost all people who want to spend time comfortably in the company of family or loved ones.  Recently, mankind has plunged into the virtual world, experiencing programmed situations in various computer games.  However, the encoded solution in the game is boring. </p><p>  Perhaps that is why board games are again in fashion with incredible speed, allowing you to make decisions yourself.  Board games are almost as good as computer games in design and beauty, and the tactile sensations of contacting the game directly and the real team spirit or an element of rivalry with the opponent, which is in the vicinity, can not be compared with any virtual games. </p><p>  In addition, when choosing a game, you can perfectly navigate by age categories.  Board game manufacturers are trying to diversify the leisure of people of all ages.  Buying a toy specifically for the child, you need to focus on his needs.  If the child is 2 years old, you should not buy him a game labeled "12+".  It is unlikely that he will be able to understand the rules.  And the teenager will not be interested in mastering the game, which says "6+".  If parents are ready to support their child, then playing will be much more interesting for parents, kids and teenagers. </p><h2>  Games with a twist </h2><p>  For older companies, you can purchase games with a special mark "18+".  The charm of these games is that their presence indicates the degree of proximity of the players.  The very specific rules of these games do not provide for the participation of children or too scrupulous people who are not ready to discuss their intimate life, even as a joke.  If an adult company consists entirely of people who are far from such entertainment, then it is quite possible to fill up leisure activities for teenagers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Replacing familiar cards </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.npr.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="board games market in Russia" class="if uuid-3136187" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98521/3136187.jpg"></div><p>  I would like to recall the most popular board games.  Of course, these are playing cards.  Recently, board printed games provide a wide variety of variations of playing cards.  Sometimes they are accompanied by a map of the area or the playing field.  There may be some additional attributes that may come in handy during the game.  They can be replenished, that is, you can additionally buy some items or rarer cards, or fully equipped.  Such games can be played from half an hour to several hours, depending on the involvement of the players.  The popularity of board printed games is undeniable.  Just look at the sales ratings on the sites. </p><p>  Among such games can be noted such as ‚ÄúUno‚Äù, in various interpretations, ‚ÄúBoss Monster‚Äù with incredible associations of the evil boss, ‚ÄúEvolution‚Äù with the ability to create new and more adapted to the complexities of life on Earth, ‚ÄúBerserk‚Äù with unique and colorful characters, "Truth Detector" from the category 18+ and other, no less entertaining games.  Thus, the usual game of ‚ÄúFool‚Äù or the boring ‚ÄúSolitaire‚Äù can be replaced by fascinating adventures, tempting travels, battles with monsters, and simultaneously solving world problems to save humanity. </p><h2>  Domino or 7 Wonders </h2><p>  If you recall plastic board games, then dominoes and checkers come to mind.  With the long use of one game, logical thinking is replaced by automation of moves.  Of course, you can build fortresses or unstable structures from knuckles and checkers, but it is more pleasant to do this alone, and not in company.  Board game manufacturers have diversified these game sets. </p><p>  Rather, it will even be said - they re-created games that can appeal to both children and adults.  Each game set initially has several scenarios for the development of the game, depending on how the players will behave.  Many sets offer to master strategies for building your own business or city, and possibly the whole kingdom.  The presence of intrigue, a rollback during wrong moves - all this is exciting and does not allow you to be bored. </p><p>  Such games include the already popular Monopoly, which develops entrepreneurial abilities, Right Honey - an instructive game with various adventures, Colonizers, 7 Wonders and others.  The diversity of the board game market is striking in its capabilities. </p><h2>  Quest games </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.forevergeek.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="board games of Russian production" class="if uuid-3136174" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98521/3136174.jpg"></div><p>  There are board games that people who are accustomed to think outside the box and develop the course of events in their own scenario will enjoy.  For fans of such entertainment, there are also several types of games. </p><p>  For example, "Detectives" or "Holmes: Sherlock or Mycroft" will not let an inquisitive mind get bored, constantly throwing up evidence or unexpected witnesses who may help solve the crime, or may just more and more confuse the investigation.  Only a professional can understand the intricacies of the author‚Äôs intention.  The beauty of such games is that they, as a rule, have many scenarios for which they will not get tired of playing after a few years. </p><h2>  Century construction </h2><p>  For those who want to not only sit and think, but also to work with their hands, there are wooden board games without mechanisms.  Everyone remembers sticks from childhood called the Leaning Tower.  The sticks had to be folded down by the tower, and then taken apart so that it did not crumble.  Now this game is called "Jenga", and it is still popular. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cbgames.kiev.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="board game certification" class="if uuid-3147046" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57090/3147046.jpg"></div><p>  If logical thinking and vision allows, you can complicate the game by building a tower on top so that the base becomes narrower and the upper part gradually expands.  The game ends at the moment when the construction constructed by the efforts of several players collapses due to the wrong course of one person.  Passion in such a situation just rolls over! </p><h2>  Party games </h2><p>  If you are planning a fun party, then you should think about which game will not let active guests get bored.  They should include both movement and artistry, and the ability to strain gyrus, since nothing helps so much fun as solving riddles with a trick.  For such amusements, Ekivoki or Code Names, Activiti and Imaginarium, and many others are suitable.  These games can be compared with the ‚ÄúCrocodile‚Äù familiar to a Russian person, but the rules are slightly different and can be explained using elements conceived by the game. </p><p>  And, of course, the Twister game set, which has already become familiar to fun companies.  If the hosts have this game, then laughter and pleasure are provided to the guests.  The simplicity of the rules, close communication and the uniqueness of each move will not allow anyone to remain indifferent. </p><h2>  Eastern thinking </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.maxiaids.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="board game manufacturers" class="if uuid-3136700" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98521/3136700.jpg"></div><p>  You can develop thinking outside the box for Western stereotypes with the help of Chinese board games.  They came to us from eastern countries, which in turn adapted them for themselves.  The most famous game can be called checkers.  Only those that are familiar to us have nothing to do with the Chinese.  Chinese checkers are called "Go" and "Halma". </p><p>  Go is the most complex, requiring a very thorough approach to the development of logic.  That is why these drafts moved to Japan and found their admirer there.  "Halma" are more popular checkers.  In Russia, you can find a similar game, which was called "Corners" and was a hexagonal field with different checkers.  Over time, this game was forgotten. </p><p>  The board game market is now filled with original versions of ancient entertainment.  The whole difficulty lies in the fact that games are not just a set of rules, but also an extraordinary adoption of a situation.  For example, the familiar ‚ÄúMahjong‚Äù is not a simple entertainment with elements of the development of memory. </p><p>  In the original, this is a real strategy with intrigues and instructive knowledge of local customs and ceremonies.  And do not be surprised at the ambiguity and complexity of the rules of Chinese board games.  After all, almost all the games in China were born by commanders who on the table tried to work out the tactics of warfare and the strategy for their troops. </p><h2>  Entertainment Corporation </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.magazineluiza.com.br" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="board games printed" class="if uuid-3136169" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98521/3136169.jpg"></div><p>  We are already used to the fact that most of the goods are manufactured in China.  It just so happened - you want to buy inexpensive goods, take it marked Made in China.  In this situation, talking about certification of board games is not worth it.  Especially if the game is purchased on the street or on the Internet.  However, if the kit is bought at a store or supermarket, then most likely the quality will still be higher. </p><p>  Nevertheless, there are companies producing board games that do not work with shops, and sell their goods directly to the buyer via the Internet.  The problems of the Russian market are very difficult to overcome for start-up companies, which is why adaptation of foreign games to the thinking of the domestic consumer takes place so slowly. </p><p>  Nevertheless, companies such as Zvezda and YaIgrushka, Khlopik and Simple Rules continue to market their products, delighting consumers not only with games from the West with rules translated into Russian, but also with completely original solutions in gaming industry. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.xmas-toys.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="chinese board games" class="if uuid-3136155" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98521/3136155.jpg"></div><p>  Having considered all the proposed options for board games in a toy store or on a website on the Internet, everyone can find for themselves something not only interesting, but also useful.  Board games in the family bring children and parents together, which helps to overcome many of the problems that arise in the process of education. </p><p>  Nowadays, when you have to save on just about everything, such entertainment may well become a substitute for going to the usual places for relaxation where you have to leave more than a thousand rubles.  If guests suddenly came and there was practically nothing to put on the table, then a fun game can help out too.  In general, whatever one may say, the presence of several sets of board games in the house is simply necessary! </p>
