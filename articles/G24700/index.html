There is a total of more than 670 mm of precipitation here in a year. </p><p>  Back in Soviet times, there was a children's sanatorium for people with bronchial asthma, pneumonia, etc. Also in those days, boarding houses and rest houses with year-round operation were created here. </p><p>  Today, the largest beach areas of Gaspra are beaches located in the sanatoriums “Parus”, “Yasnaya Polyana”, “Pine Grove”, “Marat”, etc. Below we will provide a more detailed description of some of them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The swimming season in these paradise places lasts from June to October. </p><h2>  Gaspra beaches </h2><p>  Many beaches are beautifully landscaped: changing rooms, showers, sun loungers and sun umbrellas. </p><p>  But the only place where tourists can spend their holidays for free, without being guests in local sanatoriums and hotels in this village (Gaspra) is the municipal beach.  Its entire length is about 400 meters.  It is located between the beaches of the sanatoriums "Ukraine" and "Yasnaya Polyana".
