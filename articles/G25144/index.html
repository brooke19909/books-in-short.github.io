The city is developing, its borders are expanding, so at the moment the construction is on the rise: new buildings, entire complexes appear, mainly in the suburbs.  LCD "Aspen Grove" in St. Petersburg is a <span>new residential</span> microdistrict being built in several stages.  The project attracted the attention of potential residents with the scale of construction and its own infrastructure guaranteed by the developer.  It remains to understand what exactly awaits buyers of apartments and first residents. </p>

    <h2>  about the project </h2><p>  The Aspen Grove residential quarter is a large-scale development organized by the Government of the Russian Federation by order of the Ministry of Defense of the country in order to provide military families with comfortable housing as part of the state program.  At the moment, the complex has been commissioned and is fully populated, which allows us to draw the first conclusions about how comfortable and thoughtful it was.  Given the fact that the complex was built by order of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, apartment prices here are much lower than market prices. </p><h2>  Contractor </h2><p>  The developer of "Aspen Grove" was the block-building house "Block".  On his account there are enough new buildings, <span>residential complexes</span> and quarters.  In the creation of each of them, the company resorts to the use of advanced technologies and innovations that allow achieving perfect results. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Architecture and Technology </h2><p>  49 buildings with a height of 7 to 17 floors have been phased out since 2010.  For the construction, a unique European technology of seamless <span>monolithic construction of houses was used.</span>  This allows buildings to retain heat perfectly, which is so important in quite severe weather conditions.  Moreover, the technology makes it possible to prevent the formation of so-called interpanel seams - the main drawback of Soviet-era prefabricated houses.  The first residents who managed to settle down and make repairs, the quality of buildings is referred to the main advantages of the microdistrict.  The noise of the neighbors never becomes a headache due to the excellent sound insulation, and in the winter season they manage to save on heating due to the fact that the houses retain heat very well. </p><p>  All the necessary communications are brought to the houses: electricity, water supply, gas supply and, of course, the Internet. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  For the construction of new buildings in the "Aspen Grove" was chosen Vyborgsky <span>district of St. Petersburg, the</span> territory of the village of Pargolovo.  From here, only 15 minutes to <span>the metro station</span> "Prospekt Enlightenment".  You can get to it not only by private car, but also by public transport, the options of which only expand every year. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  It is an area with excellent ecology, remote from the hustle, bustle and city dust.  The air here is much cleaner than in other areas of the city, and the nearby park of the same name and lakes have become a favorite place for leisure and recreation for all residents.  And this is just as important: despite the fact that the territorial housing complex "Aspen Grove" in St. Petersburg belongs to the suburbs, its residents receive a city registration. </p><h2>  Housing plan </h2><p>  Apartments in the "Aspen Grove" (St. Petersburg) will satisfy every taste.  They are represented by one-room, two-room, three-room and four-room options.  The layout in almost all buildings is the same: these are quite spacious bright rooms of the right square shape with comfortable corridors and large kitchens.  Depending on the layout, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãone-room apartments varies from 37 to 44 square meters, two-room apartments - from 53 to 63 square meters.  The maximum size of a four-room apartment is 110 square meters - an excellent option for families with children, where everyone will get their own room. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  In addition to residential buildings, the Aspen Grove residential complex in St. Petersburg also included social infrastructure facilities.  Two kindergartens and two comprehensive schools are open here, which at the moment is quite enough for all children. </p>

    <h2>  Extra comfort </h2><p>  Beautification works were carried out on the territory of the complex: paths were laid, walking areas were organized, places of rest were laid out, flower beds and flowerbeds were broken, trees were planted.  In addition, modern playgrounds and sports grounds are organized here, designed not only for children, but also for their parents. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  When the complex has already been put into operation, you can draw the first conclusions about how successful it turned out.  Residents complain about the underdeveloped infrastructure of the neighborhood.  Indeed, given that this is a new residential area, many facilities have not yet been completed.  Residents note that all the shortcomings identified as a result of the acceptance of apartments were eliminated by the developer within two weeks.  The good news is that there are very few shortcomings; they were identified in only 5% of cases, which only confirms the high level of construction and the reliability of the developer company, who undertook the project. </p>
