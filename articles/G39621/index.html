    <p>  Setting up the Mi Band 2 bracelet does not take so much time, the main thing is to strictly follow the instructions that are given in the instructions.  The bracelet is packed in a box of light brown cardboard.  In the box is a recess in which the electronic capsule lies.  Its upper part is covered with special glass.  A bracelet is located directly under the capsule along with instructions for using the device.  Not far from the capsule is a charger that has a USB connector. </p><p>  The track is carefully removed from the belt and inserted into the charger.  The contacts of the products must fit snugly against each other.  The USB connector connects to an available USB 2.0 port on a computer or on an adapter.  An electronic capsule is considered fully charged if all three indicators light on the case.  The first charge of the device lasts about two hours.  In the future, it will take less time to charge the device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  You can‚Äôt try to charge the tracket in any other way.  Otherwise, it may burn out.  Do not insert the charger into the adapter, where the current is 2 A. In this situation, it can be severely damaged. </p><h2>  Registration procedure </h2><p>  Setting up Mi Band 2 starts with registering your own Mi account.  The registration procedure can be completed both on a smartphone and through a browser on the Internet. </p><p>  When registering through a browser, click on the links located on the official website of the company or in the instructions for use of the device.  First of all, you should fill out a questionnaire.  In the line "Country / Region" indicate the country in the cell "Email" enter the email address.  Opposite the value of ‚ÄúBirthday‚Äù, the date of birth is indicated.  You need to uncheck the box from the newsletter, as the information comes in Chinese.  Next, enter a password, which must have at least eight characters, and captcha.  In the profile, you should mention the phone, which will help restore the password in case of loss. </p><p>  As a login, an email address or phone number is used. <br>  Registration in the Mi-system can be done through a smartphone after installing the appropriate application.  If the parameters were incorrectly entered in the Mi Band 2 tracket, resetting the settings will help to eliminate this inaccuracy. </p><h2>  Application installation </h2>

    <p>  Fitness bracelet is simply indispensable for people involved in sports.  They are happy to use the useful features of the device.  They can configure the options as they wish via a tablet or smartphone.  The Xiaomi Mi Band 2 bracelet is a simple and quite stylish gadget.  Even a schoolboy can easily figure out its functions.  The device is compatible with many well-known operating systems. </p><p>  In addition to the above positive qualities, the device has one and a very significant drawback.  The manual does not say a word how to reset to factory settings.  Mi Band 2 in this case should be used in conjunction with a tablet or smartphone.  The app for the Mi Fit tracker must be installed.  So, the procedure for resetting the device is as follows: </p><ul><li>  Snap Mi Band2 to your profile. </li><li>  Open the Mi Fit app and sign in. </li><li>  Untie the bracelet from the profile.  To do this, in the Mi Fit application, select the ‚ÄúUnpair‚Äù option and click on it.  Fitness tracket will be detached from the profile. </li></ul><p>  After the above actions, the bracelet will not be in the user list.  Now the bracelet can be tied to another user.  To do this, the snap button is activated and the selection is confirmed once again by pressing the same button.  After binding to a new profile, the bracelet will begin to vibrate, which means a complete reset. </p><p>  If you can‚Äôt access the profile to which the fitness tracker is attached, you cannot reset the settings using this method.  In this case, some users recommend completely discharging the device.  Given the autonomy of the tracker, the battery will completely discharge in a month, and this is too long.  Some users at their own risk recommend putting the electronic capsule in the freezer, but there are no facts indicating the correctness of such actions and a positive result. </p><p>  Above it was considered how to reset the settings of Xiaomi Mi Band 2, and now let's move on to the cost of the device. </p><h2>  Gadget cost </h2><p>  The cost of a sports gadget ranges from 1,500 to 2,500 rubles.

    <p>  The Xiaomi Mi Band 2 fitness bracelet is set up by users on their own.  The instructions that came with the bracelet fully describe all the necessary activities.  User reviews note the versatility of the device, its stylish and modern design.  Particularly highlighted is the function of the pedometer, which helps them track activity.  It has an error of 10 steps.  People like the option of notification of incoming calls, an alarm, which works better than on the phone. </p><p>  Another advantage to users attributed the price, which is much lower than that of competitors.  Also, the device has a pleasant vibration, the display is resistant to mechanical damage, the ability to record deep phases of sleep. </p><p>  The disadvantages people attribute the lack of a stopwatch.  Too low level of moisture protection.  They warn that the strap should be worn on the bare hand, otherwise it may loose and slip off.  Some people do not like that the device does not consider other physical activity, but only steps.  In the sun, time and other indicators are not visible.  The device does not take into account cycling and does not perceive daytime sleep. </p><p>  In general, users were satisfied with this gadget.  We are pleased to use all the functions provided by the device.  They say that a fitness bracelet helps them to be more active and slim.  It provides an incentive and is very motivating.
