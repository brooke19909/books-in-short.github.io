The main conditions are the coordination of forces, the ability to act quickly and strict discipline.  The meaning of the word ‚Äúblitzkrieg‚Äù was never taken by the Germans literally, and until a certain point it was used only in military circles.  In official sources, this term appeared only after the German attack on Poland in September 1939.  In various publications one can find a description of several versions of the appearance of the theory of blitzkrieg.  Let us dwell on each of them. </p><h2>  Heinz Guderian's Blitzkrieg Theory </h2>

The response to such a statement was predictable.  Nobody believed him.  However, Hitler entrusted Guderian to demonstrate the blitzkrieg technique in action against the troops of France and the <span>British Empire.</span>  The result was not long in coming: in a few weeks the enemy was pushed to the beaches of Dunkirk.  The factor also worked out for the Germans that, being conservatives, the French and British used only strategic tactics tested over the years, without making any changes.  Using the Blitzkrieg plan, Poland managed to enslave in just seventeen days.

He came to the conclusion that only the tactics of the last two years had a positive result, therefore it was precisely her that had to be taken as a basis in preparing the new generation of the German army.  In his opinion, the attack on the enemy should have taken place according to the following scheme:

    <p>  1. Initially, a short but powerful attack on the weakest flank of the enemy with the help of artillery, smoke and noise grenades. </p><p>  2. Next, the work of the assault squads on the final cleaning of the occupied territories. </p><p>  According to Hans von Sect, blitzkrieg is an improvement in military affairs in general.  He believed that not only the theory of warfare needed modernization, but also military equipment, including weapons. </p><p>  Some sources claim that the Blitzkrieg warfare technique was discovered by Charles de Gaulle and described in his book in 1934, while the German command only slightly modified it.  In his understanding, a blitzkrieg is a modernization of military power. </p><h2>  Operation Blitzkrieg as interpreted by the USSR </h2><p>  The Theory of Deep Offensive Operation, described in the textbooks on tank battles published in 1935, is a Soviet blitzkrieg. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="blitzkrieg operation" class="if" height="296" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20153/406477.jpg" width="550"></div>  The main goal is a quick, even rapid penetration of enemy territory, using tanks not for long battles, but for destabilizing the fighting spirit of the enemy army and disrupting offensive and defensive operations.

Artillery was used to break through the enemy‚Äôs line, followed by tanks and assault detachments of the marines. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="assault squads" class="if" height="445" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20153/406617.jpg" width="600"></div>  The main task of the second stage of the Blitzkrieg operation is to enter the enemy‚Äôs deep rear and firmly consolidate their positions there.  The assault squads tried to destroy the enemy‚Äôs communication facilities as much as possible, to deprive the command in order to destabilize the enemy and reduce his fighting spirit.  To communicate with their units, the German troops used only radio, which has already established itself as the most reliable in the military field.

    <h2>  Fiasco Blitzkrieg Wehrmacht in the USSR </h2><p>  The main and fatal mistake of Germany in the attack on the USSR is reliance on the tactics of a positional attack.  The Russians, given the experience of the civil war, made the most of the maneuvering technique, which often confused the advancing enemy.  Making the main emphasis on <span>tanks, the Wehrmacht</span> counted on the most deep penetration into the territory of the USSR, using the blitzkrieg tactics.  This worked only during the first years of the war, and then it became meaningless, because tanks were manufactured at Soviet factories that could move on wheels and tracks, which greatly complicated the enemy‚Äôs task. </p><p>  Using blitzkrieg tactics, the Germans did not change anything in it during the war, considering their strategy ideal.  Their predictability and unwillingness to move away from the chosen pattern of warfare played a cruel joke.  This is exactly what the Soviet troops took advantage of, having achieved victory in hard battles and liberated their native land from the invaders, however, like most of Europe. </p>
