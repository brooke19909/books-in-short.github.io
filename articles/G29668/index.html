  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Natural treasure of Slovenia - Shkotsyan caves</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Since ancient times, the human imagination has been disturbing everything unknown.  The underworld, which is a world of complete darkness and dead silence, is strikingly different from the usual one, filled with sunlight.  Many caves that store the energy of past eras are still not fully understood, even grottoes open to visitors and now present many surprises. </p><h2>  Underground Nature Reserve </h2><p>  The mysterious caves of Slovenia are one of the important points of all tourist routes.  Škocjanske jame is located in the south-west of the country on the Kras Plateau, the world's most famous karst region.  This is a unique biosphere reserve, protected by UNESCO and hidden underground. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Shkotsianske Pit" class="if uuid-2574205" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2574205.jpg"></div><p>  The first mention of caves is found in ancient Greek chronicles, but a full-fledged study of a natural miracle began in the 19th century.  It was at this time that tourist routes were laid.  28 years ago, scientists discovered more than 200 new passages of the Shkotsyan caves. </p><h2>  Natural miracle created by nature </h2><p>  One of the largest cave systems in the world has been perfectly preserved to our days from prehistoric times.  Stretching for 6,200 meters, she makes one admire the unique mastery of Mother Nature, which created an amazing masterpiece. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Shkotsyan caves, deservedly included in the UNESCO World Heritage List, are the result of the centuries-old struggle of water and stone, and the rocks lost this battle long ago.  Many centuries ago, in the era of the Early Pleistocene, a small rivulet flowing inside tangled labyrinths carved a huge canyon in limestone rocks, whose height is more than 140 meters, and its width ranges from 10 to 60 meters.  As a result of the karst processes (natural phenomena, as a result of which water acts on rocks, which leads to the formation of underground tunnels), some areas of the miraculous masterpiece settled.  They formed the failures of Mala Dolina and Velika Dolina, separated by a bridge that appeared in the last century. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.landschaftsfotos.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Shkotsyan caves" class="if uuid-2574262" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2574262.jpg"></div><h2>  Underground river </h2><p>  A river 38 kilometers long, passing through all the dungeons, reaches the surface of the earth in Italy.  The claimed water artery sometimes alarms the dungeon, filling the grottoes during floods and washing away the streaking formations.  The most devastating flood occurred in 1965, when water rose above the pedestrian bridge.  For safety reasons, descent to the underground river is currently impossible, and tourists watch from above the blue artery running along the bottom. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Little-studied mazes </h2><p>  To this day, scientists are studying stone labyrinths, many of which are not accessible to visitors.  However, open grottoes made of limestone allow you to enjoy the bewitching beauty of the underworld, hidden from the eyes of people.  You can admire the mesmerizing spectacle in the light of electricity, conducted in 1959 along the entire length of the Shkotsyan caves.  The lighting here is very well thought out, and the paved route is designed in such a way that visitors have the opportunity to see stream formations from different angles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rtvslo.si" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mysterious Caves of Slovenia" class="if uuid-2574286" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2574286.jpg"></div><h2>  Enchanting beauty </h2><p>  If you look deep into the many corridors, it seems as if they have no end.  There are a lot of dangerous failures and craters formed as a result of karst processes, there are several dozen underground waterfalls that strike with unearthly beauty.  The luxurious interior of the galleries consists of bizarre patterns of stalactites and stalagmites, and many have reached impressive sizes.  Some of them add up to fabulous figures and amazing compositions, delighting guests. </p><p>  Tourists admire the gigantic natural terraces of calcium carbonate (gurus).  Thanks to this mineral, mysterious corners take on truly fabulous outlines.  Outwardly very reminiscent of rice fields in China, they are considered one of the most interesting objects of the underworld created by nature. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": Húsönd, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Halls of the cave system" class="if uuid-2574216" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2574216.jpg"></div><p>  Grotto Marseille is the largest cave system hall with a length of 300 meters and a height of 140 meters.  This is a dark Gothic labyrinth, where some saponified mineral formations resemble gigantic candles or huge claws of a long-extinct predator, while others resemble large chandeliers hanging from the ceiling.  Some stalagmites look like an ancient throne destroyed by giants, installed in an underground palace. </p><h2>  An amusing trip </h2><p>  One and a half hour tours of the Shkotsyansky caves are held several times a day at any time of the year.  Walking here alone will not work.  You can visit the grottoes only with a guide who will guide you through the intricate mazes located at a depth of 145 meters.  The cost of visiting is 15 euros for adults and 7 euros for children. </p><p>  It must be warned that taking pictures inside the grottoes is strictly prohibited.  This is due to the fact that camera flashes can disrupt a fragile ecosystem.  The dungeon has its own microclimate, in which various representatives of flora and fauna coexist.  And its violation will lead to irreversible processes. </p><h2>  Shkotsyan caves, Slovenia: how to get there? </h2><p>  The nature reserve is located at Socjan 2, Divača, Slovenija, in the east of the village of Matavun.  You can get to the caves with transfers, in any case you have to use a taxi.  From the capital of Slovenia (Ljubljana), you can take buses that leave once a day to the Divača stop in an hour and a half.  Then take a taxi to the Matavun settlement. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travelslovenia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Open limestone grottoes" class="if uuid-2574250" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2574250.jpg"></div><p>  Getting to the right place is easy by train Mv 1824. Travel time is one hour 20 minutes.  You need to get out at Divača station, and then take a taxi.  In addition, you can order a transfer from the capital, the cost of which is about 100 euros per person.  For tourists, they will drop into the hotel and take a comfortable bus to the reserve. </p><p>  Take a fascinating journey into the underworld, filled with bright colors, and feel the special energy of a mystical corner.  This is a real adventure.  The memory of him will remain in the soul of every guest, fascinated by the grandeur of the natural treasure. </p>
