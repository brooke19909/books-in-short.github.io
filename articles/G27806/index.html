    <p>  At this time, an event happened in Hitler's life, which he would call a turning point in his fate a little later.  He lies in the hospital, and his vision gradually begins to return.  Hitler again goes to the front and serves in the army with great zeal.  He becomes an informant, informing his comrades whom he suspects of having connections with the Reds.  Higher officers pay attention to his anti-revolutionary ardor.  They instruct Hitler to organize the political education of German soldiers returning from captivity. </p><h2>  The path to the heights of power </h2><p>  The German army is reduced to 100 thousand people.  Hitler against his will demobilized.  He ends up in Bavaria, where extremist movements flourish, and becomes the main political agitator of the German workers' party.  In August 1920, Hitler made his political debut with a lecture entitled "Why Are We Anti-Semites."  July 1921 - Hitler activates the radicals of his small ultra-right extremist group.  They proclaim him a leader and buy him a car as an attribute of a high position. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Hitler changes the name of the party, combining the words nationalism and socialism.  His goal is to attract as many supporters as possible and show his anti-capitalist attitude.  Party members were called Nazis.  In his small headquarters, Hitler draws the emblem of the party - the red flag as an indicator of the socialist orientation of the movement, the white circle - a symbol of nationalism and the swastika - a symbol of the <span>Aryan race</span> and eternal anti-Semitism.  From this moment, the long path of the conqueror begins, and interesting facts about Hitler are revealed. </p><h2>  Hitler and Napoleon </h2><p>  Modern researchers have discovered very interesting facts about Hitler and Napoleon.  These two can be considered exemplary dictators and tyrants.  Both were not noble and wealthy from birth, but both achieved absolute power and worship and created powerful states.  Both plunged the world into bloody wars, and their personal life and career ended in complete collapse. </p>

    <p>  Between many significant dates in the life of Hitler and Napoleon, there is a difference of exactly 129 years.  In addition, according to most historians, both ended their lives by suicide.  It turns out that both Napoleon and Hitler are one and the same cosmic being, only it comes constantly in different guises.  If this is true, then it is easy to calculate when a new tyrant will be born.  According to numerology, 2018 is the year of birth of the next political dictator. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Hitler and Stalin </h2><p>  The 20th century did not know such a trice.  Caught in the throes of revolution and famine, Russia came to say goodbye to Lenin.  The people were waiting for their new ruler.  The Secretary General was Joseph Stalin.  And it was under his leadership that the country entered the <span>most bloody war of the</span> last century.  It was based on a monstrous myth of the superiority of one race over all others.  This is a war led by two unconditional leaders - Hitler and Stalin.  But what made them so?  What formed their personalities, and were they alike?  We will consider only the most interesting facts about Hitler and Stalin. </p>

    <p>  In childhood and adolescence, none of them was a leader and did not stand out among peers.  Both Hitler and Stalin were very fond of their mothers.  The F√ºhrer kept his photograph of his dead mother with him all his life, and Stalin constantly received parcels of Georgian dishes from her.  Both Stalin and Hitler at the age of 20 completely redefined their views on life and devoted themselves to politics.  Both managed to become absolute leaders for their followers and subjugate entire empires.  Stalin and Hitler never met, although each of them longed for this meeting. </p><h2>  Hitler and Eva Brown </h2><p>  Eva Braun is the only woman Adolf Hitler wanted to marry.  She loved to star, longed for worship and delight.  The lens replaced the crowds who were to greet her enthusiastically.  For 14 years she was Adolf Hitler's mistress, but the F√ºhrer so successfully concealed her from prying eyes that even in close circle few understood her true role. </p>

    <p>  For the whole country, its existence was a secret, and foreign intelligence considered it only one of Hitler's secretaries.  And only now, after decades, we learn interesting facts about Hitler and Eve Brown.  For 15 years she dreamed of becoming a married lady, Frau Hitler.  Her sword will come true.  She will become the <span>wife of the Fuhrer</span> 36 hours before her death.  These interesting facts about Hitler became known throughout the world thanks to the research of scientists.  However, this is just a small part of what history hides from us. </p><h2>  Interesting facts from Hitler's life </h2><p>  Without a doubt, Adolf Hitler was one of the most controversial figures in history.  His views on the future of his country and ideals led mankind to a war that caused a huge number of deaths and destruction.  He is undoubtedly the standard of universal evil.  Consider the most interesting facts about Hitler in WWII. </p><p>  Modern historians and researchers of the Third Reich, relying on declassified archives, argue that Adolf Hitler, long before the collapse of fascism, prepared the path of retreat.  The British journalist Gerard Williams has been dealing with this topic for several years.  His book "Gray Wolf. The Flight of Adolf Hitler" became a sensation.  The F√ºhrer and his inner circle developed several escape plans, and one of them worked. </p>

But this was not the only escape plan.  In May 45th, almost the entire Fuhrer‚Äôs personal submarine fleet disappeared from the radar.  Until that moment, the submarines were actively cruising between Antarctica and South America.  The Nazi secret base in Antarctica was code-named B-211.  Its construction began in 1939.  By the end of World War II, there was already a developed infrastructure.  Hitler chose two points where it was possible to hide from the Communists and from the forces of the Allies - Antarctica and South America.  The choice of Argentina is not accidental: the Nazis believed that the natives of South America maintained the purity of the race and were friendly to the Aryans.

    <p>  The mystery of Hitler's disappearance has not yet been revealed.  Even the most advanced historians do not have a clear answer.  These undoubtedly interesting facts about Hitler slightly opened the veil of mystery that hides the life of this person who is significant for human history. </p><h2>  Tyrant's death </h2><p>  How did Hitler die and did he die at all?  The answer to this question has not yet been found.  The version of suicide has not always received publicity and approval.  So how did Adolf Hitler die?  There are many different versions on this subject.  We will focus on the two most common.  According to one version, he took control of the first floor of the Reichstag and shot himself.  Eva Brown took a <span>potassium cyanide</span> pill <span>.</span>  On the same day, their bodies were carried outside the bunker and burned. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="interesting facts from Hitler's life" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43989/1476844.jpg" width="600"></div>
