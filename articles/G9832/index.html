The new-fangled AQUA LAND water park is also open here.  The water park in Derbent, located under the open sky on the sea coast, opened on June 23, 2016 and attracted a lot of visitors.  Attraction equipment was purchased in Germany, all safety and cleanliness standards were observed. </p><h2>  Family vacation spot </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXJ5xFQna68"><img itemprop="image" alt="water park in Derbent" class="if uuid-2795308" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104074/2795308.jpg"></div><p>  The water park in Derbent is a place of family relaxation, and most of the entertainment in it is intended for children.  There are rides for the smallest, and there are more complicated rides - for children older than seven or eight years.  For those who feel insecure in the water, the organizers set up swimming pools filled with balloons - they can flounder in them, as in water. </p><p>  The kids' favorite pastime is to slide down from high water slides into water pools.  There is also more difficult fun - a very large trampoline, for jumping on which you need agility and good coordination. </p><h2>  Location and cost of visiting </h2><p>  Water park address: Derbent, st.  Sheboldaeva 5. Visiting hours - from 10:00 to 20:00.  For those who want to visit the water park in Derbent, tickets are sold in advance.  The smallest visitors under the age of 3 can have fun here for free.  Of course, they will be allowed only with adults.  The cost of a children's ticket is 500 rubles, an adult 600 rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Adults have a private pool.  In addition, a beach with all beach equipment is located nearby.  The set of attractions is primarily aimed at children: patriarchal oriental traditions, not too encouraging beach holidays for adults, affect. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="slides in the water park of Derbent" class="if uuid-2795314" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104074/2795314.jpg"></div><h2>  Everything for tourists </h2><p>  The water park is located next to a comfortable hotel, designed for tourists.  These facilities were built in the complex: hotel and water park in Derbent.  From the windows of the hotel you can see the same big, big trampoline. </p><p>  Together with the inflatable attractions, the organizers bought a bright green artificial grass in Germany.  It covers the land in the water park and looks bright and festive in the photographs, but still on the seashore it seems redundant.  However, outside the water park you can walk on the sand and admire the surf.  Caspian waves with traditional slowness roll ashore.  It should be noted that the depth in the coastal strip is shallow. </p><p>  Visitors fill up the water park on hot sunny days.  It is freer in cloudy weather.  Those who wish can book tickets in advance for visiting the water park in Derbent, the current prices can be found on the official website.  To avoid misunderstandings, it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with the rules.  For example, food and drinks cannot be brought into the territory. </p><p>  If you are going to Derbent, be sure to visit the new attraction - the water park! </p>
