  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Interesting patterns of bird embroidery, signs</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Embroidery, as one of the popular types of needlework, combines not only different motifs and plots, but also techniques to create a beautiful volumetric work.  Most often, themes from the wild are sewn off.  Interesting patterns of bird embroidery are found both in domestic manufacturers and in foreign ones. </p><h2>  Magical overtones </h2><p>  Each character sewn on the canvas has its own meaning and carries a certain message.  Flight patterns of an eagle are designed for people who want to reach heights in life and learn something new.  A pair of swans on the pond is embroidered to connect loving hearts and improve the microclimate in the family.  Lonely girls pair stories with birds embroider in order to quickly find a soul mate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="katrusiny-rukodelki.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="embroidery duck" class="if uuid-3121898" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/3121898.jpg"></div><p>  Patterns of birds in embroidery help to activate a life goal and motivate to action.  Popular stories are often framed not only in pictures, but also in notebooks and applied elements.  Needlewomen recommend embroidering them to those who want to start working and increase profits.  In addition to birds, schemes with horses and tigers also ‚Äúwork‚Äù on this sign. </p><p>  In addition to the key element on embroidery, the background and color scheme in which the embroidery is carried out is important.  It is advisable to choose soft and warm shades, although contrasts with deep blue and green will also be organic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Popular Stories </h2><p>  Patterns of birds in embroidery are depicted with a background of sky or forest, because the plots convey the naturalness and naturalness of nature.  Embroidered owls symbolize wisdom and knowledge, as well as life experience and the desire to learn new things.  This is a popular image in modern sews. </p><p>  As for the technique of execution, needlewomen most often choose the process of drawing with a cross, although some patterns of birds in embroidery can be designed for smooth or beads.  The latter is difficult to work and requires concentration in terms of smooth attachment of beads, the result of the work depends on this. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vse-sama.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Exotic birds" class="if uuid-3121945" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57090/3121945.jpg"></div><p>  An eagle in the mountains, soaring in the sky, crosses off the American company Dimensions from the American company, although needlewomen add beads and a surface to the background to create smooth transitions and add watercolorness to the work.  Design patterns with birds are designed for small jobs and are used more often in applied embroidery.  You can find interesting patterns of embroidery in the Firebird and the Chimera, which develop haedas and full-length paintings that are sewn by the parking method or using color technique (the plot element is embroidered in stages in one color, after which the section is embroidered with another and all the work goes on) . </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Scheme selection </h2><p>  Further work depends on this stage.  It is important to pay attention to the elements and types of stitches that will be used for sewing.  Beginning needlewomen should not choose complex motives, as this will lead to errors in work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dailycrossstitch.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="small circuit" class="if uuid-3118668" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/3118668.jpg"></div><p>  Designers indicate the level of complexity in the process, so you can navigate and choose the best job for yourself.  The scheme should be worked out even without single crosses, if there are too many of them, then there will be a run in front of the needlewoman, which will not please me.  The backstitch is also shown on the diagram, and if the lines overlap the crosses, you need to select a different diagram or look at the areas where problems with the contours may occur before starting work. </p><h2>  Joy of color </h2><p>  Initially, the embroidery was supposed to convey information and performed a practical function.  In the old patterns of cross-stitching, birds and animals did not use more than two or three shades, due to which the work looked primitive and not well developed.  An example of paintings with birds can be seen in the video. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="_3LcYAnTUTk" data-url="https://youtu.be/_3LcYAnTUTk" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/5/1/8/6/15186.jpg"></div><p>  Modern designers offer different options in terms of the tint range, so that sewing as accurately as possible conveys all the details.  Monochrome plots also have a place to be, but are used much less often than color ones due to the primitiveness and simplicity of the result. </p>
