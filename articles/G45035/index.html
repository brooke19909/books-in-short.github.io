You can make very, very much of it.  Paper is used in industry and in technology, and now everyone knows about the opportunity to make some crafts out of it with their own hands.  Surely many of you have heard about origami, or at least made planes in a school from a notebook on a break.  Also from paper you can create models of weapons, cars and military equipment, or even transformers. </p><p>  This article will discuss how to make a transformer out of paper with your own hands.  Agree that such non-standard crafts can distract you from the routine, make your vacation more interesting and entertaining.  In RuNet, there are now many sites that describe how to make various simple origami out of paper, how to make a car out of paper, how to make a transformer, and other similar crafts.  Dozens of videos on similar topics appear on YouTube and other similar sites.  But, if you read this article, then such simple things are hardly interesting to you, are you?  So, perhaps, it‚Äôs worth moving on to the most important thing. </p><p>  There are very few materials that you will need when creating a transformer.  Before making a transformer out of paper, it is enough to have at your disposal: </p><p>  1) thick paper or cardboard, </p><p>  2) scissors, </p><p>  3) adhesive tape. </p><p>  So, the procedure itself is described below, how to make a transformer out of paper: </p><p>  First you need to take a sheet of cardboard, 24 centimeters long, and 12 wide. We draw a sheet into three columns: the first, should be 5 centimeters wide, the second 4 centimeters, and the third, respectively, 3. Then this the sheet must be drawn with transverse lines, so that you get eight horizontal stripes. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As a result, each column should have eight rectangles with a height of three centimeters.  Happened?  Well, then you will need to work with scissors.  It is necessary to cut the sheet along horizontal lines, as if into strips.  After that, you should get eight stripes, and three rectangles in each of them. </p><p>  Then you will need to bend each strip in vertical lines, after which each segment should become similar to the letter "P".  Now you will need to use tape.  Connect the edges of one of the figures so that it looks like a triangle, and, using tape, fix the resulting angle.  By the same mechanism, the edges of the remaining seven strips should be connected, and glued with tape.  After that, you should get eight volumetric triangular modules. </p><p>  After that, you need to take two "triangles", carefully folding them so that they are on top of each other, and then glue them with tape, putting its strip on one of the sides of the module.  As a result, you will have a dual module. </p><p>  The above operation should be repeated for the remaining "triangles", having received four double modules in the end, and continue to work with them.  Then - using adhesive tape, glue two more double modules together, after which you should get two modules with 4 "triangles" in each. </p><p>  Now on one of the sides, in the place where the lower and upper parts of the modules are connected, gently glue one small piece of adhesive tape.  After that, you will get two fairly flexible modules.  And now you will need to put them close to each other, so that there are squares at the top, with a side of three centimeters at each, and at the bottom - the edges that will form an angle.  Then you need to stick another piece of adhesive tape between the two squares located at the top. </p><p>  Well, that‚Äôs all, now you know how to make a transformer out of paper and your craft is ready.  Check the reliability of the connection of the modules with each other, and if the connections are reliable enough, enjoy the work, the creation of which you diversified your free time.  Good luck </p>
