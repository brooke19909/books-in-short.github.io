It is named after <span>the Barguzin River,</span> which flows into it along the center of the east coast.  The bay cuts deep into the land for thirty kilometers. </p><p>  The coastline of the reservoir is framed by an extensive dune, the width of which in some places reaches several hundred meters.  The sand spit is dotted with cedars with an original flag-shaped crown.  Such crowns in trees form under the influence of winds with a stable direction.  The Barguzin beach bordering the pond is a wonderful place to relax. </p><h2>  Geographical position of the Barguzinsky Bay </h2><p>  The reservoir is located in the Barguzinsky district of Buryatia.  The Barguzinsky Bay, starting in the central part of Lake Baikal, forms the eastern coast of the lake.  The water area of ​​the bay, located north of the mouth of the Barguzin River, is part of the Trans-Baikal <span>National Park.</span> </p>

    <p>  From the <span>Chivyrkuisky Bay</span> with a beautiful sandy coast, the pond is separated by a tiny isthmus.  The northern water area of ​​the Barguzinsky Bay is considered an independent body of water.  They call it Kultuk Bay.  The water area of ​​Kultuk has occupied a picturesque place where a sand dune merges with the Holy Nose Peninsula. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Barguzinsky Bay on Lake Baikal is adjacent to the villages of Ust-Barguzin and Maksimikha, as well as the Glinka area.  A walking trail leads to the Holy Cape Peninsula, to its plateau, from Glinka.  The plateau offers breathtaking panoramic views of the colorful expanses of the Barguzinsky and Chivyrkuisky bays. </p><p>  The <span>Barguzinsky Valley</span> adjoins the coast framing the gulf <span>.</span>  There are numerous mineral springs endowed with healing power.  But not only they attract travelers here.  Majestic ranges of stunning beauty rise above the valley.  Many tourists and climbers are eager to climb them, to conquer the mountain peaks. </p><h2>  Description of the Barguzinsky Bay </h2><p>  The area of ​​the water mirror of the bay is about 725 m <sup>2</sup> .  The depth of the reservoir varies greatly.  At the mouth of the Barguzin River, the water column is only one meter, and when entering the bay, a depth of 1000 meters is noted.  The maximum depth of the water here is at around 1284 meters. </p><p>  At the entrance to the Barguzinsky Bay - in a place formed by Cape Krestovy and Lower Headboard - the width reaches 22.8 kilometers.

    <p>  The northern coast that borders the Holy Nose Peninsulas is tall and steep.  The southern coast from the place where the rocky cape Kholodyanka is located is mountainous.  Its open spaces are covered mainly with taiga.  The east coast, bordering the Chivyrkuisk isthmus and the mouth of Barguzin, is low.  Sandy and sandy-pebble beaches stretch along it.  Wetlands and small ponds are found here.  Shrubbery and bog-meadow vegetation dragged along the coast. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  From the east, the largest tributary of Lake Baikal, the Barguzin River, flows into the bay.  On the south side, the Barguzinsky Bay, whose photos are magnificent, is fed by the Duhovaya stream.  Its sources are in the lake of the same name and the rivers Maksimikha and Gromotukha.  Rivers flow into the bay of Maksimikha.  In the north, the source of food for the bay was the water of the Makarov brook.  It flows along the bottom of the gorge, which settled on the southern slope of the Holy Nose Peninsula. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Of constant interest among tourists is the plateau on the Holy Nose Peninsula.  Climbing to it takes 7-8 hours along a rather thorny path.  Many of the vacationers go on an excursion to a unique landscape monument of nature - the Ininsky rock garden, which is located near the village of Suvo.  The natural garden, covering an area of ​​10 km <sup>2</sup> , is formed by large stone blocks. </p><p>  On the Ikat Range, in the area of ​​the pass, there are cult Evenk sanctuaries.  On the northern outskirts of Maksimikha, the doors of the ecological and ethnographic park-museum Svetlyaya Polyana are open for tourists.  It is a Cossack prison of the XVII century.  The infrastructure of the museum complex includes guest houses. </p><h2>  Barguzinsky Bay Beach </h2>
