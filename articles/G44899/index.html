Its main tasks include classification and identification. </p><p>  The systematics of plants is associated with the development of botany.  The first scientist to apply the classification was Theophrastus.  He divided the plants into grasses, shrubs, shrubs and trees.  Subsequent studies were carried out in the Renaissance.  At that time, Albert the Great noticed the differences between dicotyledonous and <span>monocotyledonous plants.</span>  The first classification was published in 1583.  The systematics of plants, created by the Italian Cesalpino, was based on the work of Theophrastus and supplemented in accordance with the signs of the structure of fruits and seeds (‚Äúreproductive organs‚Äù).  At the same time, Cesalpino isolated algae, ferns, mosses, and mushrooms.  He classified them as "seedless plants." </p><p>  Subsequently, taxonomic categories began to appear.  In 1689, the French botanist Magnol introduced the category of "family", later, in 1693, J. Ray introduced the concept of "species", and in 1700 by Tournefort - the term "genus".  The systematics of plants along Turnefor was supported due to its simplicity.  It was based on the <span>structure of the flower.</span>  Ray proposed a more natural classification.  However, along with this, it was also more complex - it implied a division into monocotyledons and dicotyledons. </p><p>  The greatest recognition, however, was the artificial classification of Karl Linnaeus.  The system he proposed was published in 1735 in the first edition of Plant Species (Genera Plantarum).  The classification of Linnaeus was based on the number and structure of stamens, the distribution of same-sex flowers.  As a result, twenty-four classes were formed.  Twenty-three included seed plants, and ferns, mosses, algae, and mushrooms were in the 24th grade.  Despite the fact that Linnaeus did not recognize the concept of "family", his systematics of plants was at that time the most convenient in practical application.  Together with the separation system, the scientist proposed the use of binary nomenclature.  In addition, the very definition of "systematics" was introduced precisely by Linnaeus. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1764, a new system was developed.  Its author was Adanson.  At the heart of his system, the scientist put the largest number of different signs.  Of no small importance was the classification proposed in 1789 by Jouet.  The botanist divided all the plants into fifteen classes, within which he singled out one hundred "natural orders" for which a description and name were given. </p><p>  In the nineteenth century, the Decandol system became widespread.  It was developed in 1819.  The scientist identified two departments: cell and vascular plants.  Subsequently, many botanists tried to improve the Decandol system.  So, Brown, a British scientist, identified the differences between angiosperms and <span>gymnosperms.</span> </p><p>  <strong>Modern taxonomy of plants.</strong>  <strong>Classification Examples.</strong> </p><p>  The development of modern <span>plant classification</span> systems began after the publication in 1859 of Darwin's work ‚ÄúOn the Origin of Species‚Äù. </p><p>  Brown, a German researcher, took evolutionary development as a basis.  His classification was based on the structure and development of the flower.  The Angler system was widely used.  He proposed a classification developed prior to sections and genera, and suggested the origin of angiosperms.  The Engler system was used in the scientific world until the beginning of the 21st century. </p><p>  Wetstein (Austrian botanist) improved this classification.  Two researchers (Engler and Wetstein) systematized and algae.  This classification was subsequently changed by Pasher. </p><p>  Historically, plants are divided into lower and higher.  The development of classifications was also carried out in two directions.  The main systems of <span>higher plants are</span> presented in accordance with the names of the researchers: the Kronquist system, Bessi, Cupronickel, etc. </p>
