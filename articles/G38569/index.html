  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Oblique muscles of the press and their structure</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  On each side of the human body are oblique abs muscles that perform functions associated with body turns.  Oblique abdominal muscles are divided into internal and external.  The internal are quite deep, passing from the pelvis to the sternum, and above them are the external muscles, immediately under the skin.  They help twist and bend the body.  When twisting to the left, the left outer and right inner muscles are involved, and when twisting to the right, vice versa.  The oblique muscles of the press, together with the <span>transverse muscle of the abdominal</span> cavity, perform the functions of stabilizing the spine, increasing intra-abdominal pressure.  This ensures the healthy functioning of the spine and maintaining the correct position of the internal organs. </p><p>  The external oblique <span>muscles of the abdomen</span> are the largest and most prominent of all the abdominal muscles.  They are involved in turns or bends forward, and they also help in lifting or carrying heavy objects.  In addition, these muscles are the only ones of the abdominal muscles that are in constant activity when standing.  They help maintain the body in an upright position, not allowing gravity to affect a person‚Äôs balance.  They also support the lower back and spinal column with various movements. </p><p>  External oblique muscles of the abs begin on the outer surface in the lower ribs, where it has large teeth, the upper five of which are located in the front <span>dentate muscle,</span> and the three lower ones are in contact with the teeth that make up the <span>latissimus dorsi</span> <span>.</span>  Upper muscle bundles form near the cartilage of the ribs and extend horizontally.  The bunches located below go along the oblique line from top to bottom.  And the lowest bundles are directed vertically downward.  All muscle bundles in front of the edge of the rectus muscle become aponeurosis. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Blood supply to the external oblique muscles is provided by the posterior intercostal arteries, the superficial artery that surrounds the <span>ilium,</span> and also the lateral thoracic artery. </p><p>  The internal oblique muscles of the press are designed to bend the spine during their bilateral contraction.  In the case of unilateral contraction, such muscles together with the external oblique muscles help to rotate the body and lower the ribs. </p><p>  The internal oblique muscle originates from the intermediate line on the iliac crest, lumbar-thoracic fascia, as well as on the lateral part in the inguinal ligament.  Bundles of fibers of the upper part of this muscle are attached to cartilage located on the lower ribs, and pass from the bottom up.  And the lower bundles, directed both up and down, develop into a wide aponeurosis along the contour drawn to the <span>pubic bone</span> from the cartilage X located on the rib.  The lower bundles of this muscle also belong to the spermatic cord, so that the muscle responsible for raising the testicle is formed. </p><p>  The blood supply to the internal oblique muscles is provided by the muscular-diaphragmatic artery, upper and lower epigastric arteries, and also by the posterior intercostal arteries. </p><p>  The oblique muscles of the press, as well as the lumbar muscles, belong to the muscles of the stabilizers.  Strengthening these muscles will help maintain a beautiful posture and ensure healthy functioning of the spine.  Any complex body movements begin, first of all, with the reduction of precisely the abdominal muscles.  Only after this activity is transmitted to other muscle groups.  Therefore, it is necessary to pay due attention to the implementation of exercises to maintain the toned muscles of the abs, as otherwise an imbalance in muscle development or asymmetry in the waist may occur.  When doing exercises for the press, one should not forget that in order to achieve a beautiful relief press, the fat layer should not exceed 1.5 cm, so training should be aimed at both muscle hypertrophy and the reduction of subcutaneous fat cells. </p>
