Eat a fresh crispy croissant and enjoy the aroma of real perfumes.  Many simply do not have enough financial resources to realize their dream.  Some tourists try to save on travel by hitchhiking or passing vehicles.  However, most try to find inexpensive accommodation for an overnight stay in the city.  It’s very hard to find a cheap hostel in the center of Paris on the day of arrival, so take care of this in advance. </p><h2>  Hostels </h2><p>  The city has a huge number of places to sleep, which differ in comfort, remoteness from the center and, accordingly, cost. </p><p>  Inexperienced tourists should be warned that cheap is not always far from the center.  And Paris itself is such that not all sights are in the center.  Those who are not in this city for the first time, certainly know what you can see in the city on the periphery. </p><p>  Always reserve a place to sleep in advance.  Paris does not tolerate spontaneous guests.  You can book a hostel in Paris online on the website or by contacting the administrator directly.  They will communicate best in English, not all staff understand and speak Russian. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cathedral view from the apartment" class="if uuid-2647685" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/2647685.jpg"></div><h2>  Hostels of Paris: reviews </h2><p>  All hostels from the list below were selected according to tourist reviews.  It should be borne in mind that over time, everything in the apartment can change for the better (for example, repairs were made), and for the worse. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Smart Place Gare du Nord by Hiphophostels </h2><p>  Address: 28 rue de Dunkerque, 10th arrondissement.  According to tourists' reviews, the hostel received a good rating - 8.1 points. </p><p>  Of the main advantages, residents note the location.  Very close to the train station, within walking distance of the bus station.  If you wish, you can walk about 30 minutes to the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower.  Near a lot of supermarkets and grocery stores.  Low cost relative to other vacation spots. </p><p>  Among the shortcomings, almost all tourists note very small rooms and uncomfortable "creaky" bunk beds.  In the room for four there are only 2 sockets, so the phones have to be charged in turn.  Very uncomfortable overhead light.  It is included for everyone, which brings discomfort to vacationers.  In this area at night, it’s better not to go alone, because there are a lot of “strange” personalities near the station. </p><h2>  Vintage Paris Gare du Nord by Hiphophostels </h2><p>  Address: 73 rue de Dunkerque, 9th arrondissement.  This hostel received 8.2 points from visitors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.airbnb.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="quadruple room" class="if uuid-2647687" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/2647687.jpg"></div><p>  The main advantage of most of the guests of these apartments consider the proximity to Montmartre (700 meters).  Nearby are several metro stations, so you can get anywhere in the city very quickly.  Breakfast is very pleasing to guests, after which you can take the remaining croissants with you.  The rooms have air conditioning - a very big plus. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The big minus is that the rooms have not been renovated for a very long time.  Everything is old and shabby.  The beds are uncomfortable and very creaky.  There are no shelves for things, so everything has to be left on the bed.  The bed is quite old (2 sheets, pillowcase and plaid).  Towel for a fee. </p><h2>  The Loft Boutique Hostel </h2><p>  The small hostel is open in the 20th <span>arrondissement of Paris.</span>  Belleville Underground Station (lines 2 and 11) is 500 meters away.  According to numerous guest reviews, the inn received 8.2 points.  It is necessary to warn tourists that this area is quite specific.  Many different nationalities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.airbnb.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="double noer" class="if uuid-2647689" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/2647689.jpg"></div><p>  The biggest disadvantages of this hostel, most of the guests include the fact that in the cold season there is very poor heating.  Additional blankets or blankets are not issued.  The beds in the rooms are uncomfortable (by the way, they creak very much).  May not be lucky with the neighbors.  In mixed rooms, most men are sometimes found.  The lack of an elevator and a modest breakfast also somewhat overshadow the rest.  The hostel is quite noisy at night. </p><p>  A great plus, many consider the proximity to the metro and friendly staff.  The rooms are spacious and clean.  You can use the kitchen and everything you need.  Bath and toilet in the room is a big plus.  Nearby are many cafes and restaurants, as well as a beautiful park. </p><p>  Laundry facilities and clean towels are available for a fee.  There is free internet, but with a large number of guests it is very slow. </p><h2>  St Christopher's Inn Paris - Gare du Nord </h2><p>  St Christopher's Paris is located in central Paris (North Train Station 200 meters away).  Tourists rated the hostel 8.0 points. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="room with bunk beds" class="if uuid-2647700" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/2647700.jpg"></div><p>  The area itself is somewhat alarming.  A lot of homeless people and suspicious men.  Some guests have noticed a lot of noise due to the music from the bar.  Many say that in the off-season the hostel is very cold and even a warm blanket does not help.  Small kitchen and only two dining tables (they are always busy). </p><p>  In general, the hostel is clean and comfortable.  Each bed is equipped with a curtain, its own lamp, socket and shelf.  Therefore, personal space is preserved even in a room for 6 people.  Downstairs there are 2 bars, a lounge area, and there are many entertainment venues and shops in the area.  Towels are included with a delicious breakfast. </p><h2>  Le Village Montmartre by Hiphophostels </h2><p>  Address: 20 rue d'Orsel, 18th arrondissement.  The best hostels in Paris are in the area. </p><div class="photo" data-original="paris.zagranitsa.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hostel entrance" class="if uuid-2647715" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/2647715.jpg"></div><p>  If you walk about one kilometer, you will see the railway station, and on the back of the Moulin Rouge cabaret. </p><p>  The rooms have air conditioning.  Friendly and friendly staff.  A towel is included.  Slow Internet connection. </p><p>  Of the minuses, guests note poor soundproofing.  The conversations of the neighbors are heard.  On the street is a restaurant nearby, from which music is heard. </p><h2>  Generator Paris </h2><p>  Address: 9 - 11 Place du Colonel Fabien, 10th arrondissement.  Guest rating - 8.4 points. </p><p>  Of the shortcomings, guests note only noise.  Moreover, most of the sounds come from the street, and in the hostel itself is quite calm.  The mixed rooms do not have curtains on beds, which brings discomfort. </p><p>  Cheap enough and clean.  The rooms are spacious.  Shower and toilet in the apartment (although some consider this a minus). </p><h2>  Beautiful Belleville Hôtel &amp; Hostel </h2><p>  Address: 12 rue de l'Atlas, 19th arrondissement.  The inn is located in the Chinese area, which for some may be a minus.  The hostel only has mixed numbers - also a minus.  This hostel in Paris is far from the center. </p><p>  The rooms are spacious and clean.  Bed linen and towels are included.  Laundry facilities are available for a fee.  There are bars and restaurants around. </p><h2>  Les piaules </h2><p>  Address: 59 Boulevard De Belleville, 11th arrondissement.  Guests are happy with the hotel and rated it 8.4 points. </p><p>  Of the minuses, only cramped rooms can be called.  Each bed has a curtain, socket, lamp and shelf.  Shower and toilet in the apartment.  The area is quiet, but those wishing to "hang out" will need to go to the city center. </p>
