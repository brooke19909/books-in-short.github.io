    <p>  One of the most famous manufacturers of steam generators is Karcher.  They are produced by companies such as Philips, Tefal, Bissel, Bosch and many other manufacturers of household appliances.  The principle of operation of this miracle machine (without any exaggeration) is to generate steam, which, in fact, follows from the name.  And various nozzles allow cleaning with this steam.  A steam generator for the home is a universal and extremely useful thing.  Judge for yourself: you can easily wash windows, mirrors, clean out any cracks in which dust has accumulated for a long time, refresh and clean furniture upholstery, carpets and rugs, curtains and drapes.  And all this in one cleaning, without additional funds, and <span>without killing the</span> whole day.  Think for yourself whether or not to buy a household steam generator. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

Hot steam not only cleans, but also disinfects any surfaces, which is especially true if the house has a small child or animals (or both).  With a steam generator, there is no need for chemicals, this makes cleaning more environmentally friendly and eliminates the need to saturate the air in the house with particles of chemicals and the pungent smell of cleaning products.  This is a huge advantage if there are people in the house who suffer from allergies or diseases of the respiratory system.

    <p>  The steam generator is able to clean the oven, grill of the gas stove, the stove itself, wash the tiles to shine, sanitize the bathroom and toilet, sanitize children's toys, clean and iron even those clothes that are usually dry cleaned.  It will also help get rid of bed bugs if this evil spirits encroached on your home.  In a word, he can do anything. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="steam generator for home" class="if" height="224" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10706/16772.jpg" width="224"></div>  How does he work?  Water is poured into a special container, which heats up in a few minutes.  The resulting vapor has a temperature of over 140 degrees.  Through a hose under pressure, it moves to the surface, and various nozzles allow you to perform all <span>types of cleaning.</span>  However, hot steam can damage some types of coatings, for example, natural parquet or a carpet made of 100% wool, for this case the fabric covers for nozzles are provided in the kit, which protect such surfaces from direct contact with steam.  In many steam generators there is the possibility of a jet water supply to flush dirt.

    <p>  Of course, the technique requires care.  A steam generator is also needed.  To prevent scale formation, it is better to fill only distilled water in the tank.  And if it still formed, it must be removed using special tools.  After each use of the steam generator, drain the water from the tank. </p><p>  As you can see, a household steam generator is an indispensable thing for the home.  Now you can quickly and easily make the apartment truly clean. </p>
