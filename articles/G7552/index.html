Especially popular are coins and banknotes of the 18th - 19th centuries.  But recently, collecting Soviet money has become fashionable.  Rare money of the USSR are funds that were issued in the Soviet Union from the 20s to the 70s. </p><h2>  The appearance of rare money </h2><p>  In the mid-1920s, a plan was introduced in the Soviet state for the introduction of all-Union money: both coins and banknotes.  Experts offered many design options for Soviet money, with the aim of displaying on the banknotes the exclusivity and greatness of the USSR. </p><p>  As a result of this fruitful work, huge circulations of banknotes and coins were released, which immediately started to bypass.  Among the numerous issues of currency there were also trial copies.  They are now of particular value. </p><p>  Soviet <span>paper money,</span> as a rule, is not valuable and rare.  Therefore, interest in them is not large enough in comparison with coins. </p>

    <h2>  Trial money of the USSR </h2><p>  Trial Soviet banknotes were issued as an addition to the officially approved currency.  As a rule, information on such issues was not made public.  But, despite the secrecy, many such specimens have survived to this day.  Paper Soviet rubles are not of particular value.  Coins are quite popular among collectors, since they were minted significantly less. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A vivid example is the famous "half a penny", which went into circulation in 1925, as well as a bronze three-kopeck coin of 1924. They were almost immediately abandoned due to low profitability.  A course was taken on the implementation of coins from base alloys.  In the following decades, the quarter of 1955 became very rare. </p><h2>  <span>The Gold Dagger of</span> 1925 </h2><p>  If it is possible to distinguish the most popular and rare coin from the set of samples of rare money, then it certainly is the Soviet chervonets made of pure gold in 1925.  Nowadays, only 5 such coins are known.  Two of them can be seen in the State Museum of Art, the rest are in the collections of Goznak. </p>

    <p>  For ordinary and even the richest collectors and numismatists, the golden Soviet chervonets, unfortunately, is not available.  There is information about an exact copper copy of the chervonets.  One such copy was sold in 2008 at auction for 5 million rubles in a private collection.  A year later, at the auction, they presented another analogue of the Soviet chervonets, but the sale was not carried out for several reasons.  Surprisingly, the money of the USSR is now in certain demand. </p><h2>  Fifty kopecks of 1924 </h2><p>  Very noteworthy and rare is the Soviet coin in denomination of 50 cents, which went into circulation in 1924.  The batch of release was quite large, so most copies have survived to this day.  But this fact does not bother collectors.  The fact is that the coins were minted differently, each circulation had slight differences from the previous one.  There are about twenty options for such a coin. </p><p>  That is why the price for a copy of fifty kopecks of 1924 varies from <span>500 rubles</span> to tens of thousands of dollars.  The most rare and valuable coin is recognized with a hert inscription, and the —≤ symbols printed on it.  R. </p>

    <p>  In addition to the above coins, there are other, no less valuable money of the USSR, in particular, those that were minted before the Great Patriotic War.  <span>Silver coins of</span> any denomination, which were issued before 1931, are especially rare.  During this period, there was a transition from precious metals to nickel alloys.  And all silver specimens were withdrawn from circulation, therefore, are of great value to numismatists. </p>
