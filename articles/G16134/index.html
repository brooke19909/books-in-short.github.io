    <h2>  Weather in Istanbul in November </h2><p>  The end of autumn, judging by the reviews of tourists who visited <span>Turkey in November, is</span> not the most favorable time for a beach holiday.  This month, cold winds begin to blow, and the temperature of air and water drops significantly.  This is the rainy season, but there are some good points.  For example, if during the hot season no one wants to wander around the city in search of sights, then November is just the month when you can easily inspect everything without fear of getting a heat stroke. </p><h2>  Good time to visit Turkey </h2><p>  November is not considered the most favorable month for visiting Turkish resort cities.  Then numerous travel agencies come to the rescue.  They offer to go to different places of the country, including Istanbul in November, to see historical monuments and sights.  You can visit a huge number of interesting places and learn more about this colorful country and its traditions.  It will be a new and interesting experience, and all tourists will receive a lot of pleasure. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  What clothes will come in handy for visiting Istanbul in November? </h2><p>  If you are going to Turkey at the end of autumn, you need to bring clothes suitable for the cold season, as well as waterproof items.  An excellent choice will be warm sweaters, jeans, jackets, from shoes - closed shoes, sneakers or boots. </p><p>  In the morning it is often very cold, so heat-loving women should stock up with hats, gloves and scarves.  Another integral part of autumn walks is the umbrella, because rain can overtake a careless tourist at the most unexpected moment. </p><p>  It can even get hot by noon, so consider providing an option to take off your outerwear and stay in a T-shirt and shorts. </p>

    <h2>  Religious season in Istanbul </h2><p>  Since faith is in the first place for residents of Turkey, religious holidays leave a big imprint on the life of the country.  Experienced tourists know that during days that are special for the Turkish people, you should not go to the authentic cities of the country, since life stops there during this period.  This happens during Ramadan (a 30-day fast), which occurs during the summer months, and Kurban Bayram, the four-day festival of sacrifice, which is celebrated on the seventieth day after Ramadan. </p><h2>  Shopping in Istanbul </h2><p>  This city at the end of autumn is perfect for those who come shopping.  You will be able to visit the spice market and purchase what you like so that you can surprise your relatives with new and interesting dishes at home.  You can also visit the galleries and shopping centers of the city.  In the last <span>autumn month</span> , promotions are often held in Turkey, so a good and high-quality item can be bought at a discount of up to 70%.  If you are traveling only because of the purchase of shoes and clothes, the Laleli market is suitable for you.  There is also a shopping week, which runs from mid to late April.  This is the best time to make any purchases.  You can purchase your favorite item at a price that suits you. </p><p>  The main rule of the Turkish markets is that if you like a thing and want to buy it, you must bargain.  Market prices can be much higher than the cost, this is necessary so that the seller can throw off the price.  But he will do this without prejudice to his profit, of course.  If you do not bargain, the seller may even be offended.  So feel free to! </p>
