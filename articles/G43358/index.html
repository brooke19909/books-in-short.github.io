    <h2>  Electronic CTP </h2><p>  An electronic document is as valid as a paper document.  It can be presented at any place where necessary.  CTP insurance is issued directly via the Internet directly at the company, that is, on its official website.  Car owners today can optionally make a purchase online or drive up to the office and purchase a document in the usual way. </p><p>  CTP insurance is information that a specific insurance company has entered into a contract with the car owner, information about which is entered into a centralized database.  Such a record provides a guarantee of the provision of services in the event of an accident on a common basis. </p>

    <p>  After the motorist has issued and paid for insurance, he receives an e-mail, where there is a policy in the attachment.  The document needs to be printed, and then you should sign in the space provided for this.  Although the latter is optional.  The insurance company uses a digital signature by attaching a document to it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you want to additionally insure civil liability, you should know that in electronic form this is possible only when the insurance policy was issued in a similar way earlier and it is expected to be extended. </p><p>  For electronic or paper CTP, the price is the same.  Although an electronic order will not take into account the commission of the <span>insurance agent.</span> </p><p>  There are calculators that will help determine the cost of car insurance.  It depends on the power of the vehicle, the age and length of service of the driver, the locality in which the owner of the car is registered.  For example, for a driver of 22 years of age, with a driving experience of about a year, owning a car with a capacity of over 100 horsepower and living in Moscow, the cost in different insurance companies will vary from 14 to 16 thousand rubles.  And for the owner of a car with the same data set, but living in Khimki, the price of a car insurance will be about 13,800 rubles. </p><p>  If you calculate the cost of such a service for a 50-year-old driver with thirty years of experience driving a vehicle with a capacity of up to 50 liters.  With., living in Saratov, the amount in this case will be no more than 4 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Order of registration </h2><p>  The document received in electronic form is a new service of auto insurance companies.  Many drivers are afraid of innovations and prefer the proven old way.  However, electronic design requires very little. </p>

    <h2>  What data is entered? </h2><p>  Before you apply for an insurance policy, prepare the following documents. </p><ul><li>  Passport or other document that certifies your identity. </li><li>  Documents for the car. </li><li>  The certificate of the driver, as well as persons authorized to drive the vehicle. </li><li>  Diagnostic card about passing inspection. </li></ul><p>  All these data are available in electronic form, from where insurers get the relevant information.  Therefore, if the technical inspection has not been passed, you will not receive a policy (although there are insurance companies that help in this matter).  If among the list of persons included in the contract there is one who does not have a driver‚Äôs license, the result will also be negative. </p><h2>  Authenticity </h2><p>  Alas, fraud in our country is not uncommon.  Such offenders do not bypass the insurance industry.  Forms are often falsified, and electronic company insurance is even easier to falsify.  How not to fall for the scammers? </p><p>  The rules of the road tell us that the driver must have a driver‚Äôs license, a certificate of registration for a motor vehicle, and also an OSAGO insurance policy.  If the traffic police inspector demands to present a policy, the driver must provide a paper printout of insurance. </p><p>  Of course, the time will come when there will be a terminal on each traffic police machine with which the inspector will be able to access the database to verify the document for authenticity.  But while this is not there, the paper equivalent of the driver‚Äôs electronic document should be. </p><p>  There is a special system with which the car owner can verify the authenticity of the policy on their own.  After all, each insurance has its own unique number. </p><p>  Insurance companies receive PCA policy forms.  Therefore, by entering the policy number in the database, you can make sure that the number matches the name of the insurance company.  This method can be used not only by those who issued the CTP insurance policy.  Rosgosstrakh is, ‚ÄúReso‚Äù, ‚ÄúConsent‚Äù or any other insurance company - it does not matter, as well as the way of registration.  In other words, if the contract was concluded by the insured by his arrival at the office of any insurance company, authentication via the Internet in RSA is also possible. </p>

    <h2>  Benefits for SK </h2><p>  When the innovation began to take effect, all SCs began to actively implement this system.  It is easy to understand how beneficial it is for insurers. </p><p>  They can significantly reduce staff.  The costs of paying salaries and commission bonuses are reduced.  No need to strive to open new offices and so on. </p><h2>  Benefits for policyholders </h2><p>  But not only insurance companies benefit from the new system.  Car owners, in turn, receive the following preferences: </p><ul><li>  You no longer need to go to the office, look for a suitable insurance company and listen to all the information from the agent. </li><li>  The policy is drawn up in a relaxed home environment, where the car owner makes the choice to purchase additional services or refuse them. </li><li>  This can be done at any time convenient for you and you do not need to devote a few hours on purpose and ask for leave from work.  A few minutes are enough in the evening, on a day off or at any other time when there is an opportunity.  After all, company websites, like the Internet, work around the clock. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Minor flaws </h2><p>  In addition to the obvious advantages, which are impossible to dispute, as in any system, there are also disadvantages to obtaining electronic policies.  Let's consider some of them. </p><ul><li>  Many people simply prefer not to shop online. </li><li>  When ICs provide electronic services, there is no active advertising.  Therefore, potential policyholders are deprived of information about the benefits of concluding an agreement with a company. </li><li>  Small ICs are forced to significantly reduce the cost of services in order to enter the market.  But in people, this sometimes causes rejection and suspicion. </li></ul><p>  But all these shortcomings are not so significant. </p><h2>  Process formalities </h2><p>  A more serious obstacle to the development of a service may be inconsistencies that occur during the execution of a service such as electronic CTP.  VSK, Rosgosstrakh or any other company enter into an agreement on the basis of data on documents. </p><p>  It turns out, for example, that a vehicle inspection becomes formal.  Many insurance companies provide an additional service, in which, after completing the policy, an operator is offered who performs the inspection procedure without making any complaints, that is, simply for fixing the record in the database. </p><h2>  Lack of equipment for traffic police </h2><p>  The traffic police inspector does not have special equipment to verify the authenticity of electronic forms.  If the situation is stressful, this can contribute to a conflict between the driver and the guardian of the law.  Everyone says that the <span>OSAGO electronic policy</span> (Rosgosstrakh, Soglasie, Reso, AlfaStrakhovanie and all other insurance companies) replaced the paper equivalent with an electronic signature.  Therefore, some drivers, without having a paper version, refer to this inconsistency.  At the same time, you should know that, despite the electronic signature, precisely because the traffic police do not have the opportunity to verify this information, the drivers were obliged to carry a paper equivalent with them.  Otherwise, the person will be fined 500 or 800 rubles. </p><h2>  Europrotocol design: how to be? </h2><p>  There are questions about the registration of road accidents by drivers using the euro protocol.  The specified document and the method of <span>registration of road accidents</span> are designed to improve the situation on the road and to register a minor traffic accident without the participation of the traffic police inspector.  At the same time, if one of the drivers has electronic compulsory motor third-party liability insurance, for example, then how can another participant in an accident be convinced of its authenticity?  It turns out that the norm, designed to simplify the procedure for registration of an accident, in such cases is completely lost. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Let's hope that such shortcomings will soon be resolved.  After all, the ability to order e-insurance for third-party liability insurance through the Internet is indeed very convenient.  And many motorists will certainly appreciate this in the near future.  Then it will make life easier not only for insurers and insurers, but also for the traffic police. </p><p>  We examined how to apply for an CTP insurance policy, made sure of its simplicity and many of the advantages of the system.  The flaws and pitfalls that are still available in connection with this innovation were also affected. </p><p>  Based on the foregoing, each car owner decides for himself: whether to adhere to the policy in the old fashioned way or switch to electronic CTP.  AlfaStrakhovanie, Rosgosstrakh, Reso, VSK, Soglasie and many other insurance companies are ready to provide this new service today. </p>
