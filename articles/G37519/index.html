  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bladder</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The bladder is a hollow organ that has a flat-circular shape and is located in the pelvic cavity, directly behind the pubic symphysis.  Its basis is muscle.  The shape, size of the bladder changes when filling and emptying.  The filled organ has the shape of a pear, with the wide part facing back and up, and the narrow one - forward and down.  An empty bladder is characterized by a saucer-shaped form, the confluence of all the walls.  The capacity of the organ is 750 cm cubic.  It is different in women and men. </p><p>  Bladder.  Anatomy </p><p>  The body consists of individual parts that pass into each other.  The main part is the body of the bladder.  The upper front wall forms the apex, which clearly stands out when it is filled.  The bladder upward forms the median ligament of the navel, which represents the obliterated urinary duct.  The bottom of the bladder is formed by its back, which in men is directed towards the rectum and vagina in women.  The front-lower part forms the neck of the organ, the urethral opening (internal) is located here. </p><p>  The basis of the walls of the bladder is <span>muscle tissue of a smooth</span> type, its cavity is lined with a membrane that has a mucous character.  The organ is partially covered with a connective tissue membrane.  The thick muscle membrane is represented by three layers: the outer, middle, and inner.  The outer layer starts from the pubic symphysis, goes in the backward direction to the neck, then goes around it and ends at the apex of the organ.  He gives the rectal-cystic muscle to the corresponding layer of the rectum, in women the cystic muscle is formed.  The main in the structure of the organ is the middle muscle layer.  It has a circular arrangement.  In the neck, it forms muscle pulp of the internal urethra.  The thinnest layer is the inner one, which is characterized by a multidirectional course of fibers.  It is well developed at the bottom of the organ. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The bladder has a well-developed mucous layer.  It is represented by a thick stratified squamous epithelium.  <span>The mucous membrane</span> includes a submucosal base, which is rich in <span>connective tissue</span> and penetrated by thick fibers.  Due to this structure, folds are formed that follow the contours of the muscle layer.  But when filled, they stretch. </p><p>  The structure of the bladder corresponds to its main function - the accumulation and subsequent excretion of urine.  There are three holes in it.  The first two are represented by the mouths of the ureters, the third is the opening of the urethra.  They are located in the urinary triangle, which is the most changing and fixed part of the organ.  Here, the mucous membrane is directly connected to the muscle layer. </p><p>  The mucous layer behind the mouth of the urethra forms the tongue of the bladder, which passes into the crest.  The peritoneum partially covers the lateral surfaces of the organ and its entire upper-posterior part.  It passes from the back to the uterus in women, and in the male body to the direct section of the intestine.  The front part directly lies under the pubic symphysis, when filling it rises above this level.  Part of the prostate gland, seminal vesicles, and part of the <span>vas deferens are</span> adjacent to the bottom of the organ in men <span>.</span>  In women, the cervix, the wall of the vagina is located at this level. </p><p>  The lower part of the lateral wall of the organ, which is located preperitoneally, is adjacent to the bottom of the pelvis, in the filled state - to the obstructive muscle, in women there is a round ligament, the vas deferens in men. </p><p>  The urinary organ is an important component of the <span>urinary system,</span> without which the normal activity of the whole organism is impossible.  With violations of its function, the work of all human structures is disrupted, so timely diagnosis and prevention of diseases is important. </p>
