    <p>  Compared to models such as the Nokia Lumia 630 or LG G3 S, our smartphone is practically not inferior to them in any way, apart from the screen sizes of LG, whose diagonal is 0.7 inches larger and 5 inches.  The Philips W6500, whose characteristics are significantly better in some respects than its competitors, is a very competitive model sold on the mobile technology market. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Sale of the phone is carried out in a small box made of thick shockproof cardboard.

The standard headset of this company boasts a pretty good sound.  It is equipped with a microphone and is designed to connect to a 3.5 mm jack.  The USB charger meets all European standards and has a 5V charging voltage.  The cable itself is not separate in the kit, it is disconnected from the charger, to charge the phone you will need to connect the cable to the adapter.

    <h2>  Design and ergonomics </h2><p>  The appearance of the phone is quite modern and attractive, it immediately catches the eye.  Without looking at the name, you might think that this is another phone from the Lumia series.  However, coming closer, we immediately realize that we were mistaken. </p>

    <p>  The case is made of high-quality and practical plastic.  The model is sold with two removable color panels - a bright yellow and more practical gray back cover.  This allows you to reflect the mood of a person, as well as in a certain sense, his style. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The phone is quite comfortable in the hand thanks to slightly slanted corners.  The case has a classic rectangular shape.  The screen is protected by glass, so scratches are practically not a problem for him. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The Philips W6500 smartphone has an excellent 4.3-inch capacitive display.  This screen has an average resolution, it is 540 by 960 pixels, and it turns out that for one inch the pixel density is 256 pixels.  The capacitive sensor allows you to process up to 5 touches at a time. </p>

The screen brightness has a good adjustment range, which helps to eliminate the lack of brightness when tilting the screen.  By the way, tilt angles do not affect the color rendering level at all.  Anti-glare protection helps preserve the image, leaving it clear enough on a clear, sunny day.

    <p>  The display has the usual settings for the Android system.  In addition to brightness, functions such as button illumination, backlight timeout, wallpaper change and auto-rotate screen are available. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  <span>The Philips Xenium W6500,</span> which we are currently reviewing, runs on the Android operating system in version 4.2.2 of Jelly Bean.  This version works smoothly and without any special flaws, compared with the previous one, no special changes are observed, with the exception of energy saving and changes in the design of some menus.  Now the system allows you to work the phone longer, and this, as we know, is a huge plus for smartphones of this type.  It is very simple and soft in its management, so the user will enjoy using this version of the operating system. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Performance and battery </h2><p>  This smartphone has good performance due to the powerful hardware installed in it.  The phone became the owner of a quad-core processor <span>Mediatek MT</span> 6589 with a clock frequency of 1.2 MHz.  In combination with the installed operating system and the powerful Power VR SGX544M GPU, this gadget gives very good performance.  The phone is able to ‚Äúpull‚Äù such powerful games and programs as Real Racing 3, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, Solar Walk or NASA APP, however it is not able to ‚Äúpull‚Äù Full HD, but this was already clear, looking at the resolution itself display.  Thus, it turns out that the maximum resolution that the GPU is capable of reproducing is 720p. </p>

    <p>  As for the battery, here is the company‚Äôs proprietary 2400 mAh battery.  Its volume is enough for exactly one day of use in non-stop mode.  The phone is able to play continuously: audio recordings - up to 55 hours, video, provided Wi-Fi is turned off - up to 10 hours.  Of course, the manufacturer could install the battery a little more powerful, at least 3500 mAh, as a competitor Lenovo P770, but this was not done.  Such power was considered not too necessary for this phone. </p><h2>  Phone memory and memory card </h2><p>  Looking at the performance of the phone and its hardware, it is not at all difficult to guess that it is equipped with 1 GB of RAM.  This is not very much, but also quite enough for a smartphone like the Philips Xenium W6500.  A review of this model shows that such a volume is enough to sit on the Internet at the same time, listen to music and play some not very serious toy.  And this is a good result for phones in this price category. </p><p>  The phone‚Äôs internal memory, designed for data storage, has a capacity of 4 GB, but with the installed system, drivers and standard programs, the user only needs 3.2 GB.  But this does not matter, since this model has a slot for a micro SD memory card.  It is able to withstand the physical load of a card up to 32 GB.  Thus, by inserting a high-speed memory card and switching settings to automatically use this card, you can completely not affect the internal memory of the phone, leaving it empty. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Two cameras are installed in the smartphone <span>Philips Xenium W6500,</span> reviews about them are quite twofold.  The main camera of this phone has a resolution of 8 MP, which allows it to take excellent pictures in the afternoon, as well as shoot high-quality video with a resolution of 720p at a speed of 30 frames / sec.  As for photographing and shooting at night, things are much worse here.  The presence of an LED flash does not help much in the dark - photos and videos are slightly blurry and not very clear, although, on the other hand, what else can you expect from a phone?  The main camera is equipped with automatic autofocus and a catcher for up to 10 people at a time.  There is also the presence of macro photography - the minimum distance from the subject is 5 centimeters.  The location of the main camera is very convenient - it is located in the upper back of the smartphone, clearly in the center. </p>

    <p>  In addition, the phone has a front camera with a resolution of 1.2 MP.  It is great for shooting selfy and video calling, for example via Skype or Viber.  The front camera is located unusually for smartphones in this category - on the left, and not on the right. </p><h2>  Multimedia </h2>

They are no different in new versions of the system: all the same design, ease of use, limited sound settings in the equalizer, etc.

    <p>  The equalizer of the phone has 11 settings, when changed, the sound does not change very much.  Also provides functions to enhance the frequencies and create the effect of 3D-sound. </p><p>  In addition to players, the phone has an FM-receiver.  It is distinguished by its power of receiving frequencies, with inserted headphones, the search for active radio waves is much better than that of its direct competitors.  It works in the frequency range from 87.5 to 107.8 MHz. </p><h2>  Expert opinion and owner reviews </h2><p>  Philips Xenium W6500, according to experts, is a fairly high-quality device, created by Philips.  The phone has all the necessary functions and is even capable of more than its competitors in this price category.  They also argue that such a filling with another brand, such as HTC or Samsung, for example, will cost a lot more than what the Philips W6500 costs now.  Owner reviews say the same thing.  Many owners say this: "Why spend more when you can buy the exact same product for less?"  And you can agree with them. </p><p>  Experts were able to identify just a few drawbacks not too significant for this model - this is not a tight enough fit for the removable back panel and the quality of night shooting of the main camera of the phone. </p><p>  The Philips W6500 model was praised not only by experts in the field of telephony, but also by the owners of this gadget.  It is referred to as a very high-quality, multi-functional product with small and almost imperceptible flaws.  Thus, based on the reviews, it was possible to identify the main pros and cons of this model.  The pluses include: </p><ul><li>  multifunctionality of the gadget; </li><li>  high performance (the phone is powerful enough for its price category); </li><li>  reliability (reliable assembly speaks for itself, the quality of materials is at a high level); </li><li>  Full HD support; </li><li>  reasonable price - only about eight thousand rubles. </li></ul><p>  The biggest disadvantages include: </p><ul><li>  small battery capacity; </li><li>  creaky back panel. </li></ul><p>  The Philips W6500 model, reviews of which are quite positive and warm, has also become very popular among women who are literally going crazy with the bright yellow version of the phone.  Yes, and the ability to change the color of the panel (for mood or outfit) is very much appreciated by the fair sex. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Having examined the Philips W6500 model in detail, we can say that the phone turned out to be quite successful and sold.  Great performance combined with a nice design is the perfect combination for today.  Of course, not from the first days, but he found his customers who were satisfied with the Philips Xenium W6500 model (the reviews speak for themselves).  Excellent assembly, convenient key layout allow the phone to be comfortable, and most importantly - to lie ergonomically in your hand. </p><p>  The device made a great impression on the public and experts.  Even such cheap competitors as Lenovo or Highscreen will not get in the way of this model.  They have more weight and dimensions, but what‚Äôs about their performance is that they are much weaker. </p><p>  In this price category, Philips became the best phone for two SIM cards in 2014, and you can‚Äôt argue with that.  He went around everyone.  And then we draw conclusions ourselves, since no one has the right to decide for you.  Have a good choice! </p>
