If the situation is simplified to the limit, then it can be described as a confrontation between pro-Western and pro-Russian ideas.  Left-bank and right-bank Ukraine look at further state prospects differently.  Such a conditional simplification of the existing picture reveals only general trends, in real life everything is much more complicated. </p>

    <h2>  Different Ukraine </h2><p>  Supporters of the ‚ÄúEuropean choice‚Äù and the forcible consolidation of a unitary state live not only in Lviv and Lutsk, they also exist in Nikolaev, Kherson, Odessa, Kharkov and even Donetsk, the whole question is the quantitative predominance of the carriers of certain political sympathies.  But nothing happens in the world for nothing.  The number of citizens hostile towards Russia in the West of the country significantly (and even many times) exceeds the percentage of those among residents of the eastern and southern regions.  Ukrainians look at the past differently, based on the traditions of family education and religious beliefs.  Objective survey data indicate that left-bank Ukraine, not to mention the Crimea, is not so devoted to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa unified and conciliar state with one state language and European development vector, as residents of the western regions.  Why did this happen? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  As part of Poland </h2><p>  The division of Russian people into Russians and Ukrainians is the cornerstone of Ukrainian independence.  The roots of this phenomenon should be sought in long-standing events that happened even before the annexation of left-bank Ukraine to Russia. </p><p>  In the XIII century there was a Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which concluded an alliance (union) with Poland.  It was in 1385, and after 184 in Lublin (1569) another historical document was signed, under the terms of which a single state entity was created - the Commonwealth.  It included the territories that are part of modern Ukraine.  The colonization of new lands began, accompanied by all signs of oppression and enslavement of the indigenous population.  Left-bank Ukraine, populated mainly by Orthodox people, was subjected to economic and religious repression.  There were uprisings, but they were mercilessly suppressed. </p>

    <h2>  The emergence of the Cossacks </h2><p>  Oddly enough, the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating border settlements with a special way and economic benefits originally belonged to the Poles.  Residents of such territories were exempted from many taxes for the fact that they carried out paramilitary monitoring of the borders entrusted to them, and their inhabitants stood out in a special estate.  Hence the historical name "Ukraine", which arose in those years when Poland suffered from the raids of the Tatars in its southern region.  The founders of the Cossacks were two elders, Predislav Lianskoronsky (from Khmelnitsky) and Eustache Dashkovich (from the cities of Kanev and Cherkasy).  The paramilitaries successfully repelled the Basurman attacks, often turning into counter-attacks and carrying out deep raids on enemy rear.  An important incentive for such raids on Ottoman territories was material production.  Cossacks gained combat experience. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Very uncomfortable Zaporizhzhya Sich </h2><p>  The existence of Zaporizhzhya freemen could not but disturb the leadership of Poland.  This territory was virtually uncontrolled, and the hetman Dimitry Vishnevetsky, without explaining his goals, strengthened the <span>island of Khortitsa in</span> every possible way <span>.</span>  Despite the importance of the Cossacks for the defense <span>of the Commonwealth, the</span> new territorial formation began to pose a certain threat to the very existence of the state.  Meanwhile, the Cossacks' preparations for a liberation war continued until the 17th century, as well as the establishment of military-political relations between the Cossacks and Muscovy, with which the Ukrainians felt close, both mental and religious. </p>

    <h2>  The beginning of the war for the liberation of Ukraine </h2><p>  The anti-Polish uprising began in 1648, at the end of the "Golden Polish Decade", which passed after the bloody suppression of popular unrest.  During the war, under the leadership of <span>Bogdan Khmelnytsky</span> , the Left Bank of Ukraine separated from the Commonwealth, and a new state arose, with the most affordable democratic laws at that time - Hetmanism.  There was only one problem, but very serious.  Ukrainians did not have enough military and economic resources to fight the Poles. </p><p>  The war went on for six years, it was bloody and debilitating.  In early 1654, a letter was signed in the city of Pereyaslavl, documenting the accession of the left-bank Ukraine to Russia.  Muscovy acquired new territories, namely Kiev, Bratslav and Chernihiv lands, taking on its part the obligation to protect the fraternal people from any adversary.  An immediate declaration of war followed Poland. </p><h2>  Left-bank Ukraine as part of Russia (1667) </h2><p>  After 12 years of battles, which were held with varying success, the Russian-Ukrainian army still prevailed.  Under the terms of the <span>Andrusovsky truce of</span> 1667, the Polish side was forced to recognize the annexation of left-bank Ukraine to the Moscow kingdom (and at the same time Smolensk and present-day Belarus, then Lithuanian territory).  This world was called ‚Äúeternal‚Äù in the treaty, and the sovereignty of Russia over Kiev was not questioned under its terms. </p>

    <h2>  Left bank, right bank ... </h2><p>  <span>Subjunctive is</span> hardly applicable to history <span>,</span> but remembering that left-bank Ukraine was annexed to Russia was in circumstances that threatened the very existence of the Ukrainian people.  In the future, the government of the Russian Empire as a <span>centralized state</span> was forced to take measures that today would be called unpopular.  In particular, the <span>Zaporizhzhya Sich,</span> having fulfilled its historical mission, was abolished by Catherine II.  About the events of the XX century a special conversation.  More than three and a half centuries, lived as part of Russia, have historically formed a certain way of thinking, which differs from the pro-Western mentality characteristic of the inhabitants of the regions joined in 1939.  Left-bank Ukraine is different from the right-bank.  Unwillingness to reckon with this reality leads to many human tragedies ... </p>
