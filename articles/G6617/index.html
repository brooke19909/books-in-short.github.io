People invented a lot of ways and recommendations on how to crank this out.  Of course, you have to save on all areas of life.  But if you follow the instructions, practice shows that living on 5000 rubles a month (everyone can conduct an experiment) is quite realistic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hirerush.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="save on products" class="if uuid-2966599" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29489/2966599.jpg"></div><h2>  Obligatory payments </h2><p>  In addition to food at 5000 rubles per month, you need to be able to pay a number of mandatory payments - this includes utilities, telephone and the Internet.  To save, it is better to install water meters.  Then the payment amount will be reduced by half.  In addition, it makes sense to reduce electricity consumption. </p><p>  Before living a month for 5000 rubles, you need to change your tariff for cellular communications.  Indeed, at the moment, the average monthly payment under this item of expenditure is at least 500 rubles.  It is important to note that at least several thousand rubles will be spent on utility bills.  But much depends on in which city and in what conditions a person lives. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kanzlei-braeuer.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="No money" class="if uuid-2965727" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2965727.jpg"></div><p>  Solving the question of how to live a month for 5000 rubles, you need to change the tariff plan for mobile communications, if more than 300 rubles are spent on this item per month.  It is better to change the Internet tariff by choosing a slower option.  A change in speed to a slower sometimes may not be noticed.  As a result, you can save about 500 rubles on the Internet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Saving on food </h2><p>  Answering the question how to live on 5000 rubles a month, many say that they will have to eat exclusively food prepared on their own.  Visiting public catering places is not suitable, you should not purchase ready-made dishes.  It is important to accurately calculate the portions, so that in no case prevent spoilage of food. </p><p>  Often, spending on sweets is a big expense for people.  But making up a menu for 5000 rubles a month, you will need to give up sweets.  This, depending on the preferences of the person, will save him about 500 rubles a week. </p><p>  An ideal choice would be to compile a food menu for 5,000 rubles a month in advance.  Thanks to this, you can save a lot of money.  The calculations will vary greatly depending on the region of the country. </p><p>  If the question arose of how to live together for 5,000 rubles a month, it is better to stock up with the following products - buckwheat (1 pack will cost about 60 rubles, and for 2 people it will be enough for 2 times).  The same goes for rice, pasta and potatoes.  Meat or fish will cost about 400 rubles per 1 kg.  And for 2 people this amount is enough for 2 times.  Fresh vegetables for 200 rubles will also be enough for 2 times for 2 people. </p><p>  In addition, you need to consider spending on tea - it will cost 60 rubles per pack for a week.  As a result, for lunch and dinner, made up of such products, it will take approximately 2750 rubles. </p><h2>  Savings on treatment </h2><p>  It is important to consider that it is better to take care of health in advance than after spending money on treatment.  After all, the cost of drugs will not allow you to live on such an amount.  Before living a month for 5000 rubles, you must first change your own lifestyle.  You should abandon junk food, exercise regularly, get rid of harmful stress. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is important every time when it becomes necessary to purchase medicines, look for cheap analogues of medicines.  There are many of them, the gap in cost between the advertised funds and analogues can be very large. </p><p>  It is important to remember that for a number of categories in Russia there is a free distribution of medicines.  So, medicines for children under 3 years of age or for the disabled are issued free of charge. </p><h2>  Leisure </h2><p>  When determining how to live a month for 5000 rubles, it is important to consider that a separate expense item is attending leisure activities.  And it will also need to significantly save.  And in the case of possession of only 5000 rubles per month, you need to abandon them for good. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Cheap leisure" class="if uuid-2965728" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2965728.jpg"></div><p>  But you need to consider that you can spend time at home, going to visit.  It won‚Äôt hit the pocketbook so much.  And another good way to save money is to organize group trips to a cafe, the account in which will be divided into all.  But this can also be allowed a maximum of 1 time per month.  Most likely, leisure activities in the presence of only 5000 rubles per month will be limited to movie screenings at home.  In the warmer months, you can go on picnics, bringing home-made food with you.  It will be inexpensive, at the same time, if you have a good company, you can get a lot of pleasant memories. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  About Extra Income </h2><p>  The surest way to get out of this situation is to organize additional income.  Once with only 5,000 rubles in your pocket for a month, the best solution would be to increase your income.  In his free time, it makes sense to engage in self-education, it will not be superfluous to upgrade qualifications.  Under such conditions, it will be possible to find a side job, due to which there will be more money.  So, you can earn money on the Internet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="taxfree4u.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cashback system" class="if uuid-2965723" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2965723.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, it is worth remembering that there are many programs that allow you to use cashback.  It‚Äôs best to never pay in stores in cash.  It makes sense to issue a cashback card that will allow you to return money for purchases.  Usually using such a card allows you to save about 500 rubles per month. </p><h2>  About discounts and tastings </h2><p>  The first rule of someone who is going to live on 5000 rubles will be the constant search for discounts.  In stores it is better to take exclusively goods with a reduced price.  If at the local supermarket there are no discounts for meat, you need to go to another store. </p><p>  If there is no tea on the stock, you need to purchase the cheapest - baikhovy.  To enjoy special tastes, it makes sense to visit stores when tastings are held in them.  This is another way to save.  Tasting absolutely all the products exhibited, for 5000 rubles you can live much easier. </p><h2>  Refusal of excesses </h2><p>  Household chemicals are best purchased in stores in which the entire range is presented at the same price.  Shampoos, shower gels, laundry detergents - it‚Äôs better to get there.  It will be cheaper.  It must be borne in mind that balms, hair lotions can not be included in the item of expenditure - otherwise there simply will not be enough money.  This will be a blow to pride for women. </p><div class="photo" data-original="news.ngs.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Live like that" class="if uuid-2965729" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2965729.jpg"></div><p>  It is worth saying that you will have to significantly save on cosmetics and skin care.  This will result in a worsening appearance for women.  If he has a pet, he will have to switch to dry cheap food. </p><h2>  Nutrition rules </h2><p>  It is necessary to prepare for breakfast from sandwiches made of bread with a spread.  Soups will be empty.  Salvation will be hiking.  It is important to remember that a lack of good nutrition often leads to a feeling of dissatisfaction in general.  Scientists have proven the relationship between health and quality of products.  It is worth preparing for the beginning of sluggish depressive moods. </p><p>  However, pensioners and students who live in Russia with minimal money have invented separate recipes that can significantly save on food.  For example, when buying a pair of chicken legs, you can cook soup with potatoes and noodles.  Then get the meat, chop and fry with onions and carrots, making porridge with meat.  In the morning it makes sense to cook porridge on the water - it is satisfying and healthy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Survive a hundred" class="if uuid-2965725" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2965725.jpg"></div><p>  At the same time, you need to know that saving on food, contrary to popular belief, does not lead to weight loss at all.  On the contrary, low-quality products lead to obesity.  For this reason, it is worth preparing for such phenomena to those who are going to live on 5000 rubles a month. </p><p>  If there is a need to give someone gifts, you have to be smart.  You can, for example, make a present with your own hands. </p><h2>  Useful Tips </h2><p>  Besides the fact that it is necessary to purchase only in the cheapest outlets, it is important to purchase products in exceptionally large packages, this will increase the savings.  In no case should you buy finished products anywhere.  So, having given fifty rubles for one whitewash, you can lose almost a kilogram of buckwheat. </p><p>  Also a good habit will be the calculation of the budget.  You need to know where and what the available money is spent on.  On the account you will need to keep every ruble.  To a large extent, it will help to save the conservation of products on their own in the season. </p><p>  You should definitely plan your menu in advance, which will allow you to not leave any surplus and use each product competently and with maximum benefit. </p><p>  A good way to save is gardening training.  In the absence of a summer cottage with a budget of 5000 rubles per month, you will probably need to plant seedlings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="droplak.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="grandmother in the store" class="if uuid-2965721" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/2965721.jpg"></div><p>  A sharp shift to a limited budget can have a negative impact on health.  Therefore, it is important to calculate the calorie content of dishes, take into account the intake of proteins, fats and carbohydrates.  You must always get the necessary amount of nutrients.  We must not forget that there is no money for health problems and getting rid of them. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  So, to live on 5000 rubles a month, you need to acquire new good habits.  First, plan your every purchase, even a small one.  When a person goes to the store for ‚Äúsomething,‚Äù he always buys something extra. </p><p>  In addition to this, purchases must be made at the cheapest outlets.  Cooking is best less often, but immediately for a couple of days.  This saves time that can be given to work, as well as expensive gas and electricity. </p>
