It is washed by two seas - the White and Barents.  It begins with the <span>Mezen Bay.</span>  It ends with a rocky cape in the northwest under the name Kanin Nos and Mikulin in the southeast.  Ridge composed of crystalline schists - this is what can be called the Kanin Peninsula.  Where is this part of the land located?  For a more accurate description of the geographical position, it is necessary to know its coordinates - 68 ¬∞ north latitude and 45 ¬∞ east longitude.  The peninsula belongs to the Arkhangelsk region.  Geographically, this is the region of the Far North. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="peninsula of canines" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1267730.jpg" width="523"></div>

    <h2>  Kanin Peninsula: description and features of the coastline </h2><p>  The coast of the peninsula, which washes the <span>White Sea, is</span> divided into shores.  They, in turn, have their own names.  For example, the western one is called the Kanin coast.  But the coast of the Barents Sea has no names. </p><p>  In addition, the White Sea consists of 3 parts, namely the water area itself, the throat and the funnel.  Kanin is located just near the funnel, in a narrow place where these two reservoirs are in contact.  Under such circumstances, huge waves form in the area.  This means that crossing vessels in these places is quite dangerous. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Characteristic </h2><p>  Currently, Kanin is a peninsula in the Nenets <span>Autonomous District of</span> Russia.  However, earlier, about 10 thousand years ago, it was an island.  Through the strait, which disconnected it from the mainland, the most powerful current passed - the Gulf Stream.  But gradually in this place large deposits of sand accumulated.  And it is thanks to them that Canin has now become a peninsula. </p>

    <p>  Its area is approximately 10.5 thousand square meters.  km  If you look at the peninsula on the map, you will notice that it is narrow and long.  Its length is 300 km and its width is only 70 km.  The entire territory of the peninsula is densely indented by rivers.  Some of them flow into the <span>Barents Sea</span> (Moskvina, Peschanka, Makovaya, etc.), others into the White (Chizha, Mist, Mesna, etc.). </p><h2>  Terrain features </h2><p>  Kanin is a peninsula representing a flat area.  There are lakes filled with peaty black water.  The coating is mainly hard, even sand, so most locals ride motorbikes there freely.  The peninsula is known as the continuous tundra.  On its territory, rare vegetation is found.  Mostly winds prevail here, which carry sand washed with sea water. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Population </h2><p>  At the moment, there are 9 small settlements.  Of these, five are officially recognized non-residential.  True, this does not mean that the Kanin Peninsula is completely uninhabited.  The expedition members, hunters, fishing, and also rare tourists usually stop here. </p>

    <p>  Kanin is poorly mastered by man.  This is most likely due to the fact that the region has a harsh <span>subarctic climate.</span>  Winter lasts approximately 7 months.  Climatic features are fully consistent with the northern regions of Russia. </p><h2>  Flora and fauna </h2><p>  The Kanin Peninsula is represented mainly by flat terrain.  The territory looks like a monotonous tundra, which is often interrupted by lakes and shallow rivers.  Sometimes you can see small hills.  The vegetation on the Kanin Peninsula is very sparse.  Only small shrubs and mushrooms can be found in this area.  The local population, in addition to fish and meat, feeds on berries, which are mainly collected by women. </p>

    <p>  On the peninsula, fishing for sea animals and fish is very developed.  Currently, existing settlements are widely engaged in this type of activity.  Of the mammals, deer are found here, not only tame, but also wild.  Reindeer husbandry is widely developed on the peninsula.  These animals are used as a means of transportation in the winter.  Also here you can find a fox, arctic fox, guinea pig, northern hare.  The birds that live on the peninsula are exclusively nomadic.  These are owls, gulls, zuiks, crooks, loons and others.  They change their location depending on the time of year. </p><h2>  Features of the life of the indigenous population </h2><p>  The Kanin Peninsula is populated by unique people.  Their main feature is kindness.  If the fisherman returns home with a big catch, then without a shadow of doubt he gives the unnecessary part to the neighbors and, surprisingly, completely free.  As you know, on the peninsula there are a large number of small rivers.  But each settlement calls them different names.  And surprisingly, they also chuckle at what other settlers called them. </p><p>  When the boy turns exactly 4 years old, he is considered independent, and his father presents him with a belt with a knife as a gift.  Each offspring has its own deer.  Children from an early age help parents.  Boys like to go fishing or hunting, and girls like picking berries. </p>

    <p>  To study elementary sciences, children have to fly by helicopter to a completely different city for a long nine months.  For parents, this separation seems like an insurmountable test.  Families on the peninsula are mostly large.  They use deer skin instead of bedspreads; clothes are also made from hides.  Only women are engaged in such fishing.  Their responsibilities also include cooking.  Every housewife has her own recipe for baking bread. </p><p>  There is no electricity, no communications, no oil rigs on the peninsula.  The strange thing is that people living in this area are not at all afraid of the dark. </p><h2>  Description of the peninsula in books </h2><p>  One of the English researchers visited the island of Kanin and expressed all his impressions in the work.  In the nineteenth century a book was published entitled "Journey to the Kanin Peninsula."  It was written by Russian geologist Konstantin Ivanovich Grevingk.  In it, he described the geological structure of this land area. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  The Kanin Peninsula is almost inaccessible to tourists.  Although it is extremely interesting, it‚Äôs quite difficult to get on it.  Basically, scientific expeditions or researchers come here, as well as participants in any scientific projects.  But they do not stay here for long, as it will be very difficult to withstand such a climate and a difficult path. </p>
