And after Tyutchev's death, it was decided to transfer his manuscripts and family rarities to the estate.  Subsequently, a museum was organized here.  Muranovo Manor, whose official website contains information about the history of the estate, hosts thousands of guests annually - lovers and connoisseurs of the beautiful. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Murano Manor" class="if" height="260" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/458499.jpg" width="540"></div>

    <h2>  General information </h2><p>  In our country, there is a list of prominent cultural figures whose memory it was decided to perpetuate.  In 1920, a museum was opened in the Tyutchev estate near Moscow, which was named in his honor.  What is characteristic, the estate managed to maintain the authenticity of the situation.  This fact makes it possible to seriously study the artistic culture of the time.  The creators of the museum with special care recreated the atmosphere that reigned in the house during the years of Tyutchev's life.  So, on the windows are the curtains of the beginning of the century, tables are covered with a shabby tablecloth, and the wardrobe is pasted with pictures of that era.  Each piece of furniture has its own ‚Äúroot‚Äù place.  And when you look at the interior, it seems that this furniture still retains the touch of the hands of its owner. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum Tyutchev Muranovo Estate" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/458500.jpg" width="550"></div>  Muranovo is a manor with a very unusual fate.  The estate is considered a unique monument of Russian culture.  It owes this status to the connection with the names of two famous lyricists: Evgeny Abramovich Baratynsky and Fyodor Ivanovich Tyutchev.  The whole color of the Russian intelligentsia of the 19th century gathered in this "house of poets."  And to this day, the atmosphere of time has been preserved here, in which creatively gifted people lived, transmitting in their works the feelings and way of thinking of representatives of the past era.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  For those who visited Muranovo, the estate (reviews of many tourists confirm this) was forever sunk into the soul with its simplicity, uncomplicated interiors.  Guests will not see here either a row of white columns, or gates with delicate ornate patterns, nor lions towering above the steps - nothing of what is characteristic of ancient estates.  Here you will not notice the monumentality and pathos of buildings of that era.  On the "brooding" <span>linden alley,</span> charging with peace and quiet, you can reach the house, which offers a beautiful view.  The structure is not distinguished by the uniqueness of architecture.  Meanwhile, the interior decoration can cause pleasant surprise. </p><h2>  Interior </h2><p>  Behind the open doors you can see a number of adjoining rooms.  This arrangement corresponded to the traditions of everyday life of that era.  Changes and research in different architectural directions did not affect the estates of that time.  The traditional <span>layout of the rooms</span> was not only their peculiar feature, but also a distinguishing feature that reveals the advantages.  A vivid confirmation of this is the estate of Muranovo.  The estate, the photo of which is presented in the article, begins with a large living room.  This room represents the majesty and solemnity of the whole house.  Due to the missing windows, calm twilight dwell here at any time of the day.  Light enters here only through the wide open doors of the passage rooms.  The whole atmosphere of the room is disposed to plunge into it with your head, lingering in that era.  With bated breath, you can look at the paintings on the walls for a long time, admire the exquisite set of the ombre table, get lost in the melodious ringing of the hours of work of French masters.  The neighborhood of two centuries, present and past, is reflected here.  The leading trends of that time consisted in the fact that the solemnity and grandeur of the interior should not diminish or belittle people.  These traits manifested themselves here.  A magnificent bronze chandelier with gilding hangs almost at the level of human growth, which gives the living room a special clarity and sound.  The fireplace in bright colors is characterized by severe rigor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum estate Muranovo" class="if" height="253" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/458501.jpg" width="400"></div>

Grabar said that Muranovo is a manor where rare works of Russian painting are located.  The art gallery, collected by several generations of owners, contains wonderful works by Kiprensky, Rokotov, Savrasov, Aivazovsky, Tropinin.  Painting objects of the interior of the room are not only a kind of decorative decoration and a page of Russian history, but also combine times and eras.  The picture of the artist Karl Bardou, executed in pastel colors, depicts the general family of L. N. Engelhardt.  At the beginning of the 19th century they were the owners of the Muranovo estate.  The estate also hosted Pushkin, Davydov, in whose house Baratynsky met his future wife - Anastasia Engelhardt. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  In 1841, Baratynsky - due to the inconvenience and small size of the old house - begins to build new housing.  After some time, what can be called one of the best literary nests of the 19th century appears on the site of an ordinary landowner estate.  This work of architectural art contained a picture of the lifestyle of the representatives of the nobility.  In 1844, Baratynsky went to Italy.  From this sunny country, he regularly sends optimistic and cheerful news to his family.  Unexpected for everyone was his sudden death.  Emptied Muranovo.  The estate, six years later, passes to the new heir - Nikolai Vasilyevich Putyata.  This creative person carefully treated what was left of his relatives and preserved all the property of the estate. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum manor Muranovo official site" class="if" height="220" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/458502.jpg" width="340"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Cultural significance </h2><p>  This new owner Muranovo founded here a kind of <span>literary salon.</span>  People gathered here conducted free conversations, read books and articles.  All of them were united by a sense of spiritual community.  The time at the dinner parties ran fast, imperceptibly and a lot of fun.  Having broken into groups, the guests had conversations by the fireplace, played cards, played music, filled special albums with poems and drawings, enjoyed fashionable romances.  In those days, it was difficult to find at least one living room where there was no piano.  For Baratynsky‚Äôs work, life, the audience and the salon, which was organized in Muranovo, were significant.  The estate (how to get to the estate, will be described later) was visited by famous creative personalities.  In particular, there were N.V. Gogol, V.F. Odoevsky, S.T. Aksakov, A.N. Maykov, and <span>Y. P. Polonsky.</span>  The manor of the estate was very friendly with F.I. Tyutchev, whose son in 1869 married the daughter of Putyata.  Fyodor Ivanovich, who found out about this, would later write to his daughter-in-law that friendship of twenty years could be strengthened and sanctified only by this marriage.  The poet himself, who repeatedly visited Muranovo, died in Tsarskoye Selo in the late 19th century.  And the legacy of the Murano family was replenished with archives, books and things belonging to this wonderful person. </p><h2>  Museum </h2><p>  Manor Tyutcheva Muranovo is in its original form today.  The decoration of the rooms of Baratynsky and Tyutchev has reached our time.  Many things occupy the places on which they have stood for many decades.  The office of Evgeny Abramovich stands out with a desk, which was once made by experienced serfs.  It was after him that the last collection of his poems was written.  An inkwell, <span>a paper folder, and</span> small accessories lie where they were with the owner of the house, and as if they were waiting for him to touch them again. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tyutchev's estate in Muranovo" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/458503.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Library - the standard of comfort and silence </h2><p>  Thanks to the ancient mahogany cabinets, behind the glass doors of which the golden roots of books sparkle, the room acquires a warm and rich color.  The authors of these publications were friends with the owners of Muranovo.  The estate, the address of which is Moscow Region, Pushkin District, the settlement of Ashukino, as already mentioned above, hosted many prominent people.  N.V. Gogol and S.T. Aksakov were very fond of the library and spent a lot of time in it.  But Baratynsky and Pushkin were strong friends and met repeatedly in Moscow.  After reading the author of the poem Boris Godunov personally, Evgeny Abramovich admired the incredible heights of this work.  The library also contains books that belonged to Tyutchev at one time.  Turgenev is considered the discoverer of the significance of the work of this poet.  And Tolstoy wrote that he was fascinated by the grandeur of his talent. </p><h2>  Library interior </h2><p>  Being in this room, all visitors will certainly pay attention to the flooring.  This is due to the fact that the floor of bog oak and pine is made in such a way that the amazing beauty of the tree has been preserved to this day.  Scored parquet, waxed, managed to maintain its original freshness and its natural color.  In the same room is an unusual design office made of mahogany.  Today it is almost impossible to meet carpentry work of this quality.  This bureau with a hinged lid and a large number of intricate drawers has several cunningly hidden caches. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Muranovo Manor photo" class="if" height="203" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/458504.jpg" width="360"></div>

    <h2>  Famous rooms </h2><p>  The two-story Tyutchev estate in Muranovo has a stunning staircase along which color lithographs and engravings are located on the walls.  Climbing the stairs to the second floor of the house, visitors find themselves in a different world than ours.  The rooms located here during the poet's life were intended for guests.  Of course, their decoration is somewhat different from the luxuriously decorated rooms on the second floor.  There are no originally made fireplaces, ceremonial furniture and wondrous chandeliers.  However, from these rooms there remains a feeling of coziness and comfort.  By the way, on the second floor of the estate there is a Gogol room.  As the name implies, a famous Russian writer lived in it for some time.  In these chambers there is not much furniture; as a result, a feeling of a half-empty room is created.  At the same time, special calmness emanates from the room.  In addition, it is here that numerous paintings are concentrated, which depict the Tyutchev Muranovo Museum-Estate.  In the room opposite Gogol's chambers, the Moscow office of the son-in-law and part-time of the first biographer Tyutchev, I. S. Aksakov, was recreated as accurately as possible.  In 1866, Ivan Sergeyevich married a daughter of the poet Anna Fedorovna.  By the way, before marriage, Tyutchev‚Äôs heiress was a maid of honor at the royal court.  Subsequently, she wrote interesting memoirs about that period of her life - ‚ÄúAt the Court of Two Emperors‚Äù.  Creating a "duplicate" of Aksakov‚Äôs office, special attention was paid to the correct <span>arrangement of furniture.</span>  So, at the window there was a desk, behind which the biographer preferred to work while standing.  Remember, in Tolstoy's War and Peace, Prince Bolkonsky worked at the same table. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Muranovo Manor Address" class="if" height="376" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/458505.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Features </h2><p>  When visiting the second floor during the inspection of the front rooms, it is simply breathtaking from the solemn atmosphere prevailing here.  Particularly impressive is the furniture in these rooms.  It is thanks to her that the Muranovo museum-estate has a lived-in look.  It is worth saying that in the atmosphere of the house several styles coexist at once.  However, this moment only gives a special highlight to all the premises of the estate.  So, some elements are arranged in cozy islands, and separate furniture is strictly located along the walls.  Also on the ground floor of the estate there are elements of decor, decorated with a set of precious wood.  This art of woodworking reached its peak in the second half of the 18th century.  Some craftsmen decorated the furniture with a set of flower garlands and bouquets, while others used the views of cities.  And someone preferred to bring plant elements and geometric shapes into their work.  Usually ombre tables were decorated in this way.  This card game was very popular in those days among the nobles.  Some representatives of the nobility purchased for themselves several similar tables or ordered a pair version of execution. </p><h2>  Interior features </h2><p>  During the life of Tyutchev, porcelain was used mainly for room decor.  He could be found in every room on the slides, consoles, or simply beautifully placed on the tables.  Muranovo Manor is a storehouse of porcelain art not only Russian but also foreign production.  For a century, the family of Fyodor Ivanovich used the Saxon tea service, which was produced back in the 18th century.  If any item from the set was broken, a copy was created on the order.  Russian factories made porcelain products in artistic folk traditions.  Due to this nuance, these works carry a unique identity.  The front rooms of the estate are made in the noble features characteristic of that time.  Here practicality and convenience coexist with solemnity and beauty.  In the Tyutchev estate, one especially feels how deeply in that era art penetrated people's lives.  Each visitor to the estate appreciates two watercolors by S. Timofeev. </p><h2>  Muranovo (manor).  How to get to the estate? </h2><p>  First you need to take the train at the Yaroslavl station and get to the station.  Ashukinsky.  Next, you need to get to the village itself, where the Muranovo estate is located.  How to get to the estate from the station?  You need to take the 34th bus or minibus. </p>
