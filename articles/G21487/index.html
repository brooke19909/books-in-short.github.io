Often it is not possible to separate the truth from fiction, because after millennia, many facts, repeatedly retold, acquire a completely new sound.  In Europe, they are very respectful of the legendary person of Charlemagne, who is considered the ancestor of all European medieval civilization.  Of particular interest is the sword of Charlemagne, a debate about the origin of which is still being waged in the scientific world. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Charlemagne Sword" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1650033.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  The son of Pepin Korotky - the legendary king of the Franks </h2><p>  Historians find it difficult to say exactly when Karl was born, but they suggest that his birth date may be the middle of the eighth century.  During this historical period, the ruling dynasty of the Merovingians ended its existence and Karl, together with his brother, became the ancestor of the new royal dynasty - the Carolingians. </p><p>  It is worth noting that Charlemagne managed to create a huge empire, united under his strong and fair hand.  In order to achieve this goal, he spent almost his whole life in military campaigns, and Karl was an amazingly talented military leader - he could conduct several military campaigns in different directions at the same time.  Most of his campaigns ended in victories. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By 802, Karl was able to create a strong empire and referred to himself as "the ruler of the Roman Empire, the king of the Franks and Lombards."  After the death of the legendary ruler, three European states emerged from the empire, existing to this day: France, Italy and Germany. </p><h2>  The role of weapons in the military campaigns of Charlemagne </h2><p>  In times when every free man was a warrior, it‚Äôs hard to even imagine how you could do without weapons.  Therefore, the swords were a special pride of the soldiers, poems were dedicated to them and given names.  With the kiss of the sword, the most indestructible vows were sealed.  Breaking the word given on the battle sword was considered the greatest sacrilege, for which one would have to pay in this world and in another. </p><p>  Unfortunately, few descriptions of weapons from the time of Charlemagne have survived to this day.  Historians collected these data bit by bit from preserved handwritten texts and mosaic paintings found in France.  In the era of the legendary king of the Franks, long swords that had a double sharpened blade were common.  It was made of a light and durable alloy, the hilt of the sword was a cross with a small rounded head at the end.  The handle was decorated with silver wire and precious stones, often the mark of the master was put on it.  A sample of metal was imprinted on silver and gold elements. </p><p>  In the 8-10 centuries, swords were not a pathos attribute, completely studded with precious stones and decorated with patterns.  First of all, they were to serve their master faithfully, bringing him victory in battles.  That is how the sword of Charlemagne appears before the descendants. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The Sword of Charlemagne" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1650032.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  "Song of Roland" </h2><p>  For the first time, the legendary sword of Charlemagne was mentioned in the Song of Roland.  This medieval epic tells of the campaign of Charlemagne in Spain.  Of course, in the presentation of the author, many events are presented in a slightly different light than in reality, but the general chronology is preserved unchanged.  According to historical sources, returning from the campaign, the detachment of Charlemagne was ambushed by the Moors.  Count Roland, who died in battle, rushed to defend his king.  Karl himself simply miraculously survived and was very sad about the loss of such a loyal ally.  According to legend, a king forged from a treacherous enemy helped the sword, forged from a special metal and always brings only victory.  Roland had a second similar sword, but, unfortunately, he could not save his master. </p><h2>  The Sword of Charles the Great Zhuaiez (or Joyful) </h2><p>  To this day, a little information has come about the sword of Charlemagne.  It is known for certain that he bore the proud name of Juaiez, in translation this name sounds like ‚Äújoyful‚Äù or ‚Äúrainbow‚Äù. </p><p>  It is not known what metal the sword was forged from, but, as contemporaries of Charlemagne wrote, only two swords were awarded such a metal - Zhuaez and Durandal, which belonged to Roland. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The sword of Charlemagne Joyaise has always been near the king.  Even in times of respite from military campaigns, he always lay at the royal headboard.  Karl considered the sword his amulet, capable of making it invulnerable.  Of course, we can question the magical properties of the sword, but during his campaigns, Charlemagne did not receive serious injuries and always emerged victorious from battles. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The Sword of Charlemagne" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1650034.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  The story of the origin of the royal sword </h2><p>  Historians do not undertake to state with accuracy where this amazing sword came from in the hands of the king.  But after long scientific research, the famous blacksmith Galas was recognized as the creator of weapons.  According to legend, he knew how to make the lightest and most durable swords in the whole kingdom.  Therefore, it is not surprising that one day Charlemagne himself appeared at the home of a skilled blacksmith.  At this time, he already glorified himself with several campaigns and conquests, but could not find a weapon worthy of his strength.  Galas promised to forge the king of the Franks the best sword possible. </p><p>  It took him three years to create a weapon.  The blacksmith decorated the hilt with the image of dragons, but in subsequent years they were replaced by stamped lilies.  It is believed that Zhuaez was so strong that he could easily cut a huge boulder and not even get dull.  The power of the sword was in one mysterious artifact, which became part of an extraordinary weapon. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The sword of Charlemagne Joeyes served France for a long time" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1650051.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  <span>Longin's spear</span> - true or fiction? </h2><p>  Perhaps this legend is the most difficult to verify in our time.  It is believed that the power of the sword was that its blade was forged from a piece of Longin's spear.  The very warrior who pierced Jesus Christ crucified on the cross ... </p><p>  Truly magical properties were attributed to this spear, but it is impossible to prove or disprove the involvement of this spear in the sword of Zhuaez.  Historians have learned that almost two hundred years after the death of Charlemagne, during the Crusades, rumors circulated about a piece of Longin's spear found.  But whether the item found was really a Christian artifact is also still unknown. </p><h2>  What happened to the legendary sword after the death of Charlemagne? </h2><p>  The king of the Franks died in 814 at a very advanced age.  According to historians, Charlemagne at that time was already more than seventy years old.  It is known that until the time of his death, the sword was with the king.  Where is the sword of Charles the Great Zhuaez, or Joyful, now located? </p><p>  For a long time historians tried to find his trace, and to date, several versions of the further fate of the extraordinary sword have been put forward.  According to one of the most unpopular versions, Zhuayez was buried with his master.  None of those close could separate the king and his weapons.  Therefore, we can say that the legendary sword is lost for posterity. </p><p>  But this version is far from the only one in the history of the sword.  Other historians claim that he, as the greatest relic, was deposited at the Abbey of Saint-Denis.  Later, the weapon was transferred to the Louvre, where it is still stored as a museum exhibit. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The Sword of Charlemagne" class="if" height="226" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1650036.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  The Louvre: the haven of the legendary sword </h2><p>  If you ever visit the exposition in the Louvre, you will definitely see a sword, which is considered to be the true weapon of Charlemagne.  But among historians, this fact is in great doubt. </p><p>  The sword of Charlemagne in the Louvre has undergone various studies, including radiocarbon analysis.  Scientists were simply shocked by the result of these studies: parts of the sword belong to completely different eras!  For example, the blade itself dates from the 8th-9th century, which is consistent with the version of the legendary sword Zhuaez.  But the handle with jewelry could not be created before the twelfth century, this is evidenced by jewelry, on which stands a special test.  In addition, some elements of the decoration of the sword were made around the 10th century.  Despite all this confusion, the French faithfully believe that it is precisely the sword of Juaiez that is in the Louvre. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Charlemagne Sword in the Louvre" class="if" height="443" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1650031.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  At what ceremonies did the sword of Charlemagne serve? </h2><p>  Before the Joyful became a museum exhibit in the Louvre, it was actively used by the French in various ceremonies.  Basically, the sword of Charles the Great Zhuaiez served France for a long time at coronation ceremonies.  It is believed that for the first time he was crowned Philip II, who was an amazingly talented military leader.  According to other sources, the sword of Joy was used much later - under Philip III.  Since that period, weapons have become a constant attribute at every coronation ceremony in France.  In 1825, he was crowned the last king of the Bourbon dynasty - Charles X. After that, the sword passed into the category of museum exhibits. </p>

    <p>  History is full of mysteries and secrets, because almost all great people during their lifetime become legendary personalities.  Over time, these legends grow into a mass of incredible additions.  But the descendants have the right to independently decide how true these heroic stories of past years are. </p>
