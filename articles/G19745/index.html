The sleeves themselves are thin strips with oblique sections on top.  At the end of the work, all the small parts are sewn together.  Since the sweater is striped, additional decoration is not required. </p><h2>  How to sew clothes for a Monster High doll from a sock? </h2><p>  As you can see in the photo below, not only a sweater or a knitted dress can be cut from a sock.
