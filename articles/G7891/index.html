    <p>  In general, you can list all the possibilities for relaxing in Gorky Park for an infinitely long time.  But it‚Äôs better to see once, isn‚Äôt it?  You can get here by metro.  From the station "Park of Culture" or "October" you will need to walk only 10 minutes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Krasnodar </h2><p>  Gorky Park here is also called the "City Garden".  The time of its creation is the middle of the XIX century.  By the beginning of the next century, the park had become a real natural gem, the main dendrological attraction of the city.  The Great Patriotic War did not spare this picturesque corner.  The park was almost completely destroyed, but city authorities and landscapers made sure that it was reconstructed.  Gradually, he acquired an attractive appearance. </p>

    <h2>  Another park </h2><p>  Gorky Park, whose address is Krasnodar, Postovaya street, 34, at the entrance greets guests with the monument "Reconciliation and consent."  It is dedicated to the locals who became victims of the civil war.  One of the main attractions of the park is the giant oak, which is considered its peer.  This is a peculiar symbol of the park, which personifies the connection of times and generations. </p><p>  Both Krasnodar residents and city guests like to be here.  Communication with nature always brings tranquility and joy.  Shady alleys and cascades of fountains invite you to plunge into the pleasant atmosphere and feel easy and comfortable.  But people do not come here for peace.  Here you can have some fun too.  Numerous attractions, a shooting gallery and a cafe await visitors.  A new Ferris wheel was installed here this year.

    <p>  We will leave the borders of the Russian Federation and move to Kharkov.  It should be noted that Gorky Park, whose address is Sumskaya Street, 81, is the largest corner of nature in this city.  The first plantings here were made in 1893, and the grand opening took place already in 1907, when these trees grew.  The park owes its appearance to the residents of Kharkov, thanks to which 98 hectares of forest were allotted for improvement. </p><p>  Today, many Kharkivs call Gorky Park the local Disneyland.  Here is the largest Ferris wheel in Ukraine, whose height is 55 meters.  Children and adults are waiting for a <span>roller coaster, a</span> rope park, an autodrome, a house of fear and other fun and breathtaking attractions.  In total, here you can count about 40 types of various entertainments.  This natural corner is created especially for family holidays. </p>

    <h2>  Convenient separation </h2><p>  Each visitor will be able to easily navigate in the park.  Its entire area is divided into 5 zones, each of which is devoted to a separate theme: retro, French, extreme, medieval and children's.  Representatives of the older generation will surely enjoy the retrozone - here every evening in the evenings there are dances to music performed by a live orchestra on a covered stage.  Everything breathes the atmosphere of the middle of the XX century.  Do not describe all the opportunities that Gorky Park offers its visitors.  Kharkov (the address of the park, recall - Sumska St., 81) is waiting for guests and invites them to spend unforgettable hours in a unique green corner! </p><h2>  Minsk </h2><p>  And now let's move to the <span>capital of Belarus.</span>  Gorky's local park was founded more than two hundred years ago - in 1805.  True, then it was called the Governor's Garden, because it was the governor of the city who created it - Z. Korneev. At that time, he occupied an area of ‚Äã‚Äã18 hectares.  Comfortable benches and picturesque alleys made the Governor's garden the most favorite vacation spot for citizens. </p><p>  Gorky Park has been named after Gorky since 1936.  Minsk (the address of the park is Frunze street, 2) also remembers the period when the former Governor's garden was renamed ‚ÄúProfintern‚Äù.  This happened in 1917, after the end of the October Revolution. </p><h2>  Minsk Gorky Park today </h2>

    <p>  Today, the park is spread over as much as 28 hectares of land.  It is famous for rare landscape gardening plants, which include cedar pine, <span>European larch,</span> California fir and others.  Among the variety of attractions offered, one can single out a ball pool, a Ferris wheel, a chain carousel, a race track, etc. You can laugh heartily in the ‚ÄúLaughter Room‚Äù, and you can feel the blood-chilling horror in the ‚ÄúRoom of Fear‚Äù.  Great attendance of the park contributes to its convenient location - in the very center of the city, in the immediate vicinity of <span>Victory Square.</span> </p>
