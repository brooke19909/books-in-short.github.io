  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to choose a projector: expert advice</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today we will consider a topic that will give many potential buyers of projectors the opportunity to make an informed choice, while relying not on advertising slogans or tales of the seller, but on real criteria, technical parameters and knowledge on how to choose a projector.  An excursion into the world of lumens, pixels and other matrices is declared open. </p><p>  Surely you have already wondered how to choose a projector.  I dare to assume that information on this subject is written by a cart and a small cart.  I propose to make an easy and pleasant trip, to determine for yourself which is better - a projector or a TV, and at the end to become an expert in this matter. </p><p>  The range of modern projectors is able to impress anyone who is first immersed in the study of this topic.  Large, small, stationary or portable, with a bunch of features in the description and frightening numbers in the price list.  Let us examine and classify these objects, define our tasks and needs, and after the correction related to the budget of the future purchase, we will have only a few applicants in the <span>bottom line</span> .  So with them we will eventually have a conversation "heart to heart". </p><p>  <strong>How to choose a projector and what to look for?</strong> </p><p>  <strong>Point number 1.</strong> First of all, you need to pay attention to where and how you plan to use the projector.  Depending on this, several types emerge: </p><ul><li>  for home (home theater); </li><li>  for work (presentations and conferences); </li><li>  for mass events (show programs, concerts, events). </li></ul><p>  These are the starting points that should be relied upon in the further consideration of candidates.  Design features and specifications at each point will differ markedly from each other. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Point number 2.</strong> The next aspect will greatly affect the quality display of materials on the big screen.  We are talking about the brightness of the projector, and to be absolutely precise in the formulations - about the power of the <span>light flux</span> that the projector is capable of emitting.  The units in which the projector aperture is measured are called ANSI or lumens. </p><ul><li>  For a small room with full dimming, this value can range from 600 to 800 units. </li><li>  For working in conditions with partial lighting, a device capable of giving out ‚Äúuphill‚Äù brightness from 1000 to 1800 units is suitable. </li><li>  If you have to work without dimming at all, in daylight - it is better to opt for models with power from 2000 to 3000 units. </li><li>  From 3000 units - for rooms up to 100 sq.m.  with bright <span>daylight.</span> </li><li>  5000 and more - halls for 150-200 people with bright light. </li><li>  Projectors with a speed of 10,000 or more are professional projectors designed for large concert halls and stadiums. </li></ul><p>  <strong>Item number 3.</strong>  <strong>Projector Resolution</strong>  This value characterizes the ability of the projector to display on the screen a certain number of points (pixels) per unit area.  The higher the resolution of the projector - the lower the grain, the more detailed the image will be, and the better the picture will look on the big screen.  However, do not get carried away with astronomical resolution numbers: the quality of the picture very much depends on the resolution of the signal that is fed to the projector for display.  The standard resolution of the projector 600x800 pixels allows you to display almost lossless material in DVD quality.  To display high-definition images, it is better to look at models with a resolution of 1280 by 800, and even better at Full HD - 1920 by 1080 pixels (if we are talking about a home theater - this is the only acceptable solution). </p><p>  <strong>Item number 4.</strong>  <strong>The contrast of the projector.</strong>  This parameter is responsible for the "color depth".  In fact, this is the ability of the projector to display the brightest black and white color when projecting pictures on a <span>large screen.</span>  The Golden Mean is the weighted average between the maximum and minimum values ‚Äã‚Äãof several models.  By and large, the difference between 800: 1 and 1000: 1 is almost imperceptible. </p><p>  All other <span>parameters of the projectors are</span> very similar and can only slightly differ from each other.  Before choosing a projector completely, focus on your needs: the availability of Wi-Fi, ‚Äúpicture-in-picture‚Äù, freeze frame and other ‚Äúbells and whistles‚Äù are not important.  Make sure you have the main connectors that are responsible for the input signal (preferably having an HDMI input), pay attention to the lamp life and the cost of buying a replacement one.  This, in principle, will be enough to understand how to choose a projector and what the sly-eyed sales assistant chirps to you about. </p>
