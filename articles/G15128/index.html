In such an indicator as the population, it is located on 31 positions in the country.  The largest local city and at the same time the capital is Jackson.  The official name of the region, translated into Russian, means "state of magnolia." </p><h2>  Short story </h2><p>  About one thousand years ago, a large number of <span>Indian tribes</span> inhabited this territory <span>.</span>  Many of them were at a fairly high level of development.  The first Europeans to appear here in 1540 were members of a Spanish expedition led by Hernando de Soto.  Since 1682, for more than 80 years, the state has been under the control of the Bourbon dynasty.  In 1763 they were replaced by the British, who did not last long here.  Sixteen years later, the current state of Mississippi and several other surrounding regions were captured by the Spaniards.  December 10, 1817 he became part of the United States. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="usa mississippi" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/756602.jpg" width="589"></div>

    <h2>  Economy </h2><p>  The state of Mississippi is one of the most agricultural regions of the state.  The most grown crops here are soy, cotton and rice.  Well-established fish farming and poultry farming.  The rapid development of industry in the region began in the thirties of the twentieth century.  This was facilitated by the rather large reserves of oil and natural gas found at that time.  Then the government launched several more manufacturing sectors, for example, a number of enterprises were built that operate in the woodworking, food and chemical industries.  High profits are brought to the treasury by fishing established in the Gulf of Mexico, a gambling business, as well as a space center and several military bases located in St. Louis Bay.  Despite all this, the state of Mississippi has one of the lowest rates of per capita income in the entire state. </p>
