Why not use non-original exercises?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Smartphone owners almost daily face the issue of charging a mobile phone.  The number of users of modern iPhone models has increased.  The question of whether it is possible to charge the iPhone with non-original charging arises when the battery suddenly discharges while away, loss or damage to the original device.  Is there a difference between them and what?  About it further. </p><h2>  The risks </h2><p>  Purchasing Chinese copies of adapters can result in unnecessary waste of money.  What risks may arise and what will happen if I charge the iPhone with non-original charging?  Now consider the possible problems: </p><ol><li>  The Chinese power supply may not turn on in charging mode.  The latest generation smartphones are configured to issue a message warning that ‚Äúthis cable or accessory is not certified‚Äù by the manufacturer. </li><li>  Strong heating of the storage battery and the telephone case during charging, leading to a reduction in battery life and time. </li><li>  Unexpected failure of the battery with the subsequent purchase of a new one (cost - up to 3,000 rubles from an official representative and about 1,000 - an original copy). </li><li>  Probable damage to microcircuits as a result of a circuit, leading to the repair replacement of damaged modules, the search for original spare parts for the phone and a professional specialist. </li><li>  The ability to burn out the power controller, which is responsible for the energy consumption of the smartphone battery.  The device stops loading and will not turn on at all.  Further chip replacement costs up to 5000 rubles. </li><li>  Ignition of the mobile handset or melting of the housing leads to the complete destruction of the device‚Äôs iOs. </li></ol><p>  Now you know what will happen if you charge the iPhone with non-original charging.  Above we examined possible problems. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.bustle.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to charge an iPhone with non-original charging" class="if uuid-3190898" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/3190898.jpg"></div><h2>  Cables with lighting connector </h2><p>  Purchasing a cable with a lighting connector is also not recommended.  No one will guarantee multiple safe use.  Once the money saved on the purchase of a certified adapter can result in numerous costly repairs of the mobile device afterwards. </p><h2>  Why can not you use non-original charging? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="expartlife.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible to charge an iPhone with non-original charging" class="if uuid-3190904" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/3190904.jpg"></div><p>  Why can not I charge the "iPhone" aftermarket charging?  The answer to the question will tell any professional repairing mobile devices.  Inconsistency in the charging current for a smartphone can be detrimental to the battery and the device itself.  iPhone independently adjusts the current using a power controller, which ranges from 0.3 to 2 amperes (voltage of 5 - 5.5 volts).  If the indicators are exceeded, breakdowns of a different plan may occur.  With insufficient values, the charging time increases many times, which also adversely affects the battery. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The poor workmanship of a fake charger poses a serious threat to the owner of the gadget.  Such adapters do not pass standard tests for reliability and safety of operation, strictly controlled by the company.  The presence of a certified sticker on the power supply indicates the authenticity of the product.  Additional windings and insulation of individual parts are additional protection against uncontrolled voltage drops that can damage the mobile device.  The sophisticated design of the iPhone adapter board is designed to protect against electric shock. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.businessinsider.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="You can charge an iPhone with non-original charging" class="if uuid-3190901" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/3190901.jpg"></div><h2>  Using non-original charging once </h2><p>  Is it possible to charge ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù with non-original charging once in case of emergency?  It‚Äôs possible, but you shouldn‚Äôt do it all the time.  The risk of damage to the device is significantly increased.  Failure of touch screens and ‚Äúdying‚Äù batteries, including minor and major breakdowns of the phone, can spoil the mood for a long time and bring at a crucial moment when you need to make an emergency call. </p><p>  How to charge the "iPhone" aftermarket charging?  Damage to the standard adapter forces the phone to charge another power supply.  But it is impossible to abuse the constant recharging of inappropriate characteristics for the safety of the owner and his equipment.  Original adapters, but from other smartphones, may not contain those charge controllers.  They have a lightweight version of the protection board that does not meet the requirements of the iPhone, which may adversely affect the operating time of the device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Charging options </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.lifewire.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="charging an iPhone with non-original charging" class="if uuid-3190912" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/3190912.jpg"></div><p>  In what cases can I charge the "iPhone" with non-original charging from such a device.  Probably from the USB port of the computer, due to the fact that the power supply guarantees a voltage of 5 volts, without uncontrolled power surges.  It will also be safe to use laptops whose motherboards give a current of 2 amperes, which corresponds to the standard official settings of the smartphone.  The adapter from the iPad meets the specifications of the iPhone, which allows its use by the manufacturer. </p><p>  The MFI mark indicates compliance with the manufacturer's safety standards and standards.  Well-known smartphone companies worry about their reputation and the quality of their products, so they approach the relevant safety standards with a reasonable solution.  Temporary use of original power supplies from well-known manufacturers of gadgets with similar characteristics is quite acceptable. </p><h2>  Charging and talking </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.imore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it worth charging the iPhone with non-original charging" class="if uuid-3190910" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/3190910.jpg"></div><p>  Is it worth charging the ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù with non-original charging and at the same time talking on it?  You can definitely answer that no!  There are cases of fatal electric shock while talking on a telephone connected to a non-original power supply.  I could not withstand the load in the power grid due to the voltage drop, and the output turned out to be 220 volts (instead of the prescribed five). </p><h2>  Interesting offer </h2><p>  After several incidents of electric shock to users, Apple launched a special program to replace non-certified chargers with proprietary adapters for only $ 10.  I posted on the official website a detailed description of the original charging units with all identifiers and designations, urging you to use only the appropriate accessories from the manufacturer.  The cable from the manufacturer is certified and protected from fakes, which clever masters of the production of non-original duplicates can not yet surpass in terms of protection. </p><h2>  Charging in a car </h2><p>  What will happen if the iPhone is charged with non-original charging from a car power supply?  The required adapter from 12 to 4 volts of the premium model costs about 1000 rubles, while the model of a Chinese manufacturer costs about 400 rubles. A high-quality branded accessory assumes the adapter is used safely on the road.  Using cheap fakes can cause a fire in the car, not to mention the damage to the phone. </p><h2>  Advice </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.imore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible to charge an iPhone with non-original charging" class="if uuid-3190902" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/3190902.jpg"></div><p>  Incorrect operation of the display sensor during charging is triggered by the appearance of static currents with low potential, which are regarded by the device as a working command.  The impact on the fingerprint reader may result in the termination of the scanning device, which threatens to replace the entire motherboard, equivalent to acquiring a new device.  Losing information and contacts is a sad event. </p><p>  Non-certified adapters and cables can damage the chip, which controls not only the charging of the battery, but also sleep and USB functions, the incorrect operation of which causes a lot of problems.  This is a sudden shutdown of the smartphone, problematic inclusion and violation of the charge indicator.  The proximity of the chip to the iPhone processor can capture when the track of the adjacent board is closed.  The original power supply, designed to recharge the battery of a mobile device, is able to extend the life of a fashionable device and save its owner‚Äôs life. </p><p>  For safety reasons, do not leave your mobile device unattended when charging when using an uncertified adapter.  Avoid overheating the device in the hot sun in the summer and overcooling at sub-zero temperatures.  Touch screens suffer from sudden changes in temperature.  A more careful attitude to the device can significantly increase its service life.  Economical energy consumption of the battery, protection of the case from mechanical damage and shock when dropped, disabling unnecessary services in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãweak signal reception will allow the battery to last longer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.imore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="why you can‚Äôt charge an iPhone with non-original charging" class="if uuid-3190907" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/3190907.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Now you know what will happen if the iPhone is charged with non-original charging.  You can save the device from possible damage by observing the operating conditions described by the manufacturer in the attached instructions.  If you have an expensive device in your hands, then you should not save on buying the original adapter: it will cost more. </p>
