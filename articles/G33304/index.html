In Nevinnomyssk, the influx of business tourists has sharply increased after the signing at the end of last year of the decree on creating a territory of priority social and economic development here.  The city is very green and beautiful, it stands on the Stavropol Upland in the place where the Bolshoy Zelenchuk River flows into the Kuban.  The environmental situation in Nevinnomyssk, unfortunately, leaves much to be desired.  Choosing a place of residence during a business trip, it is worthwhile to find out at what distance from <span>Nevinnomyssky Azot OJSC</span> it is located, whether there is a park zone nearby.  Also, experienced tourists are advised to stay closer to the city center, since the roads here are also not of very good quality. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hotelstop.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="summer terrace" class="if uuid-2607587" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56278/2607587.jpg"></div><p>  Hotel "Green" in Nevinnomyssk is located near the center, in a quiet and peaceful place. </p><h2>  Location and features </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="44.646744" data-lng="41.928493" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/5/3/2/0/5320.png"></div><p>  The building was built near a transport stop, shops.  It consists of two buildings that are not interconnected (we will discuss them below).  The exact address of the hotel "Green": Nevinnomyssk, per.  Green, 5 (first building) and st.  Mendeleev, 52 (second building). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The hotel is positioned as 4 *, a large selection of comfortable rooms is provided for guests, guests can use the restaurant, gym, spa, parking.  In reviews of the Zelenaya Hotel in Nevinnomyssk it is noted that for a provincial hotel this is a very good option. </p><h2>  Is there a difference between the first and second building </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.com.ph" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.tripadvisor.com.ph/LocationPhotoDirectLink-g2376076-d3463511-i147188444-Green_Hotel-Nevinnomyssk_Stavropol_Krai_North_Caucasian_District.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kitchen Area" class="if uuid-2607582" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56278/2607582.jpg"></div><p>  Some inconvenience gives guests a large (about a quarter) distance between the buildings.  Switch from the second to the first for breakfast, lunch or dinner, as the restaurant is provided only in the main building.  In the second, there is a spa complex with a gym.  In addition, guests note that the number of rooms in the second building is very worn out, requiring repair, in the rooms there is not very comfortable furniture, old televisions with picture tubes.  On the other hand, all rooms (even standards) are spacious. </p><p>  It is important to pay attention to these points when booking a room, you must definitely indicate in which building you want to stay. </p><h2>  Room selection and pricing policy of the Green Hotel (Nevinnomyssk) </h2><p>  Room at the lowest cost (3000 rubles / day) can be booked in the second building.  This is standard accommodation, but a very spacious room - 45 m <sup>2</sup> .  By the way, all numbers of the second building have such an area.  Standard accommodation (single, twin or double) in the first building will cost from 4000 rubles per day, and the area of ‚Äã‚Äãsuch rooms is only 17 m2.  The most expensive rooms are suites, apartments and a junior suite (from 8000 rubles / day). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The price includes breakfast, use of the gym and parking. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hotel-green.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="junior suite" class="if uuid-2607577" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56278/2607577.jpg"></div><p>  A distinctive feature of the rooms in the hotel "Green" Nevinnomyssk is the presence in all types of accommodation of the kitchen area, which is equipped with a table, refrigerator, microwave, electric kettle and dishes.  In the bathrooms of the rooms of a higher level of comfort, instead of the usual shower cabins, there is a jacuzzi (in the standards - bathtubs).  All categories are equipped with air conditioning systems, TVs (in the first building - with a flat screen), there is access to wireless Internet, telephones. </p><p>  The Zelenaya Hotel Nevinnomyssk has a room delivery service from 7:00 to 24:00, wet cleaning is regularly carried out, bed linen and towels are replaced, and toiletries are replenished as necessary. </p><p>  You can book a room both on the official website and with partners.  The application system is quite simple, it comes down to choosing a room category, indicating the length of stay, minimum data on tourists.  In the reviews there is information that when pre-booking a room, 25% of the cost will be charged additionally from the client, however the hotel does not confirm this fact.  The payment system is the same as in most other hotels: prepayment is made to the hotel‚Äôs current account for the day of stay, the remaining amount - upon check-in. </p><h2>  What are the guests fed </h2><div class="photo" data-original="zabroniryi.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="restaurant in the first building" class="if uuid-2607581" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56278/2607581.jpg"></div><p>  The restaurant of the Green Hotel in Nevinnomyssk specializes in dishes of European and traditional cuisine.  Guests are welcome for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Morning reception is included in the price, but if you wish, you can order a comprehensive meal.  Judging by the reviews, the food here is hearty and tasty, especially the guests liked the local pastries. </p><p>  Guests can not worry that they will not be able to eat in the restaurant if a banquet is organized during their stay - there is a separate room for this.  In warm weather, there is a summer terrace near the restaurant, where you can have a very good time sitting in the fresh air surrounded by greenery. </p><p>  <span>Residents of Nevinnomyssk</span> often spend weddings, anniversaries, corporate events and other important celebrations at the hotel, use the catering service (catering for banquets on the territory of the client). </p><h2>  Spa and other services </h2><div class="photo" data-original="mybeauty.pro" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="salt cave" class="if uuid-2607584" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56278/2607584.jpg"></div><p>  Judging by the reviews of the Zelenoy Hotel in Nevinnomyssk, the local spa complex is famous throughout the city, residents often visit it.  At a professional level, clients are provided with wellness, rejuvenating and other cosmetic services, massage.  Guests can work out for free on modern simulators in the fitness center, go to the sauna, play billiards. </p><p>  For tourists traveling for business purposes, two conference rooms are equipped (with a capacity of up to 15 and up to 35 people).  Here you can hold meetings and negotiations, as well as seminars, trainings, etc. The halls provide everything you need for work: comfortable furniture, technical equipment, which includes projectors, LCD TVs, laptops and other audio and video equipment. </p><p>  Vacationers can use the laundry service, leave their car in a private parking lot, and luggage in the left-luggage offices. </p><h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  Among the negative points, one can single out unreasonably high prices, outdated rooms of the second building, not very varied breakfasts and the assortment in the restaurant menu. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tophotels.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="banqueting hall" class="if uuid-2607576" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56278/2607576.jpg"></div><p>  Positive guests of the Zelenaya Hotel in Nevinnomyssk appreciated its convenient position in a quiet and peaceful place, clean rooms, friendly staff, and a good spa complex. </p><p>  Many flattering words are written about the snow-white room of the junior suite, where many spent a romantic weekend or the first wedding night.  The guests liked the luxurious atmosphere, a four-poster bed, a jacuzzi, and the fact that they had a nice bonus from the hotel - champagne and chocolate. </p><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  Green is a good hotel with comfortable rooms and a wide range of services, but the price / quality ratio is unjustified.  Despite this, the hotel remains one of the best in the provincial Nevinnomyssk, so you should stay here for the duration of your business trip.  In any case, visiting is good, but at home it is better. </p>
