This gives additional income on tourist excursions.  In the suburbs there is such a farm.  Alpacas have been bred there for several years.  Animals here have already pleased the owners and visitors with a new generation.  Alpaca kids are very friendly and enjoy playing with visitors. </p><h2>  Where did the animals come from? </h2><p>  Young people who visited the USA on farms and saw unusual camels became interested in the issue of their breeding.  They decided to start raising alpacas on their farm.  This business can be very profitable given the proper management of the household. </p>

    <p>  These animals come from North America.  There they live in the mountains.  Alpacas are adapted to changes in temperature and tolerate heat and cold equally well.  Therefore, the movement of animals in our climate does not harm. </p><p>  Alpacas belong to the camel family.  They are smaller and lack humps.  A well-equipped farm is suitable for a comfortable life.  Alpacas cannot live alone, they definitely need a company.  Therefore, several representatives of the species live on the farm. </p><h2>  Animal characterization </h2><p>  They amaze with their pride and activity.  Despite the fact that they can be easily fed by hand, the animal will not allow itself to be stroked.  Alpaca has teeth in the lower jaw only, so they cannot bite.  But with discontent or aggression, these animals can spit the offender perfectly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Alpaca is bred on farms to produce wool.  It is very warm and does not absorb moisture.  Animals of this species do not sweat, which means they do not have an unpleasant smell, therefore threads from this wool are very valuable and in demand on the market. </p>

    <p>  The farm should take care of timely trimming.  Alpaca is annually trimmed in May by special large electric cars. </p><h2>  Where is the farm </h2><p>  Animal breeding began in 2012.  Everyone knew that this alpaca farm was located in Khimki.  Groups of tourists from all over the region came here.  Often arranged large excursions for students on vacation. </p><p>  Alpaca Farm in Kurkino was a favorite destination for kids and adults.  But due to unpleasant circumstances with the redistribution of land, the owners urgently had to look for a new place for their pets to live.  In April 2017, one alpaca died when moving.  The farm in the suburbs remained and only moved to Dmitrovsky district. </p>

    <p>  Now the village of Pokhodkino has become a new home for animals.  In a short time with the help of volunteers and ordinary people, new houses and animal enclosures were built.  High fences were erected on the farm to protect the animals from the attack of stray dogs. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Farm Tours </h2><p>  Alpaca breeders are very fond of their pets and created comfortable conditions for them.  In a new place, they tried to maintain the atmosphere that the alpaca farm in Kurkino had. </p><p>  Large animals are built for animals with a wooden fence for walking.  There are also small houses in which alpacas can hide from heat or frost.  Animals come here infrequently, and are mostly on the street. </p><p>  During the tour, visitors can feed their pets with chopped vegetables and chat with them.  Guests are allowed to enter the enclosures.  Alpaca - animals are non-aggressive and do not bring harm to people. </p><h2>  What else can be seen on the farm </h2><p>  The hosts also breed several types of rabbits.  They are in cages in the yard and can also be fed.  Such communication is very popular with young children.  Excursions show how animal hair is processed.  You can also see how the threads are spinning, and evaluate things connected from this yarn. </p><p>  Visitors to the farm during the visit are watered with delicious herbal tea with unusual desserts.  The tour is designed for one hour.  Visitors can linger and chat with alpacas for longer.  Alpaca Farm in Khimki is always happy for new guests. </p>

    <p>  Here you can take pictures with animals.  The main task of the tourist remains to "catch" the alpaca near him, so that it gets into the frame.  They do not like close communication, but they are ready to even play with guests in the mood. </p><h2>  Visitors reviews </h2><p>  Russian alpacas have a funny appearance, and tourists often cannot help but smile.  Animals charge positive for a long time all visitors to the farm, despite their age. </p><p>  Guests note that order reigns in the territory, the owners greet each group with mood and goodwill.  Tourists do not really like the mode of operation of the farm.  Visitors are accepted only on weekends or holidays.  On the tour you need to arrange in advance by phone.  All numbers are on the official website of the farm. </p>

    <p>  Adult tourists must pay 500 rubles for admission.  Children's ticket (up to 7 years) will cost 100 rubles.  Prices may vary due to higher feed prices and equipment maintenance.  At the entrance, guests are given bags with chopped apples and carrots.  Brought food to feed animals is prohibited. </p><p>  Tourists are somewhat upset that the farm was moved.  Alpacas love constancy, and such stress can harm their health.  But regular visitors began to come here more often to help arrange a new place. </p><p>  The owners reassure everyone who is worried and report that the new farm will be even more spacious, and guests, as before, will be able to come to chat with animals.  To visit the farm, you need to call the phone number listed on the site and arrange with the owners.  They form groups of 6-10 people.  Tourists can leave wishes regarding the day and time, and the owners will try to fulfill the application. </p>
