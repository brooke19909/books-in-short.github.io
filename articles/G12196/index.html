Types, classes and application of integrated amplifiers</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Anyone who understands at least something in the world of sound should be aware that without a high-quality amplifier, there can be no talk of any good sound.  A user may have a speaker system worth several thousand dollars, a vinyl player and a top-end CD player.  But without a good amplifier, this whole system is useless.  Therefore, integrated amplifiers are needed.  What it is?  Let's try to figure this out.  But first, let's understand this: amplifiers are divided into integrated, two-block and three-block.  But the first ones are the most common.  They can be easily used in any conditions and do not take up much space.  Because they are so popular. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.adverts.ie" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="integrated amplifier what is it" class="if uuid-3027485" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3027485.jpg"></div><h2>  What is an integrated amplifier? </h2><p>  So, what is an integrated amplifier.  This is a device for amplifying sound, which includes a preamplifier, distributor and the power amplifier itself.  All this is integrated into one housing (and therefore integrated), in contrast to two-unit and three-unit systems.  Amplifiers of this type can provide high power density and fairly high-quality sound.  At the moment, these are the most common devices.  It is understandable.  They are much more convenient to use in homes, offices and apartments.  Integrated amplifiers have their own categories: "A", "B", "AB", "C" and so on. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The highest (and most difficult) is considered category "A".  These devices have unrivaled sound quality and are very expensive.  But not as expensive as their two-block and three-block ‚Äúcolleagues‚Äù (which became the lot of professionals and audiophiles).  According to the type of power supply, amplifiers with an integrated unit and models with an external power supply unit (which is located outside the case) are distinguished.  The second option, of course, produces a cleaner sound (in theory), but with it more fuss.  Therefore, most prefer amplifiers with a built-in power supply.  Now consider the main categories of integrated amplifiers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.jims-sae-site.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="integrated amplifiers reviews" class="if uuid-3027486" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3027486.jpg"></div><h2>  Categorization by category </h2><p>  Classes of integrated amplifiers we have already considered.  Now it is worth paying attention to the main categories of these devices.  There are only three of them.  And they differ in the type of components used.  Naturally, the sound quality is different in each category.  So, here are what types of integrated amplifiers are currently available: </p><ul><li>  Tube  According to many, it is these amplifiers that produce the cleanest, highest quality and "correct" sound.  Their total power cannot be high.  And they are very expensive, since their main component is expensive lamps. </li><li>  Transistor  Here, transistors are responsible for amplifying sound.  They can provide high power density and very good sound quality.  It is these models that are most popular at present. </li><li>  Hybrid.  These devices combine several elements: lamps and transistors.  The former are responsible for the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù and high-quality sound, while the latter enhance it. </li></ul><p>  It is these types of integrated amplifiers that currently exist.  The integrated amplifier circuit, whatever type it may be, suggests that all its components are enclosed in one enclosure.  This is the main feature of this type of device.  However, there are still such things as receivers, which are also formally considered amplifiers.  But they have certain differences. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Many users do not understand the difference between amplifiers and receivers.  Moreover, they believe that these are the same devices.  Yes, they are both designed to amplify the signal.  But the circuit diagram of the devices and their filling is fundamentally different.  In order to realize this fact, users need to explain what exactly are receivers and how they differ from amplifiers.  This will be discussed in the next chapter.  Let's start with the most noticeable differences, and then move on to the less obvious things. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hifishock.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="integrated amplifier circuit" class="if uuid-3027487" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3027487.jpg"></div><h2>  Amplifier and receiver.  What is the difference? </h2><p>  The integrated amplifier and receiver are fundamentally different devices.  The AV receiver is not just for signal amplification.  Although such an option is in his arsenal.  But it also includes a separate DAC for audio processing and has a built-in tuner.  But most importantly, the receiver is designed to amplify 6 or 7 channels (depending on configuration), and the amplifier works with only two channels.  And this is the main difference.  It is also worth noting the difference in price.  Since the receiver has a huge number of high-tech components, it will be much more expensive than an integrated amplifier of the same class.  Nevertheless, receivers are actively purchased to install a home theater system.  For this, such devices are perfectly suited.  But in terms of providing high-quality stereo sound, they are not very.  Here the leaders are integrated amplifiers.  Now let's look at some of the most interesting models of integrated amplifiers and see what users say about them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.hifihut.ie" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="integrated amplifier characteristics" class="if uuid-3027489" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3027489.jpg"></div><h2>  Marantz PM 5005 </h2><p>  Probably the most affordable integrated amplifier.  Its characteristics are such that it can freely provide high-quality sound at a decent volume.  The power of the amplifier is 40 watts per channel.  It is worth paying attention to the fact that these watts are relatively "honest".  This means that the power of the amplifier is enough to sound quite impressive in terms of volume of the room.  This integrated amplifier can reproduce frequencies from 10 to 50,000 hertz.  If only the columns were appropriate.  By the way, 40 watts is by no means the maximum power.  Its amplifier gives out when working with a resistance of 8 ohms.  But if you switch to acoustics with a resistance of 4 ohms, then the power will increase to 55 watts.  And this is serious. </p><p>  In this model there is also a phono stage for listening to music on vinyl records.  As we know, for this type of source, phono correction is a must.  Gold-plated RCA connectors for connecting various sound sources point to a high-end device.  Themselves connectors for connecting speakers are made in the form of terminals.  Which also indicates a high status of the product.  In general, the question of how to connect an integrated amplifier, in the case of Marantz, is irrelevant.  Everything is extremely simple here.  Now consider the comments of the owners of this miracle of technology. </p><h2>  Marantz PM 5005 Reviews </h2><p>  So what do users say about the Marantz PM 5005?  According to reviews, the integrated amplifier is distinguished by excellent technical characteristics and an adequate price tag.  The owners of this wonderful device say that it provides very high-quality sound.  Of course, he is far from equipment for tens of thousands of dollars, but he is not intended for this.  And this integrated amplifier copes with its task perfectly.  Listeners noted crystal clear sound, deep and well-designed low frequencies, a correct and deep scene, a clear balance of frequencies at medium, low and high levels.  The Marantz Integrated Amplifier circuit is ridiculously simple.  Some users even managed to fix some not very complex damage.  People say that a simple circuit is good, because the simpler the technique, the better it is.  Doubtful statement, but the equipment from "Marants" is really very high quality.  There is not a single negative review about this amplifier. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.arcam.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="integrated circuit amplifiers" class="if uuid-3027490" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3027490.jpg"></div><h2>  Arcam FMJ A19 </h2><p>  But this thing is more serious.  This integrated amplifier (what it is, we already know) belongs to the middle price category and class ‚ÄúB‚Äù.  This small-looking amplifier is capable of delivering 90 watts of power per channel.  This is quite enough for a house and an apartment.  Even a small room can be voiced with this device.  However, do not forget about other components of appropriate quality.  The frequency range starts at around 20 hertz, and ends at 20,000 hertz.  An excellent indicator for an amplifier integrated circuits.  A feature of this amplifier is the presence of a trained remote control.  But the main thing is the sound.  The amplifier delivers deep and clear sound with an excellent scene.  In terms of sound quality, it corresponds to more expensive models.  At the same time, it boasts a record low dynamic distortion (compared to other equipment of this class).  This amplifier requires a speaker system with a nominal impedance of 8 or 4 ohms.  Only then can maximum power and quality be achieved.  And what do users say about this device?  Let's see. </p><h2>  Arcam FMJ A19 reviews </h2><p>  We continue to consider the most interesting integrated amplifiers.  Arcam reviews are mixed.  But the positive is much more than the negative.  Therefore, let's start with them.  According to the owners, the amplifier does an excellent job of playing classical music and instrumental genres (like classic rock).  It provides the full depth of the stage, competently arranges frequencies and has an excellent power reserve.  Complete with high-quality speakers capable of showing real miracles.  Also, the owners note that the design of this amplifier is very successful.  It has a very compact size (for a device of this class) and fits perfectly into almost any interior.  The Arcam integrated amplifier circuitry looks pretty simple. </p><div class="photo" data-original="jam-media.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="integrated amplifier circuit" class="if uuid-3028053" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/3028053.jpg"></div><p>  Its design minimizes dynamic distortion and provides crystal clear sound.  This is what many users like.  However, at the same time, the owners note that the genres of electronic music are given to the amplifier with difficulty.  Affects the lack of low frequencies.  Rap, hip-hop, electronic music and pop are clearly not his genres.  Also, some users do not like the price of the device.  Many people think that such an amplifier should be cheaper. </p><h2>  PrimaLuna DiaLogue Premium HP Int </h2><p>  High-end tube integrated amplifier from PrimaLuna.  It has excellent sound quality and chic appearance.  This amplifier belongs to the category of hybrid and has a class "A".  However, this pleasure is very expensive.  The device has excellent technical characteristics. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.analogueseduction.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tube integrated amplifier" class="if uuid-3027492" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3027492.jpg"></div><p>  The power of the amplifier is 84 watts per channel.  This is an excellent result for an apparatus whose design includes lamps.  The range of reproduced frequencies is unusually wide.  It starts at around 7 hertz and ends at 75,000 hertz.  This means that the device is capable of producing extremely high-quality sound.  Therefore, the price is so high.  By the way, among the connectors for connecting the speaker system there is a special gold-plated RCA, designed to connect a subwoofer (subwoofer).  It allows you to achieve high-quality and deep bass.  Woofers on ordinary speakers will not be able to reflect the entire depth of the bass transmitted by this amplifier.  Therefore, a special connector was needed.  However, what do those who purchase it say about the amplifier?  Let's see.  Although there are not many of them (considering its price). </p><h2>  PrimaLuna DiaLogue Premium HP Int Reviews </h2><p>  So, we are considering an operational amplifier whose integrated circuit is very complex.  However, according to user reviews, it was such a complexity of the circuit that made it possible to achieve the highest sound quality. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.customav.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Scheme PrimaLuna DiaLogue Premium HP Int" class="if uuid-3028059" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/3028059.jpg"></div><p>  Users note that the amplifier delivers unrivaled sound.  Everything is clearly balanced, there is an excellent depth of stage, an excellent study of high and medium.  But at the same time there is a full and deep bass.  And from the sound it blows "analogy".  The owners claim that it is most logical to listen to vinyl on such an amplifier.  It is with its help that you can achieve a chic sound.  The owners also noticed that this modern integrated amplifier has virtually no background and distortion.  Here it is - lamp technology.  Even the presence of transistors in the kit does not affect the sound.  Another feature relates to the appearance of the device.  Lamps burn so that they give the device its unique charm.  In general, this amplifier is ideal for those who want to get the cleanest sound with the right frequencies and a very deep scene.  All this given integrated amplifier provides.  He has only one drawback: a very high price.  But it is worth every penny spent. </p><h2>  Verdict </h2><p>  So, we have figured out what it means to "integrated amplifier".  Now you know exactly what it is, what they are and what types are divided.  We also reviewed the most interesting and popular models from existing on the market.  The list includes both classic entry-level amplifiers and top-end hybrid models (using lamps).  On the recommendations for the purchase is no question.  For the budget level, its recommendations, but for the premium - completely different.  But the point in both cases is the same - to provide high-quality sound.  However, it is worth noting that it will be achievable only if the remaining components of the system are at the proper level.  There must be high-quality wires with gold-plated connectors, high-quality speakers that can reproduce the frequency range that is available to the amplifier.  It is also necessary to attend to a high-quality sound source.  In this role, a mid-level vinyl player can play.  An average CD player is also suitable.  A computer or laptop with a dedicated sound card will also be nice.  Only if all these conditions are met can high-quality sound be achieved.  Otherwise, you should not even try.  Anyway, even if you attach a good amplifier to a computer with a built-in sound card, the result will be obvious.  However, to summarize. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  We looked at devices such as integrated amplifiers.  What is it - everyone already understands.  I would just like to add that such devices belong to the class of complex technical devices.  They contain high-tech and expensive components.  Therefore, the price of them is often quite high.  However, those who want to hear a truly high-quality sound should understand that a good device is expensive.  A cheap amplifier will not give the pleasure of sound that an expensive one can give.  Therefore, you do not need to look at the price.  The main thing here is the technical specifications.  And only they decide how high-quality the sound will be.  It is worth remembering that a good amplifier will under no circumstances be cheap. </p>
