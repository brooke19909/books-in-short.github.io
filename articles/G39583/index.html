Even not all those who often happen to be in the city on the Neva can boast that they know the way there.  And this place is very interesting, and it’s worth visiting at least once in your life.  <span>The fortified city of Kronstadt</span> is located on the island of Kotlin in the Gulf of Finland.  It was founded in 1703 by Peter the Great and was designed to protect the new Russian capital from invasion from the sea.  The city was formed on the island, in conditions of some isolation from the outside world.  And this is due to his completely unlike appearance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get to kronstadt" class="if" height="329" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/241384.jpg" width="490"></div>

    <p>  How to get to Kronstadt </p><p>  Once it was not so simple, but today the situation has radically changed.  After the construction of the dam across the Gulf of Finland and the opening of through traffic on it, the isolation of Kotlin Island was over.  And the question of how to get to Kronstadt began to come down to which direction it is more convenient for you to come from, from the north or from the south.  That is, in which part of the city you are located, from which direction you are approaching it along the ring road, bypassing the city.  An integral part of this ring road is the dam passing through the island of Kotlin. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Petersburg kronstadt how to get" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/241382.jpg" width="492"></div>  If you entered the ring road south of the Cable-stayed Bridge across the Neva, then you should steer in the direction of the southern half-ring of the dam and the tunnel under the bay.  And, accordingly, north of the Cable-stayed Bridge, the path to Kronstadt will be shorter through the northern detour of the city.  It should be noted that the southern route is preferable - there is less traffic there, most of the freight transport follows in transit along the northern bypass of the city.  And if you do not have your own car, then there is nothing easier than to get to Kronstadt by shuttle bus.  You can make such a trip from several points of the city, prices range from 18 to 45 rubles, depending on the distance to the final stop of the route.  The easiest way to take a minibus at the final stop at the metro station "Black River".  The city bus of route 101 also goes to <span>Kotlin Island</span> , it leaves from the <span>Staraya Derevnya metro station</span> with an interval of 15 minutes to half an hour, the fare is 18 rubles, and the journey takes about an hour.  The bus is usually full of people, it is preferable to use a fixed-route taxi. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kronstadt how to get there by water" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/241378.jpg" width="499"></div>

    <p>  On the Neva in Kronstadt.  How to get to Kotlin Island by water </p><p>  And sometimes it’s interesting to remember a story, especially when there’s nowhere to rush.  The young generation of Petersburg residents no longer remembers that once there were no options how to overcome the <span>St. Petersburg-Kronshtadt</span> route <span>.</span>  How to get there, the question did not arise - only on a boat and nothing else.  But you can do it today, such an excursion will be very interesting and informative.  Since 2009, one of the five city water taxi routes has been operating in the direction of Kronstadt.  But the profitability of water transport is a big question.  With a ticket price of 200 rubles, most tourists use it.  In addition, this type of transport simply ceases to function in stormy weather. </p>
