  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Slavic communities in Russia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The origin of the ancient Slavs is still in question.  These people fill a large space on Earth, but it is still impossible to determine the place of occurrence.  One of the reasons is the absence of any mention of the people and Slavic communities until the VI century BC.  e. </p><h2>  The origin of the communities </h2><p>  The Slavic peoples include Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, Czechs, Poles, Bulgarians, Slovaks, Croats, Gascons, Slovenes, Serbs.  For a long time there were tribes of Slavs who lived in Europe, Asia, Africa, but they moved or were destroyed. </p><p>  The most popular version is that the Slavs descended from the Aryans.  They came to Europe during the Great Migration.  But by coincidence, the Slavs broke away from the German community and were surrounded by eastern peoples.  And their development lagged behind other civilizations. </p><p>  According to another version, Slavic communities broke away from the Roman Empire and fought with almost all the peoples in Europe. </p><p>  It is difficult to determine when the Slavs became a single people, but archaeologists indicate that they belonged to the Indo-European community, the influence of the Slavic culture spread from the Vistula to the Urals. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="statues of the Slavs" class="if uuid-3079842" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88830/3079842.jpg"></div><h2>  Resettlement </h2><p>  Numerous tribes inhabited eastern Europe.  Over time, the eastern, western and southern tribes appeared.  The Eastern Slavic community is located between the Carpathian mountains, the Oka and Volga rivers.  From north to south, their territory was located between the Ladoga and Black Seas.  Eastern Slavs became the founders of the Russian, Belarusian and Ukrainian peoples. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Western Slavs occupied the basins of the Vistula and Laba rivers.  The communities were divided into tribes of Czechs, Poles, Moravians, Slovaks, Slavs, and Pomeranians.  All tribes were the ancestors of modern Polish, Czech and Slovak people. </p><p>  From Central Europe, the Slavs moved to the south.  Gradually occupied the entire Balkan Peninsula, so a community of southern Slavs arose.  They became the ancestors of the Serbs, Slovenes, Montenegrins, Croats, Bulgarians and Macedonians. </p><h2>  Community life </h2><p>  In all ancient Slavic communities, words meaning household items, crafts, tools sound the same.  The ancient Slavs, living at a great distance, understood each other.  All of them were engaged in hunting, farming, raised domestic animals, lived in villages. </p><p>  In peacetime, the Slavs were famous for hospitality, gladly exchanged overseas goods for fur, leather, pottery.  When the nomads attacked, they confidently repelled the attack, were famous for martial art.  Pulling the enemy deep into their territories, the Slavs suddenly appeared from shelters and destroyed the enemy army. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow community" class="if uuid-3079799" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88830/3079799.jpg"></div><p>  Due to difficult climatic conditions, a person could not survive alone.  Inside the community, family and neighbors needed help.  Together they built houses, hunted, raised cattle.  Human belonging to the community was achieved by joint labor and ceremonial activities, which was mandatory for everyone. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Forms of mutual assistance in ancient Slavic communities are associated with the mythological world of ancient people.  The presence of amulets was mandatory.  An object or plant was used as protection.  A large number of holidays among the Slavs is associated with the distribution of surplus from the table.  Thus, equality was established in the community.  Those who had little food received enough of it.  The family looked after the old man, and if she was not there, then the community took responsibility.  Orphans were in the care of the community.  They could move from one family to another.  Or be adopted by one family, more often lonely old people. </p><h2>  The social system of the Slavs </h2><p>  The Slavs lived in a primitive communal system, with the elders at the head of the community.  In the VI century, tribal communities began to turn into families.  All had one ancestor.  But community representatives were considered distant relatives.  The family lived in a large house or group of buildings standing nearby. </p><p>  Common ownership of property, joint work, cultivation of the land are a characteristic feature of the Slavic community.  War and resettlement led to the fact that non-related residents began to appear within the community.  Several communities were united in a tribe.  The leaders of the tribes gathered at the veche, discussed issues of war and peace.  Between the tribes, military operations were conducted.  The captives became slaves.  Slavery lasted several years, and then the prisoner was released. </p><p>  The military leaders, having a squad, subordinated to themselves the heads of the communities and ruled, disregarding the opinion of the veche.  The Slavs called this form of government a principality.  Princes passed power by inheritance.  Some captured several tribes at once, expanding the borders of their lands.  The people‚Äôs rights became less and less, the primitive communal system was degenerated into a feudal one. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="archaeologynewsnetwork.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="idols of the ancient Slavs" class="if uuid-3079828" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88830/3079828.jpg"></div><h2>  Slavic communities in Russia </h2><p>  In Russia, there are 300-400 organizations that can be attributed to the community.  Typically, an organization is a religious movement that numbers up to 30 people. </p><p>  Slavic communities in Russia are divided into Moscow and provincial.  Moscow pay more attention to the ideology of neopaganism and propaganda, in the province people are more interested in the ethnographic part of the Slavic culture. </p><p>  The main direction of the communities is the education of the younger generation.  Active participants arrange holidays, recreate costumes, organize amateur groups.  Build forms of mutual assistance based on community principles. </p><p>  Interaction between communities is poorly developed.  The Orthodox community does not pay attention to the creation of Slavic communities, it inhibits their development. </p><div class="photo" data-original="canacopegdl.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Obninsk community" class="if uuid-3079802" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88830/3079802.jpg"></div><h2>  The modern community of the native faith </h2><p>  The largest association of neopagans is the Union of Slavic Communities.  The organization appeared in 1997.  It included the Moscow, Kaluga and Obninsk communities.  The head was Vadim Stanislavovich Kazakov. </p><p>  Each year, the community discusses an action plan to expand its size and cooperation with other organizations.  Such meetings are called veche.  They choose the head of the union and the high priest.  The veche is attended by over 100 representatives of various Slavic communities of Russia. </p><p>  In 2014, the community officially registered as a public organization for the support and development of Slavic culture.  The organization bought a plot of land for the construction of a Slavic temple in the Kaluga region.  In 2015, the opening of the ritual construction of the Temple of Fire Svarozhich.  It is difficult for an outsider to get into the temple. </p><h2>  The ideology of the modern community </h2><p>  The ideology of the Slavic community of the native faith is based on customs and traditions.  The organization is active not only in Russia, but also collaborates with communities of other European countries, whose ancestors were Slavs. </p><p>  According to studies conducted in 2016, 1.5% of Russians profess the religion of their ancestors and call themselves pagans.  It should be noted that this percentage includes the indigenous peoples of Altai, Yakutia and other regions where they always lived according to the traditions of their ancestors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.meettheslavs.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Shrovetide in Russia" class="if uuid-3079795" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88830/3079795.jpg"></div><p>  Rites are held within the Union of Slavic Communities, which may differ from similar events of like-minded people.  The main holidays of the Slavs are Kolyada, Kupala, Komoeditsa and Tausen.  On other holidays, outsiders are usually forbidden. </p><p>  Each community has its own symbolism and temple - places where rituals are held.  To do this, clear the site in a clearing or in the forest, put the idols of the Gods or build a pagan structure. </p><p>  In May 2012, the Union of Slavic Communities was recognized as pseudoscientific and harmful to culture. </p><h2>  Tasks of the community of the native faith </h2><p>  The leaders of the community of the native faith set themselves the task of observing and enhancing the cultural values ‚Äã‚Äãof the peoples of Russia: </p><ul><li>  customs study; </li><li>  the spread of cultural, spiritual and moral customs of the Slavic peoples; </li><li>  spiritual development of the younger generation; </li><li>  physical recovery of the Slavic ethnic group; </li><li>  informing the population about Slavic customs; </li><li>  education on crafts and crafts of ancestors; </li><li>  folk arts training; </li><li>  public education through the media; </li><li>  interaction with local authorities and other public organizations. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.forumbiodiversity.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Women among the Slavs" class="if uuid-3079813" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88830/3079813.jpg"></div><p>  Based on these principles, the Union of Slavic Communities issues a periodical printed publication on the traditions and culture of the ancient Slavs.  Distance learning was organized for people wishing to study the archeology and folklore of the ancient Slavs.  Like-minded people reconstruct costumes, holidays, study shrines. </p><p>  The life of the Slavic community promotes healthy lifestyle and outdoor activities.  The basis of the modern community is sports and labor education of children. </p><p>  Since 2014, the Union of Slavic Communities began to cooperate with power structures at various levels.  The organization supports traditional Slavic martial arts and folklore groups. </p><div class="photo" data-original="homesecurity.press" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="costumes of the Slavs" class="if uuid-3079811" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88830/3079811.jpg"></div><h2>  Community structure of the native faith </h2><p>  The leader of the Slavic community of the native faith is elected on the day of Ivan Kupala once a year at the veche.  On the same day, the head of the priestly council is elected.  Within the union, there are departments engaged in certain activities - interacting with the media, propaganda on the Internet, and public relations. </p><p>  The structure includes the Moscow communities "Holy Priest" and "Circle of Vyatichi."  The Union of Slavic Communities also includes Kaluga, Oryol, Stavropol, Anapa, Ozerskaya, Smolenskaya, Tambov and many others. </p>
