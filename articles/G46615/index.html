This issue is most important for many owners of real estate, as laws often change and tariffs are systematically raised.  There is also dishonesty of various companies.  In order to pay the bills correctly and not overpay, you need to know the principle of calculating the rent. </p><div class="photo" data-original="motaen.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rent calculation" class="if uuid-2830035" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2830035.jpg"></div><h2>  Rent </h2><p>  The owner has an obligation to pay the rent immediately after the acquisition of housing.  A person enters into an agreement with a service provider (for example, water, electricity), as well as with a company that maintains communications in good condition. </p><h2>  Calculation of the commission according to the number of registered people living, as well as depending on the area </h2><p>  The calculation of the rent by the number of registered people is carried out using the average rates.  The list of such norms includes: garbage collection, water disposal, hot and cold water, electricity, as well as gas.  The last three items will be included in the list of norms if the owner does not have meters.  If you install the counters, then in the future the costs will be significantly reduced.  If the norms depend on the number of people, then the calculation of the rent will be carried out from the number of people registered in this territory, regardless of how many live in the apartment.  That is, two people can be registered in the apartment, but actually three people live.  Payment will be made for two people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If the norms depend on the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe apartment, then the data is used: </p><ul><li>  house maintenance; </li><li>  heating; </li><li>  repairs; </li><li>  common house needs. </li></ul><p>  Payment for intercom, radio and landline telephone is not included in this receipt and is paid separately. </p><p>  How is rent calculated in Moscow?  In this city, most apartment buildings have more than eleven floors.  By technical characteristics, such houses are not gasified.  They use electricity.  Electricity tariffs vary by region.  The capital has the highest tariff.  Therefore, the amount of rent in Moscow will be greater compared to other cities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pixabay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where to apply for the calculation of rent" class="if uuid-2830039" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2830039.jpg"></div><h2>  Payment </h2><p>  How is the rent calculated in the apartment?  In order to check the actions of utilities, you need to know the accrual principle, as well as the tariffs used.  Current rates must be reflected in the receipt.  If the owner could not find information about them, then he can use the website of a particular company that provides services.  You can also seek advice in the office of the company. </p><h2>  Example </h2><p>  There is a slight difference during the calculation of the payment on the meter and the number of registered people. </p><p>  Calculation of the rent based on tariffs for certain types of services: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  maintenance - 25 rubles 37 kopecks per square meter; </li><li>  the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe apartment is 42 square meters. </li></ul><p>  The total amount will be 1065 rubles 54 kopecks.  How is the rent calculated by the number of registered people?  For calculation use the norms that are established in the region of the country. </p><ul><li>  Water separation - 18.66 per cubic meter. </li><li>  Use per person - 4.2 per cubic meter. </li></ul><p>  If only one person is registered in the apartment, the rent will be 78 rubles 37 kopecks.  The calculation method will be different if the owner has installed a meter.  For example, the water tariff was 15 rubles per cubic meter, consumption - 9 cubic meters.  A receipt in the amount of 135 rubles will come to payment. </p><p>  How is rent calculated in Moscow?  The cost of housing in the capital is much higher compared to other cities.  Also in the capital there is a principle of price containment.  But despite this, tariffs in Moscow are much higher in comparison with other settlements.  The principle of calculating rents remains the same throughout the country. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.propsocial.my" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how is the rent calculated" class="if uuid-2830033" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2830033.jpg"></div><h2>  Calculation method on the official website </h2><p>  How is the rent calculated on the official website of the Federal Tariff Service?  In order to get an exact answer on payment, you need to go to the official website of the institution, find the tab ‚ÄúCalculator‚Äù.  You need to enter all your data into it: tariffs, housing area, number of registered people, consumption by meter.  The resulting amount can be verified with that indicated on the receipt.  If there is a significant difference in the amounts, then the homeowner will be able to present calculations from the official website as evidence of fraud by the management company. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Wrong rent calculation </h2><p>  When the owners begin to make an independent calculation, they notice that sometimes companies show them the wrong amount in receipts.  Sometimes companies intentionally collect money from owners to pay for non-existent services.  For example, for cleaning the entrance, if the owners carry out cleaning on their own.  Where to apply for rent calculation?  Any owner has the right to file a complaint.  But before that it is necessary to recalculate payments and make sure that you are right. </p><ul><li>  Settlement centers for utility bills.  In this organization, employees will advise and also advise on all applicable tariffs. </li><li>  Management companies.  This organization is an intermediary and will be able to help in this matter. </li><li>  Hot line.  You can call the hotline for rent in order to clarify the principle of calculation, as well as to complain about service providers. </li><li>  Housing Inspectorate.  This organization deals with customer complaints. </li><li>  Rospotrebnadzor also deals with issues of poor-quality service to companies. </li><li>  Prosecutor's office.  After receiving a complaint from the owner, the prosecutor‚Äôs office will check the actions of the company, and if illegal actions are detected, an order will be sent. </li><li>  A court is the last resort that a homeowner can appeal to.  He may file a claim.  But in order to prove the illegality of the company, the owner must have significant arguments. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="clipart-library.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How is rent calculated in Moscow?" class="if uuid-2830036" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2830036.jpg"></div><h2>  Availability of counters </h2><p>  How is the rent calculated if the homeowner has installed meters at home?  Initially, it is necessary to monitor their evidence.  In order to pay the rent, the owner must submit the meter data every month, always at the same time.  Usually, everyone takes testimony in the last days of the month.  In order to find out the amount of payment, you need to calculate the difference between the readings of the previous and current months.  The resulting difference should be multiplied by the tariff set in the region. </p><p>  Usually, the use of counters is the most profitable, since the data on it are less than the calculations according to the norm per person.  Payment can be made using meters for these types of services: cold and hot water, electricity, heating, gas.  To date, electricity meters are necessarily installed at the stage of construction of the building.  Also required are water meters.  For other types of services, their availability is not necessary, but if desired, residents can install them.  Specialists come to the apartment to check their health.  This procedure occurs systematically. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rd.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The rent, what you have to pay" class="if uuid-2830037" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2830037.jpg"></div><h2>  Payout amount </h2><p>  The calculation of the calculation of the rent depends on several indicators - this is the tariff that is used in this region, the square area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe apartment, standards.  In order to determine the most profitable option for yourself, you need to find out what affects the amount increase in various calculation options.  The impact is provided by the tariff for a particular type of service.  This rate is set by the supplier company.  The value depends on the difficulty of obtaining resources, as well as the method of home delivery and the quality of communication.  When calculating the area, the quadrature indicator is important.  The greater the value of the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe owner, the more you have to pay.  In some regions, the rules for calculating rents allow for differences in tariffs for meters and standards.  But even if in the region tariffs on meters are higher, the fee will still be lower compared to the use of standards. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.singertexas.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Apartment rent" class="if uuid-2830032" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2830032.jpg"></div><h2>  The dependence of the quarterly fee on the number of people </h2><p>  Earlier it was written that there is an option for calculating the rent using the number of registered people.  The more people registered, the more tax you have to pay.  Therefore, for most people, the registration address does not coincide with the place of actual residence.  In areas, tariffs for the number of people are usually lower than in cities. </p><h2>  No one in the apartment is registered </h2><p>  What does the rent consist of if no one is registered in the apartment?  Even if no one is registered in the apartment, receipts will come to the landlord.  And payments calculated on the basis of the area will not depend on people, and the amount will not change.  The same applies to payments that are calculated using counters.  But the amount of payments depending on registered people will be zero. </p><h2>  Payments if no one lives in the apartment </h2><p>  How is the rent calculated if no one lives in the apartment?  Initially, the owner must prove that no one lives in the apartment.  And for this it is necessary to issue a certificate in the housing office.  Also, if the owner registered in the apartment, but actually lives in another place, then you need to submit a document that can confirm this.  It is worth noting that the document confirming the information that no one lives in the apartment must be updated every six months.  Since the certificate is valid only six months.  But the tax, which depends on the square meters of the apartment, will not change.  Payments on the counters will be equal to zero, since no one will use various resources.  Payments, which are calculated based on the number of people, will be zero. </p><div class="photo" data-original="interactive.khaleejtimes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rental charge" class="if uuid-2830038" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2830038.jpg"></div><h2>  Lack of counters </h2><p>  If the apartment does not have meters, then the calculation of the rent is based on standards that are multiplied by the number of registered people.  In this case, payment will be made regardless of how much in reality the various resources were used.  Typically, the amount received in this embodiment is much higher than the actual price. </p><h2>  Payments in a communal apartment </h2><p>  The calculation of rent in communal apartments has its own characteristics.  The tax, which depends on the quadrature, is calculated separately for each room.  Also, electricity meters should be installed on all rooms separately.  Owners of communal apartments must pay for <span>common areas.</span>  The amount of payment will be divided among the owners proportionally, depending on the share.  And the use of water and electricity in the common room is calculated separately and divided equally.  Thus, each owner pays a certain part of the total tax. </p><h2>  List of services on receipt </h2><p>  Typically, the owner of real estate receives several receipts every month.  The number of receipts depends on how many companies conclude a use agreement directly with the owner or with the management organization.  It is more convenient for the homeowner to receive one receipt and pay all expenses with its help.  But some supplier companies do not cooperate with management organizations due to distrust.  Therefore, owners have to pay a few receipts. </p><h2>  Payments in new buildings </h2><p>  Who should pay the bills in new buildings?  When the house is still under construction, the developer must pay all incoming bills.  After the house was taken into operation, the developer also continues to pay tax.  But as soon as they buy apartments in the house, the owner has an obligation to pay bills.  This obligation comes from the moment of signing the agreement on the sale of real estate.  The obligation arises regardless of whether the new owner lives in the apartment or not.  The amount of payment can be reduced by submitting certain information. </p><h2>  Penny </h2><p>  Penalty is a fine that accrues to the owner due to unpaid bills on time.  The delay begins on the next day by which the payment was due. </p><p>  How is interest on rent calculated?  The fine is 1/300 of the total refinancing rate of the Central Bank of the country.  If payments have not been received within four months, then the penalty will be 1/170 of the rate.  Rates should be specified on the official website of the Central Bank, as they vary.  Typically, a fine is charged for each overdue month.  It will be possible to stop the penalty only if the debt is fully paid off. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the penalty is not an obligation for the supplier company.  Penalty is his right.  That is, companies may not accrue it.  Of course, they will not refuse additional profit in the form of a fine.  If a person has a life circumstance due to which he cannot pay in full, then he must contact the office of the company with a statement of delay or installment plan.  Cases can only be respectful.  For example, the birth of a child, the loss of a breadwinner, dismissal, illness and so on. </p><h2>  Subsidies </h2><p>  The country's legislation allows citizens to apply for a subsidy on a rent.  But this service is not provided for everyone.  The list of citizens who can receive the subsidy is presented below: </p><ul><li>  owners; </li><li>  persons who live in buildings owned by the state fund; </li><li>  persons who rent a house, while it is necessary to submit a lease; </li><li>  persons living in a cooperative. </li></ul><p>  How is the rent subsidy calculated?  For the possibility of granting subsidies, they use information about the income of the whole family, information about whether the property is owned or not, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe apartment, the costs of maintaining the building.  After reviewing all the documentation, the employees will decide on the appointment or refusal of the subsidy.  A positive decision is made if the payment for utilities is more than 22% of the total family income.  For example, if the total income in a family is 30,000 rubles, and the rent costs 7,000 rubles or more, the subsidy will be approved. </p><p>  How is the amount of the subsidy for the rent calculated?  For calculation, the formula is used.  Grant amount = minimum tax payment - family income √ó 0.22.  Tariff 0.22 is equal to the maximum value at which the family pays the rent. </p><p>  It is worth noting that subsidies are provided only for six months.  At the end of this period, the owner of real estate must again provide information on the income status of his family. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The rent is required to pay all homeowners.  If payment terms are not respected, service providers have the right to impose a fine on the owner of the apartment.  The penalty will be completely removed from the person with full repayment of the debt.  During the payment of bills, the owner must carefully check the correctness of the indicated amount on receipts, as companies may make a mistake.  For self-calculation, you can use the official website of the Federal Service. </p><p>  It is possible to receive a subsidy on a rent if the payment amount exceeds 22% of the total family income.  Subsidies are paid only for the next six months.  In order to extend the payment, it is necessary to collect the established package of documents and certificates every six months. </p>
