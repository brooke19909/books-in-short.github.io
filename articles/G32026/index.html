  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The beginning of the cold war</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Cold War - this concept fascinates with its mystery and sensation of something very mysterious, but strong enough to destroy and destroy.  Every student is familiar with this war from history textbooks, but what secrets are still hidden?  Why do scientists continue to study and study the mechanism of this phenomenon? </p><p>  The beginning of the Cold War was a huge mistake for the whole world, because it lasted from 1945 to 1991 inclusive and required unimaginable costs of human and material resources.  It is completely useless to spend your time figuring out who is to blame and who is right, because the countries participating in this war bear the same responsibility for what happened. </p><p>  <span>The Cold War</span> is a difficult confrontation between a stable Soviet Union and the unshakable United States of America, which did not provide for direct military action, but was expressed in escalating political and economic cooperation.  Back in 1941, President Roosevelt wrote after <span>the German attack on the USSR</span> that this fact marks the liberation of the European region from the Nazis, in particular there is no reason for concern about the possibility of Russian dominance.  <span>The American president</span> believed that the alliance of countries that won the Second World War could continue to function even after the end of hostilities, because the main task of the post-war alliance, Roosevelt considered the destruction of any distrust between the states.  However, at the end of the war, the political situation changed dramatically, because most of Europe, Japan drowned in ruins, and the front positions were occupied by the USSR and the USA.  It was at this moment that the interests of the two powers clashed, each of which wanted to maximize the boundaries of its influence. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The beginning of the Cold War was manifested in the growing opposition of ideologies, and found its continuation in the arms race, the growth of economic indicators of the efficiency of production and the state economic system as a whole.  Even sport was affected, because, according to Kennedy, the country's prestige can be expressed only by two factors: nuclear warheads and <span>Olympic</span> gold <span>medals</span> .  Each of these aspects justifies itself, because ideology is conquering the human mind, armaments - authority and power in the international arena, <span>economic indicators</span> - the superiority of the social system.  We all know that the West defeated the Soviet power, which voluntarily surrendered.  After the dissolution of the <span>Warsaw Treaty</span> Organization <span>, the</span> Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, the unification of Germany, the destruction of communism, modern Russia realized that it was geopolitical factors that play a decisive role, and not ideological ones.  The beginning of the Cold War did not portend anything serious, but when the giant countries cannot find a compromise, they try, at all costs, to overtake the rival, there is no other choice but to ‚Äúfight‚Äù.  The weapons were scientific developments, the latest technology, statistical indicators of the country's development, culture, music, cinematography and all that an ordinary citizen of the country faced every day. </p><p>  The results of the Cold War are differently determined by experts and specialists in this field, because they are not unambiguous.  But only one thing is obvious to everyone - the United States was able to push the borders of NATO very close to eastern Europe, thereby being able to deploy military bases in most post-Soviet countries.  Modern American politicians are increasingly returning to the past, perhaps this is again the beginning of the Cold War?  The hope is warming that this temporary political disagreement between the superpowers will soon be resolved peacefully, because war is always a loss, even if no gun was loaded, not a single tank left, not a single plane went up into the sky. </p>
