Tourists like the wonderful view from here and the opportunity to rock climbing near Yekaterinburg.  And which is also one of the advantages of this place, it is easy to get to it.  In winter, a large ski resort operates on Volchikha. </p><p>  In this publication we will talk about the sights of the mountain and its surroundings. </p><h2>  Where does the name of the mountain come from </h2><p>  Why is Mount Volchikha called so?  The famous Ural scientist <span>A. Matveev</span> wrote in one of his works that the reason could be a large number of wolves in the once pristine region, due to which once the inhabitants of the area called this <span>mountain Volchya.</span>  In favor of this theory, some residents of the region spoke out.  In addition, it is interesting that one of the closest peaks is called Wolf Cub. </p><p>  However, local historians also speak out about the fact that it comes from the words ‚Äúdragging‚Äù or ‚Äúdragging‚Äù, and the mountain was called Volochikha at the time, since once in this way the forest was brought to the foot from here.  Then, in their opinion, after frequent use, the word changed, and the name of the mountain became what it is now. </p>

    <h2>  Mountain description </h2><p>  If you look from a distant point, then Volchikha Mountain, the photo of which is presented in our article, looks like a volcano.  At its top there are several picturesque rocks.  But, unfortunately, they were quite scribbled by tourists, despite the fact that the height of the mountain is quite rather big.  Volchikha reaches 526 m above sea level.  This indicator was measured in the first third of the XIX century by the German researcher Alexander Humboldt.  He calculated the height using a barometer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In one of the sections of the summit, travelers can see an inscription serving as a memorial plaque dedicated to the avid tourist L. Zakharova, whose ashes were dispelled on Volchikha. </p>

    <p>  Two years ago, a memorial sign dedicated to the dead climbers was also opened here.  It is made in the form of a climber, which rises to the sun.  Also besides this there are three plates.  The names of those climbers from the Urals are written on them. </p><p>  In addition, Volchikha has relay tower equipment, which is surrounded by a special fence and barbed wire.  The watchman guards this territory. </p><p>  The described mountain is an ancient volcano, which consists mainly of magma.  She is over four hundred million years old.  Sometimes on the hillside you can find the remains of an old mine. </p><p>  They climb Volchikha both in summer and in winter.  If you do this at night, you can enjoy the night view of the nearby city.  The railway tracks are located on one side of the mountain peak, and the Moscow Route is on the other. </p><p>  It should also be mentioned that on Volchikha there is a place for another famous rocky exit, which is often used by climbers for training.  It is called the South Wall or Mirror, due to the fact that in some areas the rocks are quite smooth, as if they were polished.  From here you can see the landscapes of the Volchikhinsky reservoir, sometimes called the Sverdlovsk Sea. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The surroundings of Mount Volchikh </h2><p>  Volchikha is located on the right coast of the Chusovaya river.  In these places it is quite shallow.  And sections of tourist rafts on this famous river in the Urals pass downstream.  In accordance with the name of the mountain, the reservoir - Volchikhinskoe - got its name.  By the way, it is the main water source for the population of the city of Yekaterinburg. </p><p>  If you climb to the top of the mountain, then an impressive view will open upon it.  From this place you can see the bizarre winding coastline of the reservoir, the vicinity of Pervouralsk, Revda, as well as the Moscow highway.  If the weather is clear, you can also see the heaps of old mines of Degtyarsk. </p>
