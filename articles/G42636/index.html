  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hotel at the Kazan station in Moscow: description, reviews of tourists, address</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>Kazan Station</span> is the main railway junction.  Every day, thousands of people pass through the doors of this station, including visitors to the city.  Tourists and business travelers most often need housing in the very place from where it will be convenient for them to get anywhere in the city.  The hotel at the Kazan station in Moscow is the convenience and comfort of guests, as well as the opportunity to stay near transport links. </p><h2>  "Retro Hotel" </h2><p>  Address: Komsomolskaya Square, house 2. Room rates from 3000 rubles per day.  Nearby is the Olympic Sports Complex, GUM, the Bolshoi Theater and <span>Zaryadye Park.</span>  Buffet breakfast is included.  Tourists who are looking for cheap hotels near the Kazan station (Moscow) should consider this option. </p><h2>  Interior Description </h2><p>  The interior of the hotel is of European type.  Bright rooms with cozy curtains.  The rooms have a TV, a set of dishes and a private bathroom.  The apartments are located on floors along long, light corridors with water coolers.  On the ground floor there is a lounge area with spacious sofas and a TV where you can relax and have coffee. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.hotels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Retro hotel" class="if uuid-2807334" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/2807334.jpg"></div><p>  The restaurant serves European dishes.  Hotel guests can order in addition to breakfast, lunch and dinner in the restaurant. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Guests rate this hotel 7.5 points.  The biggest disadvantage is that it is very difficult to find the entrance to the hotel.  There are no signs or signs.  Many say that after reconstruction this problem will be eliminated. </p><p>  The hotel is located directly at the Kazan station, which is both a plus and a minus.  After all, a large number of comers and noise from the station sometimes bring discomfort.

This is ideal for relaxing off the road or spending the night for several days. </p><h2>  Hilton </h2><p>  Address: Kalanchevskaya street 21/40.  Nearby are two well-known metro stations: Komsomolskaya and Krasnye Vorota, thanks to which the hotel can be reached anywhere in the city.

Here, pricing is above average. </p><p>  Hotel "Hilton" allows residents and guests of the capital to feel like a celebrity.  European service and a trendy interior are completely conducive to this.  The impressive cost of rooms (about 10,000 rubles) also confirms the status of the hotel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ok-travels.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hilton Hotel Reception" class="if uuid-2807661" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/2807661.jpg"></div><p>  A large high-rise building with a lance on the roof is hard to miss.

Many tourists believe that the cheaper the room, the worse the conditions in it, and vice versa.  Unfortunately or fortunately, this is not always the case.  Often for a moderate fee you can find a room in a hostel better than in a famous hotel. </p><p>  Tourists should pay attention to the opening year of the hostel or hotel, and at the time of its last reconstruction.  It will be true to assume that in old hotels both furniture and plumbing have worn out during their existence.  Therefore, it is best to give preference to newly discovered places. </p><p>  It is important to understand that in hostels you can meet a large crowd of people of different nationalities.  Often they live there for a long time.  Therefore, it is worth preparing yourself in advance for such a neighborhood. </p><p>  Be sure to check which establishments are next to the hotel.  Sounds from a club or bar can disrupt your stay. </p>
