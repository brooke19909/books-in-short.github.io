Following this, the Domodedovo urban district was formed, which included all the settlements of the district (including the airport), which is 150 settlements.  The total population was 167,907 people, they live on 82 hectares.  The administrative center of the district is the city of Domodedovo. </p><h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  In 1900, a railway station was opened (on the Moscow-Pavelets direction) called Domodedovo.  In those days, there was a village under the same name.  Mention of the village is still in the spiritual letter of the XV century.  It is known that then these were the possessions of the Romanov family. </p><p>  In 1898, the construction of factories and plants began in the village; alabaster-lime, brick and cement plants worked here.  During the period of revolution and civil war, enterprises did not work, but in the 20s of the last century, the restoration of industry began.  At that time, a little more than 100 people lived in Domodedovo, but there was already an elementary school here.  In the summer season, the situation changed dramatically, as Muscovites gathered in the village for recreation.  So, already by 1924 a suburban summer cottage was formed, the number of permanent residents increased.  Since the 30s, new factories and cooperatives began to appear, and a high school was rebuilt. </p><p>  After the war, the settlement turned into a city of regional subordination.  In 1970, a cinema, libraries, clubs, the House of Pioneers, and other infrastructure appeared in the city. </p>

    <h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  In the urban district of Domodedovo, the environmental situation is favorable.  A significant place in the economy of the region is occupied by enterprises engaged in the extraction of sand, clay and limestone.  Because of this, the natural landscape is practically not preserved. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There are 173 enterprises located on the territory of the okrug, which are sources of negative impact on the environment.  The most dangerous is Domodedovagrostroy CJSC.  The total stationary emission of harmful substances per year is 5,413.595 tons. </p><p>  The main pollutants in the county are carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide.  Their share in the overall statistics reaches 60%.  Strongly pollute the air and cars.  The main problem of the region is the lack of dust removal and gas purification plants in the territories of industrial enterprises and near highways. </p><p>  A huge problem is with unorganized discharges, which form about 150 local enterprises.  There are about 3 111.772 tons of waste, most of which goes into water bodies.  Most industrial enterprises do not have storm sewers and do not carry out wastewater treatment. </p><p>  In the urban district of Domodedovo, Moscow Region, many <span>unauthorized landfills.</span>  On the right bank <span>of the Pakhra River</span> (near the town of Podolsk), the closed TBPO landfill carries a huge danger, the radiation background is increased here, because the radioactive waste of the chemical plant is stored nearby.  Even all protective structures do not save the situation, since landslide processes destroy and ‚Äúpush‚Äù concrete slabs. </p>

    <h2>  Local authorities </h2><p>  The head of the urban district of Domodedovo is Dvoynykh Alexander Vladimirovich.  This is a young (born in 1984) specialist who graduated from MSTU MAMI and the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration. </p><p>  He was elected to the post in March this year, previously was the head of the administration of the city district, a deputy of the Moscow Regional Duma.  And from 2007 to 2012.  worked as the general director of LLC ‚ÄúTFC ARKTUR‚Äù. </p><p>  By the way, in November, the head of the district said that by the end of the year a separate garbage collection system would be introduced on the territory of Domodedovo.  Special containers will be installed so far only near apartment buildings, the culture of separate waste disposal will be introduced in stages. </p><p>  The long-term plans of the head of the district are many projects.  Dvoynykh A.V. plans to help in the improvement of the courtyards to those houses that have joined and keep them in order.  And the head of the region wants to help with the fact that he will equip the yards with video cameras, the territory near parking lots and entrances. </p><p>  The head of the district is actively attracting investors to the region.  In November, a new Mgrillcafe restaurant was opened, located on the 56th kilometer of the M-4 DON road. </p><p>  Recently, Double A.V. consulted with the chairmen of the SNT.  The main topic of the meeting was to address the issue of compliance with fire safety, because over the past year there have been 28 fires in which 2 people were killed. </p><p>  I would like to believe that the list of "good" deeds of the head of the city district of Domodedovo will not end there. </p>
