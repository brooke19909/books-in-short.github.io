The Chelyabinsk region on its territory sheltered many ponds, but it is this one that is characterized by both a picturesque mountain landscape and warm waters. </p><h2>  Description of a mountain lake </h2><p>  The unusual name "elanchik" is usually translated as a snake or snake lake.  Perhaps he was called so, because from a height it looks a bit like a wriggling snake.  The water depth does not exceed 8 meters, but on average is 4 meters.  The area of ​​the lake reaches a little more than 6 km <sup>2</sup> . </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lake elanchik" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1042561.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Lake Elanchik is a very picturesque place.  Its blue waters are harmoniously combined with birches and pines, which are located off the coast.  In some places, this picture is complemented by willows bending over the lake.  The lake itself is surrounded by neat mountain elevations that are overgrown with pine trees.  A little further there are wetlands rich in healthy berries.  Walking through the forest areas, you can pick up boletus and other mushrooms. </p><p>  These places are especially decorated with cliffs towering above the swamps.  Mysteriousness is given to them by moss, which densely occupied the rocky surface.  Here you can admire the many wild geese and ducks that inhabited the wetlands. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Lake benefits </h2><p>  Lake Elanchik is located near the ski resort "Sunny Valley".  Also nearby is <span>Ilmensky Reserve.</span>  In these places it is planned to build boarding houses that will allow guests to improve their health.  But even now, walking around the surroundings, you can breathe coniferous clean air, which positively affects the airways.  If a person has asthma attacks or coughing, it is good for him to spend time in these places.  People who do not suffer from these ailments, breathing in healthy air, begin to feel a surge of strength and vigor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lake big elanchik" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1042562.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Also, Lake Elanchik is distinguished by water quality.  It is mineralized here, therefore, when taking water procedures, the body is saturated with useful components.  The skin acquires smoothness, and this allows you to get a beautiful tan.  But water is also able to strengthen the body itself. </p><h2>  Where to stay on the lake </h2><p>  Along the shore of the reservoir spread their possessions of the recreation center.  There is also a wellness center for children and a cottage village for guests.  On Elanchik there is a private sector in which you can profitably rent a room or a house.  If desired, you can rent a room in a mini-hotel.  Here you can relax at any time of the year, because renting a house is very easy. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Near the coast there is a holiday village where you can rent a turnkey house.  If you are used to living conditions or want to save money, you can settle in an apartment in a multi-storey building.  Right below the house there are equipped parking lots, playgrounds for children and a beach with a pier.  The entire complex is illuminated by lanterns, so you can stroll after sunset. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake Elanchik Chelyabinsk region" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1042563.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Children's camp </h2><p>  Bolshoi Elanchik Lake has sheltered a children's camp on its shore, which is called “Elanchik”.  Some call it the Ural Artek and this is not strange, since the conditions for young guests are really perfect.  Children can come to the camp only in the summer, and the rest of the time the staff is preparing for the next summer arrival.  The duration of each race is 21 days.  This time is enough for the child to relax and gain new strength.  Children are fed five times a day, and the menu is an experienced nutritionist, so that the baby eats balanced. </p><p>  Parents may not worry when sending their children to camp.  There is a doctor and a dentist.  Also, in the dark, patrols are conducted on the camp.  Children are supervised, especially when the detachment goes swimming in the lake.  Children do not want to leave the camp, because they are very exciting to spend their time.  There is an entertainment program, carousels, mugs, fun contests, walks in the woods and much more.  After visiting these places, Lake Elanchik becomes a favorite place for children. </p><h2>  Fishing on the lake </h2><p>  Many anglers love these places because they are rich in fish.  The thing is that the sea inhabitants have a place to hide, because the bottom of Elanchik is uneven and muddy.  Here you can catch a ruff, crucian carp, perch, pike.  Also found are roach, whitefish and tench, and sometimes ripus.  You can fish all year round, because after the surface freezes, it is not scary to move around on a sleigh. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="elanchik lake reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1042560.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  Those who were in these places forever loved Lake Elanchik.  The reviews of these people are very enthusiastic, because the surrounding beauty can not leave indifferent.  Everyone also likes that in this pond the water is much warmer than in neighboring lakes.  Some say that it is very good here on weekdays, fewer people, since a lot of tourists come only on weekends. </p><p>  Of course, those who go fishing on the lake are not always lucky.  There are days when only small brushes and little perch-sized perches attack.  But in the winter, many fishermen are satisfied with the catch. </p>
