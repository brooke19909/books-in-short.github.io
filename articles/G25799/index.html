    <p>  The revolutionaries of the past can cause a lot of controversy.  Memories, an assessment of their role and significance in history have been discussed for many years in the circles of historians.  It is among them that the question often sounds: ‚ÄúWho is Che Guevara?‚Äù  According to the opinion of many political figures, it can be argued that he was and always remained a vivid example of an irreconcilable struggle, as well as a symbol of revolution.  For young people during the years of socialism, his name was associated with rebellion and rejection of injustice. </p><p>  Who is Che Guevara?  We can say about him that he was a revolutionary with idealistic thinking.  He wanted to change the world and dreamed that all people live happily ever after.  This became his main goal in life.  Despite the fact that he was a representative of a noble family, he had a common nickname Che, which literally translates as "friend."  What is known about him, and what influenced the formation of the character of the future revolutionary Che Guevara?  His biography is interesting and very short, because what he devoted his life to is fighting and hardship.  It was as if he was looking for the most dangerous and tense sections of the globe in order to bring people equal rights and share his vision of happiness with them.  How he did this is another conversation, but the fact that he was a man of courage and longing for freedom is an indisputable fact. </p><p>  He was born on June 14, 1928 in Argentina, his full name is Ernesto Guevara de la Serna.  He grew up in a noble family, while he was quite a pampered and painful boy.  From early childhood he had severe asthma attacks.  What contributed to the formation of his character, which entailed becoming on the path of revolutionary struggle, because his future was quite predictable?  Why did Che Guevara choose the path of struggle?  The biography indicates that rebellious Irish <span>blood</span> flowed in his veins <span>, the blood of</span> Argentine patriots and tireless Spanish conquerors. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  His mother was very educated, knew several foreign languages, was extremely well-read and was considered one of the first feminists of the country.  She was a woman, undoubtedly of extraordinary abilities and very progressive views.  No wonder her son in his youth possessed the <span>pipe dream of</span> saving the whole world.  He believed that it was possible.  Otherwise, who is Che Guevara, no one would know until now. </p><p>  He loved life very much, and his activity could be envied.  Like his mother, he read books, <span>drew</span> good <span>watercolors, and</span> did not part with chess.  Football and rugby were his hobbies, but his passion was fast driving.  He graduated from the Medical University, becoming a surgeon.  Such a profession was profitable, and his future could have turned out very differently, but Ernesto Che Guevara‚Äôs life went differently. </p><p>  Fate throws him first to Guatemala in the midst of revolutionary events, and then to Mexico City.  Here he tries himself as a bookseller, photographer, and in the second half of the 50s in Mexico, he works as a doctor at the Cardiology Institute.  He is constantly looking for his own ways, thanks to which he will be able to save people from <span>social inequality.</span>  In his understanding, there is no other option than bloody armed struggle.  Marxism paid attention to his views, the ideas of which seemed to him brilliant, but his meeting with the Castro brothers, especially with Fidel, was truly fateful.  It was in 1955 that he was fighting in the revolutionary squad of Fidel "M-26-7", preparing an expedition on the yacht "Granma".  In August 1956, he becomes a prisoner in a Mexico City prison for participating in revolutionary events. </p><p>  In 1956-1959, the revolutionary Che twice was injured in battles during the revolutionary liberation war in Cuba.  At the end of 1959, he was awarded Cuban citizenship by special presidential decree.  At this time, he was already famous all over the world and was considered the recognized idol of progressive student youth. </p><p>  Who is Che Guevara, it became clear when the liberation rebel war ended in Cuba.  He began to write scientific papers on the theory of revolution and the <span>partisan movement,</span> was a responsible person during important diplomatic missions. </p><p>  Ernesto Che Guevara had an important principle in life - he always remained true to himself, his people and always went to the end in any endeavors.  Defeat befell him when he went to Congo.  There, his faith in the revolutionary potential of Africa began to crumble, and this field was Bolivia, where Che was captured and was shot. </p><p>  The secret of the burial of the revolutionary became known only after 30 years.  On October 17, 1997, at the Che mausoleum <span>, Cuban President</span> Fidel Castro lit an <span>eternal flame</span> in his memory <span>.</span> </p>
