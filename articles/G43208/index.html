    <p>  In addition, very popular attractions of Mahdia and its environs are: </p><ul><li><p>  City Museum of Mahdia. </p></li><li><p>  The mosque of Mustafa Hamza. </p></li><li><p>  The big mosque. </p></li><li><p>  The fortress of Bordj al-Kebir, etc. </p></li></ul><p>  In the city museum of Mahdia you can see a collection of national clothes of the local population, gold jewelry, wedding dresses, etc. The mosques of Mustafa Khamza and Bolshaya were built in the style of fortifications.  The buildings are very ancient and will surely impress history buffs.  A visit to the fortress of Bordj el-Kebir costs only about one and a half dollars.  It is located on Cape Africa. </p><p>  There is one more interesting place, which is definitely worth a visit to the residents of the El Mouradi Mahdia 5 * hotel (Mahdia).  Monastir - a city located 45 km to the north, is also very rich in all sorts of attractions.  For example, here you should definitely go to the Great Mosque.  This building was built in the 9th century.  There is also a very interesting fortress "Ribat" - the largest and oldest in North Africa. </p><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  Of course, reviews about the El Mouradi Mahdia 5 * hotel on the network are not as good as about many other Tunisian hotels.  Basically, tourists' complaints are related to the fact that this institution is quite old.  Many even believe that this hotel has long lost its five stars and pulls no more than three.  But, nevertheless, for an unassuming tourist this hotel may seem quite tolerable, and its rooms are comfortable.  The luxurious interior of the hotel makes an unforgettable impression on the guests of India.  This hotel is particularly well suited for older people and families.  The rooms are quiet and there is no need to go far to the beach. </p>
