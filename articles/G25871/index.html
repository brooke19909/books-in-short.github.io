We‚Äôll figure out how to install the new iOS, whether it is worth doing, and what problems may arise during the installation of the update. </p><h2>  Should I Upgrade iPad </h2><p>  Before you start the update process, it is worthwhile to find out if you need to install a more recent version of the operating system at all.  The answer to this question depends on several factors, the main one of which is the model of the device. </p><p>  If you have in your hands the old iPad model released before 2013 (these are the iPad, iPad 2, iPad mini, The New iPad and iPad 4), then you should refrain from installing the update.  These tablets are technically outdated and do not support modern software.  It turns out that you can upgrade the old iPad to iOS 9, but it won't work to put something newer.  Due to these limitations, it cannot provide smooth operation.  Therefore, before you upgrade your iPad mini or another old tablet, you should think about whether you need all the features that are offered in more modern firmware. </p><p>  If you have <span>an iPad</span> 2013 and younger in your hands (these are iPad Air, iPad mini 2, iPad Pro and newer), then you can safely download the update.  The 2018 Apple operating system works fine even on older gadgets, which means that there will be no problems after the update, and you can safely proceed to the instructions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.saga.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="In the hands of a girl a tablet" class="if uuid-2859888" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98503/2859888.jpg"></div><h2>  What to do before upgrading </h2><p>  Before you upgrade your iPad, you must prepare it for this procedure.  It consists in solving two problems: cleaning the system of garbage and saving important data.  The first is solved quite simply.  You need to go through the list of applications and remove all unnecessary.  It‚Äôs also worth getting rid of unnecessary photos and downloaded songs.  Any data that migrates from one version of iOS to another can interfere with the normal operation of the tablet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The second task is solved by storing a backup copy of the data in the cloud or on the computer.  Next, we will discuss how to do this. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lifewire.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Uninstall programs" class="if uuid-2859940" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98503/2859940.jpg"></div><h2>  How to backup data </h2><p>  A backup is all the data stored on the device.  Among them are applications, music, photos and everything else that we are so afraid of losing.  IOS has a built-in data backup feature that protects users from possible losses.  To enable it, you need: </p><ul><li>  Go to device settings. </li><li>  Open the first tab (at the top of the screen with your photo or avatar). </li><li>  Select iCloud sub. </li><li>  Scroll down the list of options to ‚ÄúBackup‚Äù. </li><li>  You need to enable it. </li></ul><p>  After that, the tablet will regularly copy your data to the online storage, from which it can always be downloaded if an error occurs during the update process and the data is lost. </p><p>  If you don‚Äôt have access to the Internet directly on the iPad or you just need to save all the information on your computer, you can do the following: </p><ul><li>  Install iTunes on your computer. </li><li>  Connect the tablet to a computer or laptop. </li><li>  Open iTunes. </li><li>  An icon with an iPad will appear at the top of the program‚Äôs interface, you need to click on it. </li><li>  Check the box next to "This computer." </li><li>  Then click on the button ‚ÄúBack up now.‚Äù </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.solutionmarketingpros.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Work on iPad" class="if uuid-2859893" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98503/2859893.jpg"></div><h2>  Install the update "over the air" </h2><p>  So, we cleaned the system, made a backup copy.  Now it's time to figure out how to upgrade your iPad.  The easiest way to install the new firmware is to download it from the Apple server directly to the device.  This method is called an ‚Äúover the air‚Äù update, since you do not need to connect wires.  It‚Äôs enough to have working Wi-Fi nearby. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  iOS is designed in such a way that it can download and install updates on its own.  All that is required of the user is to consent to the download and enter your password.  To start the process of searching for new versions of the system, you need: </p><ul><li>  Go to device settings. </li><li>  Open the tab "General". </li><li>  Select ‚ÄúSoftware Update‚Äù. </li><li>  Wait until you are prompted to install a new version of iOS. </li><li>  Click the ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù button. </li><li>  Agree to the terms and conditions. </li></ul><p>  All.  After that, the tablet will reboot and install the firmware. </p><p>  It is worth noting that during the update it is better to keep the iPad plugged in. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.imore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wi-Fi in iPad" class="if uuid-2859897" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98503/2859897.jpg"></div><h2>  Installing update via iTunes </h2><p>  If you don‚Äôt have a wireless network nearby or you just want to speed up the process, you can update your iPad through your computer.  To do this, we need the iTunes application and the USB cable for Lighting (comes with the tablet).  So, for starters: </p><ul><li>  We connect the tablet to a computer or laptop. </li><li>  Open iTunes. </li><li>  An icon with an iPad will appear at the top of the program‚Äôs interface, you need to click on it. </li><li>  Then you need to click on the button ‚ÄúCheck for Updates‚Äù. </li><li>  If updates are available, then click on the ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù item. </li><li>  After that, the terms and conditions that you must agree with will appear on the screen. </li><li>  In the end, it remains only to enter your password on the tablet to unlock it. </li></ul><p>  After that, you can not disconnect the tablet from the computer, as this can lead to serious malfunctions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cdscag.mightzone.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="IPad and laptop" class="if uuid-2859928" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98503/2859928.jpg"></div><h2>  Possible problems </h2><p>  How to update the iPad, you now know, but what if something went wrong?  Although Apple devices are renowned for their reliability, even some kind of trouble can happen to them.  Especially during the update. </p><ul><li>  First, it‚Äôs worthwhile to clarify in advance that a specific version of the operating system is available to each tablet.  That is, it will not be possible to upgrade the iPad to iOS 10 if it only supports iOS 9. It is also impossible to install iOS 11 if the tablet supports iOS 12. The latest available firmware is always installed. </li><li>  Secondly, if the update fails, you will have to restore the iPad in DFU mode.  This is a special mode with which you can bring to life any Apple device that has stopped working due to a software error.  To enter the iPad in DFU mode, you need to hold the power button and the home button for 10 seconds, and then connect the tablet to a computer running iTunes.  The application will offer to restore the system. </li><li>  Thirdly, a new firmware may lead to a decrease in device performance.  This is quite common.  Weak processors and a limited amount of memory in older iPads lead to brakes.  Applications open longer, sites load slower, and so on.  Moreover, modern systems are always teeming with complex functions and innovations that can affect not only performance, but also autonomy. </li><li>  Fourthly, it may still be better to part with your data.  Years of experience show that an iPad configured with a backup works worse than a new one.  Therefore, if stability is important, then it is better to sacrifice the accumulated data and reload it on a ‚Äúclean‚Äù tablet. </li></ul>
