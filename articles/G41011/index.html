    <h2>  Bosch BGS 62530: reviews </h2><p>  A large number of buyers were able to appreciate this model of the Bosch TM vacuum cleaner.  Many of them confirm a high level of suction power, ease of cleaning, good maneuverability.  Almost no one was left indifferent by the design, and the red network cable simply delighted (a rather non-standard solution for technology).  Indeed, most devices have a white or black cord.  It is extremely simple to get a dust bag - to raise the handle and all.  During cleaning, the dust does not scatter throughout the appliance, but gets lost in the container.  Also, many appreciated the high-quality cleaning of the exhaust air. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bosch bgs 62530 reviews" class="if" height="420" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1485514.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  Now it‚Äôs worth talking about the weaknesses of the Bosch BGS 62530. The first thing that deserves attention is the glossy case on which fingerprints remain.  If the dust filter is dirty, the vacuum cleaner often starts the self-cleaning mode.  In order to avoid this, it is necessary to clean everything thoroughly after or before each cleaning yourself. </p>
