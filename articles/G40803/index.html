Of course, you can buy a thing in a store, but it's great when it is sewn by yourself!  When sewing, you may encounter some <span>types of pockets,</span> for example with a welt pocket in the frame.  There are several types of techniques for its implementation: in a complex frame, a simple frame (by two methods) and a non-standard method.  Now we will consider each of the ways of sewing a welt pocket into the frame step by step. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ruchki.yourarticles.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="frame welt pocket" class="if uuid-2568159" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44269/2568159.jpg"></div><h2>  Method 1: welt pocket into a complex frame </h2><p>  This method is the most common.  Although it is called ‚Äúin a complex frame‚Äù, there is nothing complicated in this sewing method. </p><p>  First we need to find a place to enter our pocket.  Mark it with a horizontal line, and then with vertical lines mark the beginning and end of the pocket, thereby determining the width.  Then, press the doubler on the wrong side of this marking (for the strength of the welt pocket in the frame) in size a little larger than the planned lines. </p><p>  Now you need to carve out the same material as the main part, two identical parts for the pocket.  Each should be with allowances for seams of about 1-1.5 cm. Width - about 3-4 centimeters.  The pattern on the product must necessarily coincide with the edges.  If they are cut from the fabric across the threads, then they need to be wet and ironed, pulling a little.  Then you need to carve out another detail, the so-called gap, it should be the same length as the edges and the width should be several centimeters longer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now let's take care of the inside of the pocket.  It is cut out of a special lining fabric, if there is none, you can use a thin fabric.  The depth of the pocket can be done at your discretion. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ruchki.yourarticles.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="frame welt pocket processing" class="if uuid-2568161" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44269/2568161.jpg"></div><p>  Then you need to sweep the lining fabric to the largest part (the gap) with the narrow side.  Then we sew them to each other (the width of the seam is about 0.7-0.8 cm).  It is imperative to make fastenings on all details, that is, flash several times back and forth. </p><p>  Now you need to iron it all out, it is important to make the direction towards the lining.  The second side of the lining must be sewn to one of the linings.  Iron again towards the lining.  On the front side we apply the second hem and lining with a lining, they must coincide with the center line, which we marked earlier. </p><p>  Sew these details from the marked line at a distance of about 0.5 cm. On the back side of the doubler, you get a rectangle that you need to connect with a marker and draw a line in the middle. </p><p>  Depart from the midline by about 1 cm and connect with those lines that are already stitched, triangles are obtained.  Then cut with scissors in the middle and along the lines that lead obliquely to the corner.  As a result, you should get triangles that do not reach the edge by 1-2 mm.  Turn them inside out.  Align and sweep, everything should be even.  For reliability, turning between them is also better to sweep.  The triangle that remains is also bent inward.  Sew all the details from the inside, turning the main fabric and connecting all the edges and lining. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Method 2: slotted pocket into a simple frame </h2><p>  As in the first case, you need to make markup where the pocket will be.  To iron the doubler on the wrong side, make a frame of three horizontal lines and two vertical ones.  Cut two stitches twice the width of the frame with allowances for the seams.  Fold one stitch in half inside out, make a marking on the second, that is, divide it into three parts and fold one stripe, iron the two parts as a result. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.liveinternet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="frame welt pocket" class="if uuid-2568156" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44269/2568156.jpg"></div><p>  Then it must be attached to the frame with slices to the center line.  The part that is folded in half should be at the top, and the one that is divided into three parts should be seen with the short side inward and then stitched.  After that, cut, as in the first method, make triangles in the middle and along the edges, and also turn the inside out.  Do not forget to notice the triangles, bend and iron them, cut out the lining, the width of which should be like a hem, sew it to the underside of the hem. </p><p>  From the main fabric, one more detail needs to be cut - a gap.  In length it is the same as the stitching, and in width - a few centimeters more.  It must be sewn to the other side of the lining so that the seams are not inside the pocket, but outside.  Then sew the gap to the upper grinder and finally connect all the parts on a typewriter along the edges and iron them. </p><h2>  Method 3: second method of a simple welt pocket </h2><p>  Consider another option pocket in a simple frame.  This is the easiest way, since it does not require cutting the edges.  Draw a marker with a frame about 1-2 cm wide. To the inside, iron the doubler larger than the frame itself.  Cut out two pieces from the same fabric as the main part.  The width should be slightly larger than the frame, and the length should be like the depth of a pocket with allowances for seams. </p><p>  Divide the frame into two identical rectangles, in the middle of each you need to sew one detail of the pocket on the front side.  Then attach the part to the first strip and sew it a little lower - between the two stripes.  Then turn over and sew the second part. </p><p>  From the wrong side, cut the fabric in the middle without cutting to the end about 1 cm. Then make cuts to the corners, not reaching the end by 1-2 mm.  Wrap inward, align the edging and iron them.  Bend the upper part of the facing down and iron.  The fold should be 1-2 cm from the edge.  Cut one of the parts of the grinder so that they are the same size, connect them using a machine.  And at the end, sew the extreme parts. </p><h2>  Method 4: slotted pocket - non-standard way of execution </h2><p>  Large enterprises for the sewing of clothes have many modern sewing machines, so things are sewn there much faster and easier.  Well, sewing lovers try to do everything with their own hands.  Here is an example of another way. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.liveinternet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="slotted pocket in a simple frame" class="if uuid-2568166" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44269/2568166.jpg"></div><p>  On the part, make a marking from three lines, cut one part of the grind.  Make a line with a marker in the middle of the line and bend the edges to this line.  After you need to iron.  Attach the edge to the horizontal line (the slices should coincide with the center line).  To make it more convenient, you can fix it with pins, or you can even notice it.  After this, sew at a distance of 1-2 mm from the central sections.  Cut from the inside, as was described in other ways.  You need to cut to the corners, capturing the lower part of the facing, but not cutting the upper parts.  After that, turn to the wrong side.  Further, the processing of the welt pocket in the frame is sewn, as in other descriptions - you need to make a gap and lining.  Sew around the edges of all the details. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Sewing a welt pocket into the frame, like any kind of sewing, requires experience.  The more you hone your skills, the better it will turn out.  Each of the methods is special, the main thing is to choose the method that is the best for you.  It is important that a hand-made item will bring much more joy.  Carry your things with great pleasure. </p>
