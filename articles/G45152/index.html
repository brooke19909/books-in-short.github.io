This is the five-star Porto Azzurro Delta Hotel, located on the Mediterranean coast, 35 km from Alanya and 5 km from the village of Okurcalar.  For many holidaymakers, it has become a favorite vacation spot.

    <h2>  About the hotel chain from Porto Azzurro </h2><p>  What about the aforementioned ‚Äúfive-star‚Äù?  He is popular.  Foreigners come here.  Therefore, the staff understands better in English than in Russian.  (This should be taken into account when choosing a tour to this hotel). </p><p>  Rest here is profitable.  For a good rest you will give a moderate amount.  Wonderful ecology, a good level of hotel service, well-developed infrastructure and quite affordable price (currently - from $ 1454 for a married couple in a double room for 6 nights) attract tourists here. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, if you start looking for Hotel Porto Azzurro 3 *, then you can come across the following network Italian three-star hotels: </p><p>  - in the town of Sirmione, located on the shores of the gorgeous Lake Garda with a developed resort infrastructure; </p><p>  - on the Mediterranean island of Malta, on the secluded coast of St Paul‚Äôs Bay, located an hour from the island‚Äôs capital, Valletta (Valett is the name of the knight, the master of the order who founded it). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="porto azzurro delta in okurcalar turkey" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/743864.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Thus, by analyzing the aforementioned hotel complexes, one can understand the market style of the hotel operator Porto Azzurro Delta Hotels.  Resorts reviews indicate: in Italy (where prices are higher), Porto Azzurro works with the economy segment of customers, and in Turkey with the segment of the classic level.  Hence the conclusion: the market strategy of the Porto Azzurro network is an inexpensive vacation with a maximum quality / price ratio.  Such a strategy maximizes revenue at short intervals.  On large ones, significant investments are required from the management company. </p><p>  This is how Porto Azzurro Delta <span>5 *</span> resort business managers organize it <span>.</span>  <span>The rating of hotels in Turkey,</span> published at the end of each holiday season, characterizes the mentioned hotel complex as ‚Äúa strong middle peasant‚Äù in the ‚Äúfamily vacation‚Äù nomination. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On the one hand, he is not in the top 10, but there are higher prices for the tour.  But on the other, he is a multi-year rating subject of the first twenty hotels.  Let‚Äôs be realistic: the second-generation hotel, built in 2003, cannot afford to beat its fourth-generation brothers, whose projects take into account all the know-how of the Turkish resort industry, accumulated over 25 years of rapid investment development.  His last major repair was in 2011.  He is competitive, but he can‚Äôt get into the top 10.  Its market niche, as we already mentioned, is maintaining the attractive quality / price ratio. </p><h2>  Why do tourists choose the hotel "Porto Azuro Delta 5 *"? </h2><p>  Let us return to the topic of our article - the Turkish five-star hotel.  At the same time, we note: vacation tours in it are mainly chosen by lovers of measured family vacations in the classic Mediterranean climate, especially families with children. </p><p>  Many guests of the hotel separately thank his chef for the excellent catering.  You must admit that with one-hundred-dollar expenses per day, not every hotel provides daily main dishes of good fish and beef.  In addition, local chefs are real masters in the preparation of pastries and sweets.  The menu has a lot of fruits. </p><p>  Porto Azzurro Delta <span>5 * (Turkey, Alanya)</span> provides a good quality rest for its guests using its infrastructure: eight-story hotel building, beach, outdoor and indoor pools, water slides, SPA center, beauty salon, gym, eating at two restaurants.  In this article, following the logic of guest reviews, we will try to answer the question: ‚ÄúWhy do some of the guests in the next holiday season buy a tour to Porto Azzurro Delta Hotel again?‚Äù </p><p>  The secret, obviously, lies in the well-trained staff.  Judging by customer reviews, even when the hotel complex is crowded (and it is popular), its employees find the opportunity to pay attention to each guest.  At the same time, the transfer is always clear, without any hesitations.  And the food that tourists arbitrarily choose as part of the All inclusive, as noted in the reviews of guests of the Porto Azzurro Delta Hotel, is of remarkable quality and taste. </p><h2>  Perfect climate </h2><p>  Another reason for buying a tour here is the really warm and mild Mediterranean climate.  Gourmets of resort holidays believe that it is here, in comparison with the entire coast of Turkey, weather conditions are optimal.  It is warm here, the resort place is protected from the northern winds of the Taurus mountain range.  The average monthly temperature in the vicinity <span>of Porto</span> Azzurro Delta Hotel is +20 <sup>0</sup> . The hotel complex is located in the first line - only 150 meters from the beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="porto azzurro delta alara 5" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/743872.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel's beach is covered with small pebbles, like the entire coast near the village of Okurcalar (5 km away from the hotel) and equipped with a platform.  By the way, those who want to find more information about this hotel can also look for it under the following name - Porto Azzurro Delta in Okurcalar, Turkey. </p><p>  The entrance to the water is smooth.  The territory belonging to the hotel is quite spacious, about 17,000 m <sup>2</sup> , it is well-groomed and landscaped. </p><h2>  More about the hotel </h2><p>  The hotel has 213 rooms, of which the majority - 179 - are classified as standard, 30 family rooms (with two bedrooms), 2 VIP suites and 2 specialized rooms for people with disabilities.  In the holiday season, the hotel complex Porto Azzurro Delta Alara 5 * accepts up to 650 tourists.  The rooms provided by them offer a high-quality rest of the Classic level.  They are furnished with high-quality furniture made not from second-rate materials, but from classic woods.  Household appliances are not morally obsolete: a well-functioning hourly <span>central air conditioning, a</span> TV with Russian satellite channels, a minibar are all of a good standard.  The interiors of the rooms of Porto Azzurro Delta Alara are thought out by the designers, they are all in harmony: windows, arrangement of a double bed, wardrobe, bedside tables, table, chairs, safe, floor with light ceramic coating, pastel pink or pastel yellow walls. </p><p>  Paid for living in the rooms two services: Wi-Fi and minibar.  By the way, in the lobby area there is Wi-Fi free. </p><p>  Resorts note the convenience and cleanliness of the rooms, which distinguishes Hotel Porto Azzurro Delta 5 *.  Porto Azuro Delta 5 *, and this is felt, is managed by managers who know a lot about hotel management. </p><p>  Just amazing!  The guests (and this remark is not based on a single review) are so ‚Äúaccustomed‚Äù to their room that upon leaving, they remember his comfort and coziness for a long time with kind words.  The staff of the "five-star" daily cleanly clean rooms and change linen. </p><p>  You should also warn lovers of daily shopping and connoisseurs of nightlife: this peaceful hotel is not yours.  Although options for less dynamic shopping are available here. </p><h2>  The friendly attitude to the staff is the key to a successful holiday </h2><p>  Next, I want to write, based on the past experience of the spa, on how to earn the ‚Äúspecial inclination‚Äù of the staff.  The key is simple - respect for the host country, respect for the language.  Reviews of Porto Azzurro Delta Hotels are no exception to this opinion.  Smile to staff, merchants.  In a conversation with them, use words from their native language, this will testify to your intelligence, respect to the host country.  Many holidaymakers who are not too lazy to do this, note the emphasized friendly relations with local people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Porto Azzurro Delta 5 Porto Azuro Delta 5" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/743870.jpg" width="600"></div>  We bet that if you use the Turkish words in your communication: hello (merhaba), with ice (buzlu), red wine (kizmyzym sharap), one (bir), please (lyuften), then, linking them into a single phrase, said to the bartender, you will achieve that he will greet you by the hand.  And this is true not only for Porto Azzurro Delta 5 * personnel.

    <p>  Hotel Porto Azuro Delta Alara is surrounded by small shops.  Prices in many of them are pretty draconian.  200 meters from it there is a small market, with a small shop where a saleswoman Malika sells sweets.  She is sociable and welcoming.  Our tourists met her and appreciated pomegranate juice and ice cream. </p><p>  Another good-natured and sociable employee of the hotel mention the reviews of its guests about Porto Azzurro Delta Hotel.  If you are a fisherman, you will find in Mavlut not only a soul mate, but also (free of charge) by agreement with him, after his shift (he serves the hotel beach until 17-00), you can catch carp, living in the local Alara River.  Here, on the banks of this river, there is a two-story hut where he lives. </p><h2>  With whom to decide questions of accommodation and excursions </h2><p>  Unfortunately, most of the guest reviews of the hotel in question indicate the low business qualities of the guides (this is the general trend of the hotel business).  If you refuse to buy excursions from them, and this is two times more expensive than in street tour bureaus, then they will immediately lose all interest in you.  By the way, there are two small excursion bureaus near the beach.  Tourists recommend one that is further away.  Buying tours here, you will save about 45% of the money!  So do it. </p><p>  For issues related to accommodation, equipment should be consulted not with the guide, but with the manager working at the reception.  It happens that an employee with a poor knowledge of the Russian language gets into the shift.  In this case, ask the general manager.  Knowing spoken English will be useful here. </p><h2>  Tours in Turkey </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews of the guests of the hotel we are considering, most of them choose historical and cultural excursions.  To be fair, we note that travel agencies also offer sea yacht and recreational excursions. </p><p>  A two-day tour to Pamukkale, a unique cascade of healing thermal mineral springs, is popular.  Overnight at the local Thermal Hotel.  The largest of the natural pools is called the Cleopatra pool, here the ancient Romans, perhaps the first connoisseurs of spa treatments, equipped their baths.  Unfortunately, the marble vaults were not preserved due to the earthquake, however, fragments of collapsed marble columns are visible.  By the way, Cleopatra's pool is operational. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Review of hotel Porto Azzurro Delta 5" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/678790.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  An unforgettable excursion to the valleys of Cappadocia - an ancient civilization of cities carved inside the rocks.  It is characteristic that people still live in these places, modern communications are held here.  However, looking at the local residential building, you can see that half of it is built, and half is carved in the rock.  Here is such an exotic here, unique on a global scale. </p><h2>  Opinions of tourists about the rest in the hotel </h2><p>  Generally speaking, according to our observations, the average review about the Hotel Porto Azzurro Delta 5 * consists of two parts: the first is the praises of the staff, the beach, the pool, the second is a summary of the high cost of local shopping.  We will return to the second aspect.  By the way, not everything here is so ‚Äúneglected‚Äù.  In the vicinity of the hotel complex, directly opposite it, there is a fairly lively bus stop; the hotel has shopping flights to Alanya.  In any case, we will later talk about the recommendations of shopaholics - guests of the Porto Azzurro Delta 5 * hotel. </p><p>  Hotel ‚ÄúPorto Azuro Delta Alara‚Äù is primarily appreciated by its guests for the quality of family vacations.  Especially wide and fun in it for children.  Judging by the reviews of vacationers in it, for children there is everything.  It can be recommended for young families.  Mini-club animators are professionally engaged with kids and teenagers from four to fourteen years of age at set hours.  For children there is an equipped playground, <span>water slides</span> adapted for children of different ages.  Numerous photographs with the enthusiastic faces of little spa guests indicate that they have fun at the hotel. </p><h2>  Beach, sea rides ... </h2><p>  The hotel guests relaxing on the beach, waiting for a rather fascinating animation.  In any case, you won‚Äôt be bored.  Attention is paid to both children and adults.  There are enough umbrellas and deck chairs for everyone.  There is an opportunity to play beach volleyball (‚Äúhotel championships‚Äù are regularly held, under the guidance of local trainers do yoga. There is a buffet on the beach. There are also typical beach water attractions for adults and children: ‚Äúbanana‚Äù, ‚Äúcheesecake‚Äù. There is an opportunity to go diving led by experienced instructors. </p><p>  However, according to hotel guests, the prices for local attractions are overpriced.  We do not recommend buying a ‚Äúparachute flight‚Äù, because its price ($ 50) significantly exceeds the average market price in Turkey ($ 30).  For the rest of the local attractions, prices are tolerant. </p><h2>  Features of Turkish national shopping </h2><p>  Basically, local merchants doing their business in the vicinity of Okurcalar village are ‚Äúspoiled‚Äù by tourists from Western Europe.  Accordingly, prices for goods here are significantly higher than in classic places of shopping for the Star and Crescent Countries.  Therefore, guests of the Porto Azzurro Delta Hotel 5 * hotel recommend buying in Alanya, which is a half-hour drive away.  Here, tourists mainly make their most significant purchases.  Most of them focus on original oriental jewelry, leather and fur products, souvenirs of the Country of the Star and the Crescent. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Porto azzurro delta hotels reviews" class="if" height="385" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/743868.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Arriving in Alanya should get to its main shopping street, named after Ataturk.  There are a lot of chain stores (for example, WaIKIKI) and private stores.  For lovers of leather goods, we recommend Baran Club.  The goods of this store are fashionable and of high quality.  In addition, in the studio with him you will make any product to order. </p><p>  On Ataturk street there are many cheap jewelry shops.  However, if you yourself are not a jeweler, we do not recommend buying here: there are many fakes. </p><p>  Having come to the boutique, you should be prepared in advance for the fact that 2-3 managers will immediately rush to you.  Sometimes a person comes in is treated to tea and sweets, a director is called who will promise you a personal discount, they will bring a lot of goods you are interested in ... Actually, all this is a performance.  ‚ÄúDirector‚Äù is the same seller, but playing this role, ‚Äúdiscounted price‚Äù is significantly overstated.  However, to say this out loud is not accepted.  This is eastern trade.  You will offend the seller ... What to do when you go to the boutique?  Smile, be friendly.  Skip this whole performance "by the ears".  Find out the prices in Turkey in advance.  Remember: you do not owe anything to the sellers who inspired such a show.  Firmly insist that you voice the price.  And if you called her, for example, 1200 ‚Ç¨, then boldly bargain, offering your own - $ 300.  For clarity, we will show you the Turkish "price mechanics" for leather products: </p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="213"><p>  <em>Product Name</em> </p></td><td valign="top" width="213"><p>  <em>Price ($) that the merchant originally calls</em> </p></td><td valign="top" width="213"><p>  <em>Actual price ($)</em> </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="213"><p>  Men's leather down jacket </p></td><td valign="top" width="213"><p>  1200 </p></td><td valign="top" width="213"><p>  700 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="213"><p>  Women's sheepskin coat (patent leather) </p></td><td valign="top" width="213"><p>  2000 </p></td><td valign="top" width="213"><p>  1000 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="213"><p>  Women's short coat (husk skin) </p></td><td valign="top" width="213"><p>  1500 </p></td><td valign="top" width="213"><p>  550 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="213"><p>  Autumn men's jacket </p></td><td valign="top" width="213"><p>  1400 </p></td><td valign="top" width="213"><p>  400 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="213"><p>  Women's light jacket </p></td><td valign="top" width="213"><p>  1200 </p></td><td valign="top" width="213"><p>  300 </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  We learned all this from the reviews of "experienced" tourists - guests of the Porto Azzurro Delta <span>Hotel 5 * hotel (Turkey,</span> Alanya). </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Concluding our story about the Porto Azuro Delta Alara hotel, here is a brief summary.  This is a five star family economy hotel.  Optimally go here for families with children.  The hotel infrastructure and the resort potential of the Mediterranean coast are truly capable of healing and entertaining your children.  The hotel is calm, with good animation, decent food.  Knowledge of English is not a hindrance here, some of the hotel staff do not understand Russian. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="porto azzurro delta 5 hotel porto azuro delta alara" class="if" height="323" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/743869.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Before leaving, in order to buy souvenirs, we recommend that you independently make a shopping tour to Alanya, Ataturk Street, after knowing the prices and preferred retail outlets.  If you order such a tour from the hotel, then you will be taken to outlets consisting of a contractual commission with the hotel, and the prices for your purchases will be significantly higher than market prices. </p>
