In addition, lands related to the reserve, that is, those not provided to municipal authorities, legal entities and ordinary citizens, as well as those withdrawn from the state economic turnover through conservation, are included here. </p><p>  Earth is a resource with which human activity is associated in different directions.  Today, it quite often acts as an object of commodity-money relations, for which the cadastral value serves.  The land in this regard has a status that changes quite often, so you have to constantly determine the real price of objects at a certain point in time. </p>

    <h2>  Determination procedure </h2><p>  As for other procedures, in this case there is a certain order.  To determine the cadastral value of the land, you need to use the help of the Rules of the state valuation.  Everything happens in the following order. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The territorial subject of the Russian Federation approves the decision on how citizens learn the cadastral value of a land plot. </p><p>  The territorial administration of Rosreestr is preparing a list of land plots that are necessarily subject to cadastral valuation.  According to the current legislation, all areas that are part of the territories of settlements are divided into 17 types of permitted use.  Each locality is characterized by the fact that the territories in it are divided into units of an administrative-territorial plan, each of which includes a corresponding cadastral quarter.  The list of land plots also contains information on the characteristics of each of them: area, location, availability, purpose and nature of buildings. </p><p>  Rosreestr involved an evaluation organization that calculates the specific parameter of the cadastral value for individual quarters and types of permitted use.  The procedure for calculating this indicator requires the use of the average cost in the market or the standard price per square meter of a territorial site in a certain quarter for a specific type of permitted use. </p><p>  After that, the cadastral value is recorded in the regulatory enactment.  The land plot receives the appropriate status in the cadastral registration system of the management of territorial units. </p>

    <h2>  Features of the calculation </h2><p>  You can find out the cadastral value of a land plot on the basis of the specific price parameter per square meter.  This value needs to be multiplied by the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe entire plot in order to get the final value.  For each cadastral quarter, the sum of the specific indicator may well differ, and the type of permitted use also matters, this parameter also affects the approval of the cadastral value of the land plot.  In this case, accounting is carried out at the highest specific indicator of all possible types of permitted use for the prescribed territorial unit. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Special cases </h2><p>  In order to at least somehow streamline the statistical analysis, as well as as a guideline for territorial entities, it is customary to establish average values ‚Äã‚Äãof specific indicators for each <span>category of land</span> and the type of functional application for municipal districts or districts.  In a similar form, the minimum parameters of specific indicators for lands having industrial and other special purposes can be established, below which they are not allowed to establish it.  They are determined on the basis of the methodology for calculating the weighted average indicators for individual districts and land categories. </p>

    <h2>  How is the cadastral value identified? </h2><p>  A land plot that has been evaluated must be included in special documentation.  You can get this information in the territorial offices of Rosreestr.  The request must contain the cadastral number of the plot.  It is formed on the basis of the number of the cadastral district, region, quarter, and at the end contains an indication of a specific site.  You can find the number in the bodies of Rosreest, on its website, as well as in documents, in particular the contract of sale, certificate of ownership, <span>cadastral passport of the</span> land and others.  A correctly executed request is the basis for specialists to submit all available information about it, including payments. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Additional features </h2><p>  Assessment of the cadastral value of a land plot is certainly included in these documents.  You can find it out without leaving your home, for this there is an interactive cadastral map posted on the official website of Rosreestr, for this a cadastral number is entered in the corresponding field.  If for some reason the requested information is not available on the portal, then you can find the decision of a certain municipal authority on the registration of the results of the cadastral valuation involved by the state.  It is required to find the cadastral value of a square meter of land in the area in which the plot is located, multiply it with the area, which as a result will give the approximate value. </p>

    <h2>  Change in value </h2><p>  A change in the cadastral value of a land plot is permissible only in a few cases: </p><p>  - if there has been an objective change in the basic characteristics of the territory: the borders and area have changed, there have been changes in the permitted form of use of the site, it has been transferred to some other category; </p><p>  - if errors were found in the documentation that could lead to an overstatement of the cadastral value. </p><p>  The first case assumes that a territorial body of Rosreestr is issued an application and a package of documents is submitted (copy of a document proving ownership, a copy of a document on the resolution of a land dispute, a land plan, as well as others). </p><p>  A decrease in the cadastral value of a land plot may be challenged in court or in administrative procedure.  If it is overstated, then the amount of tax that will be paid by the owner or the rent paid by the tenant, the cost of redemption of the state plot and other expenses will also be overstated.  That is why a decrease in the cadastral value of a land plot can provide significant savings for those who own it or simply use it. </p>

    <h2>  In what cases is overestimation found? </h2><p>  The specific indicator of the cadastral value may be overstated for a particular type of permitted use, or there is a fact of incorrect determination of the type of permitted use.  This happens due to a cadastral or technical error, when the document contains an incorrect indication of the specific indicator of the cadastral value that does not correspond to the actual one.  For example, if for the land plot instead of the type of permitted use ‚Äúfor the placement of administrative and industrial buildings‚Äù an indicator for ‚Äúoffice placement‚Äù is prescribed, then the value of the specific indicator will almost triple the real one.  In the case of building a site and the location of a building or other structure on it, you can determine its purpose by recording in the technical passport that accompanies a particular property.  <span>Correction of a mistake is</span> possible if an application is filed with the territorial cadastral value authority.  If a refusal to correct the error is received, then appeal to the court is allowed. </p><h2>  The market value of the object is less than the cadastral </h2><p>  This case assumes that the basic document will be the Resolution of the Supreme Arbitration Court of the Russian Federation, according to which the cadastral value of the territory will be equal to its value in the market from the moment the latter is calculated.  To identify the market value of the site, you need to contact an appraiser who works independently.  His report will become the basis for the fact that the actual cadastral value of the land plot could be established in court.  The tax in this case will be levied in accordance with the amendments.  The owner or tenant of the land should be aware of such features. </p>

    <h2>  New rules </h2><p>  If a decrease in the cadastral value of a land plot, which was determined after July 22, 2010, is required, then it can be disputed even without going to court.  To do this, you need to contact the commission of the appropriate profile within six months from the moment the information was entered into the state real estate cadastre.  To recalculate the cadastral value, only two cases are provided: </p><p>  - if it is proved that the cadastral valuation was carried out on the basis of information that is not reliable; </p><p>  - if on hand there is a conclusion of an appraiser working independently, which contains a determination of the value of the land on the market. </p><p>  A specialized commission requires one calendar month to consider the application. </p><h2>  Professional approach </h2><p>  So, you already understand how important a properly defined cadastral value is.  A land plot should be evaluated only by experienced and skillful professionals, from whose eyes even the smallest detail cannot escape.  That is why, most often, the help of professional appraisers, who know their job well, is required.  So, a decrease in the cadastral value of a land plot or its increase (depending on the initial indicator) should be carried out by appraisers.  To do this, they will need to submit some documents. </p>
