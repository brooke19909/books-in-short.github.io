Mysterious caves are the most explored objects of our time, keeping many secrets.  The silent magic kingdom is a real delight with special beauty.  Unique natural monuments are located in different parts of our planet, and today the story will be about the largest miraculous sights of Transbaikalia, where primitive people lived millions of years ago. </p><h2>  Unexplored natural monument </h2><p>  Beautiful at any time of the year, Heatei Cave was discovered in the 17th century.  A unique karst object was created by water, which eroded the rocks for many years.  He gained fame after visiting Transbaikalia by academician I. Gmelin, who described a natural monument in 1737.  However, even for three centuries, the ice kingdom, which does not store ancient rock paintings, has not been fully studied by experts.  And only from the middle of the last century, cavers seriously engaged in a natural object, of which there is no mention in the local epic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="heathai cave" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1737233.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Two names of the sacred cave </h2><p>  The name of the karst monument from Buryat translates as "patterned", and it is given for openwork lace of ice crystals decorating a local attraction.  Earlier miraculous miracle was called Mikhachin ("cannibalistic").  Allegedly, residents used it as a refrigerator and stored meat supplies here, and it was for this reason that it received such a strange name.  However, the old people, recalling the old days, when single travelers went to underground grottoes and never returned, do not agree with this statement and consider this place extremely dangerous. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Dangerous and mysterious </h2><p>  Descent into the mysterious dungeon, which has a special energy, without special equipment always ended in accidents.  The fact is that immediately after the entrance to the cave of reckless travelers, a failure was expected the height of a 4-storey building.  Standing on slippery ice is simply impossible, and the daredevils, trying to explore the halls, flew down. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hethei cave photo" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1737229.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Heatei Cave (Trans-Baikal Territory), which the Buryats are afraid of, is considered sacred.  Residents come here solely to pray and mingle with spirits.  They try to appease the dead and leave small coins or ‚Äúobo‚Äù near the entrance - trees, whose branches are tied with colored ribbons. </p><h2>  Underground kingdom </h2><p>  Kheetei cave with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout three hectares is located in the south of the Trans-Baikal Territory, on the Ketuy-Nuru mountain range.  Cavers found in the grottos the bones of both animals and humans, fragments of ceramic products and even arrowheads used by primitive people.  It is always cold in it, and the air temperature does not exceed one degree.  Decorated with frozen ice crystals, she admires the unique sculptures created by water on the frozen floor, and calcite formations. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  "Two Sisters" Haetei </h2><p>  It should be noted that Heatei Cave is a whole complex consisting of two dungeons, once connected to each other.  The narrow passage connecting the miraculous monuments collapsed after an explosion in a quarry where limestone was mined.  And now to descend into the caves "Wet" and "Sukhoi" formed in the rocks, which have gained fame, have to be taken separately. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hetei caves Trans-Baikal Territory photo" class="if" height="188" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1737226.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Ecological problems </h2><p>  They have become tourist sites recently - in the 70s of the last century.  And according to environmentalists concerned about environmental issues, unique natural monuments, where a large number of ice sculptures are destroyed, are lost forever.  This was led by uncontrolled visits to tourists and failure to comply with the requirements for the protection of geological attractions.  People often leave garbage, throw cigarette butts, paint walls with various inscriptions, and try to break off pieces of stalactites that are several thousand years old.  Where you can reach with your hand, there are almost no leakage formations. </p><h2>  Descent through an ice waterfall </h2><p>  To get to the Heetei caves (Trans-Baikal Territory), whose photos will not leave anyone indifferent, you will have to go down a vertical frozen waterfall.  Numerous tourists visiting the underground facility year-round have polished ice stones so much that now they can‚Äôt do without the help of an instructor and diving equipment.  After a few seconds, visitors are downstairs, and those who come down first light candles placed around the perimeter of the "Wet" cave.  In the light of a living fire, an examination of the miracle of miracle begins, the floor of which is covered with a thick layer of ice in winter and summer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="heatei cave Transbaikal" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1737232.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Admiration for the grandeur of nature </h2><p>  Heatei Cave consists of several grottoes, where they found the bones of long-extinct animals.  It is always very cold inside, and therefore it is worth taking care of warm things so as not to freeze while traveling through the fabulously beautiful world of the dungeon.  Immediately after the entrance, tourists who were delighted with the grandeur of Mother Nature enter a gigantic hall more than 26 meters high. </p><p>  More reminiscent of a football field, it makes a huge impression on visitors admiring the limestone, forming natek various forms.  Water entering the cave instantly freezes with unusual looking sculptures.  It seems that the skillful master captured fantastic animals, whose images in a dim light arouse imagination.  Sometimes water turns into unusual patterns and mysterious letters, not deciphered by anyone. </p><h2>  The fabulous beauty of frozen lace </h2><p>  The unique caves of Kheetei (Trans-Baikal Territory) with bizarre stalagmites and stalactites frozen in the dark that resemble mysterious sculptures cause delight.  Grottoes, differing from each other, fascinate with the special beauty of ice lace.  They give the miraculous miracle, decorated with amazing patterns of hoarfrost, a mysterious look.  Unfortunately, many tourists who want to take something from the dungeon as a souvenir behave like vandals and break down limestone formations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="heatei cave where is" class="if" height="424" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1737237.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Kingdom without ice </h2><p>  The "dry" Heatei (cave), the photo of which conveys all its amazing beauty, consists of limestone rock that is subject to destruction.  Deep cracks formed on the walls and arches intertwined into bizarre patterns.  In a small underground kingdom, in which water and ice are completely absent, clay soil does not freeze even in severe frosts.  There are a lot of pigeons, howling in the deep recesses of the walls of the nest. </p><h2>  Heatei Cave: where is it located? </h2><p>  If you do not know the exact location of the natural monument of regional significance, then you can not find it in the Agin steppe.  And even at a distance of one hundred meters, it looks like an ordinary ravine.  Experienced travelers recommend focusing on a limestone quarry located between the Onon and Mogoytu regions, and the nearest village of Ust-Borzya is seven kilometers from a unique attraction. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hetei caves, Transbaikal Territory" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1737230.jpg" width="600"></div>
