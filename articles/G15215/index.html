    <h2>  Personal insurance </h2><p>  The first group includes: </p><ol><li><p>  Life insurance.  A person can conclude a contract for a certain amount.  With this form, the most popular is cumulative insurance.  Using this principle, the policyholder makes deductions monthly.  Gradually, therefore, a good amount accumulates.  If stipulated by the contract, then the company can still charge interest on this amount, that is, it is a kind of deposit that will be paid to the family of the insured person in case of his death. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div></li><li><p>  From <span>accidents</span> and illnesses.  If you are asked, name the various types of insurance services that you know.  And do not forget about insurance, which is used by all large organizations, trying to reduce the risk of loss, due to absenteeism or <span>an accident at work.</span>  This species is popular both for personal needs and commercial.  People try to protect themselves in the case when, due to circumstances beyond their control, they cease to be capable and make money.  There are such <span>types of professions</span> when it will be difficult for a person to protect himself from accidents and diseases: miners, aircraft pilots, military and others.  The most important thing is that before signing the contract, undergo a medical examination and indicate its results in the questionnaire.  Otherwise, in the event of an insurance event, the company may simply refuse to pay you, referring to the fact that you have hidden your illnesses from it. </p></li><li><p>  Health insurance.  Considering the types of insurance services in Russia, we can conclude that specifically this is not popular in the Russian Federation.  Moreover, it is mandatory in some countries of the world.  Monthly deductions in the form of insurance payments are implied. </p></li></ol><h2>  Funded system </h2><p>  When, for example, you need to go to the dentist, the company you choose will pay for the treatment for you.  This is very convenient, in addition, a good treatment is quite expensive, and not many get it right away.  Gradually, in the Russian Federation, the number of insurers who signed an agreement on medical financial protection is increasing, but these are mainly people with incomes above the average. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Property insurance </h2><p>  In the second group, the following types are distinguished: </p><ul><li><p>  Ground transportation insurance.  The most popular of this type are full and partial hull insurance.  With the design of CASCO, people can have problems.  Firstly, it is very expensive, and not all cars will do, since insurance companies set their age and cost limits for a car.  If the <span>vehicle is</span> older (mostly not taken if more than 7 years old) or too expensive, then not all insurers will want to conclude an agreement with you on their services. </p></li><li><p>  Air transport protection.  Since <span>air transport</span> is not so common, not all insurers undertake to give financial guarantees for such a vehicle.  The amount of payments under air transport insurance contracts is much higher than in the case of automobile insurance. </p></li><li><p>  Water transport insurance.  Basically, this type is made out by ship owners who want to protect themselves in the event of its collapse. </p></li><li><p>  Cargo protection.  It is a very popular type of service that is actively used in freight transportation.  It is very important to be sure that in case of unsuccessful transportation of valuable cargo, the insurance company will assume obligations and pay compensation. </p></li></ul><h2>  Liability Insurance </h2>

    <p>  The third group includes liability insurance and includes: </p><ol><li><p>  Guaranteeing civil liability of vehicle owners.  If you are asked to recall the types of insurance of this group, name the various types of insurance services, among which mention ‚Äúauto-citizen‚Äù.  It is more correct to call such a service liability insurance.  The companies call it CTP.  According to the current legislation of the Russian Federation, the <span>civil liability of</span> owners of absolutely all vehicles must be insured. </p></li><li><p>  <span>Carrier liability insurance</span> .  Also a must-see.  In this case, there is a risk of harm or damage to passengers.  The main thing (that all users of fixed-route taxis and other buses forget) is always to get a ticket.  Because traveling without a ticket is prohibited. </p></li></ol><h2>  That's not all </h2><p>  In fact, if you turn to an expert with the phrase: ‚ÄúWhat are the different types of insurance services‚Äù, then he will remember a much larger amount than indicated in this article.  In today's world, you can secure some important transactions between corporations, assets, financial transactions and much more. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="types of insurance services in Russia" border="0" class="if" height="325" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12967/774394.jpg" width="475"></div>

    <p>  Moreover, in the process of development, insurance services, the types of which are becoming increasingly connected with deposit and pension offers, are an integral part of society.  If the insurance event did not happen, then with the cumulative type of service, your money will simply be returned. </p>
