  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What are the benefits and benefits for single mothers?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Recently, the attitude towards single mothers has become more loyal.  More and more women in our country are raising children without the help of men.  Even successful and wealthy women are not afraid to take such responsibility.  Not all women are aware of the payments and benefits that the state provides to single women. </p><p>  Benefits and benefits for single mothers </p><p>  A woman is considered a single mother if she is not registered in the marriage, or if from the moment the divorce occurred, three hundred calendar days have passed before the birth of the child.  In this case, the child receives the name of the mother, and the middle name is recorded from her words.  To confirm the status of a single mother, a certificate is issued, which must be submitted to the social protection department for accrual of benefits. </p><p>  The mother, who is engaged in raising a child alone, is entitled to all the payments that a woman receives at birth.  In addition, various regions of the Russian Federation and local executive authorities are developing and paying additional benefits to single mothers, who support their financial well-being. <br>  Many regions set preferential lines for providing single mothers with places in <span>preschool institutions</span> and special conditions for payments.  <span>Single child</span> support is increased by 100% of the base monthly allowance.  Based on the Federal Law, which entered into force, indexation of state benefits is provided for in 2011. <br>  In order to receive benefits, single mothers must submit to the authorities involved in social protection of the population documents: <span>birth certificate of</span> their child, a certain certificate from the Housing Office, indicating that the minor child lives with her, and the mother‚Äôs passport.  Along with these documents, a statement of income and a statement are provided.  Such mothers are assigned a compensation payment for a child up to three years old for food.  This payment is made regardless of the income of the mother.  There are lump-sum benefits for single mothers who have not reached thirty years of age.  Single mothers enjoy the benefits of teaching a child at school.  The amount of benefits is set by the administration, in addition, children are provided with free two meals a day at school. </p><p>  The Labor Code provides for single mothers several benefits when calculating <span>childcare benefits.</span>  The employer has no right to attract them to <span>work at night.</span>  A single woman cannot be dismissed or reduced without her consent.  When liquidating enterprises, single mothers should be employed.  They can also exercise their right to <span>additional leave</span> without saving earnings at any time convenient for them. <br>  They should be provided with free trips to children's sports camps or trips to the necessary spa treatment, while not only the ticket itself should be paid, but also the travel of the child and his person accompanying him in both directions.  Single mothers have all the rights to a tax deduction for child support, which currently amounts to 2000 rubles.  If a single mother has several children, then accordingly, such a deduction should be provided for each of the children. <br>  Each region of the Russian Federation is developing its benefits for single mothers.  To find out what benefits single mothers are entitled to in your area, you need to contact the social welfare department.  You can find all the information only from them.  They will provide you with a complete list of required documents.  The center‚Äôs specialists will competently advise you on any issues that may arise and help with the preparation of certain documents. </p>
