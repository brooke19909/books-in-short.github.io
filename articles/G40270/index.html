  <section class="page js-page"><h1>USB Headphones: Model Overview</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  USB-headphone for a computer has a number of undeniable advantages over the usual models at 3.5 mm (mini-jack).  The latter work in tandem with an internal (in the system unit / laptop case) sound card and are limited by its capabilities.  While USB-headphones have their own / built-in functionality and are connected on the principle of Plug and Play.  In this case, looking for drivers or some other software is completely optional. </p><p>  Another important feature of USB-headphones is the presence of a built-in amplifier with a digital analog converter.  That is, the sound here is transmitted in a "digital", and this is already a kind of independent speaker system.  The advantages of this format are quite obvious - this is the sound quality with volumes, and advanced functionality that can be controlled directly from the headphones, and ease of use in general.  In addition, some headphones with a mini-USB port can easily connect to mobile gadgets, which again throws a stone into the garden of the usual 3.5-millimeter devices. </p><p>  Such devices are primarily interesting to gamers and those who spend a lot of time at the computer.  Compact and wireless USB-headphones with a microphone allow, for example, to conduct video conferences, presentations and not sit still, but to move around the room, showing on the board some graphs with calculations.  Well, it is very important for gamers that all the basic settings, including sound ones, are always at hand.  And this is exactly what the <span>gaming USB headphones</span> provide <span>.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Today's market offers a wide range of devices of such a plan, and if professionals still somehow orient themselves in all this diversity, then it is very difficult for beginners to choose the suitable option.  We will try to identify the best models of USB-headphones, which are distinguished by their high-quality component and a large number of positive reviews from users.  All of the options described below can be found both in offline and online stores, so there should not be any problems with ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù. </p><h2>  Plantronics GameCom 780 </h2><p>  These are USB headphones with a microphone for a computer from a well-known and well-established manufacturer.  This model can be called a full-fledged <span>gaming headset</span> with advanced functionality.  Headphones were quite adequate price in comparison with competing counterparts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pcbuildsonabudget.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://pcbuildsonabudget.com/my-favorite-brands-for-gaming-peripherals"><img itemprop="image" alt="gaming usb headphones" class="if uuid-2458036" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2458036.jpg"></div><p>  We should also note the surround mode.  Here it is implemented very qualitatively: all musical parts differ well, and the volume itself is fully felt.  Of course, these USB-headphones are far from advanced models with an exceptional sound frequency, but the price clearly does not contribute to the highest quality. </p><p>  Ergonomics of the model at a high level.  All the main elements are located on one cup, and it‚Äôs very convenient to manage them.  In appearance, the headphones are similar to a mixture of the 70s and the future.  Color accents are placed quite competently and do not cause hostility.  In general, the design was a success, and a good half of users are delighted with it. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  The microphone in the USB headphones works fine: cuts off third-party noise, transmits sound intelligible to the interlocutor, and has competent control.  Actually, more is not required for game models.  Also worth noting are very comfortable ear pads made of fabric.  Ears from them practically do not get tired.  Of course, they collect dust and dirt faster than leather options, but they are easy to wipe and clean. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.expertreviews.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="quality headphones" class="if uuid-2458039" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2458039.jpg"></div><p>  Of the minuses, mediocre sound insulation can be noted.  Despite the closed form factor, the people around can hear sounds emanating from the headphones.  Some users also sometimes complain about the performance of the model: sometimes the cup mounts break or the microphone mute button stops working.  But these shortcomings are extremely rare and only after at least a year of use (usually negligent), so it‚Äôs difficult to call them critical. </p><p>  The approximate cost of headphones is about 2500 rubles. </p><h2>  Creative Sound Blaster EVO ZxR </h2><p>  This model can be called a full-fledged wireless headset, because the headphones can be connected via a regular 3.5 mm mini-jack, and via the bluetooth protocol via a USB adapter.  All the necessary technical component is here - a sound card and built-in software. </p><div class="photo" data-original="us.creative.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="headphones via usb" class="if uuid-2458037" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2458037.jpg"></div><p>  Despite the fact that the manufacturer does not position the model as a gaming model, it looks very gamer-like, starting with its appearance and ending with its functionality.  The surround mode is fully implemented here, so there are no questions to it.  There is also active noise reduction, which allows you to fully focus on what is happening on the monitor screen and not disturb others at the same time. </p><h2>  Headphone Features </h2><p>  Separately, it is worth mentioning the presence of such a useful "chip" as TalkThrough.  There is a special key on the headphone casing, by clicking on which you begin to hear the world around you.  Such a solution will come in handy if someone came to you on the street or they are trying to tear you from saving the virtual world with a lunch break. </p><p>  Of the minuses, it is not the most understandable control and selection of tools for adjusting the settings.  Here we are offered something like an equalizer, coupled with a proprietary and original application.  Those who have previously worked with conventional filters and familiar frequency sliders may not like this ‚Äúoriginality‚Äù.  Moreover, the cost of the model is clearly not designed for the average consumer. </p><p>  The approximate price of headphones is 12,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Sony MDR-1ADAC </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the brand positions the model as USB-headphones for the phone and in every possible way promotes them along with its Xperia smartphones, a good half of users use them on computers and laptops with equal success. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sony.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sony headphones" class="if uuid-2458038" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2458038.jpg"></div><p>  One of the most remarkable features of the device is its extremely high-quality, as well as effective tandem amplifier and <span>digital-to-analog converter (DAC).</span>  This set allows you to safely digest any music and tracks at the highest bitrate.  Music lovers respond very flatteringly about the model and consider it, if not top-end, but certainly not average consumer. </p><h2>  Headphone Features </h2><p>  Among the obvious advantages, in addition to high-quality sound at the output, one can note the exceptional build quality, as well as the practicality of the headphones.  The manufacturer prudently included a large number of adapters, adapters and cables.  There is a familiar 3.5 mm mini-jack, Lighting for ‚Äúapple‚Äù gadgets, a cord for Walkman players and other adapters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.shenzhenaudio.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="usb headphones sony" class="if uuid-2458040" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2458040.jpg"></div><p>  As such, there are no minuses here, and the only critical drawback that cannot be attributed to the technical part is the price.  Yes, the model turned out to be far from cheap, but excellent quality has never been characterized by low prices. </p><p>  The approximate cost of the model is 15,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Audio-Technica ATH-ADG1 </h2><p>  This is the premium segment, we are talking about a model without any compromises - exceptionally high-quality and professional.  <span>Full-size headphones</span> with an open acoustic design are made on the basis of the past, no less successful generation - ATN-AD700x.  On the latest model, music lovers left completely positive reviews, but here we get an excellent base plus work on the mistakes of past series. </p><div class="photo" data-original="carousell.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="headphones audio equipment" class="if uuid-2458041" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2458041.jpg"></div><p>  The tandem of the DAC and amplifier allows you to fully realize Hi-Fi sound, which you can not complain about, you can only praise.  The sound at the output is detailed and natural.  The capabilities of the headphones allow you to work with any scene, and without involving any virtual parties that mid-range devices sin. </p><h2>  Device features </h2><p>  Users separately note the convenience of the model.  For some inexperienced consumers, the headphone design may seem at least strange, but after trying everything on, it sits just perfect.  They can work, play and chat for hours on end.  All external structural elements are thought out to the smallest detail, and the model itself, according to consumers, is very ergonomic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.audiozona.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="usb headphones audio equipment" class="if uuid-2458042" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2458042.jpg"></div><p>  As a small fly in the ointment, the mute function of the microphone acts here.  Some users in their reviews complain about this decision.  To mute the sound, you must constantly hold the button, instead of pressing it once.  The decision is rather ambiguous and some did not like it.  Well, the cost of the model, of course, can not be called low.  Exceptional quality is always paired with an exceptional price.  And in this case, she is fully justified. </p><p>  The approximate price of the model is about 21,000 rubles. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Choosing devices of this plan, you must first determine your needs.  If you are an avid and picky sounding gamer, then the best option would be models in the mid-price segment, that is, more than 10 thousand rubles.  Pretentious music lovers even without extra words understand that exceptional sound can be achieved only with headphones from the premium segment, that is, the price will be in the region of 20 thousand or more rubles. </p><p>  Those who need a device for camera work, normal communication via video messengers or just listening to music from mobile gadgets will also benefit from more mundane options for the budget segment.  It is not necessary to overpay for the exclusivity of the DAC and amplifier.  But it‚Äôs also not worth it to go down to the ultra-budget segment if you do not want to burden your ears with cacophony, squeaks and other surroundings, which is peculiar to frankly cheap devices. </p>
