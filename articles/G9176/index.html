The magnificent nature, crystal clear air, especially pleased riding from the hill on cheesecakes.  I liked the Russian bath with brooms.  Around the picturesque nature, beautiful ponds, a good sauna with a pool.  Only here, many did not like the food in the restaurant, tasteless and expensive.  Tourists who came here to ride horses already found out on the spot that there were no horses. </li><li>  "White Mountain", a recreation center in the <span>Penza region,</span> tourists like the fact that here you can rent a house or set up your own tent.  Each house has its own barbecue, which is also very convenient.  Around the beautiful nature, well-equipped beach.  The guests did not like the conditions of animals in the camp zoo.  And yet, entry is paid only for those who do not rent a house, but actually take money from everyone. </li><li>  On the recreation center "Valyaevskie ozera" tourists like beautiful nature, clear water in the lake, good beaches.  Especially satisfied are those who rented a bathhouse, everything is thought out, there is access directly to the water.  Also liked the cafe.  But those who rented a house on the water, they write that they have not been repaired for a long time, they give out bad linen, it is damp in the house, they did not stay for the night.  Given the fact that the house is very crowded, the guests considered the fee for accommodation to be too high. </li><li>  At the recreation center Sosnovy Bor, guests appreciated clean pine air, a good beach, cozy houses, peace and quiet on weekdays.  Among the shortcomings are the poor roads at the entrance to the camp site, as well as the fact that on weekends it is very noisy. </li></ul>
