    <p>  Three 24-hour terminals operate on Komsomolskaya Street (houses 2, 18 and 35).  Despite the fact that it is not popular, the regional leadership decided to place them there.  If there are a lot of round-the-clock ATMs in the central part, there are only a few in remote areas.  For example, in the microdistrict of Nizhny Novgorod there is only one such one, it is located at the address: st.  Working, 36. </p><h2>  At the entrances to the city </h2><p>  ATMs of Sberbank of Ufa, the addresses of which can be found on the official website of a financial organization, are located quite densely in the city.  But what if you just left the city, and suddenly you urgently needed money?  Everything will depend on what route you took.  If we are talking about the M5, then the terminals at the following addresses will suit you: Romantikov, 3, Guards, 58/1 (Shaksha microdistrict), Cheboksarskaya, 21V;  as well as a machine in the village of Avdon on the street.  60 years of the USSR, 6. </p><p>  If you are moving along the Birsky Highway, an ATM is waiting for you in the house 3/4 daily from 8 to 17 hours.  You can also call on Syrtlanova 40, where a similar terminal operates from 8 to 23 hours.  When driving along the Zatonskoye highway, you can turn into the village of Mikhailovka, where at 42 Lenin, an ATM operates, the services of which can be used at any time of the day. </p><h2>  Where can I put cash? </h2><p>  Another topic that concerns all users of Sberbank Ufa ATMs is cash acceptance.  And in fact, it often happens that in the bustle we forget to replenish our accounts for the timely write-off of a loan.  This is fraught with serious troubles in the form of late fees and corresponding harassment by credit organizations.  To avoid this unpleasant situation, you can put money into the account you need using the terminal and not stand a huge queue at the bank branch. </p>

    <p>  The city has more than 100 terminals with which you can replenish the account you need, most of them are located in its central part.  Particularly noteworthy are ATMs operating around the clock, they are located at the addresses: ul.  Marx, 40, st.  50th anniversary of the October 3, Pushkin, 43, Lenin, 20, Chernyshevsky, 82, which are the easiest to reach.  A detailed list can be found on the official portal of the financial institution. </p><h2>  What to do if ATMs are out of order? </h2><p>  If all the ATMs of Sberbank of Ufa, the list of which is in the public domain for all comers, suddenly fail, do not panic.  You can deposit or receive money in any branch of a financial organization, however, when going there, be prepared to spend a couple of hours in lines.  However, everything will depend on where exactly you go.  Most branches now have electronic queues, which can significantly reduce the waiting time. </p><p>  It should be borne in mind that, unlike all ATMs of Sberbank Ufa, city branches do not work at night.  Most branches work from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. or 8 p.m. You can check the exact time on the official website of the bank or using search engines.  On Sundays, only three branches are open: on the street.  Pushkina, 43, st.  50th anniversary of October, 3 and st.  Sorge, 5 from 10 to 16 hours. </p><h2>  Alternatives </h2><p>  If the ATMs of Sberbank of Ufa for one reason or another do not work, and you do not want to spend your time gathering in a branch of a credit organization, you can use the terminals of other banks.  The Savings Bank of the Russian Federation has a number of partners whose services you can use if necessary.  Please note that the working hours of partner ATMs you will not find on the official website of a financial institution, there you can only find a list of companies with which Sberbank cooperates. </p>

    <p>  This method has one significant drawback - if you use the card of the Savings Bank of the Russian Federation in the terminal of another financial institution, you will have to pay a commission.  It can make up to 5% of the amount of deposit or withdrawal; more detailed information can be specified directly in the terminal itself.  However, many are willing to pay for the speed of crediting money, so they make such sacrifices. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Now that you know where the ATMs of Sberbank of Ufa are located, their addresses are in your pocket and waiting in the wings, it will not be difficult to use them.  Cash withdrawal and depositing machines are located in absolutely all areas of the village, some of them are old models, only the first function works in them, you need to pay special attention to this.  On the bank‚Äôs website, you can distinguish all terminals by function, and if you do not have access to it, you can use the services of a call center. </p><p>  A financial institution constantly offers its customers to take advantage of completely new functions and offers, which is why it is very popular.
