    <p>  The state is considered as a legal phenomenon in various aspects.  It is being investigated in connection with the historical processes of the formation of civilizations or as the main tool for the formation of associations of people.  But for this period of time, the most important point in the research of scientists and practitioners is to study it within the political system. </p><p>  The state in the political system of society is the core element.  To understand this, it is necessary to study the concept, role and, in addition, the place of the state in this structure. </p><p>  <em><strong>The concept and place of the state in the political system of societies</strong></em> </p><p>  A political system can be represented by a special structure that has both vertical and horizontal construction (depending on the ratio of its elements).  So, it can include <span>civil society,</span> political parties, <span>non-governmental organizations</span> and, in fact, the state.  The main function of the system under consideration is to provide access to the management of processes occurring within a particular country and beyond.  In this case, the conclusion may be fair - the place of the state in the political system of society can be defined as dominant. </p><p>  What explains this thesis?  The answer is simple: those features that the state possesses as an element of the system under consideration.  And they are: </p><p>  1. Special status - the interests of the people can be represented in the international arena only by the state apparatus, which is due to the presence and functioning of the phenomenon of "sovereignty". </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  2. Special powers, consisting in the fact that the state has the only right to create acts regulating all aspects of life in a specific, clearly defined territory. </p><p>  3. A special ‚Äúapparatus of legal coercion‚Äù, which guarantees the existence and functioning of the first two features, namely: the presence of the army and law enforcement agencies. </p><p>  Many jurists give additional features, but, as a rule, they only clarify the presented aspects. </p><p>  Based on the foregoing, it follows that the state in the political system of society <strong> </strong>  actually in a double position.  The first is an important element without which a system cannot exist.  And, secondly, the features presented above clearly indicate that it is at the very top of the ‚Äúpolitical pyramid‚Äù, which determines its role. </p><p>  <strong>The role of the state in the political system of society</strong> </p><p>  Exploring what responsibilities are included in the spectrum of his legal personality as the main participant in the political system, it is impossible not to determine the totality of this system.  So, in addition to the <span>state apparatus,</span> this phenomenon naturally includes political parties and non-governmental organizations, the main ‚Äúcells‚Äù of which are citizens of the country.  For the creation and functioning of these entities it is necessary to operate with special rules that effectively build and control political relationships.  This is the main role of the state in the political system of society. </p><p>  Most countries of the world prefer to observe at least a formal division of power in the country into three main types - legislative, judicial and executive.  And all these ‚Äúbranches‚Äù make it possible to build a political system.  Thus, the <span>legislative branch,</span> on the one hand, issues normative acts regulating relations within the framework of the existing system.  On the other hand, it is a goal whose achievement is pursued by parties and non-governmental organizations. </p><p>  The state also effectively engages the executive branch in the political system of society.  On the one hand, it has the ability to control the implementation by other entities of normative acts, and on the other, the country's executive bodies are the actual expression of the interests of its citizens. </p><p>  It is immediately worth noting that, unlike the first two, the <span>judiciary</span> has one but clearly defined function - to resolve disputes between participants in the political system. </p><p>  As you can see, the state plays a very significant role in the political system of society.  And, despite the fact that it is impossible to interchange these two concepts, without a state, there can be no political system, because  other subjects are actually dependent on him in a wide variety of aspects. </p>
