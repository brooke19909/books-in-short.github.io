This place is striking in its diversity of flora and fauna, beautiful landscapes and natural creations.  There are no more interesting places in the city, since it is small. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="41.8186298" data-lng="46.278130799999985" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="13"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/6/7/6/17676.png"></div><h2>  Description of the city </h2><p>  Logodekhi is a small city located in Georgia.  About 7 thousand people live in it.  More reminiscent of a village with a couple of high-rise buildings, which are located in the center. </p><p>  Nobody would visit this far and quiet corner of Georgia, if not for the national park.  Due to the fact that the attraction is gaining popularity, the infrastructure of the city begins to develop.  There are already guesthouses here. </p><h2>  Lagodekhi National Park </h2><p>  The park is located in the north-eastern corner of the country, at the very foot of the Central Caucasian ridge.  This reserve is one of the oldest in Georgia.  Its occurrence falls on 1912.  The creator of the reserve is Ludwig Frantsevich Mlokosevich.  He was a zoologist, botanist and was fond of studying the Caucasian nature. </p><p>  Previously, it was a reserve, to which access was restricted for tourists.  But in 2005, the situation changed, as these lands received the status of a national park, so they became open to visitors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Nowadays, Lagodekhi Park is a place where you can see wild and pristine nature.  Its area is 17.818 thousand hectares.  Most of the park is occupied by forests.  On 90 hectares there are various ponds.  Another 5 thousand hectares are alpine and subalpine meadows. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Trees in the park." class="if uuid-3226201" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81838/3226201.jpg"></div><h2>  Location and weather </h2><p>  There is a park in the Lagodekhi Gorge, which was formed thanks to two large spurs of the Caucasus Range.  They protect the land attractions from the east and west. </p><p>  From the stream of cold air masses that come from the north from Russia, the gorge is closed by Khachal-Dag Mountain.  In the south, the gorge is wider and enters the Alazani Valley, thanks to which the park is very warm and sunny for most of the year. </p><p>  Since the area is rich in ponds and the sun warms it well, a special greenhouse effect is formed.  Therefore, the climate here is humid and warm, it is attributed to the continental-subtropical type.  Such is the weather in Lagodekhi. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lagodekhsky park." class="if uuid-3226208" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81838/3226208.jpg"></div><p>  Georgia itself is rich in mountain ranges, but in the national park itself their number is impressive.  The climatic conditions of the highlands depend on the height of their location above sea level.  Thus, the higher they are, the colder.  The average temperature at an altitude that exceeds the figure of 19,000 m is 14 degrees Celsius in summer and -8 ... -7 degrees in winter. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Flora and fauna </h2><p>  Lagodekhi in Georgia is a picturesque corner in which there are many different representatives of flora and fauna.  In areas where forests are located, you can find such types of trees as: </p><ul><li>  Beech. </li><li>  Oak. </li><li>  Ash. </li><li>  Linden. </li><li>  Birch. </li><li>  Maple. </li></ul><p>  In addition, there are species that can be found on the pages of the Red Book.  For example: </p><ul><li>  Lapina. </li><li>  Chestnut. </li><li>  Yew berry. </li><li>  Willow. </li><li>  Caucasian persimmon. </li><li>  Aspen. </li><li>  Bear and walnuts. </li></ul><p>  More than 1400 different species of flowering plants grow in this area. </p><div class="photo" data-original="georgiantour.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beautiful landscape." class="if uuid-3226202" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81838/3226202.jpg"></div><p>  As for the animal world, in terms of the variety of species it is in no way inferior to the vegetable one. </p><p>  The latest calculations are as follows: </p><ul><li>  Vertebrate species of animals - about 130. </li><li>  Reptiles - more than 10. </li><li>  Feathered - about 150. </li><li>  Mammals - more than fifty. </li></ul><p>  The attraction of Lagodekhi (Georgia) makes it possible for tourists to see a large number of birds of prey and animals that live in the park.  Among them are: </p><ul><li>  Burial ground. </li><li>  Brown bear. </li><li>  Steppe eagle. </li><li>  Fox. </li><li>  Golden eagle. </li><li>  Wolf. </li><li>  Forest and rock marten. </li><li>  Lynx. </li><li>  The lamb. </li><li>  Falcon. </li><li>  The reed cat. </li></ul><p>  Still living in the national park: </p><ul><li>  Black grouse. </li><li>  Oriole. </li><li>  Long-nosed cormorant. </li><li>  Ular. </li><li>  Roe deer. </li><li>  Red-winged stenolase. </li><li>  Wild boar. </li><li>  Wren. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.mytravelbook.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mountain peaks." class="if uuid-3226206" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81838/3226206.jpg"></div><h2>  The main attractions of the park </h2><p>  When visiting the Lagodekhi park in Georgia, you should definitely go to the Hala-Hel lake, which was formed during the ice age.  It is surrounded by large and majestic mountains that appear black.  The water in the lake is clear and almost blue. </p><p>  On the way to the pond the tourist overlooks the beautiful meadows, which are generously covered with flowers and other smelling herbs. </p><p>  Another attraction is a waterfall called Black Grouse.  The road to it will also delight the traveler with the beauty of its nature.  Along the way, he will meet the beautiful and bustling Shromistskali river, and he will also have to overcome winding paths.  Well, the route ends near the Black Grouse. </p><p>  The height of the waterfall is 5-6 cm. You can swim in it.  People say that it is healing.  But the water in it is cool even in the summer.  Near it are sulfur springs, which form small ponds. </p><p>  There is another waterfall - Ninoshevi, whose height reaches 100 m. It is the best in the park. </p><p>  It is also worth visiting the ancient Machi fortress.  The construction is almost destroyed.  All that remains is a couple of walls and towers sprouted with moss and entwined with loops.  In the past, the building was the summer residence of the kings. </p><p>  Not far from the fortress is an old temple - a small house that seems to be buried in the ground.  Nearby is a bridge with which you can get into the gorge called Bnelis-Heoba. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bernies-journeys.at" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="A bubbling river." class="if uuid-3226207" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81838/3226207.jpg"></div><h2>  City reviews </h2><p>  Since the city of Lagodekhi is rapidly developing in the tourist area, a traveler who has visited its sights already has a definite opinion. </p><p>  Many say that a visit to Georgia in March, June and any other month is worth it.  She is always beautiful, like the Lagodekhi national steam.  Almost all the reviews are positive, but there are those people who were not very impressed by the visit to the city. </p><p>  Tourists are very surprised by the beauty of the sights and its unspoiled landscapes, fresh air, clean reservoirs and a wide variety of animals and plants. </p><p>  Lagodekhi, although a small town, but it has something that you will not find elsewhere - a national park.  It‚Äôs only for his sake to come here, because where else can you see so many rare representatives of the animal and plant world, admire the landscapes, ponds, ancient buildings and mountain peaks. </p>
