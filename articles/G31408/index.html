    <h2>  Where is Russian island located? </h2><p>  The Russian island is located in the Sea of ​​Japan, while the distance between it and the southern part of Vladivostok is 800 meters.  The capital of Primorye itself is located on the Muravyov-Amursky peninsula, recreation centers on the Russian island are separated from it by a small strait, which is called the <span>Eastern Bosphorus.</span>  The geographical object is washed by the Ussuri and Amur bays. </p><p>  The total area of ​​the island is almost 98 square kilometers, about 5300 inhabitants live on it.  The local bay, called Novik, stretches from the northwestern part of the island to the southeast and divides it into two parts.  The narrow part, located in the northeast, is sometimes called the Saperny peninsula. </p><h2>  Why exactly there? </h2><p>  Despite the fact that <span>in the Primorsky Territory there are a</span> huge number of recreational facilities, recreation centers on the Russian island are extremely popular.  Their most important advantage is low prices for the services provided.  For just a few thousand rubles, you can rent a house for several days with meals. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another important factor is the close distance from the regional capital and transport accessibility.  After the construction of the bridge in 2013, the number of vacationers here has grown significantly, since now the island can be easily reached with your own car and public transport, which runs here with enviable regularity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="recreation center on the island of Russian white swan" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15327/1006225.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews about Russian island </h2><p>  The best place in Primorye, where a recreation center that is convenient and cost-effective can be located, is Russky Ostrov.  Reviews of local travel agencies are mostly positive.  The guests of the island as a positive moment especially note the possibility of relaxing in the local bases without acquiring rooms and vouchers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Some visitors complain about too high prices, but against the background of all the other tourist bases of Primorye this seems like an unnecessary demand.  And, of course, we must not forget about the free opportunity to enjoy magnificent landscapes that look especially impressive in the winter season. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="base renaissance island russian" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15327/1006227.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  "American" </h2><p>  The recreation center "American" (Russky Island) consists of several wooden houses and cottages that surround four comfortable houses.  Each room has beds, TV, fridge, all necessary furniture.  Bed linen is provided, which is periodically replaced.  In the summer months, barbecue facilities, benches and tables are specially installed near small houses.  Most of the cottages are located a few meters from the sea. </p><p>  If we talk about the cost of living, in this case everything will depend on whether the recreation center "American" is free.  Russky Island at the peak of the season is constantly filled with tourists, and it is difficult to find a free place here.  Cheap houses are bought up quickly, the cost of living in them is 2500-3000 rubles per day.  More expensive rooms can be purchased for an amount of 3.5 to 4 thousand rubles per day.  Meals are not included in the price, however there is a cafe that is ready to feed the guests of the base at reasonable prices. </p><h2>  "Renaissance" </h2><p>  The base "Renaissance" (Russky Island, Vladivostok) is another tourist organization offering a high-class vacation to everyone.  The institution offers to use summer houses, baths, gazebos, cafes, cottages and other infrastructure at very attractive prices.  A large number of rooms of different classes are constantly replenished, the administration is expanding the number of additional services. </p><p>  The cost of renting a room for a day here is 3-6 thousand rubles, visiting the bath - 1-3 thousand rubles per hour.  When holding a buffet or other celebrations, the service of one guest is from 1.8 to 3 thousand rubles.  On October 5, 2015, the base was closed for reconstruction, it is planned that it will again work on April 29, 2016. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian island base surf" class="if" height="329" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15327/1006228.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  "Surf" </h2><p>  In search of a quality holiday, you should definitely pay attention to the Russian island.  Base "Surf" - one of the local tourist agencies, which operates only in the summer.

If you don’t want to cook on your own, you can visit the local dining room with fairly reasonable prices.
