How can this problem be solved?  Integration in pedagogy is the real way that allows former students to quickly adapt to the world around them.  That is why for any teacher it is important to mean that this concept includes. </p><h2>  Integration Prerequisites </h2><p>  The most common in the vocabulary of a modern teacher and educator is the word "system".  It implies: </p><ul><li>  educational institution as a system; </li><li>  training systems; </li><li>  a system of relationships between children and teachers, etc. </li></ul><p>  And all this is completely natural.  After all, A. S. Makarenko claimed that no tool can be considered separately from the system.  Moreover, it cannot be considered good or bad when viewed outside the complex of existing educational influences. </p>

    <p>  Inextricably linked with the system is such a thing as ‚Äúintegration in pedagogy and education‚Äù.  It gives integrity to the entire learning process. </p><h2>  Definition of a concept </h2><p>  <span>What is integration?</span>  This in pedagogy is nothing but a process, as well as the result of the interaction of various elements.  The above leads ultimately to the emergence of something holistic, new. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The principle of integration in pedagogy can be considered in two aspects.  Firstly, it is a state characterized by coherence, orderliness and stability of relations between various elements.  Secondly, the process that leads to this state.  In addition, integration is a very important indicator of the effectiveness of the entire education system in pedagogy, since it serves as a criterion for its integrity. </p><p>  The interaction of various elements in the DOW is a complex and multi-level process.  That is why there are various approaches to the definition of integration.  So, V. S. Bezrukova believes that integration is the definition of the highest form of interconnection in pedagogy.  It expresses the unity of all the components of the <span>education</span> system <span>, determining</span> its content. </p><p>  And according to the scientist O. G. Gilyazov, integration in pedagogy is an integral system of disciplines organically interconnected.  It is built by analogy with the world that surrounds a child. </p><p>  According to I.S. Serdyukova, integration is nothing more than a process of communication and rapprochement of sciences in pedagogy, which represent the highest form of transition to a higher level of education. </p>

    <p>  However, despite different opinions, the concept under consideration is invariably based on procedural characteristics.  That is why integration is in pedagogy a well-structured, multicomponent and well-organized connection of all parts of the education system.  Its ultimate goal is the self-development of the child. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The value of integration </h2><p>  A holistic system of various elements in education serves for the diverse development of children.  In addition, it contributes to the satisfaction of their interests and abilities, providing coordination of influence on the emotional, motivational, strong-willed and effective-practical sphere of the child‚Äôs personality. </p>

    <p>  The concept of "integration" in pedagogy means: </p><ul><li>  a comprehensive description of the <span>goals of education</span> ; </li><li>  a combination of pedagogical tools used in extracurricular and educational activities; </li><li>  integrity in achieving the planned results; </li><li>  the relationship of basic and additional education; </li><li>  the flexibility of organizing educational activities using various methods and forms of extracurricular activities; </li><li>  the creation of creative circles, as well as the introduction of integrative courses; </li><li>  the interaction of all elements of the educational process, society and school. </li></ul><h2>  Forms and levels of integration </h2><p>  The main objective of the pedagogical impact on the child is to teach him to perceive the world around him as a whole.  The student must be aware of the connection between objects and phenomena, in order to then draw a general picture.  In addition, the child must be able to see the thing from different angles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Effective <span>cognitive activity of</span> children becomes possible only under certain conditions, when various forms of integration in pedagogy are used.  One of them is intrasubject.  It means integration in any particular school discipline.  At the same time, disparate facts and concepts that are part of one area of ‚Äã‚Äãknowledge are combined into a system.  As a result, the training material takes the form of large blocks.  This allows you to modify the structural content of the discipline.  The advantage of this form of integration is that the student receives complete information about the material being studied.  It is also remarkable that the teacher at the same time makes the lesson more capacious. </p>

    <p>  Intrasubject integration involves the construction of a spiral structure of the presentation of the material based on the principle of concentricity.  In this case, the cognitive process can take place either from the general to the particular, or vice versa.  New knowledge is given by the teacher portionwise, which gradually deepens and expands the already existing horizons of the student in this subject.  Modern pedagogy requires conducting the educational process along the path of enlargement with the simultaneous study of related sections and topics.  In this case, the student is invited to generalize exercises and tasks, conduct independent actions on the basis of analogy, induction and comparison, draw up tables and diagrams, etc. </p><p>  Another form of integration is intrasystem.  It develops the ability of a student to use materials in one subject when studying another.  The child begins to comprehensively master knowledge, perceiving general scientific categories and approaches as a whole.  In this case, integration can be carried out in several ways.  The first one is horizontal.  He establishes intersubject communications that are based on the same scientific knowledge.  This avoids repetition and saves training time.  The second approach is vertical.  With him, interdisciplinary connections serve to form general types of thinking, including physical-mathematical, humanitarian-ecological, etc. This allows the child to create a holistic picture of the world. </p><p>  The concept of "integration" in pedagogy includes its two more forms - internal and external.  The first of these is a characteristic of the internal learning process.  External integration is carried out in the interaction of an educational institution with other structures and with society. </p><p>  Let's consider intraschool integration in more detail.  It represents the interaction and interconnection of various pedagogical tools used at several levels: </p><ul><li>  establishing internal relations (for example, intra-subject); </li><li>  the implementation of interaction between teaching aids (for example, between subjects); </li><li>  connecting material on one subject to the study of another (conducting an integrated lesson); </li><li>  the introduction of new teaching aids (conducting classes in different age groups, etc.). </li></ul><h2>  Directions of integration </h2><p>  The pedagogical process becomes more effective when: </p><ul><li>  expanding the educational opportunities of training sessions that increase the morality of the child and affect his social formation; </li><li>  strengthening the cognitive, intellectual nature of extracurricular activities; </li><li>  the use of a whole range of educational tools that blur the line between the educational process and extracurricular activities, which provides versatile development of the child‚Äôs personality. </li></ul>

    <p>  If integration is at the highest level in the educational process (this is the definition of a process in pedagogy that is not regulated by the classroom lesson system), then this is the latest high-quality education, which is a comprehensive educational tool. </p><h2>  Ideas and Objectives of Integration </h2><p>  To implement a comprehensive impact on the development and formation of the child in modern pedagogy, a multilevel model of interaction is being developed, which provides for various stages of growing up of children. </p><p>  So, there is an integration of preschool, as well as the initial stage of school education.  Primary school teacher helps kids learn the phenomena and concepts of the main educational areas.  This allows you to organize further development of objects at a deeper level.  At the same time, there is a wonderful opportunity to develop special abilities in children, which is part of the integration function in pedagogy. </p><p>  Combining the intraschool levels of education, teachers carry out comprehensive educational activities aimed at the development of the child and his education.  At the same time, the main task of the school is solved - to release from its walls a person who has stable skills, knowledge and social skills. </p><p>  At the merger of general and additional education, gifted and creative personalities are revealed.  In this case, differentiation and integration are widely used.  At the same time, pedagogy determines the direction of the child‚Äôs activity and strives for its comprehensive development. </p><h2>  General and special education </h2><p>  Currently, the state policy of educating the younger generation adheres to a new strategy.  It consists in the merging of general and special education.  This orientation makes it possible to interact between children with different health capabilities.  The main principle of such a policy lies in the humanization of society, as well as in the formation of the normal perception of people with disabilities. </p><p>  Integration in correctional pedagogy is of great importance.  The fact that releasing a person with disabilities is a daunting task.  He should have a real opportunity to participate in all forms and types of society.  This would allow him to some extent compensate for the limitations of opportunities and development. </p><p>  Integration in <span>special pedagogy</span> adheres to the idea that the life and life of people with disabilities should be as close as possible to the style and living conditions of the whole society. </p><h2>  Segregation Institutions </h2><p>  They include a whole system of <span>correctional schools, the</span> formation of which in our country was completed by the end of the 20th century.  This process was facilitated by Russia's entry into the global educational and information space. </p><p>  The concept of segregation and integration in correctional pedagogy must comply with accepted international standards that apply to persons with disabilities.  That is why the task of educating such children should be solved at the state level, since it requires both economic support and spiritual, moral, personnel and substantive organizational readiness. </p><p>  Today in Russia there is a problem of integration in the pedagogy of special education, since many children with developmental problems study in ordinary schools according to regular programs.  The reasons for this are: </p><ul><li>  lack of the necessary number of correctional (special) educational institutions; </li><li>  their great remoteness from the place where the child lives; </li><li>  unwillingness of many parents to give their child to special institutions. </li></ul><h2>  Cooperative learning </h2><p>  There are several models of integrated education.  One of them is the co-education of ordinary schoolchildren and children with WHO.  A similar educational system arose on the initiative of modern special pedagogy in Russia.  So, integrated learning in a regular class of deaf students is considered a relatively new phenomenon.  Until recently, such children fell into mass educational institutions very rarely, and even then mostly by accident.  These were ineffective integrations caused by the cultural and socio-economic conditions of our country.  Currently, this phenomenon has ceased to be a rarity. </p>

    <p>  Parents of hearing and hearing impaired children submit documents to a regular school for various reasons.  Among them: </p><ul><li>  lack of available information about the system of correctional education; </li><li>  objective assessment of the readiness of a child with WHO to attend public school; </li><li>  the prestige of visiting a general institution for children with health problems. </li></ul><p>  Regardless of the reasons for the choice made by the parents, their decision is worthy of respect and understanding.  However, the integration of the child in regular schools will be effective only for that part of the children who, thanks to early diagnosis and hard work, are close in age level to their level of development. </p><h2>  Creating Special Classes </h2><p>  Integration in the correctional pedagogy of our country adheres, as a rule, to one, the most common model.  It provides for the creation of special classes in mass comprehensive schools.  They accept children: </p><ul><li>  with impaired intelligence; </li><li>  with a delay in the development of the psyche; </li><li>  with difficulty adapting to the school environment. </li></ul><p>  Special groups can be created in ordinary kindergartens.  They accept pupils with speech, sight and hearing impairments. </p><h2>  The problem of modernity </h2><p>  Recently, the main reason for persistent student failure is the difficulty of their adaptation in the educational environment.  Because of this phenomenon, already in the elementary grades, from 20 to 30 percent of children cannot learn the material of a regular program.  This is due to the ever-increasing flow of information and its complication, as well as to the deterioration of the health of the younger generation. </p><p>  To solve this problem, <span>differentiated training is</span> organized in Russia <span>.</span>  It is based on an individual approach to the student, taking into account its capabilities and features.  At the same time, a system of classes is created in which a highly qualified teacher works, and the children are in sparing conditions.  The school environment is being adjusted to adapt to the needs and capabilities of students. </p><h2>  Education for children with mental retardation </h2><p>  When mastering the curriculum, students with ZPR experience persistent difficulties that occur due to: </p><ul><li>  lack of attention; </li><li>  low level of educational motivation; </li><li>  cognitive passivity; </li><li>  underdevelopment of memory, perception, motor skills, coordination, etc. </li></ul><p>  Such children are characterized by a limited supply of information about the world around them and low working capacity.  In order to release such a person into life, his <span>social integration is</span> needed <span>.</span>  This in psychology and pedagogy allows you to make specially created corrective educational institutions or classes.  This direction already has quite serious experience.  The organization of education for children with ZPR in our country has been carried out for several decades.  With the help of a teacher, schoolchildren overcome numerous difficulties, and half of the children after primary school continue their education together with ordinary students. </p>

    <p>  According to Russian experts, for the implementation of integration, early detection of the disease and its psychophysical correction at the initial stage of development are necessary.  Only in this case will the process of real development of the student with special needs be ensured.  The implementation of such a condition will prepare the child for integrated education in a mass educational institution, and realize its natural potential.  In addition, it will revitalize the student‚Äôs activity and create an environment conducive to its full development. </p>
