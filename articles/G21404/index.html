  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Types and use of motion sensors, DIY repair</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The issue of energy savings today is quite acute.  In light of the periodic increase in tariffs, this is not surprising.  Especially private courtyards, forced to spend kilowatts not only for the premises of the house, but also for lighting of the local area.  That is why people have to look for ways to reduce the readings of metering devices (we are talking about legal methods).  In this area, motion sensors have proven themselves well.  However, like any equipment, they can fail, which again leads to unforeseen expenses.  Therefore, it makes sense to consider such a topic as repairing a motion sensor with your own hands. </p><div class="photo" data-original="greek.dooraccesscontroller.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Such sensors can be very diverse." class="if uuid-3155513" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3155513.jpg"></div><h2>  Types of motion sensors: classification by detection method </h2><p>  Such devices may vary depending on the type.  There are 3 main detection methods: </p><ul><li>  Ultrasound.  The operation algorithm can be compared with the activity of bats - it is based on the principle of echolocation. </li><li>  Microwave radiation.  More expensive equipment, which is based on the principle of radar. </li><li>  Infrared sensors  The principle of operation is comparable to the action of a thermal imager.  Such a sensor senses a change in temperature.  If a warm-blooded object appears in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãits action, it closes or opens the circuit. </li></ul><h2>  Additional functions of motion sensors </h2><p>  Quite often, utilities install such equipment on stairwells.  However, the lighting switch is usually used by residents only when dusk thickens at the entrance.  Nobody thinks about breaking the circuit in the morning.  As a result, the motion sensor is periodically triggered all day, which leads to its rapid failure.  In addition, there is no question of any energy savings here.  It is for such cases that the manufacturer offers motion and light sensors.  Such a device will not allow the circuit to close until light falls on it.  As a result, there is no need for mechanical supply of voltage to the system or its removal using a switch. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.iclarified.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Some models of such sensors do not require connection" class="if uuid-3155546" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3155546.jpg"></div><p>  However, motion and presence sensors are not only used to control light.  It makes sense to deal with their areas of application. </p><h2>  Use of similar equipment in alarm systems </h2><p>  Motion sensors are quite common in this area.  In our time, practically no premises surrendered under protection can do without them.  No doubt, such sensors have a huge advantage over the schemes of the last century, which could only respond to the opening of a door or the vibration of a glass.  Now, even if an attacker cuts a hole in the wall, he will not be able to move around the room - security equipment will detect the presence of an outsider and will automatically send a signal to the remote control.  At the same time, depending on the switching circuit, a sound alert may also work, and a surveillance camera with a motion sensor will record what is happening on an external medium.  What will help later in the capture of the criminal. </p><h2>  Video peephole with motion sensor and its possible versions </h2><p>  Mounted lenses, which can be found on the doors of 90% of apartments, greatly distort what is happening on the stairwell.  Sometimes they do not even allow to see the person who came.  Modern video eyes are more high-tech, have a wider viewing angle and give a clear picture.  They can be equipped with their own display or the ability to connect to a freestanding monitor, TV.  Recently, video eyes with a motion sensor and recording are gaining popularity.  Such equipment allows not only to determine who came in the absence of the hosts, but can also help in the event of difficult situations.  The occurrence of any movement in the sensor's scope will provoke the automatic start of recording a video file, which, according to these laws, can even be accepted as evidence in court. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.hgtv.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="A properly installed sensor will turn on the camcorder only if necessary." class="if uuid-3155529" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3155529.jpg"></div><p>  When using equipment with its own display and self-powered, it may be a question of frequent replacement of batteries.  A peephole with a motion sensor solves this issue.  Its screen shines only in the event of a person entering the area of ‚Äã‚Äãits action.  The rest of the time the display is in sleep mode and does not consume battery power. </p><h2>  Use of motion sensors for domestic purposes </h2><p>  Such devices are most often used in private sectors.  The fact is that a motion sensor for an apartment in 2, 3 or even 4 rooms can be called useless.  Why purchase and install such equipment if there are only a few steps to the switch.  Although it happens that such automation is installed in the hallway.  This allows you not to stumble on furniture at night or not to step on a pet in the dark. </p><div class="photo" data-original="clubdejardineria.homedepot.com.mx" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="These lights with motion sensors are charged from the energy of the sun" class="if uuid-3155523" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3155523.jpg"></div><p>  For private sectors, lights with motion sensors are very convenient.  Similar modern lighting fixtures are often equipped with solar panels with a battery, which allows them to work completely autonomously.  During the day they accumulate energy, and with the onset of darkness they begin to illuminate, for example, the path from the gate to the house.  In this case, the lights are turned on only if there is movement in the field of view. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Criteria for choosing sensors: what to look for </h2><p>  The main parameter of such a device is the rated power.  It depends on it the number and brightness of lighting devices that will be connected through a motion sensor.  An important role is played by the availability of precise settings for the response time.  If this option is present, the user can easily set the required period after which the lighting will turn off. </p><p>  Viewing angle is another important parameter.  Its selection will depend on the installation location.  When directing, for example, a door, a cheaper device at 180Àö is enough, but if you plan to install on the ceiling in the center of a small room, it is better to purchase a motion sensor with a viewing angle of 360Àö. </p><h2>  Repair of motion sensors to turn on the light with your own hands </h2><p>  The first thing to do if the equipment fails is to completely disconnect it from the power.  This is best done not from the switch (it is not known whether it was installed correctly), but from the input machine.  Only after the home master has ascertained that there is no voltage on the contacts, can the device be removed and the search for breakage begun. </p><p>  Such work has many nuances and requires at least a superficial knowledge of electrical engineering, and sometimes electronics.  Therefore, if the device is expensive, and the owner is not sure that he can restore it, it is better to contact the repairman.  Lamps with motion sensors are the main source of income for such specialists.  Indeed, in our time, people quite often order them from China, which implies a high risk of acquiring low-quality goods.  Often such lamps do not work for more than a month. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.swiat-uslug.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="It is important not only to install, but also to properly build up the motion sensor" class="if uuid-3155533" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3155533.jpg"></div><h2>  A few repair tips for beginners </h2><p>  If the home master first encountered a failure of the motion sensor, you should pay attention to some nuances.  The action algorithm should be as follows: </p><ol><li>  Before dismantling, be sure to disconnect the voltage. </li><li>  A visual inspection is made for damage, cracks, after which the device is opened. </li><li>  The circuit board and connectors are carefully inspected.  If there is visible damage, burning wires or tracks, they should be soldered. </li><li>  Using a multimeter, all visible capacitors, transistors and resistors are checked.  They often fail due to power surges.  As such, protection against a similar problem in motion sensors is not provided. </li><li>  The chip cannot be verified, so if you suspect that the reason is in it, you will have to purchase a new one. </li></ol><p>  The main task is to determine whether it is worth repairing the motion sensor yourself or not to buy a new one cheaper and faster.  The cost of such devices on the market today is low, so more often masters are inclined to the second option. </p><h2>  Video tutorial on self-repair of motion sensors </h2><p>  In order to make it easier for the reader to understand how to fix a failed automatic lighting control device, a rather informative video is presented below. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="aWgeXi2J3NE" data-url="https://youtu.be/aWgeXi2J3NE" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/5/8/8/9/15889.jpg"></div><h2>  Configuring light control automation devices </h2><p>  Before you start repairing the motion sensor yourself, you should try to set it up - perhaps the problem is not as deep as it seems at first glance.  The device controls are usually located on the rear panel.  There can be 2 or 3. Each is responsible for a specific sensor function: </p><ul><li>  TIME - delay time adjustment.  After the object has left the coverage area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe device, it may take 5 seconds before the circuit opens.  up to 15 min., depending on user settings. </li><li>  DAY LIGHT - this controller sets the automatic movement of the motion sensor to the on / off mode  depending on the degree of illumination.  If you turn it all the way to the crescent icon, then in the daytime it will not work.  When turning in the opposite direction (sun sign), the device will function around the clock (set when connected to a security alarm). </li><li>  SENS - sensitivity adjustment.  At maximum settings, the sensor works even on mice.  With minimal settings - only on the explicit movement of a person. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.racer.lt" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Correct installation of the sensor is the key to its uninterrupted operation" class="if uuid-3155526" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3155526.jpg"></div><h2>  What you need to know for the correct use of such automation </h2><p>  In order to repair the motion sensors with your own hands as little as possible, it is necessary to follow some rules for their operation and manufacturer's recommendations.  The main nuances relate to the placement of the device.  They should be discussed in more detail. </p><p>  The plastic body of the motion sensor, like its lens, are a rather fragile material.  Therefore, devices should be placed in places protected from mechanical stress.  If the device is installed outdoors, it is necessary to protect it from direct sunlight and precipitation with a visor or canopy.  Such protection is often required when installing a CCTV camera with a motion sensor.  In the room, you need to pay attention so that incandescent lamps do not fall into the coverage area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe device.  The fact is that the spiral in them does not cool down instantly.  IR sensors can regard the residual temperature as human presence and trigger again. </p><p>  You should not connect CFLs to such devices.  Due to its design features, the frequent switching on and off of such lighting fixtures leads to their rapid failure - the electronic ballast (ECG) cannot cope with such a load. </p><p>  Motion sensors, at the output of which thyristor or triac elements are installed, do not always work correctly with LED luminaires.  Therefore, when purchasing, it is better to consult the seller on this issue, but it is better to carefully study the technical documentation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.botchaftwien.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Permanent lighting of a house can be very costly." class="if uuid-3155542" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3155542.jpg"></div><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  The installation of equipment such as a motion sensor significantly reduces energy consumption and increases the life of the lighting fixtures.  It is this fact, coupled with the low average cost of such devices, that has caused such a widespread use of motion sensors.  However, improper operation of the device can lead to the fact that all savings will be reduced to zero - frequent replacement of automation devices can sensitively hit your pocket, despite the low price.  So, there is only one conclusion - you should purchase high-quality products and follow all installation rules and manufacturer's recommendations for use.  Only then can you be sure that the motion sensor will last a long time without repair or replacement. </p>
