  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Potassium hydroxide. Getting, using, properties</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Potassium hydroxide is also called caustic potash, caustic potash, potassium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, and also potassium alkali.  In Latin, the name KOH sounds like Potassium hydroxide.  By its external data and <span>physical characteristics,</span> this substance represents colorless crystals with a high degree of hygroscopicity.  In aqueous solutions, KOH exhibits a strong alkaline reaction.  By conducting the diaphragm electrolysis of a potassium chloride solution, it is produced.  Due to its unique properties, potassium hydroxide has been widely used in various fields of human activity. </p><p>  KOH goes on sale in the form of massive blocks, a substance similar to flakes, as well as in the form of granules, medium-sized pieces or 40-50% solutions.  Due to the increased cost, chemical compounds containing potassium are not as common as sodium-containing ones.  The price issue has become the reason that they are used in cases where the need for physicochemical properties is not provided by sodium-containing substances. </p><p>  Being completely safe, non-combustible and absolutely resistant to slight inflammation, potassium hydroxide is a second class compound in terms of its effect on the human body.  The danger is the ingress of caustic substance on the mucous membranes and even on the skin of a person.  This can lead to severe <span>chemical burns</span> and chronic skin diseases.  Of particular danger is contact with the eyes. </p><p>  Industrial packing of a solution of potassium hydroxide occurs by pouring into steel barrels or special containers of 100, 200 or 275 liters.  In solid form, clean dry drums of 50-180 dm are used for potassium oxide hydrate.  cubic.  For a flake-like product, containers with polyethylene liners are allowed, as well as bags made of polyethylene. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the Russian chemical industry, technical potassium hydroxide meets the requirements of GOST 9285-78; for a chemically pure product, GOST 24363-80 is provided.  From abroad, KOH feeds in strict accordance with CAS 1310-58-3. </p><p>  The neutralization chemical reaction in which sulfuric acid and potassium hydroxide react to produce salt and water is known to everyone from school.  But there are other unique properties of KOH, which have found a wide scope for this substance.  It is used, in addition to neutralizing acids, also in alkaline batteries, in catalysis, in the production of detergents, drilling fluids, dyes, and fertilizers. </p><p>  Neither the food industry, nor gas purification, nor metallurgy, nor oil distillation, nor pharmaceuticals can do without the use of potassium hydroxide.  It is used in the production of a wide variety of organic and inorganic substances, paper, pesticides, potassium carbonate, potassium compounds, soap, synthetic rubber. </p><p>  One of the most important uses of potassium hydroxide is the manufacture of mild soaps.  Detergents, shampoos, shaving creams, bleaches are obtained using KOH.  Another important area of ‚Äã‚Äãapplication of this substance is to obtain a set of <span>potash salts</span> that is in demand by the industry <span>.</span> </p><p>  In the production of potassium permanganate, the process of fusion of caustic potash with manganese dioxide and the subsequent oxidation of the resulting potassium manganate in the electrolysis chamber are laid.  To obtain <span>potassium dichromate</span> , a method similar to that described above can be used.  But more often it is produced by fusing finely ground chromite ore with potassium hydroxide (alternatively carbonate), followed by acid exposure to the resulting chromate. </p><p>  Using KOH with caustic soda, significant results can be achieved in the production of a wide range of dyes, as well as a set of organic compounds.  It perfectly manifests itself as an adsorbent of gases, an agent for dehydration, a substance that provokes the loss of insoluble hydroxides, an electrolyte in <span>alkaline batteries</span> . </p><p>  And this is only a short list of descriptions of technological processes in which KOH is used. </p>
