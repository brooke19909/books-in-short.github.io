    <p>  Who is he - Mikhail Nagibin, whose biography and activities are of interest to many of our contemporaries?  Let's get to know this extraordinary, intellectually developed person closer and find out how he lived, what he did and what he aspired to. </p><h2>  Early childhood </h2><p>  Mikhail Vasilievich Nagibin was born in difficult pre-war time - in the fall of 1935, in the Rostov region, in a simple Don Cossack family.  My father worked as an airplane assembler at a local aircraft factory.  Misha inherited the love of heaven and aircraft from him. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The city of Taganrog, in which the future aircraft manufacturer was born, is located on the shores of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov and is included in the list of historical cities of Russia.  The city is very large and beautiful, with well-developed infrastructure.  Taganrog has many industrial and public buildings. </p><h2>  The Great Patriotic War </h2><p>  Little Misha met the Great Patriotic War in evacuation.  And although life in the resettlement was bitter and difficult, yet it saved the boy from terrible, monstrous memories. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mikhail Vasilievich Nagibin" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/1855987.jpg" width="475"></div>

    <p>  During the Second World War, the city of Taganrog was under brutal fascist occupation, which lasted a little more than two years.  It was a terrible time for those who stayed.  The Germans committed savage atrocities, mocking the helpless civilians.  They exterminated all Jews (about four thousand people), tortured little orphans from the orphanage, using their blood to transfuse their officers ... </p><p>  In 1943, Taganrog was liberated by Soviet troops, the air forces, infantry, landing and the navy took part in the operation. </p><h2>  Return </h2><p>  Immediately after the liberation of Taganrog, the Nagibins returned to their hometown, where eight-year-old Misha went to the first grade of school number twenty-four.  The secondary educational institution was converted by the Germans into a stable, so from the very beginning Nagibin studied in the building of a metallurgical plant, and in his free time he went with other children to restore school rooms that were destroyed and damaged by fascist occupiers.  It was then that the child first fell in love with aircraft. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The next two years, aircraft regularly flew over the city, carefully inspecting and carefully guarding the surrounding area.  Little Misha just fell in love with the sonorous and lingering engine drone of airplanes.  He excited the imagination, fascinated and captivated. </p><p>  Therefore, it is not surprising that, having graduated from the middle seven classes, young Mikhail Nagibin entered the local aviation college. </p><h2>  Youth </h2><p>  Teaching the boy was easy.  From his father, he took over not only the love of airplanes, but also perseverance, attentiveness, interest and understanding.  True, the theory did not so delight the young man as practice. </p><p>  Having been at the factory, turning in his hands tools and various kinds of details, Mikhail Nagibin devoted his whole soul to mastering his favorite profession. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="commemorative plaque" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/1855989.jpg" width="294"></div>

    <p>  After graduating from a technical school, he was assigned to one of the oldest aviation plants in Russia, located in Taganrog, where his father continued to work.  At the enterprise, the novice riveter-collector (yes, that was Nagibin‚Äôs first work) quickly gained the respect and trust of both colleagues and managers.  In less than a couple of months, as a skilled, educated guy was appointed assistant shop assistant.  Soon, the next increase would follow, but Mikhail Nagibin was drafted into the army. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  He served as an aviation mechanic in the Moscow Military District. </p><h2>  Education </h2><p>  After completing military service, Mikhail in love with airplanes returned to his native factory, where he quickly rose to the rank of master.  While in this position, the young man realized that he did not know much.  He wanted to acquire more information and skills, to become more qualified and competent. </p><p>  Therefore, Nagibin entered the Polytechnic Institute, the correspondence department.  The higher education institution was located in Novocherkassk (Rostov Region). </p><p>  At the age of twenty-six, Mikhail Nagibin received a diploma in mechanical engineering, with the opportunity to work in the specialty ‚ÄúEngineering Technology‚Äù.  By this time, the young specialist was already married and held a serious position as a master supervisor. </p><p>  Working as a controller, Mikhail Vasilievich established himself as a thorough and demanding professional.  Before making any decision, the young Nagibin devoted enough time to research this issue using the necessary literature, additional documents or research. </p><h2>  Production career </h2><p>  After graduating from the institute, a new engineer was appointed to the post of deputy chief, and a year later they were entrusted with managing the number one machine shop.  At this place, Mikhail Nagibin gained universal popularity and respect. </p><p>  Colleagues and subordinates, seeing his extraordinary mind, skilled skills, sincere enthusiasm and enthusiasm for work, did not consider the young specialist a upstart or sneak.  They highly appreciated Mikhail, gladly listened to his advice and gladly complied with his requirements. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mikhail Nagibin Rostov on Don" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/1855986.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  The position of head of the workshop was very popular with the young engineer.  Possessing all the qualities of a talented leader and having the necessary baggage of knowledge and skills, he could be in the center of production events, engage creative perception, direct the team to perform the necessary tasks and assignments. </p><p>  The leadership, watching the young, active Nagibin, had high hopes for him.  Mikhail Vasilievich was sent to take higher economic courses at the Rostov Regional Committee to improve professional qualifications. </p><p>  At the age of thirty-five, Nagibin received another serious promotion - he became the chief technologist of the airline. </p><h2>  Important task </h2><p>  The transition to a new position was marked by the introduction of a new direction at the plant.  The company was confronted with a difficult unknown task - it was necessary to begin the serial construction of the Tu-142M anti-submarine aircraft, designed to detect and destroy missile-submarine cruisers or nuclear submarines. </p><p>  In order to start the construction of a new model of aircraft construction, it was necessary to carefully study all the data on its construction, make fundamental changes to the production system of the plant, introduce the latest technical achievements and equip the production with the latest technical equipment. </p><p>  Mikhail Vasilievich Nagibin coped with this difficult and important task, surprisingly, delightfully and professionally.  The manufacture of the Tu-142M was put on the conveyor in the shortest possible time, without disruptions and misfires. </p><p>  Was the tremendous work carried out by Mikhail Nagibin appreciated?  The awards and prizes that this dedicated man has been awarded speak for themselves.  He was awarded many honorary orders and medals, as well as a new and prestigious, but incredibly complex, appointment. </p><h2>  Relocation </h2><p>  The director of the plant, where Mikhail Vasilyevich worked, saw him as his successor and really wanted to transfer the director's chair to him.  However, the top state leadership considered it necessary to transfer Nagibin to Rostov-on-Don, where the helicopter plant developed and improved. </p><p>  With what heart did Mikhail Nagibin leave his native city and his favorite place of work?  One can only imagine how it was not easy for him to leave his usual way of life, dear to the heart open spaces, dear, well-known people. </p><p>  Be that as it may, in 1976, Mikhail Vasilievich moved to another city, where he took up his immediate duties as chief engineer. </p><p>  How long did Mikhail Nagibin get used to a new place?  Rostov-on-Don is the largest city in the south of the Russian Federation, on the territory of which huge industrial enterprises are located.  Therefore, life in such an industrial working city could not but please the enthusiastic engineer. </p><p>  A year later, he already met everyone well and was able to transport his family. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Taganrog city" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/1855988.jpg" width="290"></div>  The work still occupied the main place in the life of Mikhail Vasilyevich, which did not go unnoticed in government circles.

    <p>  Four years after the move, Mikhail Nagibin was appointed director of the Rostov Helicopter Plant. </p><h2>  Prestigious destination </h2><p>  Occupying such a high and responsible post, Mikhail Vasilievich did a lot for the growth of the economy and production of not only this enterprise, but the whole city.  Under the strict guidance of Nagibin, the Rostov Helicopter Plant became the largest engineering association in Russia.  A complete technical re-equipment of production was carried out, specialized workshops were created for the manufacture of consumer goods and consumer goods, and domestic and social working conditions were improved.  The best heavy multi-purpose transport helicopters Mi-24 and Mi-26 in the Union were delivered to serial production, for which the air director received the Order of Lenin and other honorary titles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mikhail Nagibin biography" class="if" height="319" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/1856003.jpg" width="442"></div>

    <p>  While in his position, Mikhail Nagibin was an extremely honest and respectful person.  His subordinates do not remember the case that the leader was rude or insulted them.  He was famous for his enormous capacity for work, punctuality, justice and scrupulousness. </p><h2>  Restructuring </h2><p>  During perestroika, when many enterprises were pulled apart and closed, Mikhail Vasilievich managed to keep the enterprise entrusted to him.  When the difficult economic time came in production, he found an additional source of financing for his complex - he built a huge trade and exhibition center, the profit from which went to preserve the personnel and scientific and technical equipment of the plant. </p><p>  Workers on time received a decent salary, and this despite the general economic crisis in the state.  Nagibin, feeling responsible for the fate of his workers, did everything in order to improve their financial and social status. </p><h2>  Charity </h2><p>  An important contribution to the public life of the city was made by Mikhail Vasilievich, and then, when he equipped the power station for a residential village, reconstructed health-improving complexes for children and adults, repaired the school and equipped it with computers ... </p><p>  Not to list all the good deeds that Director General Nagibin did for the benefit of his city and his factory.  Therefore, it is not surprising that Mikhail Vasilyevich is remembered warmly and gratefully in Rostov. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Prospect Michael Nagibina Rostov on Don" class="if" height="392" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/1856002.jpg" width="600"></div>
