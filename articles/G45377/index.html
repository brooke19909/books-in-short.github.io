    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  Atlantica Miramare is located in Cyprus, in the ancient city of Limassol, which today is a famous and visited resort.  It is located in the southern part of this island state, on the shores of Akrotiri Bay.  The nearest airport, located in Larnaca, is about 80 kilometers away. </p><p>  The hotel itself is located directly in the center of the tourist area of ‚Äã‚ÄãLimassol.  I am glad that the hotel has its own sand and pebble beach, on which it is located.  To the sea - within easy reach, and for many tourists this is the main thing.  A bus stop is 100 meters from the hotel.  So, if you want to go somewhere, you do not have to order a taxi.  In three minutes you can walk to the center of nightlife in Limassol.  And 3 kilometers away are the historical sites of the city. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  Atlantica Miramare has everything a person on vacation might need.  In addition to free Wi-Fi, 24-hour reception, laundry, dry cleaning and other services that are available in any self-respecting hotel, the hotel offers much more. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the territory there is a medical office.  You can also call a doctor in the room if there is some kind of emergency sad case. </p><p>  Another hotel is adapted for people with disabilities.  There are ramps, elevators for access to the upper floors, parking spaces and separate rooms that fully meet the requirements of such guests. </p><p>  Atlantica Miramare also has a currency exchange, shops (souvenir and jewelry), an internet corner with computers, and car rental.  If something is needed, you can contact the staff: since the hotel staff is actively studying Russian, no one should have problems. </p>

    <h2>  SPA salon </h2><p>  All decent-class resorts have their own Welness Center.  And Atlantica Miramare 4 * is no exception. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The SPA-salon of this hotel offers a lot of treatments.  A rejuvenating program called ‚ÄúWaves of Neptune‚Äù is popular.  During the procedure, elite cosmetics produced by the French company Thalgo are used. </p><p>  Many are registered for hydromassage, mud wraps, peeling, aromatic baths, collagen and gel face masks.  Scrubs with salts of the Dead Sea, as well as a 2-day anti-stress program are popular.  Thalassotherapy using seawater and algae is also actively practiced here.  In general, the list of proposed procedures is very wide.  And you can see the full list upon arrival. </p><h2>  restaurants and bars </h2><p>  On the territory of Atlantica Miramare Beach 4 * there are several institutions where you can satisfy your hunger, with an excellent level of service.  All restaurants offer a wide selection of drinks and dishes, so setting off here is an all-inclusive service. </p><p>  First of all, I would like to talk about the Thalassa establishment.  This restaurant offers magnificent panoramic views of the Mediterranean Sea and the pools.  Breakfast here starts at 7:00.  And ends at 10:00.  If guests gather somewhere early in the morning, they will be offered an early breakfast.  But to receive this service, you need to contact the reception a day earlier. </p><p>  Lunch is from 12:30 to 15:00.  The buffet is varied, and from the original one you can note the attention of homemade meatballs (which are completely different from what we represent them), signature snacks, sandwiches and salads, as well as pizza and grill.  Dinner lasts from 18:30 to 22:00.  It is worth noting that Thalassa has a children's menu and high chairs for the smallest. </p><p>  Also in Atlantica Miramare (Limassol) there is an √† la carte restaurant The Red Room.  It serves exclusive European dishes, as well as imported and local wines.  There is a dress code, and the restaurant is open only for dinner.  There is also the Mermaid restaurant, the <span>Atlantis</span> cocktail <span>bar</span> located inside the pool, as well as the Koi sports bar and the Asteria lobby (open from 9:00 to 1:00). </p>
