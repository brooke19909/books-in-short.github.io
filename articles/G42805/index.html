They were large and not very comfortable.  Of course, one should not even talk about their functions.  However, technologies are updated every year, and now manufacturers of phones delight us with original models.  Great attention is paid to size, design and content. </p><p>  Smartphones are a kind of mini-computer, which is currently difficult to do without.  Thanks to such devices, you can not only make calls and write SMS messages, but also go online, no matter where the person is.  One of these new devices is the Fly 449 phone. Its indisputable advantage is that at a fairly low price the device is in no way inferior to more expensive copies.  The novelty has relevant technical equipment, a modern design and a large set of different functions.  It is worth noting that this particular model can be purchased by children, since its cost, in case of loss or breakdown, will not become critical for parents. </p><p>  So, let's review the new smartphone brand Fly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fly 449" class="if" height="422" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1104846.jpg" width="600"></div>
