    <p>  At an early age, young Taimanov showed his talent and ability to calculate options for moves and strategies.  He entered the chess school at the age of 11, combining it with lessons at the conservatory.  Passion for music soon grew into a professional activity.  Mark Evgenievich Taimanov toured extensively around the country and abroad with concerts and recorded several records. </p><p>  He never conducted his concert activity in parallel with chess tournaments, but alternated them.  He himself said that during the championships he rested from music, and during concerts - from chess.  ‚ÄúYou can say that I have a rest all my life,‚Äù the grandmaster jokes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Victories and defeats </h2><p>  The first success in the intellectual game can be considered the second place in the 1952 USSR championship, when the young beginner chess player lost the lead to Botvinnik.  Further, his career in this field grew, and in 1956 he already became the champion of the country.  He was invited to the competition, called in mentors. </p>

    <p>  The career of a grandmaster is associated not only with victories and successes.  So, in 1971, he was ‚Äúlucky‚Äù to meet the great <span>Bobby Fisher</span> at the <span>chessboard</span> in the quarter-finals, which took place in Canada.  The game ended in a complete fiasco for Taimanov, and after losing the championship, he fell into disgrace from government officials who decided that such a result of the match was a betrayal of the Soviet chess player.  For many years after this, Mark Evgenievich could not tour and perform, all doors were closed for him, until 1991. </p><h2>  Personal life </h2><p>  Mark Evgenievich Taimanov met his first wife at the conservatory with the light hand of their common teacher - Savshinsky Samaria Ilyich.  For a long time, they played a duet on the piano, and after a while, the relations of young people turned into romantic ones.  From his first marriage, Mark Evgenievich had a son who went in the musical footsteps of his father and also entered the conservatory. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>
