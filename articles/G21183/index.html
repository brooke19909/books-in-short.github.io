    <h2>  What made astrophysicist Charles Hyder go on a hunger strike? </h2><p>  After the Second World War, the rivalry between the two superpowers - the USA and the USSR - forced each of them to build up military resources and improve nuclear weapons.  It was worth, for example, the United States to hint at the presence of another military know-how, then immediately after a short time from the opposite side there was a statement about the invention of a similar "toy".  As a result, by the mid-80s of the last century, relations had sharply exacerbated, reaching, so to speak, <span>a boiling point.</span> </p><p>  In such an environment, the figure of Dr. Hyder, a respectable, slightly flabby man, arose.  The attribute of the clothes was a knitted ski hat with a large pompom on the top, which gave its owner the appearance of an impromptu Santa Claus. </p><h2>  Justice fighter not understood at home </h2><p>  It would seem that the mass media of a democratic state should have paid attention to an outstanding person who expressed protest against the policy of military confrontation.  There was very little airtime allocated to American peace activist in such a way that only those citizens who suffered from insomnia could learn about the details of the action. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  But in India and in countries that have chosen the socialist path of development, the topic of Hyder was being developed, as they say, to its fullest.  Moreover, he was represented as a hero, devoted many publications on the pages of the newspaper "Izvestia" and television reports from the very heart of the United States.  They clearly showed notes of sympathy, and Charles Hyder received his moral support. </p><h2>  Protest rally at the fence of the White House </h2><p>  As a protest, a hunger strike of 218 days was chosen, which was dubbed the marathon.  It began on September 23, 1986, and Lafayette Park, located next to the residence of the president, was chosen as the venue.  Dr. Hyder acted defiantly and confidently.  Photos of men were published in all the newspapers of the world. </p>

    <p>  In a statement, a protester voiced the accusation of the then American president of spurring an arms race.  Reagan will inevitably appear before the court of history.  Astrophysicist Charles Hyder was determined uncompromisingly - any food will begin after the American government fulfills the following conditions: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Nuclear warheads have no place in the United States. </li><li>  Military force should not be used as a lever in resolving issues related to international relations. </li></ol><h2>  Proposal of the President of the USSR </h2><p>  Dr. Hyder received a letter from the Secretary General of the CPSU Central Committee asking him to stop further torture of the body.  M. Gorbachev also promised that if a scientist decides to come to the Soviet Union, then research work will be provided. </p>

    <p>  Hyder did not take advantage of the last offer of the president of the USSR.  Soon after the hunger strike ended, without any chance of success, he fought for the presidency as an independent candidate, the result of the campaign was the election of George W. Bush as president.  But in any case, such a person as Dr. Hyder went down in history.  A man‚Äôs hunger strike did not produce any results, but made a fuss in some states. </p><h2>  Early termination of shares </h2><p>  What did Hyder actually achieve by sitting at the fence of the White House?  He was sitting on the lawn in the literal sense of the word, because the presidential administration restricted him in comfort by forbidding the installation of chairs and a table. </p><p>  First of all, the protest had a positive effect on the state of the organism of the 56-year-old scientist.  For seven months of a tough diet, Dr. Hyder dropped 45 kilograms, which he simply needed.  Initially, body weight was 135 kilograms with a growth of 1 meter 88 centimeters, that is, there was a pronounced obesity! </p>

    <h2>  Was there a hunger strike? </h2><p>  However, one photographer claimed that after three months the doctor did not seem to him to be a haggard man.  Six months after the start of the action, further fasting was often carried out at home.  The ex-wife controlled the process. </p><p>  Hyder announced the early termination of the hunger strike on May 4, 1987, thus not reaching the planned deadline of 2 weeks.  The motivation for such an act turned out to be banal - he simply changed his mind.  But, despite this, the scientist Hyder caused a lot of talk.  The hunger strike only benefited him! </p><h2>  The stunts that were left overs </h2><p>  According to nutritionists, an ordinary person can not stand such a strict post for more than three months.  In the case of Hyder, he was helped by a body accumulated resource in the form of fat mass.  Perhaps another way to maintain the body‚Äôs vital functions was used - the intake of vitamins.  Hyder, however, denied all allegations of cunning: he drinks only warm water, and periodically (two days a week) he adds a small amount of sea salt to the diet. </p><p>  There were also ill-wishers who talked about the ‚Äúdisarmament fighter‚Äù as if he had dinner in secret at a nearby church with dusk.  He also clandestinely visits the McDonald's toilet in the evening to meet one of his natural needs. </p>

    <p>  Be that as it may, Dr. Hyder killed two birds with one stone at once: he became slimmer and became famous.  Soviet propaganda included in the list of the next fighter against evil (by which was meant world imperialism).  At one time, the legendary figures of Joseph Mauri, Leonard Peltier, and <span>Angela Davis</span> were awarded this honor with the ‚Äúhyped‚Äù news program ‚ÄúTime‚Äù <span>.</span>  Hyder's biography is known to few.  A man was born in 1930, graduated from high school and even served in the army.  He received his first degree in 1964, he studied <span>solar flares for</span> many years and even published about 50 works on this subject.  Then there was a struggle against a nuclear weapon, which glorified him. </p><h2>  Acting talent </h2><p>  Based on such considerations, Haider cannot be denied talent.  Indeed, all this was more like a dramatization, the purpose of which was to create a beautiful, impressive picture.  Before the eyes of the Soviet citizen appeared the image of a scientist who, without any support, at the risk of his health, is trying to stop the aggressive policy of President Reagan.  None of the viewers even knew that the correspondent of the State Radio and Television had resorted to tricks.  All day he shot stories, changing clothes in different costumes, changing ties, creating the illusion that every day he comes to the fence of the White House for filming.  Ordinary viewers sincerely believed in this and watched with interest the fighter against a nuclear weapon. </p><p>  Whatever the case, despite the tricks described, this man was not a swindler.  PR was still not an end in itself, Dr. Hyder sincerely wanted to ensure that nuclear weapons were eliminated.  He did not have enough endurance, or maybe allies?  It will be difficult to find the answer to this question; on June 21, 2004 this person died.  His last years he lived in a nursing home and all the time he talked about how alone he fought against an unjust state. </p>
