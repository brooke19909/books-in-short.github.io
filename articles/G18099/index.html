Today, the definitions of "Brezhnevka", "Khrushchev" and "Stalin" are used in all cities of Russia to designate buildings of a particular period.  But at all times, along with typical residential buildings, real works of art were created.  What was the name of the Stalinist skyscrapers built in the post-war years?  What is remarkable about these buildings and how did their fate turn out?  Is it true that according to the initial projects of skyscrapers in the USSR there should have been more? </p><h2>  Sparrow Hills: MSU building </h2>

There are seven buildings in total, and they are really very similar to each other.  If you don’t personally see each, it’s not difficult to mix up the apartment building on Kotelnicheskaya Naberezhnaya and the main building of Moscow State University in the photographs.  This <span>skyscraper is the highest, it</span> has 36 floors, some of which are for technical purposes.  Construction was started in 1949, and already in 1953 the building accepted students.  Today, the high-rise continues to be used for its original purpose, being the main building of the most prestigious university in the country.  It also houses a museum.  During the existence of this structure, many legends are composed.  They say that powerful refrigeration units in the basements are hidden, and secret underground passages.  From interesting facts confirmed by official sources, it is known that hundreds of prisoners were involved in the construction, however, this is a common practice for that period.

For example, the Foreign Ministry building in height has only 27 floors.  Construction took about five years, it was started in 1948.  An interesting fact is that this building should not have a spire.  Its main decoration is a large <span>coat of arms of the USSR</span> on the facade.  But when Comrade Stalin approved the project, he personally and arbitrarily drew up the vertical of greatness and ordered the construction. </p>

    <p>  There was no time for complete processing of the drawings, for this reason the spire is made of sheet steel to reduce its weight.  All seven "sisters" were to not only improve the appearance of the capital, but also to demonstrate to the common people and the whole world the greatness of the power that triumphed in a fierce war.  It is for this reason that scale and tower style are so important.  But still, due to the technical features of the project, the building on Smolensko-Sennaya is slightly different from its twins; its spire does not have a five-pointed star decoration. </p><h2>  Kutuzovsky Prospekt: ​​Ukraine Hotel </h2><p>  According to the architects, this building was to become one of the largest hotel complexes in the world.  It was partially possible to realize it, even today the hotel is included in the list of the largest in Europe.  The height of the building is 34 floors, it was commissioned in 1957, after 4 years of construction.  This magnificent building is located opposite the white house.  Not so long ago, the hotel went through a massive restoration.  Today, over the main entrance you can see the sign of the Radisson Royal Hotel, and inside, go astray, counting bars, restaurants and entertainment venues.  The thing is that in 2005 the building was sold with the condition of preserving the facade and some of the internal premises of Biscuit LLC.  Perhaps in the future a similar fate awaits other Moscow skyscrapers of the Stalin period.  Speaking specifically about “Ukraine”, the update has benefited her, but the result is obvious - not every citizen of our country can afford to stay while visiting the capital at the Royal Hotel. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Kalanchevskaya Street: Hotel Leningradskaya </h2>

If you compare it with others, the question of what the Stalinist skyscrapers were called would not arise.  Despite the modest height (only 17 floors), this style is recognizable at first sight.  The building was completed in 1954, its uniqueness lies in the facing of the facade with ceramic tiles.  At that time, it was one of the most modern materials, which did not require complex care.  The insignificant dimensions of the building are offset by a rich interior and exterior decoration.  The skyscraper repeated the fate of "Ukraine", in 2008 it was sold to Hilton.  After extensive repairs, the building acquired the status of a modern hotel, but the Stalinist luxury and romance of that period were preserved in it.

This building is unique primarily due to the used construction technology.  In one of its lateral sectors there is an entrance to the subway.  Underground buildings and an administrative housing tower were built at the same time.  The project is unique in that the house was originally built with an impressive deviation from the straight line.  At the same time, technologies similar to those used in the construction of subway tunnels, involving the freezing of part of the soil, were used.  After thawing the soil and the natural shrinkage of the structure, it became correctly vertical.  All other <span>Stalinist skyscrapers in Moscow</span> have some limited purpose.  The building on <span>Red</span> Gate <span>Square</span> stands out on this basis.  The central part is occupied by the Ministry of Transport Engineering.  In addition, the building has several large offices and a kindergarten.  In the high-rise there are also residential apartments.

    <h2>  <span>Kudrinskaya Square:</span> Aviators House </h2><p>  The history of the construction of Stalin's skyscrapers would be incomplete without mentioning the building on Kudrinskaya Square.  Alternative names are “Aviators House” and “Building on Uprising Square”.  Initially, aviation workers got apartments here.  It is believed that there was a secret KGB observation point on the upper floors, because the US Embassy is located nearby.  Legends say that there are many secret passages and black exits in a residential building.  Under the majestic building is a large bomb shelter.  Today, anyone can buy housing here, but such a purchase will be quite expensive.  One of the seven sisters has a similar fate. </p><h2>  <span>Kotelnicheskaya embankment:</span> residential building </h2>

It is believed that they were all distributed even at the stage of building houses with the personal approval of Comrade Stalin.  The most distinguished house on Kotelnicheskaya with stunning views of the Kremlin and Red Square.  Represented in him representatives of art and party leaders.  This house even has its own cinema, which, however, was not used too often.  Today, shops are also located in a high-rise, there is a post office.  The interior decoration is inferior to the interior of the Aviators House, but the main entrance of the central section is well preserved.  Today, to settle in this building, you do not need to be an outstanding figure.  Apartments are freely sold and rented for long periods, prices are high.

    <h2>  The eighth skyscraper? </h2><p>  The project of the eighth metropolitan skyscraper was approved - and construction began.  Not somewhere, but in Zaryadye.  According to many architects, the construction of this facility would seriously harm the ensemble of Red Square.  Nevertheless, the foundation was laid, but the main customer suddenly died - Joseph Vissarionovich.  For this reason, the original project was abandoned.  They did not dare to leave unfinished in such an advantageous place, and instead of high-rise, a modest structure was erected, which later became the Rossiya Hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The history of the construction of Stalin's skyscrapers" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/392312.jpg?1399592762992" width="600"></div>  The complex worked until 2006, after which there was some debate about the possibility of restoration or dismantling of the building.  As a result, it was decided to demolish the hotel.  I had to disassemble the building using exclusively construction equipment, since the Kremlin is too close.  Today, on the site of the legendary Soviet hotel wasteland, it is planned to set up a beautiful park here.

    <h2>  How did the Stalinist skyscrapers begin? </h2><p>  The history of <span>high-rise buildings</span> in the capital of Russia begins with the design of the Palace of Soviets.  You can only see it in a film of a fantastic nature.  In the thirties, large-scale construction was launched, for the sake of which the Cathedral of Christ the Savior was destroyed.  The planned height is 420 meters.  Instead of the spire, typical of the post-war Stalinist skyscrapers, the building was to be crowned with a Russian statue of liberty - a sculpture of Lenin.  The project was not implemented due to the war, during which the built part of the palace was so destroyed that it could not be restored.  As a result, a large outdoor swimming pool “Moscow” was built on the site of an unrealistic skyscraper.  They say that Stalin was thinking about translating this project into reality.  Be that as it may, only 7 Stalinist skyscrapers were built in Moscow, and they all survived to this day.  Despite the development of the construction industry and architecture in particular, these buildings are still considered monuments of a bygone era and they are known far beyond the borders of our country. </p>
