A piece of plastic measuring 5.3 by 8.5 cm has become a constant attribute of any adult.  Moreover, even children are gradually getting used to their use.  For example, many banks are happy to issue cards for them.  The variety of types of cards makes them carry whole stacks with them, there are even special wallets for greater convenience. </p><h2>  Pros of using cards </h2><p>  But as always - a double-edged sword.  The pros and cons of using cards are pretty easy to feel, leaving them at home for at least a day. </p><p>  The advantages are as follows: </p><ul><li>  you can easily pay for any purchases, both in the store and on the Internet; </li><li>  it is not so scary to lose a card as a large sum of money; </li><li>  it is more difficult for fraudsters to use their schemes for taking money from the population; </li><li>  You can save on purchases using cashback; </li><li>  discounts and promotions stores; </li><li>  no need to look for an ATM of your bank in order to withdraw cash without a commission. </li></ul><h2>  Cons of using cards </h2><p>  Now about the cons: </p><ul><li>  there is no sense of real money, and you can spend a much larger amount than planned; </li><li>  time spent on card recovery in case of loss; </li><li>  Card validity is limited. </li></ul><p>  We will dwell on this characteristic in more detail. </p><h2>  How to find out the validity period of a card, and why it is necessary </h2><p>  No one wants to find themselves in an absurd situation when, after a hard day, having picked up a full basket of products and having stood a long line, at the checkout counter he will receive a refusal from the bank, although he knows for sure that there are funds in the account.  This may be due to the fact that the card has expired and it will no longer be possible to use it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.mnn.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/responsible-living/stories/ways-to-get-through-lines-faster-least-make-seem-way"><img itemprop="image" alt="Queue for payment" class="if uuid-3205699" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/143841/3205699.jpg"></div><p>  Or, for example, a person still gets on the long-awaited bus, presents his social card for reduced fare, but here again the problem.  Card is not valid.  To avoid such incidents, you must know in advance the validity of the card. </p><h2>  Bank card </h2><p>  A bank card is perhaps the most common type of card used by people.  It is difficult to find a person who did not have at least one.  Caring parents draw up children's cards for their children in order to keep abreast of their purchases, monitor the limit of funds spent. </p><p>  For students, retirees and other types of preferential categories of citizens, payments come to the cards.  Almost all organizations have already switched to a cashless payroll system with employees with their help.  Without knowing the life of this "faithful helper" - nowhere. </p><p>  As an example, consider how to find out the validity period of a Sberbank card. </p><ol><li>  Visually inspect.  On the front side, just below the card number and above the data on the name and surname of the owner, there are four digits separated by a /.  Example: 02/21.  The first two digits are the last month of use, the second two are the year.  These figures indicate that until February 2021, you can use this plastic, and more specifically, then until the 28th (29th in a leap year) February 23:59:59 Moscow time. </li><li>  Reread the contract.  All conditions and terms of use will be described exactly there </li><li>  In the office of the bank.  In order to use this service you must bring your passport with you. </li><li>  Find out the validity period of the card by the hotline phone number.  Before calling, you must prepare passport data and a code word in advance </li><li>  Through the official Sberbank-online app.  Go to your personal account via smartphone or computer, on the main page all cards are displayed.  The validity period is indicated next to the card icon and its number. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Card expiration through the application" class="if uuid-3204947" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/143841/3204947.jpg"></div><h2>  Social card </h2><p>  The social card is intended for privileged categories of citizens receiving various measures of social assistance.  Their holders include pensioners, schoolchildren, pregnant women, or residents of a particular area in which special regional cards like the Muscovite cards are valid. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Preferential categories for a social card" class="if uuid-3204950" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/143841/3204950.jpg"></div><p>  How to find out the validity period of a social card, consider for example.  The Muscovite Card is issued to residents of Moscow with permanent registration and provides access to the benefits of urban infrastructure, such as free travel, an appointment with a doctor along with a medical policy, discounts on meals in educational institutions, social taxis and other discounts on goods and services. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="SCM features" class="if uuid-3204952" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/143841/3204952.jpg"></div><p>  To use all the delights of this tool, it is extremely important to know the duration of its action.  As with a bank card, a lot of useful information can be found on its front side.  Validity is no exception.  The month and year of end of use is determined by the same principle.  A distinctive feature is that re-issuance of this card is not done in advance.  Track all the deadlines have to do it yourself. </p><h2>  Diagnostic card </h2><p>  The presence of this type of card is a prerequisite for obtaining CTP insurance.  Without this document, no insurance company will contact the client, because it is he who ensures that the machine is technically sound.  An exception may be cases specified in the legislation: </p><ul><li>  a car no older than three years from the date of issue </li><li>  temporary insurance is issued (no more than 20 days) </li><li>  the previous owner has already drawn up a card, while it is valid at the moment </li></ul><p>  In all other circumstances, the card should be.  You can find out the <span>validity period of a diagnostic card by</span> looking at the form.  In the upper right corner is the information you need.  You can find out the validity period of the card in another way.  To do this, go to the EAISTO traffic police database and enter the data of your car.  As a result, data on the release date, validity period and other individual characteristics of the vehicle will be presented. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Checking the term of the diagnostic card" class="if uuid-3204948" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/143841/3204948.jpg"></div><p>  In conclusion, it should be said that everyone decides how to find out the validity of the card, the main thing is to do it on time in order to do without negative consequences. </p>
