Getting to it on your own will not be a problem - the signs will indicate the right path. </p><p>  Vacationers in the village of Lazarevskoye go along Victory Street towards Tuapse, cross the small river Svirka, turn right, and then follow the information signs established specifically for tourists. </p><p>  You can get to the Minutka cafe by city buses, from there turn onto Svirskaya Street and walk along the stream no more than 800 meters.  As experienced travelers say, one road leads to the canyon, so it's simply impossible to get lost. </p><p>  The cost of visiting a unique creation of nature is one hundred rubles.  At the box office you can also purchase a map on which a route is marked for backpackers traveling to the Svirsky Gorge.  For motorists, a special parking lot is equipped, the distance from which to the valley is no more than 500 meters. </p><h2>  Svirsky waterfall </h2><p>  So, from a green meadow intended for recreation and equipped with places for cooking barbecue, tourists go on a path leading to the Svir Gorge, where a magnificent waterfall about seven meters high meets everyone.  This wonderful place will give you many pleasant minutes, and no one wants to leave here quickly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="svirsky gorge reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1514607.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Ancient legends say that in the full moon a huge lump is gaining strength, and if you touch it, the stone will fulfill the most cherished desire. </p><h2>  Dolmen "Glory" </h2><p>  All history buffs caught in the Svirsky Gorge will be attracted by the unique Dolmen ‚ÄúGlory‚Äù, which belongs to the buildings of the prehistoric era.  It is a trough-like structure, covered with earth.  If you touch the rough walls of the dolmen, then you can feel the convex signs, knocked out by distant ancestors. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The lid of the structure cracked in half from time to time, and in the very center of the ancient slab a tree grew.  Residents call the stone monolith a place of power, and tourists touch a unique object, the true purpose of which is still unknown. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Svirsky gorge" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1514609.jpg" width="512"></div>

    <p>  It is believed that dolmens served as tombs for primitive people, from where the souls of the dead began their journey into another life.  Perhaps these are the structures by which communication with space was carried out, but so far none of the versions has found its confirmation. </p><h2>  "Adam and Eve" </h2><p>  The natural masterpiece, the total length of which is three kilometers, ends with a secluded place crowned by the Adam and Eve Falls.  This is a corner hidden from prying eyes where you can feel like the only people on Earth. </p><h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  Not a single guest of the Krasnodar Territory remains a disappointed trip to the Svirsky Gorge.  Reviews of tourists are full of positive emotions, and one of the easiest routes in the village of Lazarevskoye is well-deserved. </p><p>  The gorge is almost everywhere equipped with strong bridges and ladders with a railing, which greatly facilitate the movement of local attractions.  Tourists note their concern for the guests, because there are not many interesting places equipped with special places for relaxation, where you can have a bite to eat, take a breath and enjoy the amazing views of the Caucasus. </p><p>  Travelers who have already visited the canyon recommend storing comfortable sports shoes and bathing accessories, which are sure to come in handy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the svirsky gorge" class="if" height="289" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1514605.jpg" width="600"></div>
