Description of the hotel Park Inn (Yaroslavl)</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It's never too late to start traveling.  And traveling around Russia, in our homeland, and even more so.  The beauty and magic of the visited city open to tourists regardless of their age, gender or social status, step by step.  The ancient buildings of the architectural ensemble of the cities of our country are presented to the views of seekers gradually.  The Golden Ring of Russia, as a popular tourist destination, proves these accepted axioms in practice, captivating both compatriots and tourists of foreign delegations.  The city of Yaroslavl is a vivid representative of the popular historical route.  However, no matter how enthusiastic and captivated by the impressions of the day, a tourist may be, in the evening he will have a well-deserved rest at the hotel.  Very often, guests of the former provincial city are faced with the question of where to stay for the night and not to lose the choice.  The Park Inn Hotel in Yaroslavl is good-naturedly opening the door to its rooms for everyone. </p><h2>  Old City </h2><p>  Yaroslavl is one of the most ancient cities, thoroughly located on the banks of the Volga River.  The first stone in the foundation of the Yaroslavl Kremlin was laid by Yaroslav the Wise even during his reign of Rostov in Holy Russia, around the thousandth year of our era.  According to legend, this momentous event occurred on <span>Ilyin‚Äôs day,</span> and the first church built in the city was named in honor of Elijah the Prophet.  And the name itself was given by the name of its founder: Yaroslavov city, or (in the possessive form of those times) Yaroslavl. </p>

    <p>  The city has successfully developed.  Monasteries were built here, schools and manufactories opened, and in 1777 Yaroslavl became a major administrative center, having received the status of a province.  In Soviet times, the province was abolished, and in 1936 the Yaroslavl region was formed.  For the last three years, an influx of population has been observed in the city, the number of inhabitants according to 2014 is six hundred two and a half thousand people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where to go? </h2><p>  It is interesting to know that with such a fairly large number of people living in the city and an endless stream of tourists from different parts of the world, the city is catastrophically short of hotels.  Apart from the Park Inn Hotel, Yaroslavl could offer its guests a total of 36 <span>guest houses,</span> according to 2014 data.  Some of them are private mini-hotels with several places.  Tourists can also choose a huge number of private apartments in the city, converted into apartments for several nights. </p><p>  However, few property owners can offer their guests such a range of services during their tourist visit to Yaroslavl - a hotel, a park, as well as a railway station and almost the city center in close proximity to each other. </p><h2>  More comfortable by train </h2><p>  The most convenient option to get to the tourist city from Moscow is by rail.  Someone will say, they say, by plane faster.  It is true that the time flight itself will take much less time, but the time taken to get to the airport in the capital and from the airport to the center of Yaroslavl nullifies the benefits gained from the flight.  And for the money, such a trip will be much more expensive.  "A bus," someone will suggest another option, "is both inexpensive and comfortable."  Partly the right decision, but not at all quick, taking into account traffic jams and transport difficulties along the Yaroslavl direction of the E115 / M8 exit route from Moscow. </p><p>  That is why, after weighing the pros and cons, most tourists prefer the electric train to other options.  For all other things, it‚Äôs not so important whether you are traveling by suburban train or intercity train, in any case you will have to go to the platform at the Yaroslavl-Glavny station.  And already at the entrance to the city from the window you can see how the Park Inn hotel rises in front. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Where and how </h2><p>  The main building of the hotel is both an administrative and residential building.  The administration offers its guests free secure parking on site, a thorough and invisible room service for your eyes, as well as laundry and concierge services.  Near the reception, tourists can buy souvenirs with the inscription "Yaroslavl".  The Park Inn Hotel began operating its own fourteen-story building several years ago, now 167 residential rooms of various categories are offered for guests to choose from.  Stable Wi-Fi offers hotel customers to connect to the network for free.  The reception staff speaks three more languages ‚Äã‚Äãbesides Russian: English, Spanish and German.  Even in the capital it is difficult to find a hotel so convenient from the point of view of sociability that is undoubtedly its competitive advantage and is very appreciated by foreign tourists. </p>

    <p>  The huge tourist potential is hidden in Yaroslavl.  The Park Inn Hotel offers its customers to enjoy the beauty of the historic city, the journey to which takes only ten minutes.  In the evening, a show program is provided in the lobby, and the bar, open most of the night, will not let guests of any gender and age get bored.  For young visitors, the bar provides a children's drink card.  Children under twelve years of age can be accommodated free of charge in the room using existing beds.  Babies under two years old are provided with cots.  Disco lovers can visit the nightclub located next to the Park Inn Radisson Hotel.  Yaroslavl is rich in such types of entertainment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Brand history </h2><p>  Many guests will probably be interested in the question of why the name of the hotel has a remark ‚ÄúBai Radisson‚Äù.  What is it, what does the Park Inn Hotel have to do with it?  In fact, everything is simple.  The answer lies in the history of the brand.  The hotel name is translated from English as "Park Inn by Radisson."  This proprietary name is a trademark of the corporation.  No guest house has a legal right to copy it.  This is punishable by law, as this brand belongs to the world-famous international hotel chain SAS Radisson.  Yaroslavl seemed attractive from the point of view of doing business for the management of the corporation.  Not the least role in making the decision was played by the fact that in a city with such a strong tourist potential, there are so amazingly few hotels. </p><p>  The Radisson brand was founded in 1909 and is named after the French explorer Pierre-Esprey Radisson.  The first hotel of the global chain was opened in Minneapolis, in the United States of America, where the company is now headquartered.  In 1962, Kurt Carlson bought it and included the Carlson Campanis in its network.  Today, Radisson is a 451 hotel in 73 countries, 359 of which are located in the United States.  Awesome numbers! </p><h2>  Park Inn </h2><p>  In 2000, the Carlson chain bought out the network of its Park Inn hotels, including Park Plaza hotels, from Olympus.  Two years later, the management of the company signs a master franchise with the Residor Hotel Group network.  The main point of cooperation is the global development of the Park Inn brand in Africa, the Middle East and, of course, Europe.  Another seven hotels purchased from the Event Hotels chain are branded in 2005. </p>

    <p>  All these steps together give an amazing result.  Fourteen years after its founding, 140 hotels worldwide are already operating under the Park Inn By Reddison label.  The list of cities where the brand is represented also includes Yaroslavl.  The Park Inn Hotel does not need advertising due to its high-quality service and sincere approach.  The company's mission is to overcome all obstacles in its path and use all the opportunities encountered in the same path.  This concept was called Yes Yes Hayk, which means ‚ÄúYes, I can.‚Äù </p><h2>  Weather in the house </h2><p>  The number of rooms in the hotel chain is distinguished by the unity of style.  All rooms are decorated in bright colors and cheer up in the morning.  If this is a free-standing building (and not built into urban development, such as a hotel in St. Petersburg on the square near <span>Moskovsky Station),</span> then it is usually surrounded by a park.  Hotel in Yaroslavl was no exception to this rule.  It is especially pleasant on a sunny summer morning to open the window wide open and enjoy the fresh, slightly spicy aroma of a little cool air that has not yet had time to warm itself up in the rays of the rising sun.  The central air conditioning system is equipped with an intelligent climate control system in each room.  In winter, there is no need to set up the heating radiator with a thermostatic valve first, and then the supply air closer in the room itself.  You simply enter the desired room temperature through the controller interface, and the automation itself regulates the joint operation of all systems.  Technological progress was not spared and Yaroslavl.  The Park Inn Hotel offers its customers innovative solutions that improve comfort and pastime in the complex in many of its guest houses. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="park hotel in yaroslavl" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27789/645738.jpg" width="600"></div>

The cordial and responsive reception staff are ready to offer their customers any support, suggest or share advice, as well as inform about additional paid services, such as unlimited Internet access from several mobile devices at the same time, connection of paid channels or room service.  They will show you the sights and guide you to tourist destinations.  A wonderful park, <span>hotel, Yaroslavl,</span> a memory photo, long romantic evenings in a cozy tiny cafe in the city center or leisurely walks along the chic Volga river embankment - what else does a tourist need for complete happiness? </p>

    <p>  Shuttle taxis, city buses and trolleybuses leave from the Yaroslavl-Glavny station every few minutes to the city center.  In a few minutes they will take you to the center of the Park Inn Hotel.  Yaroslavl is rich in historical monuments.  Here you can talk about architectural monuments for hours.  No wonder the city center has recently been included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.  Vast squares, landscaped streets, low-rise buildings of the central historical quarters.  The industrial revolution affected little Yaroslavl, and in the twentieth century, with the expansion of the metropolis and the development of its residential areas, they took into account its special status of historical heritage and did not erect high-rise buildings in the buffer zone in order to avoid their obvious dissonance with historical buildings.  As a result, the height of the structures in the central part of the city does not exceed fourteen to seventeen meters. </p><h2>  Dinner in Old Bavaria </h2><p>  No matter how long you stay in the center and how much time you spend there, returning to the hotel will not be difficult.  This is what Yaroslavl is famous for.  The Park Inn Hotel can be found here always and at any time, day or night.  You just need to look at the sign or find out from the driver or passing passengers whether the bus passes the train station.  If an affirmative answer follows - here you are, this is your transport.  Only five hundred meters from the station to the hotel, its fourteen-story building is perfectly visible from afar. </p><p>  In the evening, in the main lobby of the hotel, a surprise awaits you in the form of the German restaurant Paulaner.  Here guests can enjoy fresh and unique dishes of the southern lands of the Bundes Republic.  The atmosphere of old Munich is impregnated all around.  Famous mashed potato soup, delicious Iceberg pork shank, fried meat sausages, crispy German salad - the list of goodies can be continued indefinitely, but this charm will not work.  To fully plunge into it and enjoy the cozy restaurant, you must visit it in person.  He opens his doors to visitors from noon and works until one in the morning.  In the morning, from seven in the morning until eleven, breakfast is served on its territory for guests.  By prior arrangement with the administration in the restaurant you can order various events, such as weddings, corporate parties, birthday parties. </p>

    <p>  Chic German beer with delicate foam, except in the restaurant, can also be ordered in the lobby bar.  He works until the last client and offers his visitors a wide selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. </p><h2>  Issue price </h2><p>  A standard hotel room will cost the traveler 4250 rubles per night.  Periodically, the hotel has <span>special offers</span> for accommodation, so the most budget option is to get at a price of about three thousand rubles per room.  Not bad for a hotel of this class!  Superior rooms are distinguished from standard rooms by the presence of a refrigerator, coffee machine and minibar.  For a night spent in such a room, the hotel will request from the traveler about 5000 rubles per room one or slightly higher than this figure in the season.  Well, the most expensive rooms in a hotel with a <span>living space</span> twice as large as the previous categories (48 square meters versus 24) will cost a tourist a cost of 7250 rubles per room or more. </p><h2>  Reviews will not fool </h2><p>  So, if you are still tormented by doubts about which hotel to choose, just try to imagine a quiet park, hotel, Yaroslavl.  Reviews of tourists who have already visited the Park Inn, mainly emit notes of positive.  The guests liked the location of the hotel, its proximity to the railway station, a slight distance from the city center and the ability to quickly get to historical monuments by public transport.  Hotel customers place a special emphasis on courtesy and friendliness of the hotel staff, on the cleanliness of rooms, timely cleaning and unobtrusive service.  Many praise the German restaurant, the fullness of its menu and delicious draft beers. </p><p>  To trust the opinion of those who have already been here, or try something new - it's up to you.  But remember, a good vacation is eighty-five percent of the successfully selected hotel: clean, comfortable, comfortable, helping to relax in their chambers as well as at home.  Yaroslavl ‚ÄúPark Inn‚Äù fully complies with these theses, with full confidence declaring to the client: ‚ÄúCome and feel at home!‚Äù </p>
