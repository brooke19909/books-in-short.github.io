    <h2>  Service </h2><p>  Service at Serhs Sorra Daurada Hotel 3 is by no means three-star - at the hotel, all guests are treated with respect, attention and care.  Daily cleaning is not the only indicator.  The hotel speaks seven languages!  What else can more fully show the level of preparedness of staff?  German, English, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, French and Russian!  Hotel staff are fully fluent in all of these languages ‚Äã‚Äãat a conversational level.  And this attracts many tourists, especially those who have problems in terms of learning foreign languages.  People who fall into a foreign country, where so much is unknown and unfamiliar, tend to get lost in the new language environment.  Due to the fact that the staff speaks Russian, the guest will always feel support.  Indeed, at any moment it will be possible to ask something - how to get to one place or another, which excursion is better to visit. </p><h2>  General hotel services </h2><p>  Serhs Sorra Daurada Hotel 3 (Spain) offers a host of other services besides those listed above.

    <h2>  Service level </h2><p>  Continuing the theme of service, it is worth listing some more services that the hotel individually suits.  These include the delivery of drinks and food directly to the room (on request).  Packed lunches can be provided with you.  By the way, there is a vending machine with drinks and snacks at the hotel.  As already mentioned, it is difficult for a newcomer to navigate in a foreign country.  That is why the hotel offers transfer services: guests of the country are met at the airport and escorted to it.  Guests are registered in accelerated form so as not to waste their valuable time, given that you always want to relax from the road.  Tourists can also use the services of a currency exchanger, a tour desk, order tickets, place their belongings in a luggage storage room, withdraw money from a hotel ATM, take things to the laundry room, and copy documents if necessary. </p><h2>  Registration process </h2><p>  The accelerated check-in and check-out process is another feature of the Serhs Sorra Daurada Hotel 3 Maresmo Malgrat De Mar.  Guest reviews regarding this aspect are encouraging: everyone notes that you can come to the hotel almost any time of the day (from 1 p.m. to midnight) and be settled immediately after passing a short registration procedure.  Also, the hotel does not evict, like some others, until seven or eight in the morning - enough time is given, until 10:30. </p>

    <h2>  Rest on the ‚Äúfour‚Äù </h2><p>  For a three star hotel, this is a laudable one.  Indeed, the level of service at Serhs Sorra Daurada Hotel 3 (Spain) receives mostly positive reviews, even from those people who are used to richer hotels.  To some guests this place resembles Finnish Scandics (who have something to compare with).  Many claim that this hotel, which is average by Spanish standards, can easily give odds to the Turkish ‚Äúfives‚Äù.  Again, cleaning is noted: it is not superficial, as it happens, but thorough.  All apartments have perfectly clean white towels and bedding, which the maid can change as often as the guest wants.  Smiling, correct staff is a separate issue, for the sake of such an attitude, many want to return to this place again.  Any client request is satisfied almost instantly, without any questions.  This is top class service.  And the rooms, I must say, in the hotel are tastefully decorated in the same style, which is also important, especially for aesthetes. </p><h2>  A bit of criticism </h2><p>  As you might have understood, Serhs Sorra Daurada Hotel 3 received appreciation.  But nothing is perfect - this applies to everything.  For example, families who came to the hotel with their children said that when placing an extra bed in the room it becomes a bit crowded.  However, this is logical: when you gain one advantage, something goes as a sacrifice, and in this case it is free space.  People who have already seen enough of various shows in their life do not really like animation - they are somewhat weak, as some say.  However, this applies to ordinary programs, but the reptile shows and flamenco shows are really worthy of attention, since these performances are very effective.  These performances will definitely leave a lot of vivid impressions. </p>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  What should be noted with special attention.  Variety is abundant - this phrase is ideal for describing the culinary services available to the hotel.  The buffet offers a variety of fish and meat dishes, snacks, vegetables, fruits and delicious desserts.  By the way, if the guest wishes, then dinner can be changed for lunch - but only you need to warn the reception in advance.  Breakfasts are also very hearty and varied: yogurts, pastries, fruits, freshly ground invigorating drink from a coffee machine.  Three times a week, local kava sparkling wine is served for breakfast.  And once a week - a grand dinner.  A true celebration for true gourmets, where you can try a wide variety of delicacies.  Drinks at the bar are paid, but there are very reasonable prices, only 5 euros per bottle of excellent wine.  And under such a chic dinner, you just can not help but take a good Spanish drink.  In general, as you could understand, this hotel is notable for many.  He has been working since 1996.  And for this rather large period of time I already managed to become famous among a certain, rather large circle of travelers.  And after all, this is really one of the best options in these places for a budget holiday, which, despite reasonable prices, will be held at the highest level, which has been repeatedly proved by happy travelers who managed to visit here.  Great service, excellent atmosphere, good service - all this attracts tourists again and again. </p><p>  Have a nice rest!  Spain is a country in which rest will be remembered for a long time!  She beckons with her incredible sunny beauty and splendor! </p>
