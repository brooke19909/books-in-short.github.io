Various techniques allow craftsmen to create not only the simplest jewelry, but also real masterpieces.  Among such works, flowers are also very common.  Since a rose is considered the most popular flower, it often begs the question of how to make a <span>rose from beads.</span>  This task may seem almost impossible for beginners, but if you have enough desire, a little tolerance and perseverance, then it turns out that everything is pretty simple. </p><p>  There are many different schemes that describe how to weave a rose from beads.  The results of such descriptions are obtained not only varied, but even sometimes make you look at familiar things with a different look.  But, undoubtedly, the products that are as close as possible to the original image look the most beautiful, refined.  Therefore, before <span>weaving a rose</span> from beads, a detailed acquaintance with a living flower will be correct.  This will help later in the process to properly compose the composition. </p><p>  Having set a task, for example, such as making a rose from beads, as well as any other, you need to fully concentrate on achieving the best possible result.  Quite painstaking work requires not only attention, but also accuracy.  Even if, having understood all the nuances, it seems that the task is absolutely uncomplicated, it is nevertheless necessary to proceed with its implementation, stocking up time and patience.  Only in this case, the work will bring pleasure. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Before you make a rose from beads, you should prepare the necessary supplies.  For the product you will need about 30 g of pink beads (15 g of different shades).  The flower head will consist of it, so the color is not fundamental, and you can use any other hue you like.  Also, for the stem and leaves, about 20 g of green (optional, dark or light) beads will be required, the same shade of fine wire and thick threads.  You can use floss or other types of special threads that are designed for various types of needlework.  You will also need <span>PVA glue.</span> </p><p>  A beaded rose is made up of individually woven petals and leaves.  The execution scheme is quite simple.  First of all, it is necessary to weave the petals using the parallel weaving technique.  To do this, beads of the first and second rows are strung onto the working thread, after which one end of the thread is threaded towards the other through the beads of the second row, and then tightened so that the rows are in the middle of the thread.  The middle of the flower consists of three bright rows of 13 beads, three rows of 12 beads and two rows of 11 beads.  After that, you should pass one end of the wire through all the beads in the middle row so that in the end both ends are on one side, and then fold the petal and secure it with wire.  Next, small petals are made using the same technique, starting with three beads in the first row, adding three or four beads in each next one, alternating dark and light colors so that from the bottom to the middle in the center a darkening is obtained, like real petals. </p><p>  Large petals are a bit more complicated to complete, as they consist of two halves.  First, three rows are made on one piece of wire, then you should pass through the last row the second piece of wire, bent in the form of a hairpin, and twist its ends several times.  Then weave both parts with parallel weaving, in turn fastening adjacent rows.  The sepals and a cup of green beads are made using the same technique.  When all the elements are ready, you can proceed to the final formation of the product.  To do this, it is necessary in turn to carefully assemble the flower head, twisting the ends of the wire, then attach the remaining parts in the same way.  The result should be a rose on a twisted wire leg, on which glue should be applied and wrap tightly with threads. </p><p>  Now, knowing how to make a rose from beads, you can try to make it yourself and give a loved one a unique gift.  Undoubtedly, such a gift will appeal to anyone, because it will be performed with soul and love, which significantly increases its value. </p>
