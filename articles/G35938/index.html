    <p>  Each type of collection has a circle of payers.  These include legal entities, individuals, and private entrepreneurs.  The legislation describes which persons pay taxes. </p><p>  If <span>indirect taxes are</span> paid to the budget of the country, then federal ones have slightly different functions.  There are payments that are divided into primary and indirect for organizations.  The latter are not always paid by the organization.  For example, the seller creates declarations and submits them to a government agency, but the buyer pays VAT on the goods. </p><h2>  Types of taxes </h2><p>  Federal taxes and fees include: </p><ul><li>  VAT; </li><li>  excise taxes; </li><li>  income; </li><li>  single social; </li><li>  at a profit; </li><li>  for the extraction of minerals; </li><li>  giving; </li><li>  water; </li><li>  for the use of objects of the animal world; </li><li>  state duty. </li></ul>

    <p>  The tax on mining is paid by those who use the bowels of the earth to make a profit.  The objects include all minerals located in the country.  The payer independently calculates the tax base, which is calculated from the value of the goods. </p><p>  Other taxes apply to federal taxes of the Russian Federation.  The whole system is organized competently, which is necessary to effectively attract resources to the budget.  All rules for calculation, payment, deadlines are present in the legislation. </p><p>  Each type of payment is calculated for a certain period, but there is no universal term.  <span>The tax service</span> calculates the fee yourself, and you need to pay it after receiving the notice.  If before that the amount was paid more, then the next time you will have to pay less.  In case of delays, fines and penalties appear. </p><p>  You can pay taxes by any convenient means.  Now banks, financial organizations are engaged in this work.  It is also possible to pay via the Internet using electronic systems.  There will never be a claim to a citizen who timely repays payments. </p>
