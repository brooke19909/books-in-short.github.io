For the employer or private person to transfer funds to a plastic card, you must provide its details.  You can recognize them by passport in the bank office, but you will have to stand in line for this.  It is much faster to see information in one of the thousands of terminals of the company.  To do this, you need to have an idea of <span>how to get the details of a</span> Sberbank <span>card</span> at an ATM. </p><h2>  What are the details of a Sberbank card? </h2><p>  The data necessary for receiving a salary - details include several parameters: </p><ul><li>  Card account number.  It consists of 20 digits.  This is one of the most important values ​​in the details, as it is by the account number that the organization transfers funds to the bank's customers. </li><li>  BIC. </li><li>  INN </li><li>  Correspondent account. </li><li>  PPC. </li><li>  BIN. </li><li>  OKPO. </li><li>  Name and patronymic of the card holder, as well as the first letter of his last name.  For security reasons, these user names are hidden. </li><li>  Bank address and branch number. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="time.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get the details of a Sberbank card at an ATM yourself" class="if uuid-2983402" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2983402.jpg"></div><p>  How to get the details of a Sberbank card at an ATM, and a bank client can print a check absolutely free. </p><h2>  What devices can I get help on? </h2><p>  The number of Sberbank ATMs in the country amounts to hundreds of thousands.  Each of them accepts bank cards, which means the possibility of obtaining a certificate in any of them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But there are devices with a new menu and terminals that work according to the old program.  Both types will provide up-to-date information on the card, but the way of obtaining details in old and new devices will be different. </p><p>  To know how to get the details of a Sberbank card at an ATM yourself, you need to take into account the old and new programs. </p><h2>  How to distinguish an old ATM from a new device? </h2><p>  It is not difficult to distinguish the devices: the new terminals are not built into the bank wall; their color is green or dark green.  In addition, they are thinner and not so massive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="realnoevremya.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get the details of a sberbank card at an ATM in the new menu" class="if uuid-2983405" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2983405.jpg"></div><p>  But the main distinguishing feature between devices is software.  In new ATMs, the client can receive the same information as in Sberbank Online.  Including print bank card details.  In old-style terminals, information differs from the Internet banking menu. </p><p>  In addition, older devices often use a button set.  The new ATMs are mainly touch control.  There are also mixed-type terminals in which you can type on the screen and using the buttons. </p><p>  But there are cases when terminals that look like old devices support new software.  Therefore, when trying to get a service at an ATM, you need to pay attention to the information on the screen, and not the appearance. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Obtaining details in old devices </h2><p>  In an old-fashioned ATM, it is also possible to obtain bank card details.  But only the way to get the data is different. </p><p>  How to get Sberbank account details from an ATM (through an old-style ATM)?  The following must be done: </p><ul><li>  Insert a card, enter a PIN code. </li><li>  Find the tab "My Account, Information and Service". </li><li>  Select the line "Card details". </li></ul><p>  The client can independently familiarize himself with the details without using the seal of the check.  If you need a paper version with data, you can click on the "Print" tab, and the information will appear in the form of a check. </p><div class="photo" data-original="diepresse.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get account details at a Sberbank ATM" class="if uuid-2983408" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2983408.jpg"></div><p>  How to find out the details at the Sberbank ATM, and print the document for free.  The reliability and quality of the check received in the old-style terminal is not inferior to the document from the new ATM.  Therefore, there is no difference where the cardholder will receive data. </p><p>  A check is issued immediately after the operation.  Since it is performed for free, the client can get an unlimited number of details.  If there are several accounts, you can get information on each of them.  In this case, you must choose which card the client wants to print the details. </p><h2>  How to get the details of a Sberbank card at an ATM in the new menu? </h2><p>  Getting information on new devices is just as quick and easy.  There is no commission in the new type of devices for printing details. </p><p>  How to get the details of a Sberbank card at an ATM: </p><ul><li>  Insert a card and enter a PIN code. </li><li>  Select "My Accounts" from the menu. </li><li>  Select the card for which data is required.  If there is only one score, you can skip this step. </li><li>  Click "Details". </li><li>  If paper format is required, select "Print on receipt." </li></ul><p>  A check is issued immediately after pressing the button.  After that, the client will be asked to end the session and receive a card or dial a PIN code to return to the main menu of the ATM. </p><div class="photo" data-original="r.search.yahoo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get account details at an ATM of Sberbank through an ATM" class="if uuid-2983410" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2983410.jpg"></div><p>  The check is issued in one copy.  If the cardholder is interested in receiving several copies at the same time, the operation must be repeated. </p><h2>  How to find out information on a credit card? </h2><p>  Debit card information is provided without restriction.  But credit card holders want to be in the know how to get the details of a Sberbank card at an ATM. </p><p>  It is impossible to find out information in the terminal using credit cards, except for clarifying data on the state of debt, interest rate or limit of the bank’s funds. </p><p>  It is no coincidence that the bank restricted access to the credit card account.  According to the rules of Sberbank, a credit account cannot be used as a savings account and is not subject to capitalization. </p><div class="photo" data-original="penzanews.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out details at an ATM of Sberbank" class="if uuid-2983415" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2983415.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, the client is not forbidden to transfer by credit card number, but it is impossible to withdraw funds without a commission from such a card.  Therefore, information on credit card details in the bank terminals is not displayed, as on debit products, and it is not possible to print it. </p><h2>  Receiving data for a third party </h2><p>  You can print the details at the Sberbank ATM only with your card.  If the client wants to know the account information of another person, he must contact the bank branch. </p><p>  Obtaining information by proxy in the terminal is not possible, since the proxy does not display the principal's accounts.  Relatives and spouses also do not have the right to see the data cards of their loved ones. </p><h2>  What to do if I cannot print the details </h2><p>  Having learned how to take account details from the Sberbank ATM, some customers are faced with a situation where they cannot print a check.  This happens if the device suddenly runs out of paper. </p><p>  If the cardholder doesn’t care which way to find out the data, he can take a screenshot or write down the details.  You can contact another device and print the account details there, if possible. </p><h2>  Account details: can they be obtained in another way? </h2><p>  It is easy to find out the details of a card through an ATM, but not all customers know how to find out data outside the terminal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get the details of a sberbank card at an ATM" class="if uuid-2983420" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2983420.jpg"></div><p>  The first option is to obtain information from the support service of Sberbank.  To find out the card account number, the client must give his name, surname, name, debit card number, code word.  After confirmation, the manager will provide the necessary data. </p><p>  The second option is to obtain a certificate from the bank.  Passport and card required. </p><p>  The third way is to clarify information in Sberbank Online.  To perform the operation, the client must have a Mobile Bank connected to the Sberbank card. </p>
