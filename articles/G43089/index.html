    <h2>  Neptune Fountain </h2><p>  Those who see a photo of this landmark of Batumi and its environs think that it depicts one of the decorations of some European capital.  The fact is that the fountain is made in the Baroque style and harmonizes perfectly with the building of the local Drama Theater.  Its composition combines five fragments, and in the center on a high pedestal, at the corners of which are the figures of mermaids, a gilded statue of Neptune is erected.  The fountain is a copy of the sculpture adorning the historic center of the Italian city of Bologna. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The sculpture "Love" </h2><p>  The people call this monument ‚ÄúAli and Nino‚Äù, since the sculptor Tamar Kvestidze created it under the influence of the eponymous novel by Kurban Said.  It is located at the entrance to the city and is moving, since every 10 minutes the figures move towards each other.  When ‚ÄúAli‚Äù and ‚ÄúNino‚Äù meet, they are combined into a single whole, and then again move in opposite directions. </p>
