    <p>  The Bose QC 25 noise canceling headphones are considered an active system and run on a single AAA battery.  It grabs her for about 30 with a little hours.  It is also worth noting that the model has excellent ergonomics and fits perfectly on the head.  Cups sensibly clasp ears, due to which pressure is almost not felt. </p><p>  Owners in their reviews appreciated the deep and enveloping bass, as well as the presence of a beautiful and compact cover.  Also, buyers were quite satisfied with the passive noise reduction system if the battery was dead.  Some are scared away by the price of a gadget, but judging by expert reviews, the balance of price and quality is maintained at the proper level. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The package, in addition to the case, includes an integrated and convenient remote control, as well as a removable cable, which is compatible with all Apple devices and some gadgets on the Android platform.  Many owners have designated the QC 25 as noise-canceling headphones for the metro. </p><p>  Estimated price - 23 000 rubles. </p><h2>  Bose QC 20i </h2><p>  If the previous respondent can be called the best among overhead and full-size models, then the QC 20i is among intra-channel ones.  And here the nickname "Little murderers of noise" is already appropriate.  Just like the 25th model, the QC 20i noise canceling headphones can work in active and passive mode.  To maintain active mode, a built-in battery is provided, which lasts about 15 hours. </p>

    <p>  Some owners in their reviews complain about the not-so-convenient case where the battery is stored, calling it an ‚Äúeyesore‚Äù, but after several days of work, the feeling of discomfort disappears.  Users liked the ergonomics of the gadget - the headphones do not fall out and sit comfortably. </p><h2>  Opinions of experts and owners </h2><p>  In terms of sounding, the device pleased: powerful and clear bass, bright high frequencies and well-balanced mids.  The only thing that the owners note in their reviews as a minus is the lack of an ‚Äúhonest‚Äù sound, because many musical compositions at the output are slightly embellished.  This is especially noticeable in the high and low frequency ranges.  In this regard, it remains to recommend a test drive of the gadget before buying, so as not to be disappointed after the acquisition.  In addition, the high price does not allow you to make the purchase frivolous. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The device is perfectly synchronized with all Apple products and some devices on the Android platform.  The gadget owners overwhelmingly position the model as noise-canceling headphones for the office: small, comfortable and practical. </p><p>  Estimated price - 20 000 rubles. </p><h2>  Sennheiser MM 550-X Travel </h2><p>  This model can be called a quality wagon in retro style.  The Sennheiser 550 Series noise canceling headphones look like ‚Äúhi from the 80s,‚Äù but, unlike older models, they work great. </p>

    <p>  In terms of its acoustic characteristics, this model overtakes the QC 25 in some respects: ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù sound, balanced bass quality and ‚Äúmeatiness‚Äù.  The only thing the MM 550 series loses is in noise reduction: 90% to 95% on the QC 25. </p><h2>  Owner reviews </h2><p>  Among the indisputable advantages, the owners in their reviews note the absence of wires and a long battery life in active mode.  Also among other positive features, there are other distinctive nuances that these noise canceling headphones have.  The review showed that the gadget fully supports SRS WOW HD technology, which means that the owner of the device will have excellent spatial sound. </p><p>  In addition, the model sits perfectly on the head and allows you to spend a lot of time behind your favorite pastime without any discomfort.  Well, the last moment that can become critical during the choice of headphones - a removable battery - a very rare quality, even among expensive analogues. </p><p>  Estimated price - 30 000 rubles. </p><h2>  Denon AH-NCW500 </h2><p>  This is a relatively compact model of noise-canceling headphones, which differs from the mass of others by a rather interesting control system.  The gadget is equipped with a sturdy plastic case, which perfectly resonates with leather inserts. </p>

    <p>  The management system needs to be mentioned separately.  A universal button for switching tracks, start and pause is located on both sides of the headphones.  In addition, on one of the ear pads there is a very convenient volume control in the form of a ring. </p><p>  As for the active noise reduction mode, it is noticeably weak here, when compared with previous rating participants.  However, during work or leisure, you will not hear a working Xerox or noise from the air conditioner.  Active noise reduction mode will put the battery in about 10 hours wirelessly, and after that you can connect the wires and work with a passive system. </p><h2>  User Feedback </h2><p>  Owners in their reviews speak very warmly about the model.  Almost everyone was satisfied with the noise reduction characteristics, coupled with excellent sound.  Especially good are the gadget's bass and treble, which qualitatively and ‚Äútruthfully‚Äù convey to the listener all the information.  Some complain about small dips in the middle frequencies, but this is noticeable in a number of rare compositions. </p><p>  Estimated price - 15 000 rubles. </p><h2>  Jabra Evolve 80 UC </h2><p>  The brand is still famous for its ‚ÄúBluetooth‚Äù headsets, which completely conquered the business segment.  In the new Evolve line, the company emphasized the same sphere, that is, it developed the next high-quality gadget for business. </p>

    <p>  This model is the only one of all that can be called a headset.  Other participants in the rating have a microphone, but it is built into the earphone and is located relatively far from the mouth, while the Evolve models are equipped with a specially designed bar with a hinge for greater convenience.  And if in the first case we have mediocre transmission quality due to the distant location, then in the second - everything is exactly the opposite. </p><p>  By and large, we can say that the Jabra Evolve 80 UC is not only <span>noise-canceling headphones,</span> but also a full-fledged headset, that is, ‚Äútwo in one‚Äù.  Owners in their reviews have repeatedly noted this pleasant feature, and dispatchers and streamers spoke especially warmly about it.  Also, many owners were pleased with the Do Not Disturb mode.  If it is activated, then the ear pads light up in red, thereby notifying others about the user's busyness.  The battery life of the gadget is quite acceptable and varies within a day.  There are no questions to the sound either - everything is almost perfect, and there were no critical comments. </p><p>  Estimated price - 20 000 rubles. </p>
