He was a favorite of Empress Anna Ioannovna, for several weeks he actually acted as regent of the Russian Empire.  After the death of his patron, he was arrested and sent into exile.  In this article we will tell his biography, dwell on the facts that were in reality, as well as on the myths dedicated to Biron. </p><h2>  Childhood and youth </h2><div class="photo" data-original="magazines.russ.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ernst Biron's career" class="if uuid-3117662" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3117662.jpg"></div><p>  Ernst Biron was born in 1690.  He was born in Cape Kalnciems in the Duchy of Courland and Semigalia.  Since 1737 he bore the title of Duke of these lands.  Those who do not know what country this is now - Courland, we enlighten that this is the territory of modern Latvia.  To be more precise, the western part of this state.  It is worth noting that for most of its history, the local dukes recognized themselves as vassals of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and after that the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth came to replace it.  Only in 1795 the territories were annexed to the Russian Empire, the province of the same name appeared on them.  Now it is part of Latvia.  This is what country this is now - Courland. </p><p>  At the court of Anna Biron served since 1718.  There is practically no reliable information about him before this period.  It was alleged that Ernst Biron was sent to study at the University of Koenigsberg, but this has not yet been possible to find documentary evidence. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In their studies, some historians come to the conclusion that in his youth he tried to get a job as a junk chamber with the wife of Alexei Petrovich, son of Peter I, but was refused because of his low origin. </p><h2>  Early career </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Anna Ioannovna" class="if uuid-3117663" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3117663.jpg"></div><p>  Understanding the myths and truth about Ernst Biron is not easy, much of his biography is based on speculation and rumor.  For example, Princess Dolgorukova claimed that he was a shoemaker, even sewed her uncle‚Äôs boots.  It is not yet possible to find any other evidence of this version. </p><p>  According to the memoirs of Ernst Biron himself, he served with Anna Ioannovna from 22 years old.  At her court he was secretary, ran the estate of W√ºrzau, after 1727 he was a chamberlain.  A few years before, he married the maid of honor Benigne Gottlieb von Trott-Treiden.  According to the official version, she bore him three children. </p><p>  There is evidence that in 1722 he participated in a fight with the city guard in Koenigsberg.  As a result of this clash, one person was killed.  Biron spent several months in prison, from where he was released with an obligation to pay a fine. </p><p>  With Anna several times he came to Russia.  At court he was known as a connoisseur of horses. </p><h2>  At the imperial court </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.liveinternet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Biron and Anna Ioannovna" class="if uuid-3117666" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3117666.jpg"></div><p>  After the election of Anna to the throne, he received the court position of chief chamberlain.  It is known that he was a favorite of the Russian Empress Anna Ioannovna.  This contributed to his career advancement. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 1737, the hero of our article becomes the Duke of Courland.  At the same time, he runs his own state while in St. Petersburg.  In this position, he remains faithful exclusively to the interests of Russia, does not succumb to the gifts of the Holy Roman Emperor, the Prussian King. </p><h2>  Bironovschina </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.sima-land.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ernst Biron Biography" class="if uuid-3117661" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3117661.jpg"></div><p>  The period in Russian history, when Ernst Johann Biron occupied high state posts in the empire, is commonly called Bironism.  Many contemporaries portrayed him as an evil genius, others speak of him as an uneducated, rude and greedy person.  He was regularly accused of embezzlement, executions and cruelties, the rule of foreigners in governing the country. </p><p>  It is worth recognizing that at the time there were really a lot of foreign ministers at the head of Russia, for example, Osterman and Minikh, but they were nominated by Peter the Great.  In addition, Biron was constantly at enmity.  Most senators and board leaders remained Russian.  There were many foreigners in the army and among diplomats, but the same situation existed under Peter. </p><p>  It is known that Biron was skeptical of the Russians, not hiding this.  However, many claim that he was looking for popularity among the titular nation.  During the reign of Anna Ioannovna there was a lot of political persecution, but Biron himself was not interested in them.  The persecution of political enemies was beneficial to the empress herself and to those to whom she owed her exaltation to the throne.  This is <span>Feofan Prokopovich,</span> Saltykov, Osterman, Golovkin.  Anna Ioannovna, who by law had few rights to the throne, was jealous of the fact that they were talking about this among the people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The stories about Biron‚Äôs self-interest are mainly based on the assertions of the historian Boltin, who claimed that the empress‚Äôs favorite took away millions of arrears, which ultimately ruined the state.  This was not proved, as was the claim that Biron exploited the best Russian mining plants and various other industries in his favor.  At the same time, there is irrefutable evidence that he rejected large cash gifts, which at that time were in the order of things. </p><p>  Summing up the story about the biography of Ernst Johann Biron, it should be noted that his activities under Anna Ioannovna and the degree of influence exerted cannot be precisely determined. </p><h2>  Regent of the Russian Empire </h2><p>  Despite the influence that Biron exerted on the empress, he was nominated as regent by the Russian nobles.  These were Trubetskoy, Cherkassky, Golovin, Kurakin, Bestuzhev-Ryumin. </p><p>  The Duke of Courland and Semigalia became regent after the death of Anna by virtue of her will.  He actively sought popularity among Russian society, conscientiously set about fulfilling his duties. </p><p>  However, Biron's days were numbered.  Almost on the first day of his regency, a conspiracy was unveiled, the purpose of which was to eliminate it.  The Generals and the Senate at the same time sided with Biron. </p><h2>  Arrest </h2><div class="photo" data-original="aminpro.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ivan VI" class="if uuid-3117669" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3117669.jpg"></div><p>  Field Marshal Minich offered his services to the mother of a young Ivan VI Anna Leopoldovna.  On the night of November 9, he committed the arrest of Biron with his wife.  The regent was sent to the guardhouse. </p><p>  The main accusations that were brought against him are related to the seizure of the regency, neglect of the health of the late empress, oppression of the Russians, desire to seize the throne. </p><p>  In April 1741, a manifesto was issued listing all of Biron's crimes.  He was sentenced to death by quartering, but was pardoned immediately, replacing her with an eternal exile in Pelym.  Now it is a village in the Sverdlovsk region.  Contemporaries say that Biron was in a gloomy mood, preparing for death. </p><h2>  Return from link </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.tury.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ernst Biron with his wife" class="if uuid-3117660" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3117660.jpg"></div><p>  True, Biron did not have to stay in Pelym for a long time.  When Elizabeth became empress, she remembered the services he rendered to her and transferred to Yaroslavl.  However, she did not dare to give complete freedom. </p><p>  Peter III returned the hero of our article to Petersburg.  At the same time, he returned to him all the insignia and the order, except for the Duchy of Courland, which he had already promised to his uncle George Golshtinsky. </p><p>  Catherine II already restored the temporary worker on the throne in Courland.  At the same time, Biron was obliged to let Russian troops pass through the territory of his duchy, not to enter into any relations with the enemies of the empire, to support the Orthodox, allowing them to build churches. </p><p>  These conditions did not suit the nobility of Courland.  As a result, Biron refused the title in favor of his son Peter. </p><h2>  Death </h2><div class="photo" data-original="lookmytrips.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mitava Palace" class="if uuid-3117670" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3117670.jpg"></div><p>  Biron died in 1772 at the age of 82 in the city of Mitava, which at that time was the capital of the Duchy of Courland.  Now it is Jelgava, located in the territory of modern Latvia. </p><p>  He was buried in the ducal crypt of the Mitava Palace, the largest tomb of the Baroque palace in the whole Baltic. </p><h2>  Characteristic </h2><p>  Biron had a mostly negative attitude, although, as Pushkin noted, his main misfortune was that he was born German.  As a result, all the negativity that had accumulated from the reign of Anna Ivanovna fell on him.  It was in the spirit of the people of that time. </p><p>  Count Minich claimed that Biron had two passions.  One to riding and horses.  He even convinced the empress of the need to establish horse factories in Russia.  Tribal stallions were brought from Naples, Persia, Arabia, Spain and England.  His second passion is play.  He could not spend a single day without cards, he always played big, finding profit for himself in this.  Outwardly, he was very attractive, devoted to the empress and insinuating.  He almost never left Anna Ivanovna.  In extreme cases, he left his wife in his place. </p><p>  At the same time, many foreign ambassadors spoke generally about Biron.  For example, the Duke of Lyria, who represented the interests of Spain at court, claimed that the favorite of the Russian Empress was well-educated and polite, advocated for the glory of his sovereign.  At the same time, a near mind remained, which made it possible for other people to control it.  For example, he never knew how to distinguish good from bad advice. </p>
