It is unlikely that the Europeans, frightened by their influx, will rush to erect new, spacious religious buildings that meet the requirements of modernity in their honor.  In multiconfessional Russia, where all religions are experiencing a rebirth, new churches, mosques and Buddhist temples are being intensively built in all its corners. </p><h2>  Three leaders in Russia </h2><p>  The largest and most beautiful mosques in Europe are located in the Russian Federation.  Moreover, the leader is constantly changing.  More recently, the Grozny beauty Mosque ‚ÄúThe Heart of Chechnya‚Äù, opened in 2008, occupied the first line, and now it was replaced by the Moscow <span>Muslim Church, which was</span> restored in 2015 <span>.</span>  The largest mosque in Europe, located in the north of the Central Administrative District of the capital of Russia, is also the highest on this continent. </p><h2>  Good gift </h2><p>  In the <span>Meshchansky district,</span> next to the restored beauty, is the Council of <span>Muftis of Russia.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the largest mosque in europe" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1050537.jpg" width="519"></div>  The largest <span>cathedral mosque</span> in Europe was opened on September 23 and became the center of the Eid al-Adha celebration, also known as the festival of sacrifice, which is the end of the Hajj.  That is, the Muslims of Russia for one of the most important dates for them was presented with a wonderful gift.

Mosques, depending on the purpose and functions, are quarterly (for the implementation of daily fivefold prayers), cathedrals, or juma mosques (for the Friday prayers performed by the whole community), and cabir, which is the central metropolitan religious building. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The largest mosque in Europe in Moscow" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1050539.jpg" width="456"></div>  The current largest mosque in Europe was erected on a historic site.  Until 2011, there was a Muslim religious building built in 1904 at the expense of the merchant Salikh Erzin, a well-known Moscow businessman and philanthropist, in memory of which a memorial plaque was installed on the facade in 1999.

    <h2>  Through all the thorns </h2><p>  The architect of the first mosque was N. A. Zhukov, who built beautiful Orthodox churches.  For example, the Church of the Intercession of the Holy Virgin in Gorodnya.  This mosque remained the only one in the city that was not closed during the years of atheism.  In 1980, it was threatened with demolition in connection with the preparation of the Summer Olympics, but the historic building was saved through the efforts of Moscow religious figures and ambassadors of the Arab countries.  The Mufti Council moved to this mosque in 1996. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hazards and black PR </h2><p>  The current largest mosque in Europe has undergone a complete reconstruction with the preliminary demolition of a dilapidated century-old building.  Although a decision was made earlier, which was canceled in 2008, it was attributed to objects of cultural heritage.  During the construction of a new mosque in the capital, originally planned by architects I. Tazhiev and A. Kolenteev as one of the largest in Europe, there were many legal proceedings.  Violations, of course, did occur, but the hype raised around such a significant object was not intended to punish the guilty, but to discredit the very construction of the building, which is so significant for Muslims not only in Moscow. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the largest cathedral mosque in europe" class="if" height="257" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1050541.jpg" width="400"></div>  After the architects turned to the mayor and the prosecutor of the capital, the situation was returned to the legal framework.  Official statements were made that the facility being built does not pose a threat to the life of believers.

    <h2>  Capacity indicator </h2><p>  And on September 23, 2015, in the presence of delegations of almost all countries professing Islam, as well as the presidents of Russia, Turkey and Palestine, the largest mosque in Europe was opened.  The building of six floors, three of which are halls for prayer, can accommodate up to 10,000 believers.  But such indicators only in Russia can boast both the Grozny mosque mentioned above and the Ufa mosque of Salavat Yulaev, which generally can be visited by up to 25,000 believers.  Yusuf Bay Jami in Makhachkala is designed for 15,000 people.  A mosque in Argun (Chechnya) is capable of simultaneously accommodating up to 15,000 believers. </p><h2>  Dimensions of the Moscow building </h2><p>  Obviously, only in combination with other indicators is the largest mosque in Europe determined.  In Moscow, the height of the dome is the same as that of Ufa - 46 meters.  However, the minarets are higher (78 vs 77 m).  And the diameter of the dome is really the largest in Europe - 27 meters.  Considering all the indicators in the complex, we can safely decide on the question of which mosque is the largest in Europe, in favor of Moscow. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the largest mosque in europe photo" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1050542.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The funds spent on the construction of this shrine amount to $ 170 million.  They include donations from believers, even on behalf of the children of Palestine, Mahmoud Abbas donated $ 25,000 during his visit to Moscow.  It only says that the Moscow object is really very significant for Muslims around the world. </p><h2>  Impressive cost </h2><p>  It should be noted that a very large part of the funds spent on the construction went to the foundation of the building, 131 piles were driven into the base, as there is Prospect Mira metro station nearby and the Moscow Metro ring line passes.  In addition, the Neglinka River flows directly below the building.  And since the territory occupied by the new building increased by 2 dozen times (18,900 sq. Meters versus 964), the objects that were on it earlier, such as a substation that provided electricity to the whole area, had to not only be demolished, but also restored functions, which, of course, increased the cost of construction. </p><h2>  Modern facility </h2><p>  The largest mosque in Europe (photo attached) is unique.  Its minarets are extraordinary in shape, one of which completely repeats the Spasskaya Tower of the Kremlin, and the second - the Syuyumbike tower in Kazan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="which mosque is the largest in europe" class="if" height="453" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1050543.jpg" width="509"></div>  Seven domes, 15 exits, screens broadcasting a prayer service for believers who did not get into prayer rooms, ramps and elevators in the amount of 7 units for disabled people make the mosque one of a kind.  A modern building that meets all the requirements, which in decent conditions can accommodate much more parishioners than declared, still hardly accommodates all Muslims in Moscow.

    <h2>  Blended and beautified the look of Moscow </h2><p>  It is necessary to stipulate the fact that the general appearance of Zlatoglava absolutely does not violate the largest mosque in Europe.  In Moscow, gold domes are a kind of calling card.  At the new cathedral mosque, not only domes, but also minarets are covered <span>with gold leaf.</span>  All this very successfully fits her into the appearance of the capital.  And the question of the need to build such a representative mosque in Moscow a long time ago, because Islam is the second largest religion of the Russian Federation, and in some republics more than 90% of the population are Muslims. </p><h2>  A successful combination of historical design and modern technology </h2><p>  It should be noted that, according to the testimony of the imams, the architects building the shrine anew managed to completely restore the historical plan of the mosque.  However, it has been updated with many exclusive elements.  All the marble that went into the interior was delivered from Turkey, where a huge chandelier of the central hall and a mihrab were made there (a niche in the middle of the wall, decorated with two pillars and directed towards Mecca). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the largest mosque in europe" class="if" height="362" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1050544.jpg" width="567"></div>  The interior itself is made in the national colors and ornaments of Muslims inhabiting the Russian Federation.  All rooms of the mosque are equipped with modern technologies.  In the future, it is planned to build hotels for pilgrims and educational institutions on its territory.
