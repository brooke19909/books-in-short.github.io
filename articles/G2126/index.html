The magnificent theater was built by order of Napoleon III as part of the great Parisian reconstruction project and was named after architect Charles Garnier. </p><p>  The palace was opened on January 5, 1875, it took fifteen years to complete, and today it is known under various names, such as the Paris National Opera, Garnier Palace and Garnier Opera House.  Currently, one of its main directions is ballet performances, since most of the operas are performed in the new Paris Opera House of the Bastille. </p><h2>  Historic Landmarks of a World Heritage Site </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.birthdayteller.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Emperor Napoleon III" class="if uuid-3241648" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/3241648.jpg"></div><p>  A true masterpiece of the Second French Empire and the Parisian Osman, Opera Garnier in Paris was commissioned by Emperor Napoleon III, who tried to satisfy the demands of high society for a great and vibrant theater.  Napoleon after the attack in the old cramped street theater Le Pelletier decided that the time had come for a new theater that would not only be safer, but would also strengthen France's international authority, showing it to the whole world. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Before construction, a competition was held.  To everyone‚Äôs surprise, the young and unknown Charles Garnier won it, despite the fact that such well-known modern architects as Fleury, the architect of Paris, and Viollet-le-Duc, the empress's favorite, took part in it.  The construction of the Opera Garnier in Paris (France) began in 1860 and lasted 15 years. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.walmart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Architect Charles Garnier" class="if uuid-3241660" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/3241660.jpg"></div><p>  When developing this monumental masterpiece, Charles Garnier drew his inspiration from the best achievements of the architecture of the past, and at the same time, the Palace was different from everything that existed in the world at that time.  The stunning facade reflects the wide range of materials used, causing a sense of surprise.  He markedly distinguished the building from the dull, typically gray monochrome city monuments.  When entering inside, it is difficult to understand exactly what the main artistic plan is, there is a place for everything: bas-reliefs, candelabra, statues, numerous baroque ornaments, columns, and, of course, luxurious mineral ornaments. </p><p>  Honey Roof.  It is widely known that on the roof of the palace, bees collect honey.  More than 300 kg of honey is produced annually; it can be bought at the outlet gift shop. </p><p>  The history of the Opera Garnier in Paris is riddled with various legends.  Few tourists know that there is a hidden artificial lake under the building.  During the construction of the foundation, Charles Garnier faced a swampy and unstable area, in order to solve this problem, a special ‚Äúreservoir‚Äù was created, filled with water, providing impermeability and stability, which could be used as a fire tank. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There is a legend associated with this pond about the famous opera ghost.  It says that the young man lived for many years near the lake, eating only fish, which can be found there to this day.  After his death, he began to appear in the palace in the form of a ghost.  According to this legend, Gaston Leroux in 1909 wrote his famous novel ‚ÄúThe Phantom of the Opera‚Äù. </p><h2>  Little-known facts about the Paris Opera </h2><p>  1681, The Opera Ballet first opened its doors to female dancers. </p><p>  1847, Giuseppe Verdi wrote his first grandiose opera Sisal for the Royal Academy of Music.  Verdi always had an ambiguous relationship with the Paris Opera, he never refused orders, but constantly complained about the requirements for what he called the ‚ÄúLa Grande boutique‚Äù. </p><p>  On January 14, 1858, when Napoleon III arrived at the Opera on his carriage, Italian anarchists employed by Felice Orsini dropped bombs on the crowd.  The emperor and his wife miraculously escaped, but as a result of the explosion, eight people died and nearly five hundred were injured.  The next day, the emperor decided to build a new opera house. </p><p>  October 28-29, 1873 Salle Le Peletier burned out due to a fire that raged for more than twenty-four hours, its causes are still unknown.  The opera was forced to relocate to Salle Ventadour until the new Opera Garnier in Paris was repaired. </p><p>  1982, believing that the scale of the Palace was insufficient, President Francois Mitterrand decided to build a new modern opera house in Paris.  A competition was organized in which 1,700 architects took part, presenting a total of 756 projects. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.dezeen.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Grand Opening of the Bastille Opera" class="if uuid-3241662" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/3241662.jpg"></div><p>  On July 13, 1989, the Grand Opening of the Opera of the Bastille took place as part of the celebration of the bicentennial of the French Revolution. </p><p>  1990, The Bastille Palace and Opera combine into the Paris Opera.  The first opera performance in the new building took place in March - ‚ÄúThe Trojans‚Äù by Hector Berlioz staged by Luigi Pizzi, directed by the music director of the Paris Opera Men-Woon Chung.  The first season of the Opera Bastille began in September of that year. </p><p>  1994, Opera Garnier in Paris received National status.  The change of name testified to his intention to expand the scope beyond the capital. </p><h2>  The architectural features of the Palace </h2><p>  After reconstruction in 2000, the historic facade of the Opera House looks as impressive as it did in the 19th century, with its original rich colors and golden statues.  One of the most famous features of the palace is the main staircase, which was built of marble of different colors, and at the foot there are two bronze statues. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Great Staircase" class="if uuid-3241618" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/3241618.jpg"></div><p>  The main staircase is an impressive 30 meters and leads to the lobby, to various levels of the audience and the Rotonde de l'Empereur in the western pavilion, where the library and museum of the Musee de l'Opera are located.  The empire fell, and Napoleon died before the Garnier Palace was completed, so the Rotunda was never finished, and you can still see the covered stone blocks, as they were in the 1870s. </p><p>  The large and beautifully decorated foyer provides a place to relax during breaks between performances, while the Avant foyer is decorated with delightful mosaics in rich colors on a gold background and offers a magnificent view of the Great Staircase.  Charles Garnier wanted the Big Foyer to resemble a gallery of a classical castle with its enormous dimensions of 18 m high and 54 x 13 m. The bust of Charles Garnier, made by the sculptor Carpo, stands in the center of the room near one of the windows, which offers a view down Avenue. towards the Louvre Museum. </p><p>  Salon du Glacier is located at the end of the bar gallery with its light and airy rotunda, with a ceiling decorated with paintings by the artist Georges Jules-Victor Clarein, as well as tapestries illustrating various drinks - tea, coffee and champagne, as well as fishing and hunting episodes. </p><p>  A large hall of impressive dimensions: height - 20 m, depth - 32 m, width - 31 m, it is decorated in the shape of a horseshoe in red and bronze colors, with more than 1900 velvet seats, and is illuminated by an extremely large crystal chandelier, weighing 8 tons. It placed under the ceiling decorated by Marc Chagall.  The work was completed in 1964 by order of the Ministry of Culture. </p><p>  In 2011, a modern-style restaurant was built on the territory of the opera, which, although it was placed behind the glass between the columns, many consider it to be a destroyer of the original architecture of the monument. </p><h2>  Quick route to l'Op√©ra </h2><div class="photo" data-original="fr.m.wikipedia.org" data-author=": Pline, " data-source="https://fr.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fichier:Avenue_de_l%27Op%C3%A9ra_P1060011.JPG"><img itemprop="image" alt="Quick route to l'Op√©ra" class="if uuid-3241664" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/3241664.jpg"></div><p>  Op√©ra Garnier is located on the Place l'Op√©ra in Paris, which is the symbol of the Second French Empire.

For men, this means a tuxedo, traditional black or navy, and for women, a cocktail or evening dress.  Nevertheless, recently women come in trousers or skirts, but others perceive this without enthusiasm.  People, as a rule, dress in Paris more conservatively than in Russia, you need to minimize open areas of the body, avoid bright colors and choose a hem line that falls below the knee.  A simple black evening dress and black pumps are a great outfit formula to have in your arsenal. </p><p>  At the performance at the Palais Garnier, dressing is somewhat simpler, there are almost no visitors in dresses and tuxedos.  Even strict suits are not so common, although the viewer in this form is normally perceived in this place.  For women, a dress, blouse / skirt or blouse / beautiful pants are suitable.  For men, a shirt, beautiful pants and good shoes are suitable.  An unacceptable style of clothing - sneakers, sneakers, tennis shoes, shorts and jeans and something like that.

Sometimes they don‚Äôt accept reservations after 21:00 or 21:30, so it‚Äôs useful to find out when the show ends.  Usually from 21:30 to 23:00, so that you can choose a restaurant and make the appropriate reservation. </p><p>  Pleasant information for tourists: they can go to the Grand Opera in Paris Garnier for free on the first Sunday of every month, but you need to remember that this is the most crowded day of the month. </p>
