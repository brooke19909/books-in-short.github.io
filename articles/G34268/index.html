Traveler reviews will be a warning to you about possible unpleasant surprises.  Here are some negative comments worth paying attention to: </p><ul><li>  in rooms with windows facing the roadway, as a rule, it is very noisy (it is impossible to open the ventilation window); </li><li>  although the hotel is non-smoking, some rooms have a distinct smell of tobacco smoke; </li><li>  there are a lot of people at breakfast (given the small size of the restaurant, there are not enough free tables for everyone); </li><li>  some rooms have very old plumbing (the bath is especially depressing); </li><li>  there are no outlets near the bed (moreover, they are all concentrated on one wall above the floor); </li><li>  poor-quality and very cheap toiletries in the bathroom; </li><li>  there is no air freshener in the bathroom; </li><li>  for breakfast you have to go to another building, which is especially uncomfortable and unpleasant in bad weather; </li><li>  the drain in the bathroom does not work well; </li><li>  coolers can stand without water for several days; </li><li>  the assortment of breakfast dishes is quite modest, and the taste is poor; </li><li>  the guest has nowhere to get information on the breakfast menu in advance; </li><li> during breakfast, low-quality juices are served (either powdered or cheap packaged juices); </li><li>  there is mold in the bathroom (apparently this is due to poorly functioning ventilation); </li><li>  the elevator travels only from the second floor (that is, it will have to lift heavy suitcases up the stairs); </li><li>  the refrigerators in the rooms work very poorly, so you can not count on the long-term safety of the product; </li><li>  Wireless Internet does not work well (speed is very low, and the signal constantly disappears); </li><li>  the maids do their work very noisily, constantly talking loudly on the walkie-talkie (this is especially felt in the early morning); </li><li>  the carpet in the corridors is very old and stained; </li><li>  upon arrival, it may turn out that the room you booked is busy (despite the fact that, most likely, they will offer a room of a category higher, the precipitate is still unpleasant); </li><li>  in spite of the fact that the rooms are equipped with plastic double-glazed windows, from them it still blows (or rather, from the cracks around the windows); </li><li>  the floors of the hotel creak strongly (this is especially audible at night and in the early morning); </li><li>  catering establishments close at 23:00, and therefore, if you arrive at the hotel at night, you will have nowhere to eat (you can use third-party round-the-clock food delivery). </li></ul><h2>  Jobs </h2><p>  If you want to become part of a friendly team of professionals and join a big interesting business, pay attention to the vacancies of the Golden Ear Hotel in Moscow (at VDNKh).
