We learn something new, make discoveries.  Ahead of us are adventures and miracles created by human hands.  Looking at some, it’s hard to imagine that this is even possible.  For example, the temple of Zeus at Olympia.  This amazing building contains not only the architectural, but also the cultural heritage of ancient Greece.  Here myths come to life, and their heroes appear before the guests of the temple.  But the most interesting thing is that ancient stones preserve the memory of those legends that are not known to everyone. </p><h2>  Miracles of the past and present </h2><p>  In every religion and faith there are magic numbers to which various properties are attributed.  These include the three, six, nine, thirteen and seven.  It was the latter that was chosen to determine the best structures of antiquity.  There is probably no person who has not heard about the <span>seven wonders of the world.</span>  These are incredible <span>architectural structures of the</span> past, stunning the imagination with its majesty and pomp.  The list included the gardens of Babylon, the temple of Artemis, the mausoleum and even the lighthouse. </p>

Perhaps even now a new building is being built somewhere that will amaze people’s imagination. </p><h2>  Gods of antiquity </h2><p>  It is difficult to say what allowed one people to become more prosperous, educated and cultural.  Perhaps their faith gave them strength, moved to the heights of perfection. </p><p>  In ancient Greece, there were several gods that people worshiped in attempts to achieve their goals.  Virtually any <span>natural phenomenon was</span> attributed to their influence.  The god of the north wind Boreas, the lord of sunlight Apollo, the lord of the deep sea Poseidon.  These were dozens of fictional creatures male and female. </p><p>  People believed that life on earth depended on their moods.  They tried to appease the gods so as not to incur their anger.  Places of worship were created, where thousands of faiths flocked.  Over time, entire sanctuaries were erected, for example, the temple of Zeus in Athens. </p><h2>  Majestic building </h2><p>  In 471–456 BC  e.  a building unusual in its architecture and grandeur was erected.  This is the temple of Zeus at Olympia, designed by Libon, an architect of <span>ancient Greece.</span>  Thousands of pilgrims flocked here to kneel before God and pray for the forgiveness of sins. </p>

But fortunately, many fragments have survived today.  Scientists, historians and archaeologists, having studied the writings of the ancient Greek Pausanias, were able to recreate the view that once had the temple of Olympic Zeus.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Pediments </h2><p>  If we could look at the building in those distant times when it shone with its greatness, it would be impossible to look away.  What are some of its pediments.  This is the completion of the facade of the building, which is limited by roof arches and a cornice, forming a triangular shape. </p><p>  From the west, the temple of Zeus in Greece was decorated with paintings of the battle between centaurs and lapifs.  According to the myth, the inhabitants of Thessaly invited their neighbors to a wedding feast.  But the tipsy centaur decided to steal the bride, which brought anger to his tribe.  A struggle ensued, during which the Lapiths won.  This fragment is not accidental.  For the ancient Greeks, he was the personification of the victory of civilization over illiteracy and savagery. </p><p>  The eastern part is decorated in a slightly different style.  Here is a myth about Polepos and the king Enomai who died at his hands.  The figures look more static and are located away from each other.  Historians are inclined to the version that these two parts were performed by different masters. </p>

    <h2>  Metopes </h2><p>  Very often, the upper part of the buildings was decorated with a series of stone slabs and triglyphs.  The former were often covered with relief images.  Such plates are called metopes.  Today, some can be seen in the Museum of Greece, but most of them are kept in the Louvre. </p><p>  All the metopes of the temple of Zeus in Olympia are united by one plot - twelve deeds of Hercules.  This character was not chosen by chance.  For the ancient Greeks, his exploits meant the victory of a rational man over the incomprehensible and inexplicable forces of evil.  The images were arranged so that the pilgrims began their survey from the first and ended last.  All these extraordinary architectural delights were only a preparation for seeing the main attraction. </p><p>  If you look at the temple of Zeus in Olympia (photos or drawings), you will notice that his metopes are somewhat elongated vertically.  Most likely, this was the idea of ​​the architect.  He wanted to give the building maximum grandeur, a certain desire up. </p><h2>  Wonder of the world </h2><p>  Despite all the splendor of the structure, it was not appreciated as worthy as the statue, which was located inside it.  The Temple of Zeus in Athens was not honored to become a wonder of the world.  Although it became the abode of such. </p><p>  In the center of the structure, Zeus sat on a huge throne.  It was a statue about 15 meters in size.  Imagine the height of a house with four floors. </p><p>  Zeus looked startling: huge, radiant, with fiery eyes.  All this the architect managed to achieve with the help of light, which was refracted in the right places and illuminated the face of the statue.  The whole body of God was made of gold, and the throne of cedar and ebony.  The head of God almost touched the ceiling of the building. </p><p>  People came to see him from all over the world.  Ordinary people and great rulers.  This spectacle did not leave anyone indifferent.  And it was a wonderful demonstration of scientific achievements, the development of the ancient Greeks. </p>

    <h2>  Complicated story </h2><p>  The author of this grandiose construction was Phidias, a sculptor from Athens.  In order not to be mistaken in size, a huge building was created.  The parameters are the same as the temple of Zeus at Olympia.  The author worked with his brother and student. </p><p>  Later, the statue underwent several restorations.  What she did not survive: earthquakes, lightning.  They stole gold trim more than once. </p><p>  <span>The Roman emperor</span> set out to transport Zeus along with other sights that testified to his conquests.  But as the legends say, when workers came to the temple, the statue began to laugh out loud.  Frightened by fear, they fled to wherever.  Naturally, after this, no one dared to make another attempt. </p><p>  When the Christian faith began to be popularized, and it reached a certain upsurge, pagan temples began to close.  From some records of those times it is known that the statue was transported to Constantinople.  And there she was destroyed by fire, because her whole frame was made of wood. </p>

    <h2>  Other temples </h2><p>  Not only the temple of Olympian Zeus was a jewel of those places.  In the gardens of the city are the sanctuary of Hera of Hippodamia.  There was an altar of Zeus made from the ashes of sacrificial animals. </p><p>  The grove was surrounded by venues for the Olympic Games: stages, a hippodrome, gymnasiums and a theater.  These buildings were located in a semicircle.  They were decorated with statues of gods and heroes of that time.  Immediately after them, another semicircle was erected.  These were places for the audience.  Here they feasted and traded.  During the games Olympia turned into a huge market.  Thousands of people gathered in one place - it was a great business. </p><h2>  Archaeological finds </h2><p>  For many years little was known about this wonderful city.  All that was visible to the people was a few columns and walls.  Passing by, one could only see animals that walked through the ruins of a once great place.  Excavations were carried out only in the 19th century.  For French archaeologists, the Temple of Zeus at Olympia opened several of its metopes and foundations. </p><p>  Later, the Greek authorities decided to dig seriously.  German archaeologists set off in search of adventure and new discoveries.  An agreement was signed: all that they found belonged to Greece by law.  Could be made public a little.  Therefore, few then saw the live temple of Olympian Zeus - photos and drawings of it only. </p>

Many records found during excavations shed light on political relations in ancient Greece. </p><h2>  Better to see once </h2><p>  No matter how much we describe the grandeur and unsurpassed architecture of that time, it is impossible to imagine what it really is.  No drawings or photographs can replace sensations when you see everything in reality. </p><p>  To plunge into this atmosphere, feel the centuries-old “breath” of the walls, go to Athens.  The Temple of Olympian Zeus is represented by fifteen columns and a foundation.  In the archaeological park you can also see Roman baths, basilicas of the 5th century. </p>
