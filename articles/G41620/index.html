Few people think that these gadgets are created according to existing projects, and craftsmen just change the appearance of the back panel or its color.  One of the few manufacturers that refuse such a strategy is Highscreen.  Here everyone, starting from development and ending with the descent of finished products from the assembly line, is trying to do it on the territory of Russia.  The budget smartphone Zera F from this company was no exception.  It turned out to be quite attractive in appearance, not very powerful in performance and costing only 3990 rubles.  The Highscreen Zera F, which we are going to review now, is not the brightest representative of the budget niche, but it may well become one.  Let's talk about everything in order. </p>

    <h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  In general, the Highscreen Zera F is manufactured with average technical specifications.  But if you look at the cost, then everything becomes clear, because for that kind of money you can take only a weak ‚ÄúChinese‚Äù.

    <p>  The smartphone comes in standard packaging, which is made of recycled cardboard.  Having lifted the cover, you can see the Highscreen Zera F Black smartphone lying in the lodgement.  It is neatly wrapped in oilcloth.  In addition, the kit includes standard elements in the form of a USB cable, charger, headset, instructions and warranty for the smartphone. </p><p>  A film with the characteristics written on it is glued on the screen of the gadget.  In principle, everything is standard here as for the budget option.  It is worth noting the headphones that come with <span>Highscreen Zera F. Reviews</span> about them are not very good.  Despite the fact that they are almost identical with the headset to the iPhone, users often talk about their inconvenience and poor sound.  But the main thing here is not the headphones, but the smartphone itself. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2>

    <p>  Made device in a classic style.  This is a familiar candy bar with a four-inch touch screen.  I would like to note that a <span>protective film is</span> glued on top <span>,</span> under which there is not a single bubble. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There are 5 mm frames on the sides of the screen.  Thanks to this, the smartphone can be easily held in your hand without pressing the sensor.  The case is made of non-slip plastic <span>.</span>  Holding a smartphone in your hand, you immediately feel that it just doesn‚Äôt slip out of it. </p><p>  In general, the smartphone looks pretty decent.  It is noticeable that a lot of work was done on its design.  If you are a fan of other models, you can see a lot of borrowed elements. </p><p>  Smartphone Highscreen Zera F on the front side, on top of the display, has a speaker, a <span>front camera</span> and <span>a light sensor.</span>  Below, except for three functional touch buttons, there is nothing else. </p><p>  The main camera and flash are located behind.  In the middle of the panel is the inscription of the manufacturer.  Below is the call speaker.  It has special protrusions at the edges so that nothing prevents the sound output. </p><p>  The left edge is equipped only with a ‚Äúrocker‚Äù volume.  On the right, also in splendid isolation, there is a microUSB socket for connecting a smartphone to a computer and charging.  The manufacturer placed the microphone on the bottom, and on the top - the power off / lock button and headphone output.  To insert a SIM card, you need to slightly pry the back cover.  Here you can see two slots, a battery and a place where a flash drive is inserted. </p><p>  Smartphone Highscreen Zera F, although it is positioned as a budget option, but, given the build quality, you can easily attribute it to the middle class. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  Most budget line smartphones have a small display, but the Highscreen Zera F has 4 inches of it.  The resolution of the <span>IPS matrix</span> is 480x800 (WVGA).  This indicator is not the highest, with a closer look you can see the points.  But to use this is enough. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The color rendering of the display is normal.  Naturally, you should not expect a ‚Äúlive‚Äù display from such a display, but you need to understand that all budget gadgets are not capable of more. </p><p>  Contrast is hardly enough to make out the image in sunlight.  But very pleased with the viewing angles, which are almost maximum. </p><p>  The sensor supports up to two points.  It has an average sensitivity.  In some cases, he even responds inappropriately to the press.  Such a nuisance was due to a very thick protective film.  If you remove it, then manage the gadget is much more convenient. </p><p>  Highscreen Zera F reviews are pretty good.  Users on the screen are not satisfied with only two things: low brightness and lack of <span>oleophobic coating.</span> </p><h2>  Performance and equipment </h2><p>  The Highscreen Zera F smartphone is based on the MTK MT6572 processor.  It has two cores with a maximum data processing frequency of 1.3 GHz.  A single-core GPU, standard for budget employees, perfectly copes with simple three-dimensional games.  1 GB of RAM is the very necessary minimum, without which the smartphone will simply ‚Äúthink‚Äù for a long time.  It is very pleasing that all this was observed in the device in question. </p>

    <p>  The relatively old GPU has average performance.  Naturally, he won‚Äôt pull the ‚Äúheavy‚Äù games, but unpretentious, with 3D-graphics, easily. </p><p>  As a result of testing with popular benchmarks, the indicators were not very high by modern standards.  But for such a device, this is very good.  Highscreen Zera F Black could not be tested with some benchmarks, as they simply did not start due to their ‚Äúseverity‚Äù. </p><p>  If you use a smartphone in everyday life, then users have no particular complaints.  Judging by the reviews, they even got more than they expected.  The interface itself works fine and only in some cases lags.  Installing applications is done without any problems. </p><h2>  Software and firmware </h2><p>  Highscreen Zera F Black works with the installed Android OS version 4.2.2.  In the very first deliveries, a virus was accidentally sewn in that sent SMS and downloaded applications without asking the owner about it.  Naturally, this situation has collected a lot of bad reviews.  But, in turn, the company's operational work on updating corrected the situation. </p><p>  The interface itself is standard and does not differ in originality.  In fact, this is just a ‚Äúbare‚Äù Android.  Updates by users can be carried out over a wireless network.  But the manufacturers of our country choose the release of a new gadget than support for the old. </p>

    <h2>  Multimedia </h2><p>  The multimedia capabilities of the smartphone are standard.  Everything here is simple and clear.  A standard audio player is available.  It, like in all state employees, does not differ in a large number of settings, but for listening to music it is quite enough.  The video player is weak.  It is immediately recommended to replace it with another free player.  Well, an FM radio is also available.  Everything plays well and plays loudly.  Even video can be viewed in HD, only the screen has a fairly low resolution. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  The gadget Highscreen Zera F reviews are all relative.  In particular, this also applies to cameras.  There are two of them.  The first is the main one, the second is the front (for video communication).  For picky users, of course, their quality will be very low.  Well, what can you want from a device worth less than 4000 rubles?  Some users are satisfied with the quality of the pictures and claim that they are fully consistent with the price category.  In general, there is no certainty here. </p><h2>  User reviews </h2><p>  If you look at user reviews in general, and not for each specific function, then everything is very good here.  Almost everyone claims that the Highscreen Zera F should be more expensive in relation to its functions.  But the manufacturer was very pleased with the price.  Even competitors of well-known manufacturers with the same characteristics are not able to compete with this gadget. </p><p>  There are few complaints about poor network reception.  This problem can easily be solved by removing the cover from the Highscreen Zera F.  The developers did not take into account the power of the built-in antenna. </p>

    <p>  Most of the problems that can be distinguished from the reviews appear with prolonged use of the gadget.  This and some software failures, and overheating.  In addition, you can mark a not very powerful battery, which is enough at maximum parameters for only a few hours. </p><p>  Users also complain about the relatively large thickness of the Highscreen Zera F.  Reviews about her are not very encouraging.  If the smartphone had a built-in battery above 2000 mAh, then the thickness would have been justified, and the case could have been made thinner.  More displeasure is the framework.  They are also relatively large and significantly spoil the look. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  When you first saw a Highscreen Zera F smartphone, you don‚Äôt immediately realize that it belongs to the family of state employees.  Beautiful, convenient and high-quality - all this characterizes the gadget in question.  It has normal specifications and is suitable for everyday use.  Most pleased with the price, because similar smartphones are much more expensive.  The screen is used of very good quality, but if it were to add brightness to it, then everything would be just wonderful. </p><p>  Like any technique, this smartphone also has several negative characteristics.  First of all, this is a very weak main camera.  Also, many users complain about a very long time to fully charge the battery.  The reason for this is the use of substandard materials.  Otherwise, everything is fine. </p>
