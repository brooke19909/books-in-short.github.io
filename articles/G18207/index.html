    <h2>  Organization of rest for children </h2><p>  When planning a vacation with the whole family, tourists often choose Cyprus.  Hotels with a beach, swimming pools on site, an entertainment program for children are represented on this island in huge numbers.  These include the Tsokkos Holiday Hotel.  There is a kids club, in the restaurant there are special chairs and menus for the smallest vacationers.  Upon request, a cot can be added to the room.  At the hotel, children have no time to be bored, as animators take care of their leisure. </p><p>  Parents can pay extra for babysitting services, which is very convenient if adults want to see the sights of Cyprus, and the child does not want to shake in a stuffy bus and prefers to spend this time in the company of their own kind, playing and having fun.  At the same time, parents can be absolutely calm for their child, because, firstly, the hotel employs only experienced nannies who can easily get along with children of any age, and, secondly, they are responsible for them. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The main reason why tourists from different countries choose Cyprus for their vacation is the presence of luxurious and clean sandy beaches.  The best hotels in Cyprus have their own beaches, but Tsokkos Holiday Hotel does not concern this, since it is a budget accommodation option.  Although the lack of a private beach is not a problem, since public ones are no worse, unless you have to bring a towel with you, and if you need sun loungers and umbrellas, you need to pay separately. </p>
