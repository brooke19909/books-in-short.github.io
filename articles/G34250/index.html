The heat is rapidly disappearing, and the sun begins to warm less and less.  Those who love beach vacations do not have to go to Spain for this.  However, those tourists who want to visit historical sights, various cultural events and take a walk along the streets with a unique color and atmosphere can well enjoy the beauties of this country at this time of year.  Spain in November is an ideal place for a romantic pastime.  In this publication, we will talk about what a tourist should do in the fall in Spain and how to plan his vacation. </p><h2>  Weather in Spain in November </h2><p>  There are very few sunny days this month.  It rains more and more throughout the country.  If you believe meteorologists, then November can please travelers with only nine to ten sunny days.  In addition to precipitation, a strong wind blows on the seashore.  Moreover, the latter is the main characteristic of Spanish late autumn.  This is especially true for coastal cities.  Thus, the weather in Spain in November is relatively cold (of course, when compared with the usual heat in summer).  Reviews of tourists indicate that due to low temperatures and cold water on the beach, it becomes impossible to relax at this time of the year.  The air warms up slightly. </p>

    <h2>  Temperature in Spain in November </h2><p>  In late autumn, here the temperature in the daytime can reach 15-17 degrees.  For example, in Madrid, these figures are somewhat lower.  Usually from 14 degrees during the day and only 6 at night.  The eastern and northwestern parts of Spain are characterized by the same temperature indicators, but in the north it is much colder due to rains and frequent <span>storms in the ocean.</span>  Cyclones and heavy winds also dominate the southern regions.  In sunny weather, of course, the temperature can reach 19 degrees.  However, this is not so common.  Water on the coast sometimes warms up to 20 degrees, but because of the general temperature of the air and wind at sea, as mentioned above, you can’t rest on the beach.  On the coast, tourist camps remain empty until the start of next season, waiting for the summer.  In such a situation, the Canary Islands attract tourists who crave warmth and comfort, as there is excellent weather at any time of the year. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Prices in November </h2><p>  Those who are fortunate enough to purchase <span>tours to Spain</span> in November may feel that during this period their holidays will cost them several times cheaper when comparing summer and autumn prices.  You can significantly save your money on hotel and hotel services.  According to tourists' reviews, food at this time will also be cheap.  This situation is due to the fact that in the summer there are a lot of travelers in restaurants, therefore, in comparison with the warm season, they are practically absent in the autumn, therefore, every visitor is waiting for in catering establishments.  The hosts are lowering food prices, thus trying to “lure” tourists who nevertheless enjoy a holiday in Spain in November. </p><p>  So, a full meal can cost only 10 euros (while in July you would have to pay 15 euros for the same set of dishes).  Therefore, you can use these circumstances to spend your vacation in this country and feel in maximum comfort.  The weather does not stop you from walking around the city or attending cultural events.  It is worth noting that the prices for basic entertainment in cities are the same at all times of the year.  Tours in Madrid are quite expensive (minimum price is 25 euros), the entrance to the museum can cost about 7-12 euros.  If you do not want to walk around the city on foot, then you can take a public transport to the main attractions.  The average fare is 2 euros. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Madrid in late fall </h2><p>  As you can see from the above, tourists who enjoy a cultural pastime will enjoy Spain in November.  Prices have a budget holiday, which you can not forget for a long time.  Madrid is no exception.  It is here that you can appreciate all the sights (of which there are quite a lot) in a relaxed atmosphere without suffering from the summer heat. </p><p>  Late in the fall, Madrid becomes one of the centers of European culture.  The capital is the venue for the Autumn Art Festival, where you can enjoy the performances of dance, theater, circus and music groups from different parts of the Earth.  Performances and concerts are mainly held at city venues.  Most often these are theatrical scenes.  Guests at the festival also attend various performances and go to galleries, in addition, there are meetings with celebrities and artists. </p><p>  Since Spain in November does not have a beach holiday, if you get tired of walking and cool weather, you can go to a performance at the Royal Opera House.  Those who have already been here warn that it’s best to book tickets or purchase them online.  They are printed out and paid at the theater terminals, in specially provided cash rooms. </p>
