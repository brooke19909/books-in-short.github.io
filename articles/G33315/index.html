So, for example, Softty yarn is gaining its popularity, which has a very interesting texture and no less interesting price for buyers. </p><h2>  Material Overview </h2><p>  First, let's take a closer look at this yarn.  It is based on an ordinary thread, which on the one hand has expressive fluff, resembling laces with fringe along the edge. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="soft yarn" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2136310.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Despite the unusual "structure" of the yarn, it practically does not crumble, which often happens with other similar materials.  Of course, if you make enough effort and pull out a piece of the sticking-down fluff, then it will be in your hands, but for this you need to try very well. </p><p>  In addition, knitting Softty yarn gives one aesthetic pleasure, since the gaps between the loops are practically invisible.  The canvas turns out homogeneous and dense, without any holes and holes. </p><h2>  Features of work: yarn "Softi" </h2><p>  Of course, there are special nuances that should be considered when working with such bookly yarn.  We will list them sequentially, carefully considering each situation so that the information is understandable and accessible to everyone: </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting soft yarn" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2136338.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Scheme and hook.  Since the Softi yarn has a pronounced dense structure, you should opt for large patterns and corresponding hooks.  Because working on the tiny details of small works will be simply impossible.  In addition, this way you will not only save your efforts, but also save a huge amount of time. </li><li>  Markers  In working with this yarn, you definitely can not do without them, because the loops are hardly distinguishable.  And when using bright auxiliary markers, you will immediately notice where the row begins and where its end is. </li><li>  Provide yourself with a bright workplace.  Sit close to a bright light source, floor lamp or table lamp, directing the light exactly onto the canvas you are working on.  So the loop will be easier to distinguish, and the eyes do not have to strain very much. </li><li>  Do not forget to constantly count when knitting, whether it is loops, rows or other elements of the creative process.  This will ensure that the accuracy of the circuit and work.  If it is difficult for you to count verbally and you constantly stray, you should make notes on paper.  Then the probability that you will be lost will be much less. </li></ul><h2>  Variety in the markets </h2><p>  If we talk about the shades possessed by Soft Baby yarn, then their number is really large.  Variety does not end with rainbow colors and several shades.  No, the choice is much larger and includes various creamy, red, pink, brown, green, gray, yellow, blue and purple hues. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="soft baby yarn" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2136374.jpg"></div>

Knitted products from it look much more interesting because of the thread turning from color to color. </p><h2>  Material use </h2><p>  You have Softty yarn, what to knit?  A really difficult question for all knitters, as you always want the product to turn out not only beautiful, but also practical and necessary.  Therefore, we will offer you several ideas from which you can independently choose one or several, based on your desire, the availability of free time and the amount of yarn. </p><p>  In any case, knitting from Softi Alize yarn will give you one real pleasure, because it is so soft and pleasant to the touch. </p><h2>  Special characters </h2><p>  We will crochet a product (a children's cap), so we will need special designations that will facilitate the description of the work process.  Of course, if you are already an experienced craftswoman with many years of training and working with symbols behind, then you can skip this chapter and start knitting right away. </p><p>  But if you are knitting recently, or this is generally your first knit, do not be lazy and read the abbreviations described below: </p><ul><li>  KA - Amigurumi ring.  It is considered the basis of the basics of any knitting, whether it be a toy or a hat.  The process of making it is simple if you practice well in advance. </li><li>  CCH - double crochet.  This item is the second most important item in our product.  We chose it here only because the loops are large, which means that the work knits faster, and thanks to the yarn, the fabric turns out to be homogeneous and smooth. </li><li>  PB - increase.  It is also often used for knitting, but the abbreviation is sometimes replaced with a whole word to facilitate the process of perceiving information.  After all, if you look, the usual description of the work without details is more like a programming language than what it really is. </li></ul><h2>  Practical solution </h2><p>  We will stop our choice on a children's headdress - a cap in which both ordinary and Softty yarn will be combined.  We will divide the entire job description into several parts so that it is easier for you to understand the process itself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="soft alize yarn knitting" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2136341.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The hat made of ‚ÄúSofti‚Äù yarn should turn out to be very soft and elastic, thanks to which even the smallest and most fashionable women will feel comfortable in it. </p><ol><li>  We start the process by creating an amigurumi ring - the most important element from which the product begins.  When it is ready, we make three air loops for lifting and we knit in the middle of 7 columns with a crochet (CCH). </li><li>  We connect the row into the ring again with a connecting loop. </li><li>  Next, we knit 4-11 rows with double crochets, after which we proceed to create increases. </li><li>  In the 12th row, we begin to make increments every 3rd crochet (CCH), and we knit the 13th row unchanged. </li><li>  In the 14th row, we already make additions in the number of loops every 4th crochet column (CCH), the 15th row remains unchanged. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crocheted soft yarn" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2136345.jpg"></div></li><li>  In the 16th row, every 5th double crochet (CCH) is added, as a result we get 14 loops, which we knit in the next 17th row. </li><li>  In the 18th row of the loop, every 6th crochet column (CCH) is added and again we knit the row without everything. </li><li>  Thus, we knit loops to 41 rows, in which we already have 45 double crochet (CCH). </li><li>  At this stage, the main part of the children's cap is ready, it remains only to tie the edge with several rows of single crochet columns (RLS) so that it spins up a little. </li></ol><p>  So, the crochet hat made of Softty yarn is almost ready. </p><h2>  Funny puss </h2><p>  Would any headdress look interesting without a fluffy pompom?  That is why we will create it on special clamps so that the ball turns out to be smooth and dense around the entire perimeter. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="soft yarn what to knit" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2136322.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The size of the pompom does not matter much, because in any case it will look great.  In our case, we will choose a large version that will initially contrast with the small size of the cap itself. </p><ol><li>  We create a pompom on a special "machine", and then fasten it to the very top using the left yarn threads. </li><li>  We decorate the cap at will: you can sew the ribbon or lace around the edge, decorate the fabric with beads or buttons, put on a brooch or leave the hat without accessories. </li></ol><p>  So, a wonderful product is ready - a cap made of "Softi" yarn, a cute product that is suitable for any photo shoot or autumn walk. </p><p>  Most importantly, the texture of the yarn fully meets all the requirements: it does not prick, it keeps its shape perfectly and retains heat.  But this is the most important thing for owners of a small head! </p><h2>  Endless list </h2><p>  Of course, the list of all those things that can be knitted from Softi yarn does not end on one knitted hat.  Here are wonderful scarves, and cute animal toys, and warm blankets, and fluffy mittens, and even bright cardigans with various faces and appliqu√©s. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="soft yarn hat" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2136362.jpg"></div>

    <p>  For example, plaids from such bookly yarn knit simply, and come out very warm and soft.  Just the very thing that is needed for young children who are especially sensitive to all materials.  And if they are decorated with sewn pockets in the shape of muzzle of bears and foxes, then such a blanket turns into a work of art. </p><p>  This material is also suitable for making mitts and <span>mittens for babies.</span>  And to be honest, absolutely any tasks that she easily copes with are suitable for Softty yarn. </p><h2>  Impressions of use </h2><p>  After we have done a good job with yarn, knitting a wonderful hat-cap, you can leave your feedback on working with it. </p><p>  This is a very pleasant material, work with which is a real pleasure.  The yarn does not crumble when knitting, but when finished, it turns into a cast surface, from which it is impossible to pull out any ‚Äúfluff‚Äù.  And if you then look at the finished material, then you are unlikely to want to change your choice of yarn when knitting. </p><p>  What is surprising, despite the unusual texture of yarn, absolutely everything can be made from it, from blankets and bedspreads to creative toys and costumes for the smallest. </p>
