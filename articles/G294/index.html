Vacation in October in Tenerife</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The island of Tenerife is not only the largest in the entire Canary Archipelago.  It is also considered one of the most visited resorts in the world.  The whole reason is its unique weather.  Here it is like spring all year round, that is, the temperature does not fundamentally change.  It is never cold in winter, and there is no heat in summer.  Accordingly, Tenerife in October is a green paradise, which is surrounded by the warm waters of the ocean.  About what exactly the weather is like here in the middle of autumn, and how you can have fun at this time, read the article. </p><h2>  Climatic conditions </h2><p>  The temperature in Tenerife in October always fluctuates between 23-28 degrees.  At the same time, the lower indicator is rare here and is more suitable for night time.  It is important to note that on the island, fluctuations between daytime and nighttime temperatures are almost invisible.  Moreover, it happens that the night here is warmer than the day, which makes it possible to swim in the ocean and walk until the morning.  If the thermometer rises above 28, you still will not feel strong heat.  It is always very warm and humid, but there is never any heat. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tenerife in october" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/614377.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Tenerife Weather October: Reviews and Impressions </h2><p>  All travelers who went to the largest Canary island in mid-autumn, argue that there is a bright sun shining almost every day.  The chance of precipitation is very low.  Even if a little rain sometimes passes, then literally in an hour everything dries up, you can again go to the beach, sunbathe and swim in the ocean.  A large number of sunny days makes it possible not only to wallow in the sand and listen to the sound of the surf, but also to travel around the island.  There are a lot of natural attractions, as well as monuments of colonial architecture since the conquest of the Canary Archipelago by the Spaniards. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tenerife october reviews" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/614376.jpg" width="600"></div>

During this period, there are much fewer people here than in summer, because all recreation areas are relatively empty.  The island is famous for the fact that the shores that belong to the hotels are covered with white sand.  It was imported mainly from Africa so that vacationers could feel most comfortable.  As for the wild beaches, they are all covered with black volcanic sand.  This is natural for this island, in the center of which a volcano with red-hot lava is still seething.  The landscapes of the <span>black sand beaches are</span> simply amazing, so do not forget to take as many pictures as you can here. </p><h2>  <span>Autumn Holidays</span> in the Canaries </h2><p>  If you go on <span>vacation in October</span> in Tenerife, then you can get there on the most famous New World holiday - the discovery of America.  It is held on October 12 and reminds us of how in 1492 <span>Christopher Columbus</span> discovered the New Earths.  Banks and shops do not work on this day, since all the streets of the island are filled with locals who celebrate and relax.  Also in October there is a magic festival.  It is held in the capital of the island at the Gimera Theater.  Along with it, a folklore festival, which takes place in the province of Adeje, is very interesting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="temperature in tenerife in october" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/614374.jpg" width="500"></div>

The reviews of people who visited this resort in the fall tell us that surfing, diving, snorkeling and <span>water skiing are</span> very popular here <span>.</span>  It is only important to find a lesson for everyone among all that is offered here, and choose the most suitable place for it.  There are open beaches where it is always windy and high waves rise.  Here windsurfers and water ski enthusiasts improve their skills.  In the quiet bays, where there is always calm, you can get acquainted with the underwater flora and fauna of the Canary Islands.  Yachts and boats are popular at all resorts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vacation in october in tenerife" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/614375.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Price policy </h2><p>  Many people think that visiting Tenerife in October is cheap and affordable.  In fact, this resort at any time of the year has slightly overpriced prices (compared with Egypt, Turkey or Greece) precisely because of its unique climate.  At any time of the year it is warm, sunny and moderately humid.  The weather is not too cold, windy or sultry.  Because there are no such seasons that open or close on the island.  Tenerife in October is the same as in April, May or February. </p>
