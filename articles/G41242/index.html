We will narrow the scale a little, because we are talking only about Gelendzhik.  Guest house "Olga" (Kolkhoznaya, 99) is a worthy option for a family vacation.  This is a small complex, which consists of several 2-and 3-storey buildings.  On the territory there is a large kitchen under a canopy, where everyone can cook their own food.
