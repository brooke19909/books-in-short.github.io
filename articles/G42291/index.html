People and educational program</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Literacy of the population is one of the signs of the development of the state.  That is why many are interested in the importance that the <span>Soviet government</span> attached to the eradication of illiteracy.  Yes, just paramount!  According to statistics for 1919, the majority of the population of post-imperial territories were not familiar with writing. </p><h2>  Decree "On the <span>eradication of illiteracy</span> in the RSFSR" </h2><p>  Peasants and workers came to the first roles in the social hierarchy of society according to the ideology of the CPSU (b).  It was among these categories of society that there were an overwhelming majority of non-written people. </p><p>  One can understand what significance the Soviet government attached to the eradication of illiteracy by familiarizing itself with the main provisions of the decree of 1919.  Compulsory basic education was established for people aged 8 to 50 years.  The eradication of illiteracy in the USSR fell on the shoulders of local councils. </p><p>  In these years, primary schools were massively created in our state.  It was the fight against illiteracy of the absolute majority of the population that was their main task.  Each council set the term of study at school individually.  Why?  But there was still a civil war, and many industries had to be restored from the damage caused by the hostilities of the First World War and the Civil War. </p><p>  Since 1919, the formation of <span>the USSR education</span> system actually began <span>.</span>  Before the revolution, there were very few educational institutions for the population in the villages.  The only place where children received knowledge of the basics of literacy were parish schools.  With the advent of Soviet power, the state education system was actively developing, which over time made it possible to receive at least <span>elementary education for</span> all young citizens of the USSR. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Who could not study at literacy centers? </h2><p>  Did everyone want to get knowledge?  Of course not.  There is interesting information on the Oryol region.  In 1923, about 430 illiterate children over 8 years old were identified there.  According to the Decree, all of them were supposed to attend classes at educational centers.  It was possible to cover only 134 people. </p><p>  We can clearly see the importance that the Soviet government attached to the elimination of illiteracy, but at the same time, some categories of citizens did not need to attend classes on educational programs.  The main preferential categories are: </p><ul><li>  if the owner or mistress of the family is one (one) - because the person does not have enough time to do the housework and study; </li><li>  people who had a certificate of illness (in modern language - "sick leave"); </li><li>  defective (most likely, people with disabilities who cannot see, hear, or cannot move); </li><li>  persons who are engaged in public works; </li><li>  pregnant women who have a gestational age of 6 months or more, such women were required to come to the educational institution after a month from the birth of the child (the term was extended to one year if the woman was breastfeeding). </li></ul>

    <h2>  Literacy outcomes </h2><p>  Knowing the importance attached by the Soviet government to the eradication of illiteracy, it cannot be said that it was possible to educate all people without exception for privileged categories.  Based on data from the 1937 national census, 25% of the population was still illiterate.  Most of them, of course, are rural residents. </p><p>  Having studied unofficial data, we will understand that the real situation was even worse.  Most of those who were considered literate knew only how to sign, write the last name and first name, as well as the name of their locality.  A real breakthrough in the fight against illiteracy was outlined only when the connection between the city and the village became as strong as possible. </p>
