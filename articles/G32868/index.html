Convection and Grill Microwave</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you decide to change your old <span>microwave oven</span> to a new one, then the variety of models today will pleasantly surprise you.  The most widely used microwave ovens are convection (reviews about them are only positive).  But before acquiring such a model, let's first look: convection <span>in a microwave oven,</span> what is it all about. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="microwave convection what is it" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15109/375520.jpg" width="349"></div></h2><h2>  Principle of operation </h2><p>  The very concept of "convection" means the transfer of heat through circular movements of the heated air.  This method of transferring thermal energy is used not only in household appliances, this method is very relevant in large enterprises, in industry. </p><p>  Convection microwaves not only allow you to heat or defrost foods.  In such ovens you can cook delicious pastries, bake fish or meat. </p><p>  Many microwave models allow you to use the device in several modes: standard (in which you can only heat or defrost food) or combined (in this mode, you can also fully cook or bake products in the microwave). </p><p>  There is a combined microwave with convection and grill.  A fairly functional household appliance.  With this oven you can even cook juicy grilled ribs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="convection and grill microwave" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15109/375519.jpg?1397589005151" width="500"></div></h2><h2>  The main differences </h2><p>  For the correct and optimal choice of microwave oven model, it is important to know what are the main differences between this device and similar devices.  It is worth noting that conventional microwave ovens heat food using <span>infrared radiation.</span>  New generation microwave ovens not only heat food using infrared rays, they, using convection, help to cook it deliciously. </p><p>  In addition, convection microwave ovens (customer reviews confirm this) have large dimensions and higher power <span>consumption.</span>  They are equipped with an additional fan and a special element that heats the air.  These components are located on the back wall or at the top of the microwave. </p><p>  Because of this, the furnace has significant dimensions and greater weight than its counterparts with a simpler device.  But then it has additional functions that allow you to cook and bake in it. </p>

If we talk about the time of cooking, then it will have to spend much less, when compared with the time that goes into cooking meat in the oven.  Thanks to the convection function, a conventional microwave oven turns into a full-fledged oven.

In a microwave oven with this principle of operation, there is one significant flaw - it consumes a lot of electricity. </p><p>  Therefore, first of all, attention should be paid specifically to the power indicator of the device.  If the oven is additionally equipped with a grill, then the values ‚Äã‚Äãof its value in the instrument passport will be indicated for the grill, for the stove to work in normal mode and for the appliance to work in convection mode.  Naturally, during the operation of convection mode, the device will consume a maximum of electricity. </p><p>  For example, during normal operation, the power of the device will be 900 watts, while during operation with convection, the power will be about 2500 watts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="microwave convection mode" class="if" height="276" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15109/375517.jpg?1397589082648" width="400"></div>

    <p>  Pay attention to the coating of the inner chamber.  If you plan to cook meat or poultry in the device, you will certainly have to clean it.  It is desirable that the coating of the chamber was made of stainless steel or bioceramics. </p><p>  The best option is a ceramic inner chamber.  True, such a device will cost a little more.  The fact is that cleaning ceramics is much easier than coatings from other materials.  In addition, this surface is more resistant to carbon deposits.  Very good if the oven has an automatic cleaning option.  With it, you can easily remove odors from the oven after cooking meat or fish. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Security </h2><p>  So, now you can answer the question: "Convection in the microwave: what is it?"  - and, accordingly, decide whether you need it.  If the answer is yes, then make sure that it is correctly installed. </p><p>  Carefully read the passport that came with the device.  Be sure to consider the possibilities of your wiring.  When using powerful appliances in private homes, wiring is sometimes quite weak and may simply not withstand such a large load.  Therefore, there is a risk that the cork in the house will be constantly "cut down". </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="convection ovens" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15109/375515.jpg?1397589241660" width="376"></div></h2><h2>  Grounding </h2><p>  Typically, manufacturers indicate recommendations for installing the device in the instrument passport.  The need for grounding when connecting a convection oven is one of them.  This is because such powerful devices must be earthed to avoid accidents.  It is up to you to decide, but it is advisable not to ignore the instructions of the manufacturer and once again protect yourself. </p><h2>  Installation </h2><p>  Before you go to the store to buy a microwave oven with convection, think about where you will put it.  Remember that such devices have rather large dimensions, and there should be enough free space around the oven. </p><p>  Convection microwave oven must have air access from all sides.  Installing the device close to the wall is also prohibited.  You can not put any objects on top of the device, since during cooking it can become very hot.  Ignoring such simple requirements can lead to the fact that your device will fail prematurely. </p><p>  The lack of free space may cause the device to simply overheat and burn.  Items left at the top of the oven can ignite at high temperatures, and this is a direct path to the fire. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="microwave oven with convection" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15109/375514.jpg?1397589310252" width="350"></div></h2><h2>  Exploitation </h2><p>  The microwave convection mode, what is it, you know, so try to operate the device correctly and follow the basic rules.  After each cooking, the oven must be cleaned or wiped with a damp sponge.  It will be easier for you to get rid of dirt and soot in the device immediately after cooking.  If the dirt is too strong, use only special cleaning products that do not scratch the surface.  Do not use drugs that contain alkali. </p><p>  Try to follow the instructions recommended by the manufacturer.  Use special utensils and do not experiment.  As practice shows, experiments with such devices lead only to their quick exit of their system. </p><h2>  Additional functions </h2><p>  When choosing a specific model of a microwave oven, pay attention to a number of additional functions in the device.  Microwave convection (what it is, you already know) provides a number of benefits.  And this is not only an integrated grill.  For example, some models are equipped with steam cleaning function of the inner chamber.  And the LG microwave with convection has an integrated steam cooker option. </p><p>  Some models can be used for cooking two dishes at the same time, operating modes can be combined, as well as using programs for automatic cooking.  The timer function allows you to set the time to turn on the oven, so in the morning in the kitchen you can expect a delicious hot breakfast.  Some models provide not only automatic launch of the cooking program, but also have the opportunity to warm up or defrost food in automatic mode. </p>
