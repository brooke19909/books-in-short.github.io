The city was founded in the second half of the XII century.  Today, almost 42,000 people live in it.  The unique geographical location, healing climate and an abundance of attractions annually attract thousands of tourists here. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Swinoujscie or Swinoujscie (pol. ≈öwinouj≈õcie) is a city in the West Pomeranian Voivodeship of Poland, spread on the banks of the Pig River.  It is located on three islands: Wolin, Karsibor and Izvestim.  The last of these islands is divided by the Polish-German border. </p><p>  It is the westernmost city of Poland.  The pig farm dates back to the end of the 12th century. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="53.91003269999999" data-lng="14.247577500000034" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/6/0/2/17602.png"></div><p>  Already at that time there was a powerful fortress.  In 1290, the Duke of Barnim Pomeransky founded a ferry crossing the Svina River.  A little later, a pilot station and a customs station appeared here.  The origin of the name of the city is inextricably linked with its geographical location at the mouth of the Pig. </p><p>  For a long time this settlement belonged to Prussia.  In 1945, according to the Potsdam Agreement, the city finally passed to Poland.  The pig farm is an important transportation hub in its country. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Poland city Swinoujscie" class="if uuid-3223266" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/3223266.jpg"></div><p>  There is a large seaport, a shipyard, a terminal designed for receiving and subsequent regasification of natural gas. </p><h2>  Climate and weather in Swinoujscie </h2><p>  Poland is a wet, rainy and relatively cool country.

Already in 1824, a beautiful park was laid here.  In 1897, sources of healing saline water were discovered near the city.  From this moment he gained the fame of a balneological health resort.  Today, recreational and resort enterprises of the city offer year-round vacationers over 60 types of various medical procedures. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Reviews about the pig farm in Poland are extremely positive.  The beaches here are big and clean.  A pine forest wall separates them from the city, exuding divine aromas during the summer season.  All beaches are equipped with sun loungers, awnings, summer cafes, attractions and lifeguards.  A shallow depth and a gentle flat bottom make the swimming process in Swinoujscie safe and as comfortable as possible. </p><p>  The main therapeutic factors of this resort include: </p><ul><li>  Mild marine climate. </li><li>  The presence of healing mud on the coast. </li><li>  Sources of natural mineral waters with a high content of iodine and bromine. </li></ul><p>  Sanatorium treatment here is recommended for people suffering from ailments of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, as well as diseases and disorders of the musculoskeletal system. </p><h2>  Major Attractions and Activities </h2><p>  Tourists consider the unusually beautiful city of Swinoujscie in Poland.  Photos of its attractions, streets and squares confirm this.  There are not only health resorts, but also entertainment for every taste: a large water park, an aquarium, an amusement park, a yacht club.  In the central part of the city there are a large number of cafes, restaurants and night clubs. </p><p>  In addition, the city has preserved many historical, cultural, engineering and architectural monuments.  The most popular and interesting sights in Swinoujscie (Poland): </p><ul><li>  Sea lighthouse. </li><li>  Mill Lighthouse Stawa Mlyny. </li><li>  Fort Gerhard. </li><li>  Fort Agnola. </li><li>  Fort Come. </li><li>  Church of Christ the King. </li><li>  Church of the Virgin Mary of the Starfish. </li><li>  The resort park. </li><li>  Museum of Fisheries. </li></ul><h2>  Sea lighthouse </h2><p>  From almost anywhere in the city you can see its main attraction - the lighthouse, because its height is 65 meters.  This is the highest lighthouse not only in Poland, but also in the entire Baltic region.  It was built at the mouth of the Pig in 1857.  Light from it is visible at a distance of 46 kilometers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.gospodarkamorska.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lighthouse in Swinoujscie" class="if uuid-3223268" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/3223268.jpg"></div><p>  Another lighthouse is located on a spit that protrudes into the sea.  Its size is more modest - only 10 meters in height.  However, this mill lighthouse is the most popular among tourists.  His image often adorns postcards and brochures about the Pig-farm. </p><h2>  Forts </h2><p>  The era of Prussian rule left behind a system of fortifications.  Of the four brick forts built in the middle of the 19th century according to the project of engineer Leopold Ludwig Brese, three have survived to this day.  The largest of them is Fort Gerhard.  It is located on the island of Wolin near the old lighthouse.  This is one of the best preserved coastal forts in Europe.  Initially, it was designed for a garrison of 300 fighters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.polskiepomorze.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pig farm Poland photo" class="if uuid-3223270" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/3223270.jpg"></div><p>  In 2010, a historical museum was opened at Fort Gerhard.  It exhibits military tools, various documents, old maps and valuable photographs. </p><h2>  Church of Christ the King </h2><p>  Pig-farm is also famous for its magnificent sacred monuments.  The oldest church here was built in 1792.  The place was chosen in the city center.  In 1881, a tall and sharp tower was erected over it, which today dominates the entire historical core of the Pig-farm.  From the beginning of the XIX century until today, organ concerts are held in the Church of Christ the King.  But the main highlight of the temple is the layout of an old French corvette.  It is suspended on ropes under the arch of the central nave. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tropter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Swinoujscie Poland attractions" class="if uuid-3223269" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/3223269.jpg"></div><p>  In the city there is another interesting church with a rather unusual name - the Most Holy Virgin Mary Starfish.  It is known for its magnificent stained glass windows and original furniture of the XIX century.  An interesting mosaic has also been preserved above the portal.  It depicts the Virgin Mary with Jesus, sailing in a small boat in the middle of a fierce ocean.  Above the mosaic is an inscription in Latin: "Long live the Star of the Sea!"  Virgin Mary used to be often called the Starfish, as she often directed the sailors who had gone astray to the shore. </p><h2>  Resort Park </h2><p>  The park in Swinoujscie was laid at the beginning of the 19th century on an area of ‚Äã‚Äã60 hectares.  Just at this time, the city was actively and rapidly developing.  The breakdown of the park was led by the talented Prussian gardener Peter Lena.  In 1827, the first thousand seedlings were planted here. </p><p>  Beech, oaks, chestnuts, elms dominate in the Resort Park.  There are also exotics - yews, plane trees, Crimean lindens.  The park has all the necessary infrastructure for a good rest: sports grounds, bike paths, campsites and tennis courts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.atrakcjedzieciece.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Park in Swinoujscie" class="if uuid-3223271" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/3223271.jpg"></div><h2>  Museum of Marine Fisheries </h2><p>  The city, located on the islands of the Baltic Sea, has never experienced a shortage of fish.  The Sea Fisheries Museum is located in the city hall building, built at the beginning of the century before last. </p><p>  Its permanent exhibition tells about the history of the development of the city, the fauna of the Baltic Sea, tools and devices with which fish were caught in ancient times. </p><p>  The museum also houses a collection of amber products.  A separate exhibition introduces visitors to the magical world of coral reefs. </p><h2>  Opinions of tourists </h2><p>  Everyone who visited this resort, only good reviews leave it.  Noted advantages: </p><ul><li>  Beautiful nature. </li><li>  Cleanliness and order around. </li><li>  Reasonable prices in hotels and restaurants. </li><li>  Germany is very close, which can even be reached on foot. </li><li>  Friendly locals. </li><li>  In summer, warm water in the sea. </li></ul><p>  Noted disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  Too long to get there.  From Warsaw, you first need to take a train to Pigsties, and then take a taxi to its spa part. </li><li>  In restaurants and cafes, the menus are mainly in Polish and German. </li><li>  There are few offices in the city where you can rent a car.  We have to go to Germany for this. </li></ul>
