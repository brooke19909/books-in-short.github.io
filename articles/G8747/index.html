An interesting fact is that after seven in the evening in the resort town it is forbidden to swim.  All attempts to violate the ban are prevented by the embankment guard.  Such measures, according to the local administration, will help save the lives of tourists and locals who are intoxicated. </p><h2>  Attractions Portoroz </h2><p>  Many tourists who prefer a vacation in Slovenia seek to combine a stay on the beach with wellness programs.  The real attraction of Portoroz is the Terme Palace sauna center.  There are four thermal pools with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã700 square meters.  The most popular are Jacuzzi with hydromassage.  Tourists from all over the world come to Slovenia in order not only to enjoy the local beauties, soak up the Adriatic coast, but also to restore their well-being.  Such procedures are especially useful for people with diseases of the cardiovascular system. </p><p>  Numerous entertainment complexes and a casino can be considered a landmark of Portoroz.  Young people arrange bright night parties here, spending money for their pleasure. </p><h2>  Piran </h2><p>  If we talk about the resorts of Slovenia on the sea, you can not help but remember about this small town, which in the past was also part of the Venetian Republic.  Locals still consider themselves a little Italians today.  In particular, it is easier for older people to communicate in Italian than in English.  Piran is worth a visit for those who seek not only to spend time on the beach, but also to study the ancient architecture.  The city has virtually no modern buildings. </p>

    <p>  The central square is considered the heart of the city.  Here is the Municipal Council, as well as St. Peter's Basilica.  Those who are going to Slovenia for shopping should not plan a vacation in Piran.  Many tourists call the settlement an open-air museum.  Large shopping centers would spoil the original old architecture. </p><h2>  Sights of Piran </h2><p>  Tartini Square is one of the city's most popular attractions.  Reviews of tourists about her can be heard only positive.  The square is located near the embankment, it is always clean here, you will not be able to meet vagrants.  Cafes and restaurants located around contribute to a great stay.  You can meet many families with young children.  At night, the illumination of buildings is switched on, which adds more mystery to the historical area. </p>

    <h2>  Sights of Koper </h2><p>  Many monuments and objects of architecture tell us that in the past the seaside resorts of Slovenia belonged to the Venetian Republic.  Photos of the city really impress with their beauty.  The pride of Koper is the Pretoria Palace, which was built in 1464.  The architectural structure is located on the main street of the resort town.  The Loggia Palace will also be of interest to tourists.  Today it houses an art gallery. </p><p>  It is no coincidence that many families with small children visit Slovenian resorts on the sea.
