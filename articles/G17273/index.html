  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Camera shutter speed</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Any novice photographer should know <span>what the shutter speed of the</span> camera is, since this characteristic affects the quality of the pictures.  This is described in more detail in the article. </p><p>  <strong>What is exposure</strong> </p><p>  It is known that photography is obtained from the influence of light on the camera‚Äôs matrix.  The gate through which light enters the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãits shutter, which opens and closes thanks to the shutter button.  The time for which it turns out to be open is called endurance.  By changing its value, you can adjust the amount of light that enters the camera‚Äôs matrix. </p><p>  Often, pictures that are either highly darkened or with white areas turn out to be so because the shutter speed was set incorrectly.  Light, if there is a lot of it, burns out pixels on the matrix, and its lack leaves them in black light.  The quality of the photo depends on the shutter speed.  To convey the effect of blurring water, you can choose a shutter speed of 1 second and to infinity. </p><p>  <strong>Canon</strong> <strong>Cameras</strong> <strong></strong></p><p>  Digital electronics for photographers is represented by two groups: the so-called ‚Äúsoap dishes‚Äù for a wide range of lovers, and ‚ÄúSLR‚Äù cameras for professionals.  Canon is a popular brand that produces electronics for the home and office, including photographic equipment.  Camera specifications vary, of course.  So, Canon camera shutter speed may <strong> </strong>  be 1/500 of a second. </p><p>  There are two ways to create creative photos.  There are two modes for this: <span>aperture priority</span> (AV) and shutter priority (TV).  When you select the first, the shutter speed on the camera is set automatically.  Such shooting is suitable for photo portraits, macro photography and any kind of photographs.  When moving to shutter priority (TV), you can select its value, and the aperture is selected by the camera.  This mode allows you to capture motion in the frame. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition to the undoubted positive qualities of Canon technology, there are also problems, one of which is slow shutter speeds when using the AV flash mode, as a result of which the pictures are darkened.  It is very important that you read the instructions carefully before using the camera.  Different ‚ÄúSLRs‚Äù in a mode called ‚ÄúAperture Priority‚Äù (AV) behave differently.  There are no complaints about some models, while others regularly receive complaints. </p><p>  When using the flash in a dark room, the Canon camera takes pictures blurry due to the slow shutter speed.  This is due to the fact that the device itself installs it, without taking into account the presence of a flash.  For rooms, as a rule, a slow shutter speed of ‚Äì1/15 seconds is set.  At the same time, the camera exposure affects the quality of the pictures, and the role of the flash is small. </p><p>  According to the instructions, the camera must be mounted on a tripod.  However, in reality this is not always possible.  Especially when the subject is in motion.  So, a shutter speed of 1/15 second for shooting people is too long. </p><p>  This mode is called "slow synchronization."  The ‚ÄúDSLR‚Äù Canon goes into it in AV mode at factory settings.  But when taking pictures, this effect is not always useful.  How to avoid the automatic inclusion of "slow synchronization"?  One of the solutions to the problem may be turning to the settings where you need to find the flash switch and set its position to 1/200.  But the shutter speed of the camera will not be enough to create high-quality images, because there will not be enough light.  So, in order to avoid marriage in the photo, you need to take care of additional lighting in the room or select the M mode on the camera. At the same time, set the shutter speed to not too long and not too short.  This will help to avoid blurry shots and darkened <span>background.</span> </p>
