Some of them can have serious consequences for the driver, even if he is not to blame for this.  In order to understand what actually happened in a particular situation, a very popular device was created today, called a DVR.  This thing helps in the video format to reproduce the most accurate picture of what happened.  The <span>ParkCity <span>DVR HD</span> 460</span> model <span>, the review of</span> which is presented later in this article, is an excellent solution for both beginners and experienced motorists in order to prove their case in case of such a need. </p>

    <h2>  Kit </h2><p>  First, a few words about the configuration of the device.  The main set includes the device itself, two cameras, two USB cables six and three meters long (designed to connect the rear and front cameras, respectively).  In addition to this, there is also a cord in the box for connecting the car with the <span>ParkCity DVR HD 460 DVR, an instruction</span> manual, a remote control, and also all documentation with a warranty sheet from the manufacturer. </p><h2>  general description </h2><p>  The presence of two cameras of the remote type is the main feature of the model.  Each of them records everything that happens in the sector entrusted to it in HD resolution.  Information is stored on a memory card installed in the main unit.  The viewing angle of the cameras is a total of 240 degrees.  It should be noted that the device is not equipped with its own monitor, therefore, to output a video signal, it is necessary to connect to an external screen.  To do this, you can use the display of the car itself, a multimedia system or an external monitor. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Main unit </h2><p>  The heart of the <span>ParkCity DVR HD 460</span> is the so-called main unit.  It is a small rectangular box, the dimensions of which are only 110 x 52 x 8 mm.  On its front side is the name of the manufacturer, as well as two large buttons.  One of them is designed to turn on the device, and the second - to activate the write protection function.  Nearby are power and recording indicators.  On the left side, the developers installed a miniUSB connector and a slot for installing a memory card, and on the right - a reset button and a port for connecting cameras.  After completing the trip, the user can take the main unit with him to watch video material on his home computer, or leave it at his discretion.  In this case, a new adjustment of the location of the cameras is not needed. </p><h2>  Features of functioning </h2><p>  <span>The ParkCity DVR HD 460 dashcam</span> starts shooting video immediately after it is turned on.  Recording by both cameras is carried out simultaneously.  At the same time, for each of them a separate folder is provided in the memory card.  The user in the menu independently selects the duration of the clip.  In particular, this parameter may be one, three, five or ten minutes.  A stamp with time and date is displayed in the upper left corner of the frame for each camera, so if necessary, you can compare these values.  Initially, by default, video from the front camera is displayed, but when reverse gear is turned on, the picture from the rear camera automatically starts to be displayed.  Also in this case, visual markup appears, designed to facilitate the parking process (when saving video and viewing it is not available in the future).  You can also switch to the rear camera using the remote control. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Record </h2><p>  Multifunctionality in terms of recording characteristics is considered another feature of the <span>ParkCity DVR HD 460</span> video recorder <span>. Responses</span> from device owners indicate that when the main unit is offline, it is best to choose a mode in which the device is activated when the car starts moving and turns off immediately after closing the doors.  Another interesting feature of the model is automatic recording when motion is detected near the car.  This is very useful if the car is in an open area or parking lot.  It should be noted that the developers excluded the possibility of false positives, because if there is no nearby movement for five seconds, the device turns off. </p>

    <h2>  Installation Features </h2><p>  Ideally, <span>ParkCity DVR HD 460</span> should be trusted by a specialist.  In order to connect the device, it is necessary to lay the camera route on the rear window, as well as permanently connect to the reverse sensor and the on-board power system.  The main unit is best placed in the niche of the so-called glove box.  At the same time, its body should be visible when opening for easy removal of the memory card and the visibility of the remote control signal.  The recorder must be connected to the circuit with a constant "plus", because otherwise, when the engine is turned off, all settings will be reset. </p><h2>  Monitor selection </h2><p>  To connect the <span>ParkCity DVR HD 460,</span> there are several options for choosing a monitor.  In the first case, the screen is built into the cabin mirror.  But this entails additional cash costs.  The second option is possible if the car has a standard <span>multimedia system</span> with a display.  In this case, the DVR is quite simple to connect to the video output.  It should be noted that this model was created precisely for such a case, therefore it is considered a priority.  One more proof of this is the fact that even the fonts in the menu are made small with the expectation that the image will be displayed on a five-inch display.  The third way is to install an external monitor on the front panel.  Its role may be a navigator or a portable TV. </p>

    <h2>  Video quality </h2><p>  The quality of the videos recorded with the <span>ParkCity DVR HD 460 is</span> hardly outstanding.  Be that as it may, on the clips you can clearly see the fixed objects, regardless of the time of day or weather conditions.  Thanks to the built-in microphone, the picture is accompanied by sound.  When choosing the maximum resolution, the video material is subjected to high compression, and therefore one minute takes a little more than 50 megabytes of space.  This is a very decent indicator, considering that recording from each camera is carried out in parallel in different folders.  Along with this, the feedback from the owners of the device suggests that you should not expect high quality and smooth transitions from videos.  Be that as it may, the picture has a good brightness range, and road signs with markings are very clearly visible. </p><h2>  Remote controller </h2><p>  Another feature of <span>ParkCity DVR HD 460</span> can be called the presence of a remote control.  Many users note its small size.  If you carefully read the instructions, you can learn to use many functions and set parameters that greatly simplify the operation of the device.  For example, when activating the so-called motion lock, you can create a video recording any movement near the car, and the Up / Lock button will protect the recorded video with two clicks. </p>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Summing up, it should be noted that the cost of a model in the domestic market averages about 6400 rubles.  At first glance, this amount may seem rather high.  On the other hand, the device not only has a number of advantages compared to competitors, but can actually help its owner get rid of the results of unpleasant traffic accidents if he is not to blame for them. </p>
