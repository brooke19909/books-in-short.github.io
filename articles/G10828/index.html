  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Smartphone Qumo Quest 570: description, reviews, specifications</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Just ten years ago, when buying a phone, everyone thought first of all about its durability.  And no wonder, because then the development of the technological process went rather slowly, and often the reason for changing the phone to another model was only its breakdown.  Now everything has changed.  The characteristics of smartphones are growing by leaps and bounds, every year there are a lot of new software that requires more and more productivity, and sometimes an ordinary user is not even able to notice when his device has already become outdated. </p><p>  However, despite such rapid growth, some smartphones released two or three years ago still have not lost their relevance, although they are far from modern flagships.  One of these smartphones is the Qumo Quest 570, which first saw the light in 2013.  He had enough time to prove himself on the positive side.  In this article, we will consider what his strengths and weaknesses are, as well as what users who have been with him for some time say about him. </p><h2>  Appearance and equipment </h2><p>  This smartphone was one of the first devices that in common people began to call ‚Äúshovels‚Äù.  The reason for this is the rather large diagonal of the display - 5.7 inches.  However, despite this, the gadget got a pretty nice look, and its use does not cause inconvenience. </p><p>  The case is made with high quality, no creaks and backlashes have been noticed.  The back cover of the Qumo Quest 570 is removable and gives access to two SIM cards, as well as a slot for memory cards.  Outwardly, the phone looks solid, and may well claim the role of a representative model, although by modern standards it can be safely attributed to the budget series. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Options from the manufacturer are quite rich.  In the box, in addition to the smartphone itself, after the purchase you will also find an additional battery, a case, a USB cable and a charging unit, a headset, and in addition to a few documents - a brief instruction and a warranty card.  It seems that this is the maximum possible choice of additional options that can be packaged by the manufacturer from the factory. </p>

    <h2>  Communication Standards and Wireless Modules </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the Qumo Quest 570 Gray smartphone does not support the modern 4G communication standard, but it can cope with 3G networks without problems, the coverage of which is much better developed.  Switching between 3G and 2G occurs without time delays, which increases the comfort of using mobile networks for data transfer. </p><p>  There is a built-in GPS-module that allows you to use navigation programs offline.  Positioning accuracy is high, it finds satellites quickly. </p><p>  Among the main wireless modules, there is Wi-Fi with b / g / n standards, as well as Bluetooth with support for the A2DP profile, which allows you to connect a wireless stereo headset to listen to music. </p>

    <h2>  Software </h2><p>  The firmware from the box is the Google Android 4.1 operating system, which subsequently receives an update by air to 4.2.  Unfortunately, this is the maximum that exists for this unit.  However, if you have knowledge in the field of firmware for mobile devices, you can try installing a custom version of the software.  The network has the opportunity to find Google Android 4.4 for this device with different design options. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In general, the software is optimized well, despite its modest characteristics, the system interface works smoothly, there are no special problems when using a smartphone. </p>

    <h2>  "Iron" characteristics </h2><p>  The chip from MediaTek MT6577 is the central processor.  It has two cores with a frequency of 1.2 GHz each.  They work in tandem with the PowerVR SGX531 graphics accelerator, located in the same chip.  It complements a bunch of 1 GB of RAM, which makes the Qumo smartphone quite modern and allows the device to compete with the budget segment, despite its venerable age. </p><p>  But there is frankly little space for storing program and user files - only 4 GB, and this is one of the weaknesses of the Qumo Quest 570. Reviews are ambiguous in this matter, since for 2013 it was a rather small figure.  Modern realities suggest that if you buy this model, you should still immediately count on the acquisition of a memory card.  The gadget supports micro-SD cards with a capacity of up to 32 GB. </p>

    <h2>  Display </h2><p>  Perhaps the display is one of the strengths of this smartphone.  This is a high-quality IPS-matrix with good viewing angles and a sufficient supply of brightness for comfortable use, allowing you to use your smartphone in any weather and under any conditions.  At a resolution of 1280x720 and a diagonal of 5.7 inches, a record for those times, the pixelation is almost invisible, and the picture looks vibrant and saturated, without a pronounced advantage of any shade.  For this, you can safely put a major plus on your smartphone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The sensor is equipped with standard parameters in the form of a multi-touch for five touches.  Noteworthy, a good glass touchscreen Qumo Quest 570 with a good response and accuracy, but prone to damage in the form of scratches.  It is recommended that you use a protective film or carry the phone in a case that covers the display. </p>

    <h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  The smartphone received a fairly high-quality main camera with a resolution of 8 megapixels.  It allows you to take high-resolution photos, and in good lighting, pretty good pictures are obtained.  There is autofocus with a short focusing time, which compares favorably with the competitors Qumo Quest 570. The characteristics of its camera for 2013 were generally almost top-notch.  There are a small number of filters that can be applied immediately during shooting.  Of course, if you shoot in low light, then noises appear, but this problem is typical for almost all mobile devices, since their camera aperture is low. </p><p>  There is an LED flash, which does not help much when photographing, but it can come in handy as a good flashlight.  If you shoot using the flash, the phone often makes a mistake with the choice of mode and shutter speed, resulting in photos that are either overexposed or with a distorted color scheme. </p><p>  The front camera does not differ in quality, since it uses a matrix with a resolution of only 0.3 megapixels.  It is enough for video calls, but it‚Äôs better not to count on selfies.  Photos are obtained not bad in sharpness and color reproduction, but with a resolution of only 640x480 pixels, which is categorically not enough to get a high-quality picture. </p>

    <h2>  Positive sides according to user reviews </h2><p>  The smartphone has a number of strengths that users often notice in their reviews after prolonged use.  In particular, the following points can be distinguished among them: </p><ul><li>  Fully loaded out of the box.  Not every manufacturer can now boast of having a branded cover and headset in the starter kit. </li><li>  Attractive and ergonomic design.  Despite the rather large diagonal, the Qumo smartphone looks nice and lies comfortably in the hand. </li><li>  The presence of all the necessary wireless modules and sensors that increase the comfort of using a smartphone. </li><li>  Capacious battery.  The presence of a 3200 mAh battery allows you to use the Qumo Quest 570 Gray smartphone in active mode without worrying that there is no power outlet nearby.  And an additional battery of the same capacity, which you can always carry with you, doubles the battery life. </li><li>  Pretty high-quality main camera.  Pictures from the camera have a resolution of 8 megapixels without interpolation, and good optics allows you to get nice-looking photos in almost any conditions. </li><li>  A large, but at the same time high-quality display, which allows you to easily use any application in any environment.  Ideal for use as a book reader and navigator. </li></ul><p>  As you can see, the smartphone has a number of advantages that distinguish it in a favorable light among other devices of its price segment, even more modern.  However, there were some cons. </p><h2>  The negative sides of the smartphone </h2><p>  Any electronic equipment can not do without cons, and this smartphone is no exception.  Among the aspects that users did not like are the following: </p><ul><li>  Firmware clutter with unnecessary applications that cannot be removed by regular means.  As a result, the increased battery consumption of the Qumo Quest 570, the firmware requires serious refinement, by rutting and removing unnecessary applications. </li><li>  The lack of updating the operating system to modern versions. </li><li>  Quite a lot of weight (which, however, can partially be explained by the large screen size and capacious battery). </li><li>  Low volume of the main speaker.  If necessary, this problem can be solved by changing the limit values ‚Äã‚Äãthrough the engineering menu. </li></ul><p>  As you can see, there are problems, but for some they may seem uncritical.  For other users, these points may be important.  Therefore, before you buy a Qumo Quest 570 smartphone, you should weigh the pros and cons well. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  This model is suitable for those who do not pursue modern characteristics and use a smartphone primarily as a means of communication, as well as as a multimedia player.  You should not count on support for modern games, although many casual entertainment applications will run on the Qumo Quest 570 without any tangible problems.  The device is also convenient as a navigator thanks to the large display. </p>
