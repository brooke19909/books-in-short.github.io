  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How much the investigator gets: salary level by region, prospects</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the most popular genres demanded by modern readers is, of course, a detective story.  There, an experienced, wise and charismatic investigator brilliantly copes with the most complicated cases, leading killers, thieves, bandits and other villains to clean water.  All cases in books end with spectacular fastening of handcuffs on criminal hands.  But this is often fiction.  It is necessary to understand what the investigator does in the real world and how much he receives for his hard and sometimes dangerous work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="youcanbeawesley.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="follow the trail" class="if uuid-2902169" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109095/2902169.jpg"></div><h2>  What are the investigators </h2><p>  In Russia, there are three of the largest law enforcement agencies with their own investigative apparatus.  These are the Investigative Committee, the <span>Ministry of the Interior</span> and the Federal Security Service.  Formally, they differ in functions, but recently their areas of activity have often been mixed up and sometimes even lead to interagency conflicts.  There are many examples of this in the media.  If you try to figure out what they should do, you get the following picture. </p><p>  Investigators working in the Investigative Committee are involved in serious and especially serious crimes, murders, rapes, major thefts and similar offenses.  Investigators of the internal affairs bodies are focused on cases of lesser social significance, although they also fall within the scope of the Criminal Code (for example, beatings and robberies), as well as administrative affairs.  Well, FSB investigators - as the name implies - are investigating cases related to state security - the capture and exposure of spies, which exist not only in James Bond films, but also in reality.  In addition, large internal affairs of importance to state security, such as hostage-taking or economic crimes in the relevant sectors, fall into the sphere of interests of FSB investigators.  It is curious that most of the investigators in the Investigative Committee are men, and in the internal affairs bodies - women.  And the vast majority are young people under the age of 30. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition to the aforementioned large departments, the State Customs Committee, the State Fire Supervision Service, the Federal Penitentiary Service and several other departments of the country have their investigators and interrogators in small numbers.  The bulk of the crimes are recorded and investigated in the system of the Ministry of the Interior, of the 740 thousand cases of the preliminary investigation, more than 600 thousand fall to the police and only about 100 thousand fall to the Investigative Committee. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bashinform.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="criminal proceedings" class="if uuid-2903430" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109095/2903430.jpg"></div><h2>  Special ranks </h2><p>  In addition to the position, each investigator, for example, the Investigative Committee, also has a special rank - from junior lieutenant to general of justice, and the terms for assigning ranks to the rank of lieutenant colonel of justice are regulated by the corresponding provision on this committee.  If an employee works diligently, has no penalties, then the terms for the next rank can be from 1 year (from junior lieutenant to lieutenant) to 5 years (from lieutenant colonel to colonel).  Assistant investigators have the rank of warrant officer or senior warrant officer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="xn--80axf.xn--b1aew.xn--p1ai" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cadets of the Ministry of Internal Affairs" class="if uuid-2903426" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109095/2903426.jpg"></div><h2>  Factors determining the level of remuneration of the investigator </h2><p>  Three main factors determine how much an investigator gets.  It depends on the position held by the investigator, on his special rank and region of service.  Of course, the level of remuneration, or rather, of service, is also affected by the conscientiousness of the performance of one's official duties.  The figures of how much the investigator receives in Moscow are very different from the income level of investigators in the regions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="kinotaun.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="investigator and expert" class="if uuid-2902172" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109095/2902172.jpg"></div><h2>  Is the investigator's job promising </h2><p>  In terms of crime, Russia is closer to the middle of the global statistics, but nevertheless, the number of various types of offenses and their severity do not allow us to say that the problem is basically solved or is on the way to its solution.  Therefore, the profession of an investigator has been and remains in demand in modern society.  Weakly believe in the predictions of naive futurologists that someday bright times will come and crime will completely disappear.  So far this has not been observed. </p><h2>  Investigator salary composition </h2><p>  Since the investigator as an official is, first of all, a civil servant and has a special rank, it is not entirely appropriate to speak here about wages in the sense of terminology.  Like military personnel, investigators have a monetary allowance determined by their position and rank, the size of which also depends on the region where the service takes place.  In addition, additional payments are provided for the effectiveness and scope of work.  Moreover, these bonuses can be paid both in cash and with valuable gifts.  There are additional payments for length of service, for conscientious performance of official duties, for work with information constituting a state secret, special conditions of service, and a number of others.  In addition, investigators enjoy great privileges in terms of social and legal guarantees, that is, what is called a social package in civilian life.  This includes preferential or free trips, medical care, travel benefits, compensation for personal expenses and other pleasant things, which, incidentally, apply to family members of the investigator.  There are also investigator assistants.  How much the assistant investigators receive depends on their status.  If the assistant investigator works on a voluntary basis, he does not receive any wages.  Staff assistants can earn 15,000-20000 rubles a month. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sledcom.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tracker bus" class="if uuid-2902210" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109095/2902210.jpg"></div><h2>  investigative committee </h2><p>  The question of how much the investigator of the Investigative Committee receives can be answered by examining social networks and fairly scattered data on the Internet.  On average, <span>salaries in Moscow,</span> in the central office, can reach up to 80,000-90000 rubles per month.  The head of the Investigative Department of this committee in Moscow earns so much.  Ordinary staff receives less, an average of 45,000-60000 rubles.  In the regions, payment is even lower and ranges from 30,000 to 50,000 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.depositphotos.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="police car" class="if uuid-2903596" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/2903596.jpg"></div><h2>  Internal Affairs Bodies </h2><p>  Investigators of the internal affairs bodies, in comparison with the mentioned officers of the Investigative Committee, receive a slightly lower income.  How much do police investigators in Moscow get?  This is 40000-50000 rubles per month.  From here we turn to the answer to the question of how much the investigators of the Ministry of Internal Affairs receive in provincial cities, where their salary can even start from 15,000 rubles, which absolutely does not correspond to the significance and complexity of their work.  A police investigator serving in the central office in Moscow is the highest category in terms of how much a police investigator can get in general.  And this ceiling, although lower than that of his colleagues from the Investigative Committee, is still quite high.  This is 60,000-80000 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gtrk-kaluga.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kaluga investigator" class="if uuid-2903424" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109095/2903424.jpg"></div><h2>  Vacancies for investigators </h2><p>  There are too few vacancies for this position on public recruiting resources, for example, in Moscow only 12 vacancies for a huge city were found, in Novosibirsk, Krasnodar and a number of other large cities of Russia there are no vacancies at all.  The same thing needs to be said about the website of the Investigative Committee, which also contains a laconic phrase: "There are currently no vacancies."  And this is not surprising, since the specificity of the work suggests that a significant number of employees come to the service through the recommendations of acquaintances or through an active search for potential employees, for example, from those who have left the Armed Forces and other law enforcement agencies. </p><p>  In fact, the investigating authorities are a fairly closed community, preferring to replenish their ranks with trusted people.  Therefore, the answer to the question how much the investigator receives, taking into account all social benefits and non-monetary payments, is quite complicated.  On a number of sites across the country, only a few dozen job advertisements were found.  Amounts from 44000-50000 for Moscow and St. Petersburg to 30000-40000 for small cities such as Verkhny Volochek, Volzhsk, Korolev are offered for beginners in this business.  This information cannot give a complete picture of how much the investigator actually receives in Russia. </p>
