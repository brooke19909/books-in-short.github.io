Knowing it is one of the most pressing issues of epistemology. </p><p>  Most scholars, considering the question of <span>what truth is</span> in philosophy, adhere to the classical concept of truth.  Its origins can be found in the teachings of Aristotle, they are based on the fact that knowledge corresponds to the object, realities, reality. </p><p>  Knowing, a person is not only engaged in the formation of knowledge, but also gives him an assessment: whether it is acceptable, whether it is important or relevant.  But the main type of evaluation is evaluation from two perspectives - truth and falsity.  Therefore, truth in philosophy is not concrete phenomena or things, but knowledge about these phenomena and things. </p>

    <p>  Key provisions of the theory of truth in philosophy </p><p>  The goal of all <span>types of knowledge</span> is truth.  But, it should be noted that truth and error in philosophy always exist together, being constant companions.  Therefore, they occupy a leading place in the <span>theory of knowledge.</span>  Under the error should be understood knowledge that does not correspond to its subject and does not coincide with it.  Truth in philosophy, on the contrary, is consistent with its subject and corresponds to it. </p><p>  It should be noted that the theory of truth in philosophy has two approaches - classical and neoclassical. </p><p>  The classic approach includes the following concepts: </p><p>  - correspondent (provides that the thought and reality correspond to each other, and the idea coincides with reality); </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - authoritarian (represents deep beliefs or absolute trust in authority); </p><p>  - semantic (due to the fact that often the result of a statement about a statement is a semantic paradox, a ban has been introduced on the definition of truth in theory); </p><p>  - The theory of truth in philosophy as evidence (truth is a vivid and clear idea); </p><p>  - The theory of truth as an experience that has confirmation. </p><p>  The neoclassical approach provides for the following concepts: </p><p>  - pragmatic theory (consists in the effectiveness and usefulness of knowledge); </p><p>  - conventional (truth is the result of an agreement); </p><p>  - coherent theory (truth acts as coordinated knowledge). </p>

    <p>  Identity and differences of truth and error </p><p>  Truth is adequate information about the object.  It is obtained by comprehension - intellectual or sensual - or through a message about this comprehension.  Such a truth is characterized in philosophy from the standpoint of its reliability.  Therefore, it can be argued that truth is a subjective reality. </p><p>  But without extremes and errors, humanity only in very rare cases manages to comprehend the truth.  Delusion is knowledge that does not correspond to reality and cannot be accepted as true.  The source of error is real, it reflects objective reality. </p><p>  In any scientific knowledge there is a clash between different opinions and beliefs.  They can be both erroneous and reliable.  <span>Scientific knowledge</span> is usually relative.  Indeed, the truth in philosophy is historical: the object of knowledge is never exhausted.  He has the ability to change, acquire different qualities and an infinite number of relationships with all that surrounds him. </p>

    <p>  Thus, truth and error in philosophy are identical and at the same time different. </p><p>  Their similarity lies in the fact that they, like any other antagonists, cannot exist without one another.  Truth is an adequate, correct way of thinking;  delusion is a distorted reflection of this path. </p><p>  It can also be argued that truth and error are different, because identity also contains a difference, and the difference also implies identity.  Delusion is a high-order abstraction - absolutization - of the moment of knowledge, which is divorced from the subject of knowledge. </p><p>  Therefore, the question of how truth and error are related has a close relationship with truth - both absolute and relative. </p><p>  Delusion must be distinguished from lies.  Lying is a distortion of the truth, done intentionally, deliberately, with the aim of deceiving.  Scientific errors are overcome over time and generate <span>true knowledge.</span> </p>
