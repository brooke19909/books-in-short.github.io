Its population is about 228 thousand inhabitants, and it is also the capital of this state.  Half of the population is African-American, about 30% white, Asian and Hispanic - no more than 2%.  Unfortunately, the city has a high crime rate. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="loaf of rouge" class="if" height="325" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1304411.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  In ancient times, the modern territory of the city belonged to two Indian tribes: Homea and Bayugul, the borders of which were divided by the river.  She now flows through this locality.  When the French arrived here in the 17th century, they disrupted the peaceful way of life, wars and a black period in the history of the city began.  Only in the first half of the 19th century did the situation stabilize a little, and this territory passed under the jurisdiction of the United States. </p><h2>  City location </h2><p>  The main part of the city of Baton Rouge is located on one of the banks <span>of the Mississippi</span> full <span>river</span> and is protected from floods by numerous dams.  As a result of this, and also due to the fact that it is located 14 meters above sea level, floods are not so terrible for residents.  That is why there are so many tourists and those who wish to move to a permanent place of residence. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="baton rouge louisiana" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1304408.jpg" width="600"></div>

Precipitation during the winter is rare.  Throughout the whole year, hurricane winds dominate, which are familiar to residents living in this region.  There is always the danger of unexpectedly getting in the way of a tornado. </p><h2>  Industry </h2><p>  Today, Baton Rouge is a city with a large number of light and chemical industries.  <span>Louisiana</span> holds a leading oil refining position.  One of the local factories in Baton Rouge ranks second in terms of production capacity among all existing similar enterprises in the country.  The port, located on the river, can serve huge <span>cargo ships,</span> as well as large tankers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãin usa" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1304409.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  Among the sights of the city, it is worth noting the large Louisiana State University (LSU), in which about 30 thousand people are educated.  The campus has 250 buildings with an average age of about 100 years.  Almost the entire population in the city supports the LSU Tigers student basketball team.  Matches with her participation attract a large number of spectators.  And the university stadium in 2015 at one of the games accommodated more than 102 thousand people. </p><p>  Also in the city stands a structure of 34 floors, which is clearly visible from a long distance due to the peculiarity of its lighting.  Baton Rouge is home to science fiction writer Steve Perry. </p><p>  You can also visit many famous museums.  The city is famous for other ancient monuments, in particular the destroyer "Kidd" and the powder cellars of the old arsenal. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  Baton Rouge (Louisiana) itself differs from other similar settlements in that there are no satellite towns near it, which are characteristic of American towns of this size and number of people living.  The rapid growth of residents can be explained by several reasons.  The main one is that people who inhabit territories downstream of the river leave their homes and move to the described place, since the latter is less prone to natural disasters. </p><p>  Baton Rouge is often visited by tourists who forever remember this city.  He brings amazing colors, many emotions and joys to their lives.  Having visited it once, I want to return here again and again.  That is why all travelers who have ever visited this city advise novice tourists to visit it. </p>
