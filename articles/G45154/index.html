    <h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  <span>According to the project, the complex is adjacent to the Moscow Ring Road understudy, which is why problems for families with a car certainly will not arise.</span>  <span>Own departure to the understudy helps to avoid traffic jams and congestion and easily reach any point in the capital.</span> </p><p>  <span>In fact, among potential buyers there are many who do not believe in such a cloudless future.</span>  <span>But experience shows that even at rush hour there are no traffic jams at the place of departure onto the MKAD.</span>  <span>Of course, proximity to the Moscow Ring Road in this case is both an advantage and a disadvantage of the project: unfortunately, the Bitsevsky Park does not help protect residents from endless noise.</span>  <span>Those who managed to visit the construction site note that the builder has installed reliable plastic windows with decent sound insulation as compensation.</span> </p>

    <p>  <span>On the official website of the LCD "Etalon City" you can find information that the apartments are rented with a turnkey finish.</span>  <span>In the usual sense, finishing cannot be called final, but all because it is represented only by a floor screed, electrical wiring, glazing, and installation of a heating system.</span>  <span>If you are comfortable with this option, feel free to buy an apartment here.</span>  <span>If you plan to buy an apartment, where it is enough to bring furniture - take a look at other projects.</span> </p><h2>  Price policy </h2><p>  <span>Apartments in the Etalon-City residential complex belong to comfort class housing, but their cost is clearly lower than the price of apartments inside the MKAD.</span>  <span>You can buy an apartment here from 4.6 million to 18 million rubles.</span>  <span>It is difficult to call this option a budget one, but for this money every resident will get a spacious apartment with an improved layout with pre-finishing, in a developed area of ‚Äã‚ÄãGreater Moscow.</span> </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  <span>LCD "Etalon City" is, of course, an interesting and noteworthy project presented by a worthy developer.</span>  <span>It combines transport accessibility, excellent ecology, a variety of planning solutions and access to all necessary infrastructure.</span>  <span>We advise you to take a closer look at the complex, especially since you can buy an apartment here with significant savings for your budget.</span> </p>
