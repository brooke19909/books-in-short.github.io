    <p>  It is human nature to periodically recall the past, subconsciously comparing his image with the present.  This is happening now: after the disappearance in 1991 from the <span>world political</span> arena of a huge superpower - the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics or the USSR, it is often remembered. </p><p>  Citizens who made those days sometimes mention in conversations that it would be great to revive the USSR.  Although the desire for a better life is inherent in everyone, and people offer the optimal solution, in their opinion, however, before declaring the need to recreate the Union, you should understand well what are the reasons for the formation of the USSR.  Obviously, nothing can arise from scratch.  Therefore, now, as then, the prerequisites for the formation of the USSR should be identified.  Talking about the future is a thankless task, let us leave it to the philosophers.  Wise people say that the future is foggy if the past is unknown.  However, we can now recall what are the reasons for the <span>formation of the USSR,</span> and, if necessary, analyze history. </p><p>  The prerequisites were laid back in 1917, when, after the overthrow of autocracy, the question of the organization of power began to arise more and more often.  In 1919, the Central Commission of the RSFSR issued a special decree according to which Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, Latvia and Russia unite to oppose world imperialism. </p><p>  It is important to note that each of these republics remained independent and retained the right to self-determination, and the railway infrastructure, as well as the military, financial and economic component, became the first and foremost.  Soon, by 1922, the countries of the Transcaucasian Federation joined them, including Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan.  In fact, this is the date of the formation of the USSR - December 30 of the above year. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By the way, at that time only 4 republics were included, the rest joined later.  Work began on the creation of a constitution for the <span>Union of Soviet Republics</span> (1923).  At the same time, the <span>Central Asian</span> , Turkmen, Uzbek, Kyrgyz Soviet republics emerged, which in 1925 became <span>part of the USSR.</span> </p><p>  It was a time of great change.  Every now and then the <span>question of national</span> demarcation arose.  Its reason lay in the fact that the area of ‚Äã‚Äãsettlement of nationalities often did not coincide with the geographical borders of a particular republic.  For example, in Central Asia, several pro-Soviet entities existed at once ‚Äî the Turkestan ASSR (formed in 1918) and two more ‚Äúpopular‚Äù ones ‚Äî the Khorezm and Bukhara republics.  After a series of meetings and ‚Äúredrawing‚Äù of the borders, the Turkmen, Kazakh, and Uzbek republics formed.  The ways of coexistence of these entities were actively considered, various projects were proposed: from the confederation to contractual relations or, which became the predominant, rigid centralized management. </p><p>  Interestingly, the concept of unity and friendship of peoples among representatives of different nationalities was sometimes fundamentally different.  For example, proud representatives of Transcaucasia generally rarely formed alliances.  However, in this case, the union in the ranks of the Soviet Union made it possible to protect its borders from the encroachments of its "neighbors." </p><p>  Summing up, we indicate what are the reasons for the formation of the USSR: </p><p>  - the main one is, of course, the desire of party leaders to gain enormous power without war; </p><p>  - mutual assistance in the restoration of infrastructure damaged during the <span>Civil War</span> ; </p><p>  - a single management body and economic system opened up new opportunities for interaction between the republics within the USSR; </p><p>  - An easy solution to the issue of border protection. </p><p>  Knowing what are the reasons for the formation of the USSR, it is easy to understand that the most important components of the association are currently missing.  In addition, a particular ideology is often included in the list of reasons: at that time, each person strove to create world socialism.  Alas, even here the condition for the reconstruction of the USSR is not respected. </p>
