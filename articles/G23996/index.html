So, the work of the hotline is not well established, it is difficult to get through.  Clients would like to promptly receive answers to questions.  They suggest developing online communication with users.  Such a chat would be a salvation, because there is a lot of incomprehensible information about a loan product. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hardmoneyhome.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="e cabbage first loan reviews" class="if uuid-2989918" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55045/2989918.jpg"></div><p>  Some negative reviews about Kapusta online loans are associated with a too high percentage, but no one forces you to use the services, all conditions are set in advance, so the client knows what he is doing.  Of course, the overpayment is palpable, but if you urgently need funds, you can turn a blind eye to this. </p><p>  Sometimes customers experience difficulties with clearance.  There are also tips from users who believe that it is better to look at more well-known microfinance organizations. </p><p>  We reviewed customer reviews of the Cabbage loan. </p>
