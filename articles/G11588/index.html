This was a key event of the period, which actually meant the collapse of the Eastern Roman Empire.  Constantinople was captured by the Turks.  After this military success, the Turks established total supremacy in the Eastern Mediterranean.  Since then, the city remained the capital of the Ottoman Empire until 1922. </p><h2>  On the eve of the fall of Constantinople </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="1453 year" class="if uuid-2519876" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2519876.jpg"></div><p>  By 1453, Byzantium was in decline.  She lost many of her possessions, becoming a small state, whose power, in fact, extended only to the capital. </p><p>  Byzantium itself only nominally remained an empire.  By 1453, the rulers of even its individual parts, which still remained under its control, in fact no longer depended on the central government. </p><p>  <span>The Byzantine Empire</span> by that time was already more than a thousand years old, during which time Constantinople was captured only once.  This happened in 1204 during the Fourth Crusade.  The Byzantines managed to free the capital only twenty years later. </p><p>  The empire itself in 1453 existed surrounded by Turkish possessions.  The paleologists who ruled the state were in fact the rulers of a dilapidated city, which many left. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the time of prosperity in Constantinople itself, about one million people lived, and by the middle of the 15th century no more than 50 thousand inhabitants remained.  But the empire continued to maintain its authority. </p><h2>  Background of the siege of Constantinople </h2><div class="photo" data-original="weaponsandwarfare.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="1453 year in history" class="if uuid-2519878" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2519878.jpg"></div><p>  The Turks who surrounded the Byzantine Empire from all sides were Muslims.  It was in Constantinople that they saw the main obstacle to strengthening their power in the region.  The time has come when they began to consider the seizure of the capital of Byzantium as a state necessity in order to prevent the start of the next crusade against Muslims. </p><p>  The gaining power of the Turkish state was the cause of one of the key events of 1453.  The first attempt to conquer Constantinople was made by Sultan Bayazid I back in 1396, when he besieged the city for 7 years.  But as a result, he was forced to withdraw troops after the emir Timur attacked the Turkish possessions. </p><p>  All subsequent Turks attacks on Constantinople ended in failure, mainly due to dynastic conflicts.  Due to the divergence of political and economic interests, the neighboring countries failed to create a powerful anti-Turkish coalition in the region.  Although the strengthening of the <span>Ottoman Empire</span> seriously bothered everyone. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Siege of the Byzantine capital </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Events of 1453" class="if uuid-2519877" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2519877.jpg"></div><p>  Under the walls of Constantinople in 1453, the Turks came again.  It all started when on April 2, the advance detachments of the Turkish army headed towards the city.  Residents initially waged a guerrilla war, but the approach of the main Turkish army forced the Romans to withdraw to the city.  Bridges through the ditches were destroyed, and the city gates were closed. </p><p>  On April 5, the main <span>Turkish army</span> approached the walls of Constantinople.  The very next day the city was completely blocked.  First of all, the Turks began to attack the forts, which posed a serious danger to them.  As a result, Turkish artillery destroyed them in just a few hours. </p><p>  Most of April was a long battle, but they were all insignificant.  The Turkish fleet approached the city close to the city on April 9, but was recaptured and forced to return to the Bosphorus.  Two days later, the attackers concentrated heavy artillery under the walls of Constantinople and began a siege that lasted a month and a half.  At the same time, they constantly had problems, since too heavy guns crawled all the time from the platforms into the spring mud. </p><p>  The situation was reversed radically when the Turks brought two special scorers under the city walls, which began to tear down the walls of Constantinople.  But due to the April mud, these powerful guns could only fire seven rounds a day. </p><h2>  Offer to surrender </h2><div class="photo" data-original="leagueofaugsburg.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The fall of Constantinople" class="if uuid-2519875" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2519875.jpg"></div><p>  A new stage of the siege of the city began in the second half of May, when the Sultan invited the Greeks to capitulate, promising an unhindered exit for everyone from the city along with property.  But Emperor Constantine was categorically against it.  He was ready to make any concessions up to paying tribute in the future, but not to hand over the city itself. </p><p>  Then <span>Mehmed II</span> appointed an unprecedented ransom and a huge annual tribute.  But Constantinople did not have such funds, so the Greeks refused, deciding to fight for the city to the very end. </p><h2>  Storm </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.historyanswers.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Storming of Constantinople" class="if uuid-2519879" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2519879.jpg"></div><p>  May 26 began a strong bombardment of Constantinople.  Turkish artillerymen equipped special platforms on which they mounted heavy guns to fire directly at point-blank walls. </p><p>  Two days later, a rest day was announced in the Turkish camp in order to gain strength before the decisive attack.  While the soldiers were resting, the Sultan planned an offensive.  A decisive blow was inflicted in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Likos River, where the walls were already almost completely destroyed. </p><p>  The Turkish fleet planned to land the sailors on the coast of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãMarmara in order to storm the walls, distracting the Greeks from the main attack.  On the night of May 29, the Turkish army launched an offensive along the entire front line, in Constantinople everyone was raised on alarm.  Whoever could carry weapons took up defensive positions at the gaps and on the walls. </p><p>  Emperor Constantine personally participated in repelling the enemy‚Äôs attacks.  The losses of the Turks were too heavy, in addition, in the first wave of the attackers there were a large number of bashbuzuk, the sultan sent them to the walls, so that at the cost of their life they weakened the defenders of Constantinople.  They used ladders, but in most places they succeeded in fighting off the bashbuzuk. </p><h2>  City commissioned </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.reddit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Constantinople surrendered" class="if uuid-2519874" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2519874.jpg"></div><p>  In the end, the Turks broke through the walls, the fall of Constantinople in 1453 became one of the most significant events of that period in history.  There were too few defenders, and besides, they had virtually no reserves to somehow eliminate the breakthrough. </p><p>  And to help the attackers came all new janissary squads, with which the Greeks were unable to cope.  Trying to repel the onslaught, Konstantin with a group of loyal supporters threw himself into a daring counterattack, but was killed in hand-to-hand combat. </p><p>  According to the surviving legend, the emperor before death tore off the signs of royal dignity, rushing into battle like an ordinary warrior.  Along with him, many of his associates died.  The year 1453 in history became tragic for the great city of Constantinople. </p><h2>  Centennial war </h2><p>  There was another important event in history that occurred in 1453.  The hundred-year war, which lasted 116 years, finally ended just then. </p><p>  The Hundred Years War is a series of armed conflicts between England and France, the reason for which was the claim to the French throne of the British Plantagenet dynasty. </p><p>  The result of the war was disappointing for the British, who lost almost all their possessions in France, with the exception of Calais. </p><h2>  What else happened at that time </h2><p>  Of the noteworthy events of 1453, the recognition of the new title by the Austrian princes should also be highlighted.  From this moment, their possessions become the Archduke, and the princes, respectively, receive the title of Archduke.  In Russia, <span>internecine wars</span> ended this year <span>.</span>  And in Istanbul (formerly Constantinople) a university was opened, which is considered the oldest in Turkey. </p>
