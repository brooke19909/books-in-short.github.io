    <p>  This is not the whole list of boarding houses.  In fact, there are a huge number of them, which are difficult to cover in one article.  I would like to describe a few more resort complexes, which Abkhazia became famous for.  Sanatoriums are a favorite vacation spot of many Russians and even foreigners. </p><h2>  Sanatorium named after Chelyuskintsev </h2><p>  The resort complex is located in the picturesque area of <span>Old Gagra.</span>  At the same time, the health resort is ready to accept up to 100 people.  The building is quite old, but annually it is refreshed with redecoration.  Each room has a balcony, a bathroom, furniture and air conditioning.  The sanatorium has its own sand and pebble beach, fully equipped for a comfortable stay.  Three meals a day are included in the price.  Children from 2 to 6 years old can stay with their parents for free.  Medical care is not provided in the sanatorium, however, vacationers can order a massage session or balneological procedures for a separate cost.  Tourists are delighted with this place. </p>

    <h2>  "Moscow" </h2><p>  The health resort occupies a vast territory of 6.3 hectares, which is a park area.  The resort has its own beach with sand and pebbles.  It should be noted that the resort building is located on a hill, so every day you can enjoy a pleasant walk along the convenient steps to the beach.  If necessary, you can use the elevator. </p><p>  The use of comfortable sun loungers on the beach is included in the price.  Near the sanatorium there is a guarded parking lot, which vacationers can use absolutely free.  The price also includes three meals a day.  The rooms of the sanatorium are located in one spacious building.  The cost depends on a set of amenities.  This is one of the few resort centers in which even people with a small income can relax.  Not all sanatoriums of Abkhazia are ready to boast such an advantage.  Prices here are the most affordable (from 800 rubles per day). </p>
