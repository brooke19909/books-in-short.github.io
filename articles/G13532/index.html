  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Jacquard knitting patterns. Symbolism of color and lines</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Jacquard knitting has not gone out of fashion for many years.  Models with bright ornaments can be seen not only on the pages of fashionable knitting magazines, but also on the catwalks during the fashion show.  The origins of this skill must probably be sought in ancient times when the first hand-made textile items decorated with ornaments appeared.  From antiquity, symbolic meanings of color and graphic ornamental interweaving have come down to us. </p><p>  However, jacquard knitting got its name, thanks to the invention of the Frenchman S.N. Jacquard, who in 1808 created a machine for manually weaving threads of various colors.  Since then, <span>jacquard patterns have</span> firmly taken their place in the needlework and industrial production of knitwear.  Bright original patterned models immediately attract attention.  They are suitable for both women and men, and even in the creation of children's clothing have become simply indispensable.  Knitting jacquard patterns allows you to select any color and texture combinations, it is easy to combine pattern knitting, hand embroidery and applique in one model. </p><p>  Knitting jacquard patterns can be found anywhere.  To decorate knitwear, any pattern and ornament suitable for counted embroidery, where one square will correspond to one loop, is suitable.  Of course, jacquard knitting already has its own, ornamental compositions and combinations that have become classic, but you can come up with an ornament yourself by transferring it to checkered paper and coloring it in the right colors.  Knitting jacquard patterns are easy to find online on sites dedicated to this technique.  We will turn to the color component of the ornament, because to make it look elegant, you need to correctly and skillfully choose the alternation of colors in the pattern.  The choice of the <span>color scheme of the</span> ornament is an individual matter, but there is a principle of color compatibility, and it is advisable to adhere to multi-colored knitting, sewing or weaving. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Black and white colors are universal, they are combined with any color.  The saturated red color is the color of summer, its energy, warmth and beauty, joy and strength.  Bright red goes well with white, gray and black, and a more subdued red color will make a composition with blue and blue.  The burgundy color can be combined with all the light shades of the rainbow spectrum.  The emerald green color of spring and the revival of nature in jacquard patterns is combined with any color, giving the product originality and exquisite beauty.  Pure gray color makes a good combination with blue, red, brown, blue and beige.  The blue color and the color of sea water will make up exquisite ornaments with red, green and brown colors, and with white color they will remind you of snowy winter or <span>white sand</span> on the seashore.  Use in jacquard patterns and beige color, which is combined with orange, brown, yellow colors. </p><p>  Fashionable jacquard patterns for knitting is a combination of red, blue, green and yellow colors, which are performed on a white or black background, which makes the knitwear bright and joyful in the summer. </p><p>  When performing jacquard patterns, embroidery is additionally used, decorated with ruffles and frills, and smooth patterned knitting is combined with lace inserts.  Sweaters and <span>vests, mini vests</span> and short bolero-sleeves that are worn over monophonic thin pullovers, as well as voluminous and light models in a romantic style, are decorated with colored ornaments. </p><p>  Jacquard patterns for knitting are, firstly, small-crocheted patterns that are best made from threads of similar colors and shades and complemented with two or three <span>contrasting colors,</span> and secondly, large ornaments, in which they necessarily use bright contrasting color combinations. </p><p>  To knit a jacquard pattern is quite troublesome and difficult.  But you can create an original thing by decorating it with an embroidered ornament on a finished plain canvas.  Ornaments are embroidered with colored thread and a needle with a tambour or special seam on knitwear repeating facial knit loops. </p>
