We will explain in more detail.  The hotel we are describing is located in Greece, on the island of Rhodes.  It is not urban, and therefore has a vast territory.  The hotel is located in the small village of Kallithea.  The village of Faliraki, where the island's best beach is located, is located five minutes away by car.  The capital of the island, the <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãof Rhodes,</span> lies six kilometers from it.  The airport is separated from the hotel by a greater distance - twenty kilometers.  Since the Aldemar Amilia Mare is visited mainly by ‚Äúpackage‚Äù tourists, whose ticket includes a transfer, reviews are silent about how to get from the air harbor to the hotel.  They only mention that the road takes about forty minutes, because on the way the bus takes travelers to other hotels.  As for the trip to the city, tourists claim that the hotel is located extremely well.  Right at its gates is the terminus of a bus heading into the center of Rhodes.  But this option is good for those who like an active pastime and are not averse to getting to know the rich history of the island.  And many tourists did not leave the territory of Aldemar Amilia Mare 5 for the whole vacation. The hotel complex is so large that it resembles a small town.  It has everything - a hairdresser, laundry, shops ... You can even buy a fur coat without leaving the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aldemar Amilia Mare 5 reviews" class="if" height="248" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1418750.jpg" width="600"></div>

But since then the hotel has been renovated several times.  The last repair was completed last year.  You can learn about the glorious past of the hotel from old reviews.  Even when it was called ‚ÄúAldemar Paradise Mare‚Äù, tourists spoke only good things about it.  Over the years the hotel has existed, new buildings have been added to its territory.  Now Aldemar Amilia Mare 5 consists of the main seven-story building with an elevator and four new ones - in three and four levels.  Tourists disagree about which building is better. </p><p>  The seven-story building after renovation looks amazing and spectacular.  But the old layout makes itself felt.  The rooms have wooden floors.  They are covered with a carpet.  In the new buildings, the floors are lined with ceramic tiles, which is more pleasant in the summer, moreover, it does not serve as an irritant for allergy sufferers.  This hotel is closed all year.  The hotel receives its first visitors in April.  And in October the hotel closes for the winter.  The territory of the hotel complex is surrounded by greenery.  The main building is oriented to the sea and pools, on the sides are new three- and four-story cottages.  Reviews praise the art of gardeners and landscape designers who have managed to create a true paradise on this coast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Greece Aldemar Amilia Mare 5" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1418741.jpg"></div>

One bedroom has a wide matrimonial bed, and the other has two separate beds. </p><h2>  Increased comfort </h2><p>  Most of the tourists from Russia occupy the Standard double or the Family Room, which is similar to it, described above.
