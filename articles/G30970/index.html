  <section class="page js-page"><h1>World War I</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The First World War was an imperialist war between two political unions of states where capitalism flourished, for the redivision of the world, spheres of influence, the enslavement of peoples and the multiplication of capital.  Thirty-eight countries took part in it, four of which were part of the Austro-German bloc.  By nature, it was predatory, and in some countries, for example, in Montenegro and Serbia, it was national liberation. </p><p>  The reason for the outbreak of the conflict was the liquidation in Bosnia of the heir to the Hungarian throne.  For Germany, this was an opportunity to start a war with Serbia on July 28, the capital of which was shelled.  Thus <span>began the First World War.</span>  Two days later, Russia began universal mobilization.  Germany demanded an end to such actions, but received no response, declared war on Russia, and then Belgium, France and Britain.  In late August, Japan declared war on Germany, while Italy adhered to neutrality. </p><p>  The First World War began as a result of the uneven political and economic development of states.  Strong conflicts arose between Great Britain and France with Germany, since many of their interests in dividing the globe clashed.  At the end of the nineteenth century, Russian-German contradictions began to intensify, and clashes between Russia and Austria-Hungary also arose. </p><p>  Thus, the aggravation of the contradictions pushed the imperialists towards the division of the world, which was supposed to happen through the war, the plans of which were developed by the general staffs long before its appearance.  All calculations were based on its short duration and shortening, so the fascist plan was designed for decisive offensive actions against France and Russia, which were to take no more than eight weeks. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Russians developed two variants of conducting military operations that were offensive in nature, the French provided for an offensive by the forces of the left and right wing, depending on the offensive of the German troops.  Great Britain did not make plans for operations on land, only the fleet was supposed to protect marine communications. </p><p>  Thus, in accordance with these developed plans, the deployment of forces took place. </p><p>  Stages of the First World War. </p><p>  1.1914  The invasion of German troops in Belgium and Luxembourg began.  In the battle of Maron, Germany was defeated, just as in the East Prussian operation.  At the same time, the battle of Galicia took place, as a result of which the Austro-Hungarian troops were defeated.  In October, Russian troops launched a counterattack and drove the enemy forces back to their original position.  In November, Serbia was liberated. </p><p>  Thus, this stage of the war did not bring decisive results to either side.  The military actions made it clear about the fallacy of building plans for their implementation in a short time. </p><p>  2.1915 year.  The hostilities mainly unfolded with the participation of Russia, since Germany planned its quick defeat and withdrawal from the conflict.  During this period, the masses began to speak out against imperialist battles, and already in the fall a <span>revolutionary situation</span> began to take shape <span>.</span> </p><p>  3.1916  Great importance is assigned to the Naroch operation, as a result of which the German troops weakened their attacks, and to the battle of Jutland between the German and British fleets. </p><p>  This stage of the war did not lead to the achievement of the goals of the warring parties, but Germany was forced to defend on all fronts. </p><p>  4.1917  Revolutionary movements began in all countries.  This stage did not bring the results that were expected on both sides of the war.  The revolution in Russia foiled the Entente‚Äôs plan to defeat the enemy. </p><p>  5.1918.  Russia came out of the war.  Germany was defeated and pledged to withdraw troops from all the occupied territories. </p><p>  <span>The results of the First World War.</span>  For Russia and other countries involved, military operations made it possible to create special state bodies that deal with defense, transportation, and many others.  The growth of military production began. </p><p>  Thus, the First World War was the beginning of a general crisis of capitalism. </p>
