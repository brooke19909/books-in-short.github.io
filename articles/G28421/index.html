    <h2>  Children's creativity </h2><p>  To keep a child busy, you need to give him the opportunity to prove himself in many activities: modeling, drawing, designing.  For someone, sports or music are more suitable.  Observing the degree of involvement of the child in the process, it is possible to understand that he is more occupied, that he is bored more quickly, in what type of activity he is persistent, even if some moments are not immediately successful. </p><p>  If we proceed from the theory of psychologists that every child is talented from birth, then you can and should even try to identify his tendencies.  We must not miss the moment of the beginning of the manifestation of abilities for activity: applied art, art, sports, and sciences. </p><p>  Often the beginning of this process is not easy to identify.  In order not to waste time, you can offer your child to constantly make diverse simple children's crafts for the kindergarten with his own hands (see the photo below).  According to his interest in such activities and the degree of involvement in the creative process, it is highly likely to say which kind of activity he is more inclined to. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Simple crafts </h2><p>  Fresh air and sports for the child is the key to health.  But for each parent, it is important that the children not only grow, but also develop mentally and creatively.  By proposing to make children's crafts for the kindergarten with your own hands (photo below), you can form a habit for them to work with the tool: to design, glue, weave, cut with scissors, sculpt from clay or plasticine using a variety of shapes and patterns. </p>

    <p>  All these applied forms of creativity contribute to the development of skills and tendencies to craft with their own hands.  This approach will definitely not be superfluous; it will be useful in future adult life.  The main thing is that the process of creativity does not take place under duress.  It‚Äôs better if everything is organized in an entertaining way. </p><p>  Compliance with such principles will form a child‚Äôs natural interest in classes.  They will ultimately have a beneficial effect on attention, visual memory, and observation.  In the process of work, <span>fine motor skills of the</span> hands quickly and intensively develop, and when communicating - speech. </p><h2>  Material </h2><p>  For the development of the child, it is important to teach him how to make children's crafts for the kindergarten with his own hands with meaning.  In this case, creativity using <span>natural material</span> will be useful <span>.</span>  Even a stone in the hands of a talented person can turn into a masterpiece of art.  To find original ideas you need to learn how to fantasize. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Nature makes it possible to collect various materials and use them for children's creativity.  A walnut shell can become a shell for a small turtle.  Spiky chestnut peel - ‚Äúclothes‚Äù for a decorative hedgehog. </p><p>  A whole walnut can be used as the base of the head for any animal.  You can put it on a toothpick if you make a small hole in the base.  The trunk can be a large open bump, and limbs can be selected from suitable branches.  It is convenient to use plasticine to connect parts and give finished products a finished look. </p><p>  From acorns you can build an army of soldiers if you "put" them on their feet from matches.  The remnants of foam rubber, fabric, wool, wallpaper, old toys can also be useful.  Plywood, pieces of board or plastic can be used for coasters. </p>

    <h2>  Where to begin? </h2><p>  The organization of the creative process for children in the play space contributes to the knowledge of the world.  DIY crafts for the kindergarten, made by hand, are not only a good pastime, but also new knowledge.  A child of a primary preschool age cannot hold interest and attention on difficult work for a long time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  When the final result of the creative process is not visible in advance, it is difficult to captivate children with persuasion.  At the same time, similar crafts can quickly get bored.  In order not to lose time in the manufacture of more complex works, you can use pre-prepared templates that can easily be used for cutting, molding plastic material or drawing. </p><p>  For the smallest, for example, you can offer a simple way of creativity.  The contour of the image on white or colored paper is surrounded by glue.  If the child sprinkles such a sheet with small colored crumbs, then in the right places, as a result, the composition familiar to him is formed.  It can be <span>children's crafts for the kindergarten for the</span> New Year or other topics.  In the spring, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcomposition could be a gift for mother's day.  Easter is also a great space for imagination. </p><h2>  Children's crafts for kindergarten: autumn simple (middle group) </h2><p>  In autumn, you can and should procure material for <span>winter crafts.</span>  Foliage, interesting configuration dry twigs, acorns, chestnuts, cones - affordable, natural and environmental material for children's creativity. </p><p>  Autumn precedes the winter holidays.  Therefore, in order to have something to make children's crafts for the kindergarten for the New Year, it is worth collecting the appropriate material in advance.  First of all, these are, of course, spruce and pine cones.  Big and small, open and closed, will do. </p>

    <p>  The original centipede can be collected from chestnuts.  They are used as body segments.  Feet can be made from dry fallen twigs of suitable configuration.  They stick to chestnuts with the help of plasticine.  Body segments can be arranged in a bizarre bend.  This is especially liked by children.  A centipede can be as long as it has enough material. </p><p>  By the same principle, you can make a flower.  For the base, an acorn is taken.  With the help of plasticine, a rosehip or chestnut is attached to it.  The ‚Äúseeds-helicopters" of maple collected in spring are used as a whisk. </p><h2>  Winter theme in creativity </h2><p>  Even a three-year-old can make children's Christmas crafts for the kindergarten with their own hands.  From a cone and plasticine he will already be able to build a simple decorative Christmas tree.  It is better to install it on a small base.  For this, the used spool of thread is suitable.  For decorative purposes, it can be wrapped with foil.  Herringbone cone can be painted green and decorated with hand-rolled small plasticine balls of different colors. </p><p>  If it is possible to collect a lot of cones, then a larger Christmas tree can be built from them.  To do this, twist the cone from thick paper and fix it in an upright position.  This will be the basis for the Christmas tree.  Then the whole surface of the cone must be covered with cones.  If you carefully select the size and shape, as well as neatly fix them all with a glue gun, you get a three-dimensional structure that resembles a natural tree.  It can be dressed up with real or home-made Christmas decorations. </p>

    <h2>  Applique </h2><p>  Making children's crafts for the kindergarten with your own hands from colored paper is perhaps the first and most affordable thing a child can do.  However, without the help of an adult mentor in this lesson can not do.  Colored paper is well cut, bent and folded, it is convenient to glue, to collect bright compositions from colorful parts. </p><p>  Without much work, you can make a bunch of grapes or a sprig of lilac.  To do this, you need a sheet of thick paper or cardboard for the base, as well as lilac and green paper.  Parts can be assembled on PVA or with a glue stick. </p><p>  Suitable parts are cut from lilac paper.  For grapes - circles, for lilacs - four-leaf flowers.  For convenience and speed, it is convenient to cut them from a sheet of paper folded several times.  Then all the elements will have the same configuration and similar size. </p><p>  On the sheet of cardboard draw the contour of a future bunch, grease the base with glue and fill it with flowers or berries.  A stem is cut out of green paper, one or two leaflets of different sizes are added, and the composition is ready.  A child, depending on age, can help cut or simply glue parts along the contour of the image. </p>

    <h2>  Children's crafts for kindergarten from natural material </h2><p>  Everything that can be collected in nature should be used in applied art.  First of all, it is fallen leaves, branches, seeds, fruits of trees and shrubs.  Someone may like the art of gathering bouquets from dried plants.  The list of materials suitable for creativity can be continued for a long time. </p><p>  A simple craft can be quickly made from a bizarre pebble, shell, acorn, chestnut.  The choice of material depends on the imagination and idea.  Rose hips and rowan berries, burdocks of burdock and burdock, hazelnuts and walnuts, sunflower seeds, pumpkins, watermelon and melon - all can be adapted to create original compositions. </p><p>  Weaving from twigs, willow branches or straws is also an interesting occupation.  It is too early to create beautiful and practical household items in a kindergarten from such material, but it will not be superfluous to familiarize yourself with the technique of performance on the example of simple products. </p>

    <h2>  Workplace organization and safety </h2><p>  Based on personal observations, parents can determine the circle of interests of their child.  In this they can help kindergarten teachers.  They see what this or that pupil succeeds in, and they can tell in which circle of early development the kid can be registered so that he does his favorite thing. </p><p>  You can do creativity at home.  To begin with, it is worth equipping a workplace.  To prevent the child from being distracted, there should be no foreign objects on the table.  The creative process is associated with a positive attitude.  You may need some fun music to contribute to this. </p><p>  Paints, glue and plasticine in the hands of a child is a material that can stain clothes and furniture.  Therefore, it is better to prepare ‚Äúwork clothes‚Äù and a removable tablecloth on the table for work in advance.  It is possible to use cutting and piercing tools, but the child should work under special supervision after reading the safety rules. </p><p>  By instilling in children a love of applied creativity, parents form their desire to comprehend the world around them.  Making practical children's crafts for the kindergarten with their own hands, the child forms a desire to be useful to society. </p>
