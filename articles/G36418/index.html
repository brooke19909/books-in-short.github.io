  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Totalitarian regime</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The word "totalitarianism" (from the late Latin "totalitas") means completeness, wholeness.  This term appeared and spread in the twenties and thirties.  The concept was used to refer to the then existing political systems of a number of countries.  For example, they said that there is a totalitarian regime in Italy, Nazi Germany, as well as in the Bolshevik Soviet Union. </p><p>  One of the first people to use this concept was J. Amendola.  This author stated that communism, like fascism, is a totalitarian regime, which is a reaction to democracy and liberalism. </p><p>  This term was also used by J. Gentile.  In 1925, the Italian government began to use the definition.  Thanks to the activities of Gentile, who was the ideologist of fascism, this term came into use. </p><p>  <span>A totalitarian regime, the</span> signs of which are quite peculiar, arises (as history shows) in situations of deep crisis: in the post-war period, during the war, etc. At such times, it is necessary to take tough measures to restore the economy, stop feuds, restore order, and ensure stability.  Moreover, social groups in need of protection act as the social basis of the state. </p><p>  Among the conditions conducive to the emergence of a totalitarian regime, researchers point to the industrialization of society.  In this case, one of the main prerequisites for the development of a new political system is an increase in the capabilities of the media, which contribute not only to universal ideologization, but also to establish control over all areas of the individual‚Äôs activities.  In these conditions, the monopolization of the economy is born, combined with the strengthening of state power, as well as its controlling and regulatory functions. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The totalitarian regime is usually characterized by the presence of a single, officially formed ideology.  It is set by the ruling elite, <span>political party,</span> leader, movement or "leader of the people."  At the same time, the state‚Äôs desire to gain absolute control over all spheres of society‚Äôs life, as well as to completely subordinate a person to the prevailing ideology and existing power, is undoubted.  Along with this, the state and people are considered as a single, inseparable whole. </p><p>  Ideology is determined by a <span>political leader.</span>  The basis of this ideology is a natural movement towards a specific goal (towards building communism or world domination, for example). </p><p>  <span>The totalitarian regime</span> accepts only one party.  At the same time, other political formations are dispersed, destroyed, and prohibited.  The party of power (ruling power) is declared the leader, and its installations are presented as sacred dogmas. </p><p>  In conditions of state administration, totalitarianism is characterized by extreme centralism.  Management in practice is presented in the form of executing commands from above.  Moreover, the initiative is not only not encouraged, but also severely punished.  Local authorities carry out the task of transferring teams. </p><p>  The "leader" enters as the center of the entire system.  He is declared the most just, wise, infallible, thinking tirelessly only about the public good.  Any critical attitude towards the leader is immediately suppressed. </p><p>  An integral sign of a totalitarian regime is the constant and widely used terror in relation to the population.  Thus, the main condition for the realization and strengthening of power is physical violence.  To do this, ghettos and <span>concentration camps</span> are created in which torture, hard physical labor, suppression of resistance are widespread, and mass killings of people occur.  It should be noted that the police exist under different political systems.  But under totalitarianism, the "terroristness" of police control is manifested, in which, in order to kill a person, one does not need to prove his guilt. </p>
