They take everything on credit: houses, apartments, cars, furniture, clothes, education, and even vacation packages.  All this, for the most part, has become possible due to the fact that almost all banks offer loans to customers without income statements, collateral and guarantors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="topofblogs.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Loans are granted not only for goods, but also for services or education" class="if uuid-2565221" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90745/2565221.jpg"></div><h2>  Lending terms </h2><p>  Each financial institution offers money on credit on different conditions. </p><p>  What you should pay attention to when choosing a creditor bank: </p><ul><li>  interest rate; </li><li>  the presence of a one-time commission for registration; </li><li>  the presence of monthly commissions; </li><li>  inclusion of insurance payments in the cost of the loan; </li><li>  the maximum possible amount and term; </li><li>  the possibility of partial and full prepayment. </li></ul><p>  <span>Banks</span> offer the most favorable <span>loans</span> to reliable, in their opinion, borrowers. </p><p>  The credit conditions are affected by: </p><ul><li>  customer age </li><li>  experience - both general and at the last place of work; </li><li>  the presence of movable and immovable property, which can be used as collateral; </li><li>  positive credit history; </li><li>  high income, a maximum of 40% of which goes to pay all existing loans; </li><li>  willingness to provide a statement of income; </li><li>  the availability of guarantors. </li></ul><p>  When applying for a consumer loan without income statements and guarantors, do not expect favorable conditions.  Through high interest and commissions, the bank prevents possible losses from unfulfilled loan obligations. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Types of loans without references and guarantors </h2><p>  When planning <span>to take out a loan without an income statement,</span> you cannot count on a large loan amount.  Mortgages, car loans, and just a large amount of cash banks are in no hurry to believe a client with unconfirmed solvency. </p><div class="photo" data-original="loantap.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Different types of lending" class="if uuid-2565207" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90745/2565207.jpg"></div><p>  Types of loans without income statement: </p><ul><li>  cash consumer loan - funds are issued to the client at the bank's cash desk or credited to a bank card, can be spent on any purpose; </li><li>  commodity lending - when a product or service is issued on credit, money is not issued to the borrower, but transferred to the seller‚Äôs account. </li></ul><p>  As a rule, the second type of lending is characterized by more favorable conditions and less stringent requirements for the borrower, since the purchased goods in this case are considered as collateral. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lifehack.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cash loans can be spent on any purpose" class="if uuid-2565218" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90745/2565218.jpg"></div><h2>  Required documents </h2><p>  To apply for a loan at any of the banks of the Russian Federation, a potential borrower needs to provide a package of documents, some of which are mandatory, and the rest can affect the receipt of a positive response on the application and change the terms of lending for the better. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Mandatory: </p><ul><li>  passport confirming citizenship of the Russian Federation; </li><li>  certificate of registration or corresponding mark in the passport. </li></ul><p>  When applying for a loan without income statements and guarantors, the bank may require: </p><ul><li>  international passport; </li><li>  insurance policy (CASCO, medical insurance); </li><li>  certificate of registration of ownership of real estate; </li><li>  statement of movements in a bank account or a certificate of its availability and condition. </li></ul><p>  In the absence of a certificate of employment, any of these documents will be able to confirm the financial viability of the client and increase the chances of obtaining a loan. </p><h2>  Where to get a loan </h2><p>  Determining where to get a loan without an income statement, a potential borrower may be faced with a variety of offers from financial institutions. </p><p>  Institutions providing loans: </p><ul><li>  banks; </li><li>  non-banking organizations, which include credit unions, cooperatives, investment funds. </li></ul><p>  When deciding to get a loan without a certificate of income in such an organization, it is worth remembering about their shortcomings: </p><ul><li>  lack of regulation of activities by the state; </li><li>  high interest rates; </li><li>  possible hidden commissions and payments. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.commbank.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Each bank offers different loan conditions." class="if uuid-2565224" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90745/2565224.jpg"></div><p>  Before applying for a loan, you should carefully read the contract and ask about the reputation of the creditor organization. </p><h2>  Application Methods </h2><p>  Modern banks care about the time and comfort of their customers, so each potential borrower can choose the most convenient way for him to apply for a loan. </p><p>  How to apply: </p><ul><li>  during a personal visit to the nearest bank branch; </li><li>  online on the official page of the bank. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.noobpreneur.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Online loan application" class="if uuid-2565211" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90745/2565211.jpg"></div><p>  It will take less time to fill out an application on the Internet, but the conditions for such a loan will be less profitable.  At the bank office, an employee will ask the borrower additional questions, request a larger package of documents, which will affect the speed of decision making and the proposed conditions. </p><h2>  List of creditor banks </h2><p>  So, there was a need to get a loan without a certificate of income.  Which banks provide this service?
