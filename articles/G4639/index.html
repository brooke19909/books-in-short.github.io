Insurance for expectant mothers is a separate area of ‚Äã‚Äãactivity that SKs are very reluctant to engage in.  The thing is that pregnant women are exposed to a significantly greater number of risks compared to other categories of citizens, especially when it comes to long trips.  Indeed, in any emergency, a threat to health and life is created not only by the woman, but also her unborn child.  That is why only a small part of companies provide insurance for pregnant women when traveling abroad. </p><h2>  Insurance benefits </h2>

In addition, this insurance for pregnant women when traveling abroad has certain restrictions.  This is due to the fact that women bearing a fetus are exposed to so many risks.  According to reviews, the insurance terms are determined by the company individually, however, the policy loses its validity at 25 weeks of gestation.

However, the policy is valid only until the twelfth week of pregnancy, after which it is canceled.  This is stated in the contract, since the insurer does not want to take on additional risks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Extended insurance for pregnant women traveling abroad covers significantly more categories of expenses, up to 31 weeks of gestation.

Moreover, payment is made in full at the time of signing the documents.  The policy applies to the entire time you are abroad, starting from the moment of crossing the border and ending with the return to your homeland.  If you plan regular trips abroad, you can conclude a one-time insurance contract for a period of 12 months and use insurance services for each trip.

    <h2>  A few words about the pitfalls </h2><p>  Each insurance policy for pregnant women traveling abroad insures against certain risks and provides for the coverage of certain cost items, therefore, in order not to be in an unpleasant situation, it is recommended that you carefully read the insurance contract when it is drawn up.  Particular attention should be paid to what cases are recognized by the company as insurance. </p><p>  Most insurers pay the costs associated with the hospitalization of the expectant mother to the hospital, if such a need arises, as well as the first appointment with the doctor and an urgent diagnostic procedure.  Moreover, all costs associated with childbirth and the mother and child in the hospital, abortion or premature birth are not compensated, unless they were artificially stimulated due to a threat to the health and life of the mother or child. </p><h2>  Which insurer is better to choose? </h2><p>  Unfortunately, in the domestic market, not many companies provide insurance services to women who are bearing a child and intending to go abroad.  Industry giants prefer not to get involved in this area because of too much risk.  Nevertheless, there are some insurers through which insurance can be issued for pregnant women when traveling abroad. </p><h2>  Liberty Insurance </h2>
