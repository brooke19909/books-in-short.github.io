They help to make ordinary clothes original, expressive and unique. </p><p>  Irish lace is a classic beyond fashion and time.  Models using this knitting technique are expensive, due to the fact that all the work is painstakingly created manually. </p><div class="photo" data-original="postila.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Irish lace" class="if uuid-2831294" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12424/2831294.jpg"></div><h2>  Luxury born of poverty </h2><p>  The beginning of the appearance of Irish lace is considered the XIX century.  And, oddly enough, this was due to the poverty that reigned on the island.  In those difficult times for the Irish, knitting training centers began to appear as an aid to the poor. </p><p>  Initially, people copied patterns and styles that were already implemented in European countries.  Then their own unique and complex designs began to appear. </p><p>  Due to its uniqueness and beauty, Irish lace has become famous all over the world, and today it is highly regarded as a symbol of masterly mastery of the art of knitting. </p><p>  It became most popular at the end of the 19th century. </p><p>  The technique of knitting Irish lace is recognized as one of the most complex types of this art in the world.  However, it is it that allows you to connect a variety of elements in a picturesque composition, to experiment with shades and textures. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Creating lace has its stages.  First, the motives are knitted, which are ready-made located on the pattern of the future masterpiece in accordance with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe author.  After which they are interconnected by an irregular grid, which is tied between the elements. </p><h2>  About Asa Verten </h2><p>  The real name of the master <strong>is</strong> Galina.  However, fans of her work, she is known as Asya Verten.  Interestingly, this is not a pseudonym, but a middle name given at birth by parents. </p><div class="photo" data-original="asiaverten.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Asya Verten" class="if uuid-2828741" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104363/2828741.jpg"></div><p>  The master has lived in Tuscany (Italy) for more than 15 years, but often visits Russia, where she previously had her own tailoring atelier. </p><p>  Over the past few years, the master is no longer personally engaged in the execution of orders, but leads workshops on working in the technique of Irish lace.  Training materials can be purchased online, as well as attend full-time classes, which are held in Moscow. </p><h2>  Publishing </h2><p>  In 2016, Asya Verten released the first book, which outlined the author's techniques for working in this direction.  The publication has become very popular with readers thanks to not only detailed descriptions, but also colorful illustrations. </p><p>  In her book, the master gathered all her experience in working with Irish lace and put it on the shelves.  This is a great guide for beginners who want to work in this style. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition to the book, there is a video tutorial disk that details training material on knitting both basic and more complex elements on the subject of Irish motifs. </p><h2>  "I draw a lace dream ..." </h2><p>  Asi Verten products are incredibly beautiful and harmonious. </p><p>  Ease of models, their femininity is achieved through the use of the finest threads.  In 100 gr.  material contains 800 meters.  And in some models Asi Verten, the thread is even thinner.  The mesh footage used in the work is up to 1500 m per 100 g.  She knits with hooks with needle sizes from 0.75 to 0.5 mm.  All this makes the process painstaking, and Asya Verten's products are subtle and elegant. </p><div class="photo" data-original="2yanakara.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Irish Lace Asi Verten" class="if uuid-2828782" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104363/2828782.jpg"></div><p>  Her work is unique.  The fact is that she achieved perfect harmony in combining the image of Irish lace with its location, taking into account the individualism and characteristics of the female figure. </p><h2>  The uniqueness and luxury of new looks </h2><p>  The last major collection is called "Paradise."  It consists of luxurious models made using the Irish lace technique.  Products impress with their splendor, refinement and brilliance. </p><p>  In each model, all the details are thought out to the smallest detail, the color palette is harmoniously selected.  The collection includes the jacket "Flower of Eve", as well as dresses "Star of Adam" and "Eden." </p><p>  These models create the image of sensuality and femininity of its owner. </p><h2>  "Eve's Flower" </h2><p>  This is a jacket made in the original technique of Irish lace.  A bright highlight of the product is the image of a colorful poppy.  This flower is often used by fashion designers when creating their masterpieces.  At the same time, this is a rather complex element, which is important to beat correctly so that it looks harmonious and original. </p><p>  In her new work, Asya Verten created poppy mini-compositions on a smooth Tunisian canvas.  It also deserves attention.  A casual casual is obtained thanks to the contrast created by the light Tunisian mesh lining with the dark Irish. </p><p>  "Eve's Flower" successfully combines with jeans for everyday outings, while at the same time in the image with a skirt gives the look a festive look. </p><p>  The jacket model has an unusual cut due to its asymmetry.  One side of the neckline is decorated with floral motifs, the other has a flat surface with an apache collar, which gives the image a look of negligence and easy freedom. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Eve flower" class="if uuid-2828774" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104363/2828774.jpg"></div><p>  The lower part of the jacket is also made in asymmetry: it has a rounded shape on the right, and the left edge has a sharp end. </p><p>  Particular attention should be paid to the back of the model, the composition of which is surrounded by a textured cord along the bend line. </p><h2>  "Star of Adam" </h2><p>  This dress is also part of Asi Verten's latest Paradise collection.  The product is named after the largest sapphire of the millennium weighing 1404.49 carats - "Stars of Adam". </p><p>  The dress looks luxurious due to its rich blue color and a scattering of sparkling rhinestones.  Association with sapphire at the sight of it comes to mind by itself.  Even in a regular photo, Asi Verten‚Äôs Irish lace looks luxurious and elegant. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemaster.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Adam's Sapphire" class="if uuid-2828739" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104363/2828739.jpg"></div><p>  The dress is made in asymmetry and diagonals.  Bright blue color is diluted with all kinds of tones and violet colors.  An unexpected highlight of the composition is a small insert of caramel-lingonberry shade.  The reception turned out to be very successful and makes the dress truly luxurious. </p><p>  The model used rhinestones in the form of crystal, large plastic and thermostats "Swarovski".  Using them in work gives the dress a dazzling sheen.  Interesting: so that the glow of plastic rhinestones does not disappear when damaged by a small scratch, they are covered with colorless nail polish in two layers. </p><h2>  Eden Dress </h2><p>  This model is designed for special occasions.  It is made using the favorite master of the technique of Irish lace. </p><p>  The volumetric and textured appearance of roses, which were originally flat, was achieved through the play of color.  Although only 2 scales are presented in the dress, but by mixing their colors it looks like 3D.  Only a small rose has a mix of 5 shades, and a large rose has 7 colors.  The stems of the flowers contain a mixture of 5 tones of green. </p><p>  Rhinestones are ideally selected, which are scattered in the core of the bud and on its lower petals.  They harmoniously complement the color scheme due to closely selected tones. </p><p>  The product model is noteworthy.  To knit the shoulder, a method was used that allows the deep neckline to hold firmly on the shoulders.  This is achieved thanks to special loops that are on the wrong side along the shoulder line.  Therefore, the bra straps hold very securely. </p><div class="photo" data-original="asiaverten.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Eden Dress" class="if uuid-2828742" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104363/2828742.jpg"></div><p>  The stem of the rose divides the back in half and beats the barely noticeable incision from the back.  This gives freedom to movement, despite the narrower silhouette of the dress. </p><p>  Thanks to a special and individual approach to the technique of Irish lace, Asa Verten manages to create sophisticated models that captivate and attract the eye. </p>
