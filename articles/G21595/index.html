That is why people with big plans are so eager to go there, and with their joint efforts a completely new capital is created.  Now Moscow is growing at a frantic pace and is changing more and more, and the city's residents are only happy about it.  And here, at the intersection of the 24th km of the Moscow Ring Road and Kashirskoye Shosse, the Vegas shopping and entertainment center, or, as the people call it, Vegas on Kashirka, found its place.  And although it opened relatively recently, on June 1, 2010, it has already become the most popular public place in the city.  Such overall shopping and entertainment centers throughout Russia can literally be counted on the fingers, and therefore in this article we will talk about it. </p><h2>  Key Features </h2>

And this is not without reason, because here the most intricate 5-tier labyrinth, amazing 5D cinema, extreme attractions such as the Tower of the Fall, Typhoon, UFO, Tsunami, and also Sea battle ‚Äù,‚Äú Ferris Wheel ‚Äùand several other large attractions, as well as many slot machines and a special children's park for kids.  Thus, the creators of this large-scale project took into account the wishes of people of all ages, which earned them such popularity in Moscow.  They also built an indoor ice rink in the shape of a ring, although small in area, but very well-groomed.

    <h2>  Facilities </h2><p>  The creators of this shopping and entertainment center deserve special praise for such a pleasant care of visitors.  Firstly, it is extremely convenient to separate floors and rooms, so you can easily navigate and not wander for a long time in search of the necessary department.  Firstly, it was manifested in the appearance of thematic streets, which were discussed in detail at the beginning of the article, secondly, in the existence of ‚Äúfemale floors‚Äù, entire pavilions with only shoe or clothing departments, and thirdly, in the foresight of the navigation system with touch screens in the center, because it‚Äôs still easy to get lost here, it‚Äôs not without reason that Vegas is called a trading city.  A large number of security guards are also pleased, at first glance it even seems that there are slightly fewer of them than visitors, which means you should not worry about your finances and expensive acquisitions. </p><h2>  Conditions </h2>

These are comfortable sofas in boutiques for expecting husbands with children, stylish tables in restaurants and cafes, as well as many benches and armchairs in the corridors, as visitors walking through such a vast territory will surely tire.  But at the food court and in home appliance stores, one cannot help but rejoice at the incredibly comfortable service, thanks to which you will not have to stand in terrible lines waiting for a cup of espresso or a new acquisition.

    <p>  Vegas opening hours on Kashirka are also provided for visitors of all ages: on weekdays from 10 am to 11 pm, and on weekends and holidays until midnight.  At the same time, you practically do not have to worry about free parking space, because, in addition to underground parking, there is also a ground one, designed for (think only!) 7.5 thousand cars. </p><h2>  How to get there? </h2><p>  Of course, the inevitable multi-kilometer traffic jams on the MKAD make certain difficulties, however, there are clearly no fewer people wishing to visit this trading city.  As mentioned earlier, this center is located at the intersection of the Kashirskoye highway with the 24th kilometer.  At the same time, you will certainly notice from afar the huge, impressive in its dimensions and excellent design, shopping and entertainment center "Vegas" on Kashirka.  How to get to it?  The creators also thought about this: you can be taken by a special free Vegas bus, as well as city routes No. 37 and No. 471. </p>
