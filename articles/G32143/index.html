The device is a professional-grade mirror digital model.  With its birth the camera set a completely new standard for this kind of technology. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon 5DS" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/974997.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  general description </h2><p>  The design of the Canon EOS 5DS is almost identical to its predecessor - the EOS 5D Mark III.  Moreover, the location of the controls, the dimensions and the weight of these models are very similar.  Similar can be called a functional set of both devices.  The case of the novelty is made of magnesium alloy.  Since she received a modern USB 3.0 port, the connector also changed.  In addition, the developers equipped the model with a mechanism for raising the mirror, so that the vibration during its movement was reduced.  The fact is that it is equipped with a fundamentally new motor.  The shutter sound, in comparison with other representatives of the series, has become significantly quieter.  On the back is a 3.2-inch screen, consisting of 1.037 million dots.  At the same time, according to the reviews of the first buyers of the camera, it remains unclear why the developers removed the headphone jack.  The controls located on the case are equipped with protection against all kinds of atmospheric phenomena and dust, so users can take pictures even in rainy weather. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon EOS 5DS" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/974998.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Matrix </h2><p>  The Canon EOS 5DS is equipped with <span>a CMOS</span> sensor with a 50.6 megapixel sensor.  Thanks to this device, extreme flexibility and speed of shooting is provided.  The camera allows you to create images of incredible clarity.  This is very important in cases where each pixel plays a large role (for example, in pictures for magazine covers or billboards).  The ISO range in this camera ranges from 50 to 12800, so the picture is characterized by low noise and a fairly wide dynamic range. </p><h2>  The lenses </h2><p>  Due to the high resolution of the matrix, not all optics are suitable for the device.  In this case, it is understood that only some Canon lenses can provide full detail for 50 megapixels.  Representatives of the manufacturer recommend purchasing for this model both their top versions related to the L-series, and some other, simpler lenses.  One of the most affordable and popular of them is the EF 50mm f / 1.4 USM.  If you believe the reviews of experts, then such optics proved to be quite good on previous modifications from this manufacturer with other matrices and is capable of creating quite good pictures in different modes.  Be that as it may, it should be remembered that the model is a professional camera.  Depending on the type of shooting and the purpose of the shots, photographers can choose other <span>Canon lenses</span> for themselves <span>.</span>  This will maximize the potential of the large <span>matrix of the camera.</span>  Fortunately, their range is only expanding every day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon lenses" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/974996.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Auto focus </h2><p>  Canon 5DS inherited the automatic focusing system from its predecessor.  It consists of 61 sensors (41 of them are cross-shaped) and can boast of having a large number of various fine-tuning options, ranging from combining focusing points into separate groups, and ending with the choice of a suitable tracking automatic focus algorithm for specific tasks. </p><p>  Exponometry is performed by the device due to a separate matrix.  It consists of 150 thousand points, divided into 252 zones.  The user focuses the auto focus response speed on his own.  In addition, he has the opportunity to independently select a specific point in order to clearly focus on a particular part of the frame.  It should be noted that the model boasts the presence of intelligent face recognition and tracking.  It allows the device to analyze information about objects that are located within the frame. </p><h2>  Vibration control </h2><p>  As noted above, the presence of an advanced mirror vibration control system is another interesting feature of the Canon 5DS.  Reviews of the first buyers of new items indicate that due to this, vibration has significantly decreased.  This, in turn, made it possible to increase the resolution and sharpness of images, and also significantly softened the sound of the shutter release.  The principle of the system is that it provides a special trajectory of the mirror, which is not accompanied by shocks and settings at extreme positions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon 5ds reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/974995.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Work speed </h2><p>  The processing speed of the Canon 5DS camera images and its response, even taking into account the large amount of information received from the matrix, is very high.  According to experts, this is due to the fact that the developers installed two DIGIC-6 processors on the model at once.  They function independently of each other and in combination provide a shooting speed of up to five frames per second.  At the same time, one cannot fail to note the fast and remote control of the device.  The fact is that a modern USB 3.0 port is installed here, which ensures operational work with the camera through a mobile access point. </p><h2>  Low pass filter suppression </h2><p>  The design of conventional digital mirror-type cameras provides for the so-called low-pass filter.  It is installed directly in front of the device‚Äôs sensor and is designed to prevent digital distortion (for example, false color).  Due to the fact that this leads to some softening of the picture, in this model the mentioned effect is specially suppressed.  This allows you to provide the greatest sharpness of the image (do not forget about which matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãused here). </p><h2>  Taking photos </h2><p>  One of the main characteristics justifying the high cost of the Canon 5DS, as well as the model‚Äôs market share, is the resolution of the image sensor, which is 50.6 megapixels.  This camera was one of the first SLR cameras equipped with a 24x36 sensor with such a high resolution.  It is enough to print an A1 poster with excellent picture quality.  In this case, even the tiniest picture elements will be well distinguishable.  Some skeptics call the dynamic range of this camera very weak.  As the test done for Canon 5DS shows, in comparison with the market leaders in this indicator ( <span>Nikon D-810</span> and <span>Sony A7S models), the</span> device loses.  On the other hand, this gap should not be called so critical. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon 5DS test" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/974993.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The average size of one raw photo taken with this camera is 65 megabytes.  If you create pictures in semi-professional JPG format, then this file size is reduced to 20 megabytes.  In this regard, it is not surprising that the device has two slots for installing memory cards.  The owner of the camera can independently choose how the files will be recorded on the drives (separately, sequentially or in parallel). </p><h2>  Video recording </h2><p>  You can create videos using the Canon 5DS model within the same limits as with its predecessor.  In particular, the device performs video recording in Full HD 30p format.  At the same time, as already noted above, there is no headphone jack on the case.  Even experts cannot explain this feature, and many camera users call it inconvenient and ill-conceived.  Be that as it may, the device creates videos of decent quality, and also provides the user with the opportunity to carry out manual and creative image management. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon 5DS review" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/974994.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Operating experience </h2><p>  Speaking about the operation of this model, most owners call it quite comfortable.  Due to the presence of a large number of various parameters, any professional photographer can customize the camera for himself.  On the other hand, experts argue that many settings make the menu quite extensive.  In order to get used to it, the user needs some time.  Most owners praise the quiet shutter sound.  In this regard, the model looks much more attractive compared to its main competitors.  The bright viewfinder and LCD display also deserve special praise.  The only drawback here is perhaps the lack of a swivel mechanism in it. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  As for the cost of the Canon 5DS model, the price of a camera in Russian technology stores is about 3,700 US dollars in domestic equivalent.  This is quite expensive, so many connoisseurs of the brand will not be able to afford this device.  However, speaking about this camera, one should not forget about the set of its functions and capabilities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon 5DS Price" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/974992.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Summing up, it should be noted that the new Canon 5DS is one of the most technologically advanced cameras among all the models that are offered on the market as of today.  The developers embodied in this camera all the advanced achievements.  Because of its cost, the model cannot be called an ideal solution for beginner amateur enthusiasts, because it makes no sense to pay such an impressive amount for a camera, the characteristics of which they are unlikely to use in full.  As for the professionals, most of them this device will definitely not leave you indifferent. </p>
