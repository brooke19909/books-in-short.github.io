Actually, that's what they live for.  But an ordinary person may just be wondering what the coins are made of, but at the same time one does not want to go deep into the jungle of numismatics.  And let it be understood that either side of the coins has its own name, its own and unique, and even though it is interesting, a person is not ready to devote a significant part of his life to the search for this knowledge.  So help each other. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="coin side name" class="if" height="318" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17472/331574.jpg" width="350"></div>

    <h2>  What is a coin? </h2><p>  Of course, any modern person can easily answer the question "what is a coin."  Roughly speaking, this is a metal circle that has some value, and it depicts certain symbols that confirm this value.  But it’s not so simple.  The most important thing is that the coin is a complete banknote, only made not of paper (parchment, papyrus), but of a more durable material.  Since it has a volume, it has two surfaces, each of which is referred to as the “side of the coin."  The name given to them by different peoples is again different, but this does not change the essence.  Most often, coins are made round, but they are known to be square, hexagonal, strange in shape (in our opinion), with holes, “ears” and other additions that are not clear to us.  However, in all countries the name of the obverse of the coin “obverse” remains constant, the back of the coin is “reverse” and the side is “rump”. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Coin terms </h2><p>  They are unchanged for many centuries.  If you follow the numismatic terminology, then the coin has obverse, reverse and edge.  The main, central side of the coin (its name is “obverse”) was called an eagle in Russia, which is quite justified, because the “face” of such a banknote always depicted either a symbol of a power or the appearance of a ruler.  Other parts of the metal banknote had their names in Russia.  So, the reverse side of the coin (official name is “reverse”) was called tails.  It’s easy to explain: a very large <span>amount of information</span> was minted here <span>,</span> from face value and year of manufacture to all kinds of embellishments that confused ordinary people who perceived the pattern as a certain lattice.  And let the traditions change, and the pattern on the reverse side simplified, the side of the coin retained its name, although now it can play the role of at least an obverse, at least a reverse. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="name of the side of the coin" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17472/331575.jpg" width="370"></div>

    <h2>  Party that is not party </h2><p>  Remains the edge of the coin.  Strictly speaking, it is not a party to this currency, although it is definitely part of it.  The name of the side of the coin sounds like "edge".  Previously, the “sidewall” was more important than now.  Certain information was etched on it;  Yes, even the presence of cuts on the edge indicated that it was "uncircumcised."  Now the practice of cutting coins is no longer applied, in which it seems to have remained the same, but the weight has been reduced.  The “threaded” but clipped edge served as a warning beacon: “the coin is the same, but smaller and cheaper.” </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="name of the front side of the coin" class="if" height="305" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17472/331576.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Actually, now the coins no longer carry the semantic load with which they were burdened before.  What is the difference, now has 5 kopecks of its <span>nominal price</span> or not.  All these details should be paid attention only if you are dealing with old coins.  However!  Suddenly in the grandmother's attic there is a chest with ancient coins?  Take an interest in numismatics, maybe you are destined to become a millionaire. </p>
