    <p>  So, in this article we will talk about another fairly well-known company with strong positions in the investment market.  This is VLS <span>Invest.</span>  <span>The reviews</span> we found on the Web make it possible to form some opinion about this subject, find out what methods the company operates, what tasks it sets for itself and how efficiently it fulfills them.  In addition, as a source of information, we also used open data - information from official and other sites describing the organization‚Äôs activities.  We also use them in this article. </p><h2>  General information </h2><p>  Let's start with some general information that reveals to us the activities of VLS Invest.  Reviews say that you can find it on the official page of the group.  So, the main field of activity of the company is investment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Fundraising, their increase and operational management of deposits require a responsible approach to organization, transparent working conditions, efficiency, focus on results and reliability.  All these principles, according to what the VLS Invest financial company writes about itself (we will also give reviews a bit further to find out how this corresponds to reality), are successfully combined in its activities. </p><h2>  Command </h2>

    <p>  As indicated on the group‚Äôs website, company employees are experienced traders who work to increase the capital involved in the group‚Äôs activities.  In fact, each of the traders has its own approach to trading, its own strategy, which can differ radically from what others do.  However, all their activities are united by a common goal: to maximize the company's income, and with it what investors receive. </p><p>  In addition to traders, as noted on the company's website, other specialists also take an active part in its activities: analysts and IT engineers, who are looking for suitable solutions for the company's tasks.  Summarizing all this information, we can conclude that the activities of VLS Invest (the reviews of which we are primarily interested) are aimed at creating optimal Forex trading strategies and their automation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  History </h2>

    <p>  Here, on the group‚Äôs website, you can see information about how this company started its work and what tasks it faced at the initial stage.  It follows from this that its work began in 2013, after financial specialists united by common interests decided to launch such a project.  At the initial stages, the vector of the company's work was directed to the market of small private investors, represented by ordinary citizens, who could, without experience in the field of finance, make money on the tools that it provides them.  In particular, we are talking about competent money management of small investors. </p><h2>  Startup Resources </h2><p>  Of course, VLS <span>Invest (feedback</span> can confirm this) did not start from scratch, but with extensive experience working at Forex, with a registered capital of 30 million rubles, insurance from Alfa Insurance for 500 million.  In addition, at the very beginning of the work, the company launched its own dealing center, which was formed by the efforts of analytical traders with extensive experience.  In the course of their activities, the latter adhere not only to the most optimal financial management strategy, but also resort to the constant diversification of cash resources in circulation.  This strategy makes it possible to reduce risks while maximizing the income received. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Guarantees </h2><p>  As expected, the financial company VLS <span>Invest, the reviews</span> of which we will provide a little further in the text, offers everyone to get acquainted with information about guarantees for their investors.  They are placed on the page with the appropriate name.  In short, this is a list of those factors that indicate the safety of investments.  So, diversification is indicated here (the company works in three different directions, maximally distributing its portfolios);  legal mechanisms (it is indicated that the investor‚Äôs funds are protected by an agreement concluded by the parties);  audit and insurance are mentioned, which are also aimed at protecting the interests of people who have invested their money.  All these and other points indicate that this investment group has something to offer its customers. </p><h2>  Restructuring News </h2>

    <p>  All that is given above is really beautiful words about how reliable and safe the structure described in this article is, how many advantages it is from contacting it and from assistance for a simple investor.  However, if you travel further through the company‚Äôs website, you can pay attention to the fact that all other sections are not available, and another one, ‚ÄúNews‚Äù, is active.  Here, at the top of the page, is attached information from March 1, 2016 that the company is resorting to a restructuring of its activities. </p><p>  Even without reading customer reviews describing VLS Invest, one can guess that the group is curtailing its activities.  The reason is simple: a company cannot pay off its debts to investors.  Here, on the site, it is indicated that the company ceases to accept funds, terminates contracts and starts the compensation procedure by paying insurance capital. </p><h2>  Company talk </h2><p>  Through simple actions with the search engine, we were able to find information about this project in a wider aspect.  So, if the official website of the group shows only a beautiful story about the professional approach of the company (which we cited above), then on investment forums and blogs where the project is discussed, you can find completely different characteristics of this program. </p><p>  In particular, investor reviews on VLS Invest note that the group is engaged in accepting deposits, rather on a ‚Äúhype‚Äù basis, where payments to investors are made through the following contributions.  Some users call this resource a ‚Äúpyramid‚Äù, which cannot guarantee a refund to all its participants: only those who started interacting with it at earlier stages remain in the real ‚Äúplus‚Äù. </p>

    <h2>  Investment Project Network </h2><p>  Another interesting point is the real status of the investment program and its design, as well as the ‚Äúfork‚Äù of several such projects.  Firstly, the reviews dedicated to VLS Invest LLC indicate that the program does not really have the documents mentioned on its website.  This means that users have far fewer opportunities to truly offset their contributions than it might seem at first glance.  All the fault is beautiful texts about how serious this company is and the discrepancy between their real status. </p><p>  Secondly, the authors of the project actually have another similar project, acting under a different name.  The reviews left about VLS Invest (Krasnodar) indicate that his advertisement was placed on the same media as the information about that other <span>investment program.</span>  And this means that the project administrators approached their investment business quite pragmatically. </p><h2>  Customer reviews </h2>

    <p>  Only a further study of the recommendations left by users allows us to reveal the full picture.  It turns out that VLS <span>Invest</span> LLC <span>(the reviews</span> completely confirm this) is nothing but another high-risk project built on the principle of a pyramid. </p><p>  His task was to use their ‚Äúcover‚Äù of their activities, expressed in an interesting legend and supposedly three-year work experience, to receive their investments from private investors.  Subsequently, part of the funds was accumulated in order to make payments to previous investors, and part, obviously, ‚Äúevaporated‚Äù. </p><p>  Soon, when the authors of this program considered it necessary, it was closed.  Information on ‚Äúcompensation‚Äù from the insurance company appeared on the site, although in fact this is another tale.  Deceived investors will not see any payments. </p><p>  The VLS Invest investment project (customer reviews, by the way, also assure us of this) is most likely just another program from people launching other similar solutions and earning naivety from ordinary people. </p><h2>  Employee Reviews </h2><p>  As one would expect, we could not find the real opinions of people working at VLS Invest (feedback from employees, to put it more simply).  Given that we are faced with a kind of ‚Äúscam‚Äù, this is not surprising.  And with the reality of the work of such a project, we would hardly have heard the opinions of those 10-20 traders and analysts (even if they were real). </p>

    <p>  In fact, there is only one review, left supposedly at the request of an employee (by another person).  In it, the actions of the company are encouraged, and it is about the fact that the investment project simply encountered small difficulties.  This commentary contains a long ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù text of a similar nature to those we have already presented to your attention above.  True, one cannot say that this is a real review.  VLS Invest probably wrote this comment themselves in order to create the appearance of successful activity. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  So, as you can see, during the writing of this article on a financial company, we analyzed a number of sources.  According to the result of processing the first (official website of the company), we can say that there are some kind of ‚Äúfairy tales‚Äù that are really hard to believe in.  Successful ‚ÄúForex‚Äù strategies, development of robots and signals for trading, long-term experience of employees, many other features that investors are pleased to read are mentioned. </p><p>  The real assessment of the company‚Äôs activity, which we met on the forums and blogs where this project is being discussed, is seriously different.  Characteristic of VLS Invest (Nizhny Novgorod) reviews of real users are not so unambiguous in their assessment.  Yes, someone writes that they really paid interest on the deposit.  These are probably the lucky ones who were among the first to make investments and return them. </p><p>  However, most reviews still come from deceived investors.  All of them write that the funds were not returned in this way, and that the company, in fact, positioned itself in a completely different light, different from reality. </p><p>  The result of this article is as follows: the VLS Invest project, like hundreds of similar programs, turned out to be just a ‚Äúhype‚Äù.  Like other programs of this kind, it was based on a ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù legend that allows attracting funds from private investors.  In the future, it all ended in the same way as in all similar programs - a complete loss of funds by depositors and closing.  Most lucky were those who were at the very beginning of the project, and, of course, the creators themselves. </p>
