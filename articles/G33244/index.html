Another name is Rock (The Rock). </p><p>  The island has an interesting history.  At one time, its territory was used as a defensive fort, a little later a military prison was located on it, and then its building turned into a super-protected prison, which contained especially dangerous criminals, as well as those who in the past tried to escape from the previous place of detention. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelcaffeine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="famous prison" class="if uuid-2318090" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2318090.jpg"></div><p>  Currently, the island houses a museum.  You can get to it by ferry, which runs from San Francisco. </p><h2>  When was the island discovered? </h2><p>  The first traveler to enter the San Francisco Bay was the Spaniard Juan Manuel de Ayala.  Together with his team, he visited there in 1775 and made a map of the bay.  One of the three islands located there was given the name La Isla de Los Alcatraz√©s.  Translated from Spanish, it meant "island of pelicans."  According to some researchers, such a name could be given due to the abundance of these birds on this piece of land.  However, according to ornithologists, there are no pelican colonies on and around the island.  This area is a place favored by cormorants and other large waterfowl. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1828, an English geographer captain Frederick Beachy made a mistake.  In compiling his map, he transferred from Spanish documents the name of the island given by Juan Manuel de Ayala to the neighboring one.  Currently, this area is known as the place where the famous prison, called Island Alcatrazes, is located.  Further, in 1851, the name of the island was somewhat reduced by the topographical service of the <span>American Coast Guard.</span>  This place became known as Alcatraz. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="37.8266636" data-lng="-122.42301220000002" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/4/6/9/1469.png"></div><h2>  The construction of the lighthouse </h2><p>  In 1848, gold deposits were discovered in California.  This fact led to the fact that thousands of ships came to the San Francisco Bay.  This created an urgent need for the construction of a lighthouse.  The first of them was installed and began to work in the summer of 1853 on the island of Alcatraz.  Three years later, a bell was used on this lighthouse, used during heavy fog. </p><p>  In 1909, the construction of the prison began on the island.  At the same time, the first lighthouse, which served for 56 years, was dismantled.  The second such building was installed on Alcatraz 12/12/1909 near the prison building.  In 1963, this lighthouse was modified.  Having become autonomous and automatic, it no longer required round-the-clock maintenance. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Fort </h2><p>  The gold rush that arose in these places led to the need to protect the bay.  That is why on the island in 1850, by decree issued by the US president, the construction of the fort began.  Long-range guns were installed on the territory of this protective structure, the number of which exceeded 110 units.  A little later, the fort began to be used to place prisoners in its walls.  However, in 1909, by order of the army command, the building was demolished to the foundation.  By 1912, a new building was erected for criminals. </p><h2>  Military prison </h2><p>  The location of the island of Alcatraz provides its natural isolation from land.  After all, it is located in the middle of the San Francisco Bay and is surrounded by icy water, as well as powerful sea currents.  All this contributed to the fact that the island was considered by the leadership of the US Army as an ideal place for prisoners of war.  The first of them went to Alcatraz prison in 1861. They were people from various states who were captured during the Civil War.  In 1898, the United States participated in hostilities with the Spaniards.  This war led to an increase in the number of prisoners who also went to Alcatraz prison.  So, from 26 people it increased to 450. </p><p>  The history of Alcatraz prison began to develop in a slightly different direction after the earthquake that happened in 1906.  The elements destroyed most of San Francisco, forcing authorities to relocate several hundred civilian prisoners to the island.  This was done, first of all, for security reasons. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In 1912, Alcatraz Prison was expanded.  An impressive building was built on the island.  By 1920, this three-story building was almost completely ‚Äúpopulated‚Äù by prisoners. </p><div class="photo" data-original="erasmusu.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://erasmusu.com/en/erasmus-san-francisco/what-to-see/the-prison-of-alcatraz-5096"><img itemprop="image" alt="prison building" class="if uuid-2318063" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2318063.jpg"></div><p>  The history of the Alcatraz prison allows us to judge it as a place that was particularly strict for violators.  Here, prisoners who did not obey discipline were faced with the most severe penalties.  In the first long-term army prison, offenders were sent to hard labor, and they could also be placed in solitary confinement, providing them with a limited ration consisting of bread and water.  But this list of disciplinary sanctions was not limited. </p><p>  The military prisoners of Alcatraz Prison had an average age of 24 years.  Most of them served time for desertion or any less serious misconduct.  There were in Alcatraz prison and those who were sent here for a long period for physical violence and disobedience to commanders, murder or theft. </p><p>  Military order forbade the people who were there to stay in the cell during the day.  The exception was only special cases of forced detention.  High-ranking servicemen who committed various disciplinary offenses were also placed here.  These prisoners in the Alcatraz prison were able to move quite freely through its territory.  It was forbidden for them only to enter the premises for protection, which were one level higher. </p><p>  But in general, despite the adoption of severe disciplinary measures against criminals, the regime here could not be called strict.  Most prisoners did household work for those families who lived on the island where Alcatraz Prison is located.  Selected ones were sometimes trusted to look after the children.  At times, prisoners used a vulnerable security organization to escape.  However, the very place where the Alcatraz prison is located did not allow them to reach the mainland.  Most fugitives were forced to return due to icy water.  The one who dared to get to the shore, died in the bay from hypothermia. </p><p>  Prison Alcatraz (see photo below) gradually softened its order. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripsavvy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="camera decoration" class="if uuid-2318117" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2318117.jpg"></div><p>  By the end of the 1920s, the prisoners contained in it were allowed to break the baseball field and even wear their own sports uniforms.  Between the criminals in the evening on Fridays boxing competitions were organized.  These fights were so popular that even civilians living in San Francisco gathered for them as spectators. </p><p>  How many years have the military used Alcatraz as a prison?  The Ministry of Defense closed it in 1934. This happened after 73 years of use due to the high costs associated with where the Alcatraz prison is located, since the supply was carried out only by boat transport from the shore.  After this, the facilities located on the island were transferred to the Ministry of Justice. </p><h2>  Federal prison </h2><p>  A high surge in crime was recorded in the United States from the late 1920s through the mid-1930s.  This was facilitated by the Great Depression that arose in the country. </p><p>  During this period, organized crime began to arise in the form of individual gangs and mafia families, which unleashed a real war for spheres of influence.  The victims of this battle often became law enforcement officers and civilians.  Gangsters controlled power in cities.  Criminals gave bribes to officials so that they turned a blind eye to the lawlessness that was going on. </p><p>  The response of the authorities to the war unleashed by the gangsters was a decision that decided to reopen the famous prison of Alcatraz.  Only now it has become federal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="erasmusu.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://erasmusu.com/en/erasmus-san-francisco/what-to-see/the-prison-of-alcatraz-5096"><img itemprop="image" alt="prison sign" class="if uuid-2318067" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2318067.jpg"></div><p>  A similar decision was made by the US government due to the fact that Alcatraz prison is located on an inaccessible island, and this allows isolating criminals from society, frightening those offenders who are still at large.  Federal Prison Head Sanford Bates and Attorney General Homer Cummings initiated the development of a prison reconstruction project.  To this end, they invited Robert Burge, who at that time was considered the best expert in the field of security.  His task was to draft a new prison.  The reconstruction of the structure was overhaul.  The entire building, except the foundation, was destroyed, and then a new structure was built on this site. </p><p>  Already in April 1934, where war criminals were stationed in Alcatraz prison, a building appeared with a new face and new focus.  So, if before the moment of reconstruction the rods and gratings were made of wood, then after the redevelopment they became steel.  Also, electricity appeared in each cell, and it was decided to completely block the service tunnels so that the prisoners could not hide in them and subsequently escape.  Special weapon galleries appeared in the prison building.  They were placed above the level of the cameras in order to protect the guards, who now kept their watch behind the iron bars. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelcaffeine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="metal grill" class="if uuid-2318072" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2318072.jpg"></div><p>  The prison bar was always the most vulnerable place for brawls and fights.  That is why this room of Alcatraz was equipped with tanks filled with tear gas.  Located on the ceiling, they were remotely controlled. </p><p>  Along the perimeter of the prison building, in the most strategically suitable areas, guard towers were located.  The door equipment has also changed.  They mounted electric sensors. </p><p>  In total, in Alcatraz prison (the photo inside the building is presented below), there were 600 cameras.  At the same time, the building was divided into four blocks - B, C, F and D. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelcaffeine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="camera interior" class="if uuid-2318078" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2318078.jpg"></div><p>  This made it possible to significantly expand the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe prison, which, prior to the reconstruction, accommodated no more than 300 prisoners.  The security measures introduced, combined with the icy waters of the bay surrounding the island, created an impenetrable barrier even for those criminals who were considered incorrigible. </p><h2>  Chief </h2><p>  The new prison needed a new leader.  The Federal Bureau of Prisons has appointed James A. Johnston to this position.  He was chosen for strict principles and a humane approach to the correction of criminals, which allowed them to return after release in society.  Johnston was also known for his reforms, which were carried out for the benefit of prisoners.  This man did not see the convicts bound in a single chain in criminals.  He believed that they should be involved in such work, where they would feel respect and understand that their efforts would certainly be rewarded.  The press wrote articles of praise about Johnston, calling him "the chief of the golden rule." </p><p>  Prior to his appointment to Alcatraz, this man served as director of the San Quentin prison.  There he introduced a number of educational programs, which became very successful and had a beneficial effect on most of the prisoners.  But at the same time, Johnston was committed to strict discipline.  The rules he established were considered the hardest in the entire correctional system, and the penalties used were the most severe.  Johnston was personally present at the San Quentin Hanging Execution and knew perfectly how to best deal with incorrigible criminals. </p><h2>  Prison life </h2><p>  The decision to serve a sentence in Alcatraz was not issued by the courts.  Here criminals came from other prisons for their special "differences".  After Alcatraz came under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice, the rules here underwent a radical change.  For example, each prisoner was given his own cell.  In addition, the criminals had minimal privileges that allowed them to receive water and food, clothing, medical and dental care.  Personal belongings were strictly forbidden.  Anyone who wanted to chat with visitors, take a book from the prison library or write a letter needed to earn this right with perfect behavior and work.  At the same time, those criminals who were considered violators of discipline were not allowed to work.  In the case of the slightest offense, privileges were immediately withdrawn. </p><p>  In Alcatraz, any media, including newspapers, were banned.  Letters written by prisoners were subject to correction by the prison official. </p><p>  Any chief who headed one of the federal prisons was entitled to transfer prisoners to Alcatraz.  Despite the prevailing opinion, not only gangsters were sent here.  Those who represented a special danger were kept in this prison on the island.  For example, fugitives and rebels, as well as those who constantly sought to break the regime, were sent from other prisons to Alcatraz.  Of course, among the criminals there were gangsters on the island, but most of them, as a rule, were sentenced to death. </p><p>  The prison day began with a rise at 6.30 a.m.  Then, within 25 minutes, the prisoners had to be cleaned in the cell, after which they needed to go to the grate for roll call.  At 6 hours 55 minutes, if everyone was in place, the doors opened and the criminals were led into the dining room.  They had 20 minutes to eat.  After that, the prisoners lined up and received prison work. </p><p>  The whole life of these people turned into a monotonous routine cycle, which was not subject to any changes for many years.  The prisoners called the largest corridor in the building ‚ÄúBroadway‚Äù, and the most desirable for them were the cameras located along this passage, but only on the second tier.  They were warm, and no one passed them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="architectureimg.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="prison interior corridor" class="if uuid-2318051" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2318051.jpg"></div><p>  Appointed to lead Alcatraz Johnston at the initial stage of his work adhered to a policy of silence.  This was regarded by many prisoners as the most unbearable punishment.  In this regard, they complained and demanded its cancellation.  It was said that several of the criminals were even crazy because of this policy.  Later, this rule was abolished, which was one of the few changes in the content on the island. </p><p>  The east wing of the prison was reserved for solitary confinement cells.  The toilet in them was an ordinary hole, the drain of which was controlled by a guard.  The criminals were placed in such cells without outer clothing, giving them a rather meager ration.  The doors of the detention centers had a narrow slit through which the prisoner was given food.  The camera was always closed, and the person in it was in the dark.  They were placed in an insulator for 1-2 days.  It was very cold in it.  The mattress was issued only for the night.  Being in this wing was considered the most severe punishment for bad behavior and serious violations.  Every prisoner was afraid to get here. </p><h2>  Shoots </h2><p>  Many dreamed of breaking free and leaving Alcatraz.  However, it was almost impossible to do.  The most successful escape attempt, which was probably successful, was carried out in 1962 by <span>Frank Morris</span> and the brothers John and Clarence Anglin.  These criminals used a home-made drill with which they picked out cement from the walls.  Having carefully studied the security shift schedule and other nuances, on June 11, 1962, the prisoners escaped through the service tunnel, which was located behind their cameras.  On the berth of each of the criminals they left a fake body.  The fugitives laid a hole in the tunnel from the inside with a brick.  Such measures were necessary so that the guards became aware of their absence as late as possible. </p><p> Then the criminals entered the roof through the ventilation system and went down the drainage channel.  When they got to the bay, they built a makeshift raft, blowing rubber coats prepared in advance with a small accordion.  According to the official version, the fugitives could not swim to the shore.  However, their bodies were not found in the bay.  There is an unofficial version of what happened.  According to many independent experts, the escape committed in 1962 was still successful, and the prisoners were free.  This story was once interested in the show "Mythbusters".  Its organizers conducted their own investigation, the results of which convincingly proved the fact that the escape could well have been successful. </p><p>  Another, quite possibly successful escape occurred on December 16, 1937. On that day, Theodore Cole and his friend Ralph Rowe (workers at the iron-processing workshop) removed a grate from a window in one of their shifts and went to the waters of the bay.  However, a strong storm raged that day, and judging by the official version, the fugitives drowned.  However, their bodies were not found.  Perhaps the criminals took to the open sea.  But until now, these fugitives are considered missing in the United States. </p><p>  In total, from the beginning of its existence to the closure of Alcatraz prison, 14 escape attempts were made in it, in which 34 people took part.  And two of them did it twice.  As a result, seven of these criminals were shot dead by the guards, five of whom were described above were missing, two were drowned, and the rest were returned to their cells. </p><h2>  Prison closure </h2><p>  The last prisoners left the inhospitable island on March 21, 1963. This is the closing date of the Alcatraz prison.  The decree on the termination of the legendary building was signed by the US Attorney General <span>Robert Kennedy</span> (brother of John F. Kennedy - the then president of the United States). </p><p>  Why was Alcatraz prison closed?  The official version clarified this decision by the too high costs that the government allocated for the maintenance of prisoners.  After all, everything (food, water, fuel, etc.) was imported here from the mainland.  In addition, salt water gradually destroyed the buildings, because of which the prison needed repairs worth 3-5 million dollars. </p><h2>  Alcatraz today </h2><p>  After the prison was officially closed, the government discussed various ways to use the island.  One of these options was the placement of a UN monument on it. </p><p>  In 1971, the island moved to the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and became a prison museum.  Today, Alcatraz is one of the most important attractions in San Francisco and is very popular among tourists.  Thousands of visitors daily sail here by ferry, trying to experience the exciting atmosphere of this prison. </p><div class="photo" data-original="erasmusu.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://erasmusu.com/en/erasmus-san-francisco/what-to-see/the-prison-of-alcatraz-5096"><img itemprop="image" alt="prison visitors" class="if uuid-2318061" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2318061.jpg"></div><p>  The glory of Alcatraz today is in every way exploited.  Hotels with the same name are open in Germany and in England.  They offer their customers to stay in a small room in which there are all amenities.  Of course, it is unlikely that such numbers can be compared with the real Alcatraz. </p><p>  In 1996, the movie "Scala" was released on cinema screens.  This is a film about Alcatraz Prison with Nicolas Cage, shot by American director Michael Bay.  The tape tells the viewer about the story of the abduction of deadly gas missiles, which was carried out by a general of elite special forces of the United States with his subordinates.  The military took hostages of visitors to the former Alcatraz prison and put forward demands for the transfer of money to the families of military personnel who died during secret operations. </p>
