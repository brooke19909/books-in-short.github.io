  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Fishing for bulds - one hundred percent catch of perch in winter and pike in summer.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Fishing is not just a vacation with friends on a river with a guitar, but primarily an old craft, thanks to which our ancestors fed their children.  A true fisherman gladly catches fish, but almost never eats it.  After all, the process itself is important.  From this the fishermen get great pleasure.  Of course, fishing, as a form of outdoor activity, has evolved over the years.  Primitive <span>fishing</span> tools <span>were</span> replaced by modern <span>telescopic fishing rods,</span> spinning <span>rods,</span> etc.  Progress also touched the bait, with the help of which the fish caught on a hook.  There are so many of them that a detailed description will take a lot of time.  Our goal is to familiarize fishing enthusiasts with an extravagant bait called "bastard."  The fact is that not every domestic fisherman, even with experience, can explain what this type of bait is.  Indeed, fishing on the buld is becoming more popular among anglers.  Some believe that the name of the bait means its deceptive behavior in water.  However, the name most likely came from the method of fishing for this type of bait.  In the process itself, the fisherman lowers the "bulldozer" to the bottom and knocks on it, while a curtain of dregs rises, which attracts the attention of the fish.  It is best to fish on the buld in the winter.  As soon as ice turns on the river, the fish behaves aggressively and quickly responds to a tempting bait.  Perch - one of the predators is the main fan of "playing" with the bastard.  However, this does not mean that the bait is not used in the summer, when water bodies are free of ice.  So, fishing in the buld in the summer implies hunting for a large pike from a boat in a plumb line.  This kind of bait is a lead body in the form of a ball and two leashes with hooks.  Additionally, a small dead fish is planted on the tees and the bottom of deep holes is tapped. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Any fisherman who used this bait in his practice will argue that fishing on the bulldozer is an exciting adventure that will give you a lot of positive emotions and a good catch of a fresh fish.  "Bald" is easy enough to build on their own.  For the first time, brass Mepps cores with grooves are suitable.  The hooks can be fixed to the body of the bait by soldering the wire.  This kind of bait really "plays" well in the water, thoroughly imitating the movements of aquatic inhabitants.  The main thing to remember when making bait on your own is one rule - the body of the "bastard" must be absolutely symmetrical.  To achieve this result, you will need a bullet-shaped load and several hooks with beads. </p><p>  Although some fishermen are skeptical of the bait of such a plan, fishing on the buld has many advantages.  First of all, the bait is heavy and in a matter of seconds it appears at the bottom at great depths.  Elementary passes through the sludge in the hole.  Secondly, the hooks do not need to additionally attach the bait.  This saves valuable time and keeps your hands warm.  The main advantage is the process itself.  They knock it on the bottom, raise a cloud of turbidity, which attracts fish.  After that, the aquatic inhabitants discover the moving hooks, which are mistaken for small crustaceans and are happy to rush into battle.  That is why fishing on the bulldozer is the most successful way to catch active fish.  It‚Äôs pretty good to take on the "bulda", the so-called "white" fish. </p><p>  Many fishing enthusiasts prefer to buy bait in specialized stores, but experienced anglers make their own ‚Äúbastard‚Äù guided by their preferences.  According to the observations of experienced fishermen, the preference of fish depends on the color scheme of the bait.  So, the red-white "bastard" will attract bream, rudd and roach.  If you want to get a predator, coloring from dark tones is best. </p>
