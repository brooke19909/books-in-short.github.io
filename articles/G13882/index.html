The cities of this wonderful country are living museums, in the open spaces of which the history of the ancient people, medieval monuments and modern progress are located.  Dry winds of endless deserts and the fresh breeze of two seas - the Mediterranean and the Red.  A riot of nature and amazing African fauna.  All this can be found in this wonderful country of the Sun.  But since it will not be possible to visit all the settlements of this world in one round, we offer to explore some of the most beautiful and mysterious places that Egypt can boast of. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="egypt city" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/215339.jpg" width="546"></div>

    <p>  Cities that were laid back in the pre-Christian era, as a rule, are most in demand among tourists.  The main cultural center of the state is Alexandria - a port city that has retained this status since its inception.  This is where a huge number of museums are located, among which there are both historically important and more modern ones founded by scientists of our time.  It is impossible not to pay attention to the Greco-Roman Museum, which presents more than 40 thousand artifacts belonging to the ancient era.  On the shelves of this institution are ancient <span>Roman coins</span> and Greek souvenirs that were brought into the country from the Northern Mediterranean.  But in the museum of royal jewels to a greater extent are presented memorabilia of the ancient Arab world.  Also in this city, exhibitions and auctions are constantly held, where you can see paintings and sculptures, crafts and jewelry of masters of both the past and the present. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="map of Egypt with cities" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/215341.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It so happened with most tourists that the map of Egypt with cities is viewed from north to south, and most travels have a similar route.  Therefore, on our way appears the capital of the state - Cairo.  A city in which incredibly close are luxury and poverty, perfectly "licked" estates and polluted streets.  This Arab metropolis, which is the largest in the Middle East, has very large traffic jams, which can be compared with Moscow.  But despite all this, this city, which stands at the origins of the legendary Nile, has its own sights.  A huge number of <span>Muslim temples,</span> ancient estates and palaces tell the tourist a lot about what Egypt used to be.  Cities became more modern, but also managed to preserve the spirit of the former sacrament. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ancient cities of egypt" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/215340.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The ancient <span>cities of Egypt are</span> inconceivable without Luxor.  This is another miracle of the North African country, which has no access to the sea, and is located on the spills of the mysterious Nile River.  Previously, this village was called Thebes, and in their open spaces was the residence of Ramses the Second.  Now the city is one of the main archaeological centers of the state.  Excavations are carried out in the Valley of the Kings (a cemetery where the souls of the pharaohs of the New Kingdom are buried), near the ruins of the village of Deir al-Medina, as well as in the temples and palaces that were left to us by former residents and their rulers, who previously headed Egypt. </p><p>  Cities that can also be talked about a lot are Aswan, Rosetta, El Ghiza, as well as the endless resort provinces of the Hurghada Valley, which stretches along the coast of the Red Sea. </p>
