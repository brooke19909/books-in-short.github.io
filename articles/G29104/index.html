Holidays in Brunei</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Not every Russian has probably heard of such a state as Brunei.  Nevertheless, this sultanate is also known from the Chinese chronicles of the 15th century, although under other names: Pugni, Polo, Poly.  A little later, in the XVI century, it was a powerful empire, which subordinated part of the Philippines and almost all of Borneo to its influence.  The protectorate of Great Britain - since the end of the XIX century, since 1984 - an independent state, the head of which is the Sultan.  Today we will expand your knowledge of a country called Brunei.  The capital of the state is Bandar Seri Begawan. </p><h2>  Sultanate Location </h2><p>  If you have never heard of such a state, the first question will be: "Where is Brunei located?"  It is located on the <span>island of Kalimantan,</span> its northwest coast.  It consists of eastern and western regions, divided among themselves by Malaysian territory with a width of about 30 kilometers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Brunei is the capital" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/545014.jpg" width="600"></div>  Somewhere 85% of its area is covered by a huge tropical forest, overgrown mainly with trees of valuable species.  There are several rivers flowing into the South China Sea: Temburong, Pandaruan, Tutong, Belait, all of them are small.  By the way, being interested in where Brunei is located, pay attention to the fact that the full name of the state is Brunei Darrussalam, which translates as "a haven of peace."  The climate here is equatorial, humid, as it is exposed to monsoons from the South China Sea.

    <h2>  Brunei - the sights of the country.  General Review </h2><p>  This country is a typical <span>state of the Islamic</span> world.  Tourists who come here to rest should take this fact into account so as not to get into trouble.  There is practically no nightlife here, you need to behave in public places strictly according to the rules.  What is left for the traveler to do?  Get acquainted with the history of the East and its traditions, explore its sights, look at the primitive nature.  So, if you arrived in Brunei, the capital of the Sultanate is just the place from which you should begin your acquaintance with the state. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Inspect Bandar Seri Begawan </h2><p>  In addition to being the capital, it is also the only large city in the country.  Modern, clean and tidy, with wide quality roads, high-rise buildings, markets and, of course, mosques.  Nevertheless, at almost every step you can see the real national color - many houses are made in the oriental style, places of worship are framed by parks and gardens, nearby are bank offices and palaces with old houses from the beginning of the oil production era.  Istana-Nurul-Iman - the most beautiful palace of the Sultan - the main attraction of the capital, the largest residential palace in the whole world. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest brunei" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/545012.jpg" width="600"></div>  It is located on the coastal strip, in the west of the city center, in a very picturesque place.  It stands out by combining in one object a very expensive modern decoration, local traditions and Islamic architecture.  Imagine: 1778 rooms, 51,000 lamps, 44 stairs, 18 elevators and several throne rooms - all in one palace!  From England, chandeliers were brought into it, from Shanghai - granite, from Italy - marble.  At the end of Ramadan, anyone can visit the palace in accordance with local traditions.  If you arrive in Brunei, the capital of the state, the city of Bandar Seri Begawan will show many other magnificent buildings.

    <h2>  Omar Ali Sayfuddin Mosque </h2><p>  This colossal building is one of the most beautiful and impressive eastern mosques.  It was built in 1958 and named after one of the sultans of Brunei, the 28th.  It is a symbol of Islam in the state.  This gigantic building is 52 meters high and has gold bells decorated with magnificent mosaics, a 44-meter minaret and many decorative architectural elements. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="brunei country" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/545023.jpg" width="336"></div>  A building was built on the banks of an artificial lagoon, right on the banks of the river.  Non-Muslims have no access inside, and they cannot view the luxurious interior of the mosque.  Nearby is the largest shopping complex in the country - Yayasan-Sultan-Hadji-Hassanal-Bolkia-Foundation, built in 1996.  So know: if you fly here on vacation, Brunei will not let you go without shopping.

    <h2>  Jerudong Park - the green zone of the capital </h2><p>  This attraction is a huge beautiful <span>green zone,</span> which has been turned into a real entertainment and sports complex, which is under the patronage of the Sultan.  Entrance to the complex is free.  There are: first-class croquet ground, golf course, polo stadium, go-kart track, shooting range.  Some tourists made complaints by visiting Brunei.  Reviews say that not all the objects of this complex were able to get travelers.  Somewhere they are allowed only if one of the club members invited.  And where does an ordinary tourist get such acquaintances or friends?  But, once in the nearby Luna Park, they calmed down after seeing a huge variety of attractions and entertainment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="brunei sights" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/545019.jpg" width="600"></div>  For religious reasons, there are no gorgeous beaches in the country.  All of Brunei, its capital, more precisely, has one beach - equipped and modern.  It is located just behind Luna Park.  It has a well-developed leisure infrastructure, and, among other things, there are many stalls selling fish and other sea delicacies.

    <h2>  Temburong - ecological zone of the country </h2><p>  Brunei - the country is not so small.  There are other interesting places in it, besides those located in the capital.  We will share some information about one of them.  In the eastern part of the state there are many swamps and rivers, evergreen forests, where millions of the most diverse living creatures live.  The main attractions of this region are Ulu-Teburong, National Park, Bukit-Patoi - an ecological trail, as well as colorful ethnic villages inhabited by the Murut, Malay and Iban peoples. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Brunei hotels" class="if" height="230" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/545004.jpg" width="600"></div>  Due to the fact that the Ulu-Teburong park is located relatively far from the central places and has a difficult terrain, the authorities managed to preserve the ideal natural environment where there is a wide <span>variety of animals</span> and plants.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Batu Apoi forest in whose territory this park is located is almost 50 thousand hectares.
