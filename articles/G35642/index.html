  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Black River", Voronezh: address, opening hours, product range for artists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Where to buy professional brushes and paints in Voronezh?  Today we will answer this question, and also share information about the most famous store for artists in the capital of Chernozemye.  The address, assortment, prices of the <span>Chernaya Rechka</span> store in Voronezh and reviews of its work are described in the article. </p><h2>  Where is it and how to get there </h2><p>  The store is located in the city center.  The address of the "Black River" - Voronezh, st.  Kirova, 9. Getting here is equally convenient by private car and public transport. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="51.6573213" data-lng="39.19135080000001" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="18"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/6/2/7/1/6271.png"></div><p>  By the way, the nearest bus stop is 100 meters from the store and is called "Kirova St.".  You can get here by buses with numbers 5A, 23K, 27A, 33K, 69T, A70, 1KS, 20M, 25A, 27K, 70A, 70M, 312A and A49.  You can walk from the Sunny Paradise Shopping Center or the Opera and Ballet Theater, but it will take a little longer. </p><p>  If you decide to go to the store by personal transport, then you should take care of the parking space in advance.  There is very little chance of a good car being delivered directly to the store.  Therefore, it is recommended to park near the aforementioned "Sun Paradise" and walk a short distance (about 200 meters). </p><h2>  Opening hours and online ordering </h2><p>  The Black River in Voronezh operates in a very unusual mode, so remember: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Monday to Friday: 9.30-19.00. </li><li>  Saturday: 10.00-17.00. </li><li>  Sunday: 11.00-17.00. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="pixabay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="paints for the artist" class="if uuid-2663473" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95582/2663473.jpg"></div><p>  What is the reason for this mode of operation?  It‚Äôs unlikely to be understood.  On the other hand, the Black River in Voronezh is a shop for artists, and, as you know, you can create only in an atmosphere of freedom.  So here even working hours are set in lightness and airiness mode. </p><p>  For those who do not like to choose products in person, it is possible to register on the site and place an order for the necessary items online.  Delivery at the store is not provided, so the only option is to pick up from the store on Kirov. </p><h2>  Range </h2><p>  Shop "Black River" in Voronezh presents the opportunity to buy goods for fine art, crafts and decoupage.  Here everyone will find something for themselves. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mymodernmet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="brushes and paints" class="if uuid-2663477" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95582/2663477.jpg"></div><p>  In the offered assortment you can find: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  brushes of completely different types; </li><li>  airbrushes and accessories for them, as well as paints for airbrushing; </li><li>  accessories, frames and equipment for a baguette workshop; </li><li>  sets for face painting and tattoo; </li><li>  <span>educational academic</span> and souvenir plaster figures; </li><li>  pastel, graphic and watercolor pencils; </li><li>  sets and tools for mosaic; </li><li>  primers, paints and fastenings for modeling; </li><li>  easels, tablets and palettes; </li><li>  equipment for ceramic craftsmanship, including pottery wheels and kilns. </li></ul><p>  And this is not a complete list of the presented goods.  Sufficiently long existence of the store allowed to form a very extensive offer for consumers. </p><h2>  For professionals </h2><p>  The Black River store in Voronezh is not very far from the Voronezh State Institute of Architecture and Civil Engineering.  This fact makes it possible to provide future architects, as well as professional artists, with <span>collet pencils,</span> professional rulers and patterns, rapidographs and isographs, tools and other drawing instruments. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.solarnavigator.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="acrylic paints" class="if uuid-2663478" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95582/2663478.jpg"></div><p>  It is worth noting that for professional artists there are many interesting products.  Canvases within and on cardboard, pencils and specialized sharpeners for them, acrylic, oil, gouache paints and much more.  In general, here you can find everything that professionals of fine art and drawing will need in their painstaking craft. </p><h2>  For lovers and beginners </h2><p>  For beginner artists or people who decide to find a passing hobby, the Black River store in Voronezh also offers a wide range of quality products of a lower status.  Does your child like to draw?  Here you can find brushes and paints that will advantageously differ from similar products from ordinary stationery stores, but will not cause a serious blow to the family budget. </p><div class="photo" data-original="skrepkaexpo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="black river Voronezh" class="if uuid-2663465" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95582/2663465.jpg"></div><p>  The Black River store in Voronezh is a great place to develop your creative abilities, get a new hobby and be inspired for future development.  It remains only to buy the necessary accessories and start creating.  It is worth knowing that the assortment is regularly subject to changes, so the availability of a particular product is most easily clarified by calling the Black River in Voronezh, which can be found on the official website. </p><h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  The opinion of the buyers of the Black River store in Voronezh is diverse.  But in general, two distinct positions can be distinguished. </p><p>  The first is that there is a very wide range of products.  The store really helps out a huge number of artists and students of an architectural university.  There is no need to go to the country to another art store for canvas, there is no need to wait for weeks for goods ordered on the Internet.  Convenient location makes it possible to quickly solve the problem of the absence of any product. </p><p>  The second opinion is that you often don‚Äôt really want to go to this store.  After all, the staff is not distinguished by a high level of professionalism and immersion in art.  The buyer will not be explained the difference between the types of goods and devote to the subtleties of the choice of paints, brushes and canvases.  Among other things, sellers are not always kind and can respond to the buyer quite sharply, or even completely "forget" to issue a check for a poor-quality product. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wonderstreet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="paint palette" class="if uuid-2663475" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95582/2663475.jpg"></div><p>  If you are in search of specialized products for decoupage or scrapbooking, then the Black River store will most likely not help you.  Sellers are new to the subject of such a craft and cannot always distinguish one tool from another, so rely solely on your own knowledge. </p><p>  Among other things, this store has very high prices.  Some buyers note that the margin is so high that it would be wiser to clearly control the amount of materials and order them in advance than to buy anything in the Black River.  In general, prices "bite", be prepared for this. </p><p>  Summing up, we can say that the Black River shop in Voronezh is a place where you can quickly make up for missing materials or lost tools for fine art, drawing and any other hobby.  High prices are justified by the location in the city center and the retail nature of the sale.  So this place is suitable for some, but not for others. </p>
