Nevertheless, <span>this object of the transport infrastructure of the</span> capital and the place where it is located deserve attention.  There are simply no interesting places in Moscow. </p><h2>  From Moscow history </h2><p>  Until the mid-twentieth century, this area, located west of the Moscow District Railway, remained almost undeveloped.  It was called the "Military Field."  And for such a toponym there were quite specific reasons - this vast wasteland in the north-west of the capital has long been used as a tactical training ground for <span>military exercises of</span> units stationed in the neighborhood on the Khodynsky field.  There were artillery depots and training <span>fortifications,</span> guns were fired at established targets.  Since 1922, the territory became known as the "October Field".  And in the post-war period, starting in 1948, its planned development of residential buildings began.  The constructed streets were named after the outstanding Soviet military leaders.  In 1972, the Oktyabrskoe Pole metro station appeared here.  After that, the area became fully integrated into the urban transport system.  Linking to the metro scheme always opens up new development prospects for urban areas and automatically removes them from the category of suburbs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="October field" class="if" height="311" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/472351.jpg" width="493"></div>

It went into operation acting as a closing station as part of the launch site from Barrikadnaya.  Currently, the "October Field" is located between the stations "Schukinskaya" and "Polezhaevskaya".  In its design type, it is a three-span shallow pillar station.  There are currently no connections to other lines.  From the station there is access to the streets: People‚Äôs Militia, Marshal Malinovsky, Marshal Sokolovsky, Marshal Biryuzov. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metro october field" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/472354.jpg" width="492"></div>

    <h2>  Further perspectives </h2><p>  In the plans for the development of the Moscow <span>metro of the</span> Oktyabrskoe Pole <span>metro station, the</span> role of a transfer hub is assigned.  It should fulfill its function after the completion of the second ring circuit in the Moscow metro, which will interconnect the peripheral areas of the capital.  The transplant will be carried out from the Big Ring to the Tagansko-Krasnopresnenskaya line.  The prospect of track development was laid down in the design of the Oktyabrskoye Pole station at the time of its design and construction.  The technological groundwork for the future transition is expressed in the <span>strengthening of the columns</span> in the center of the hall and the reduction of the distances between them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="park on the october field" class="if" height="307" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/472352.jpg" width="492"></div>

Due to the presence of two rows of support columns, twenty pieces each.  Such stations can be found quite a lot in Moscow and in other cities of the former Soviet Union, where the subway was built in the sixties and early seventies.  Despite the fact that the design of the station is standard, the authors did everything possible to give it a touch of expressiveness and personality.  This is achieved mainly due to the decorative design of the interior.  For the columns in the center of the hall, <span>anodized aluminum</span> was used here for the first time in the Moscow metro <span>.</span>  Marble and granite of gray coloristic scale are used in the design of track walls and flooring.  The walls are also decorated with metal decorative panels "Hammer and Sickle." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metro station october field" class="if" height="346" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/472353.jpg" width="461"></div>

    <h2>  Overcoming the consequences of the fight against excesses </h2><p>  The architectural design of the Oktyabrskoye Pole station is a typical attempt to overcome the trend that prevailed in metro construction over the sixties.  It was caused by the famous decree of the party and government "On the fight against architectural excesses."  In practice, it destroyed all architecture, except typical.  And led to the creation of the same faceless stations.  They can be found in abundance on the outskirts of Moscow, especially on the Filevskaya and Arbatskaya lines.  But the stations that were built in the seventies, like the "October Field", the architects still tried to give personality.  As far as it allowed to make a standard project.  The Moscow metro builders managed to finally overcome the excesses decree only in the second half of the seventies during the design and construction of Kalinin line stations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="october field park" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/472355.jpg" width="492"></div>
