When iPhone 6 comes out: reviews, review, prices, photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many fans of Apple products expected on September 9 last year, as it was on this day that the next version of the iPhone device appeared on sale.  Acquaintance passed with virtually no surprises, as fans have long known what they expect.  If you were interested in Apple‚Äôs new development, then you are probably familiar with the rumors that the iPhone‚Äôs screen has increased in size around the world.  Indeed, the model received a new case, as well as a large display.  Today we‚Äôll talk about how iPhone 6 looks, and we hope that this article will be very interesting for you. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The main detail that Apple decided to touch is the screen change.  The developers had to abandon the attractive four-inch display, although these parameters have not changed since 2012.  But now the company has begun to undergo global transformations.  This is what the public expected.  Due to the fact that the screen of the ‚ÄúiPhone 6‚Äù device was enlarged, its dimensions also changed significantly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what does iPhone 6 look like" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19307/686603.jpg" width="600"></div>  The most interesting thing is that the company provided its users with more than just a model with certain display parameters, they have plenty to choose from, because the new version of the device is made in 4.7 and 5.5 inches.  Accordingly, the iPhone with the largest screen will cost a little more, but for someone this option is the main advantage.  However, what ‚ÄúiPhone 6‚Äù looks like, you can find out using the information provided in the article, and it will also be possible to immediately examine the characteristics that the developers provide to us.

But if you take into account all the previous iPhone models, you probably know that the case of the predecessors is plastic.  Naturally, the company needed to highlight a new model.  Therefore, we decided to forget about the familiar material.  Most likely, this step was influenced by sales of the iPhone 5c mobile device, which the company was unhappy with.

    <h2>  Acquisition </h2><p>  On iPhone 6, the price in Russia is a little overpriced, but despite this, many users have already begun to buy a new model with confidence.  By buying a mobile device, you can save significantly, but for this you will need to purchase a phone through the United States.  Few users want to take such a risky step.  The cost of the device is very high, so people overpay and get it on the day of purchase. </p><h2>  IPhone 6: photo, appearance </h2>

But nevertheless, it is necessary to clarify how the iPhone 6 looks and whether it is worth buying.  In fact, the device is really worthy of attention, and the mobile phone looks very stylish.  If you believe the statistics provided by world experts, then already in the first days of sales more than ten million devices were purchased by users from all over the world, and we are only talking about the new development of the company.  The iPhone 6 images speak for themselves.  After meeting with such a device, everyone will definitely want to hold it in their hands, well, and it‚Äôs not far from there before buying.  If you do not take into account the functionality and capabilities of the device, but only pay attention to how ‚ÄúiPhone 6‚Äù looks, then you can determine that sales will not decrease, but, on the contrary, will begin to grow.

    <h2>  Cost and reviews </h2><p>  As for the price of the new device, it varies significantly depending on the type of device and place of purchase.  You can buy a phone for an amount from 46 to 62 thousand rubles.  As for the reviews of the owners, they most often attribute the chic design of the device to the advantages.  And about the shortcomings, criticism of the enlarged screen is increasingly heard.  The fact is that such parameters do not allow you to comfortably hold a smartphone in your hand. </p>
