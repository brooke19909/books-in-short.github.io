    <h2>  Location Delta Sharm Resort 4 *: Sharm El Sheikh, Hadaba </h2><p>  This hotel is located in the southern part of the famous peninsula called Sinai.  Geographically, it belongs to the resort of Sharm el-Sheikh (Ras Um al-Sid Bay, Hadaba district).  It is a quarter hour drive to the airport and five minutes by transport to Naama Bay Resort.  A ten minute walk from the hotel there is a luxury supermarket of the French network "Carrefour", where you can buy many delicacies. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Hadaba - a former military town where soldiers used to settle, and now there are slender ranks of hotels for tourists.  Delta Sharm Resort 4 * - one of them.  In principle, this is a classic resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSharma.  Here there is a beautiful sea with corals, and good shopping, and interesting excursions, and nightlife.  The pride of Hadaba is the Il Mercato shopping center, where you can not only make interesting and successful purchases, but sit in a cafe or just take a walk.  It is oriented to Europeans and meets all standards.  More ‚ÄúEgyptian‚Äù is another Alf Layla Wa Layla shopping center, where you can bargain with local sellers. </p><p>  Excellent light and entertainment shows in the evenings, the best night clubs ‚ÄúDolce Vita‚Äù and ‚ÄúToda Joya‚Äù attract young people here.  And children will like the dolphinarium and the water park "Albatross".  In addition, Hadaba is a place of pilgrimage for divers.  Lovers of colorful fish and coral gardens specially come here for excursions.  Therefore, many travelers who leave reviews about the hotel simply do not find words to describe the sea and the underwater fauna.  After all, it‚Äôs enough, not being a sophisticated diver, just to snorkel at the reef and forever fall in love with this colorful sea life. </p>

    <h2>  The territory and all that is there is paradise life </h2><p>  Tourists write that this is not a hotel, but a whole mini-town.  Well, judge for yourself.  Delta Sharm Resort 4 * has a huge shopping center, which houses about a hundred different shops.  There is also a supermarket, a bank, several beauty salons, a fitness center, dry cleaning, and laundry.  You can rent a car, also without leaving the hotel.  For children there is not only a club and several playgrounds, but also a special kindergarten for kids from two to ten years.  In addition, if necessary, you can call the nanny.  And children's animation is generally beyond praise.  What else interesting can be found in the hotel Delta Sharm Resort 4 *?  Reviews recommend visiting a good gym. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Egypt, and especially Sharm, is famous for its luxurious hotels with beautiful gardens, but many guests say that such wonderful views and such sophisticated style are probably no longer in the entire resort.  Flowers are breathtaking.  There are even exotics that grow only in tropical forests, for example, in Thailand.  Here, not only clean, but everything breathes sophistication.  So many graceful towers and bridges, waterfalls and fountains that your eyes run wide.  Due to the abundance of water in the territory it is cool even in forty-degree heat.  There is so much here that when you first get to know the hotel, they give a card so as not to get lost.  And even if you go far from some cottages to restaurants and bars, it‚Äôs very nice.  The security at the hotel works well and will always save you from unnecessary problems.  In a word, it is clean, good and calm. </p><h2>  Rooms and accommodation - comfortable and quiet </h2>

Reviews about the restaurants are full of admiration and gratitude to the quick waiters.  The main meals are held at the Family Restaurant and often by the pool at Friends.  The same-name bar is open around the clock where you can have a bite to eat, drink cocktails and something hotter.  In the evenings, the Shisha cafe opens here, where you can recreate a desert tent for yourself, try traditional Bedouin dishes, and also smoke a hookah.  In the morning and until late, guests will find the San Susi bar, where there is good alcohol and cappuccino.  The Ali Baba eatery is famous for sandwiches, cocktails and fresh.

In total, the Delta Sharm Resort 4 * hotel (Sharmelsheikh) has four bars, three of which are located near the pools. </p><p>  Salads and a variety of very impressive desserts are highly praised for food.

In a word, nutrition is such that the "five" could envy him.  A great selection and variety, everything is fresh, and tourists jokingly complain that all the drugs for poisoning were taken home unused.  If we read the statistics of various problems in Egyptian hotels, then we will understand that such a review is worth a lot. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Egypt Delta sharm resort 4" class="if" height="202" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2545/555064.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sea, beach and water activities </h2><p>  The coast of the Red Sea is really far from the Delta Sharm Resort 4 * hotel.  Nevertheless, the hotel has its own beach in Naama Bay.  They deliver there only by bus - it is very difficult to get to the coast by yourself.  Unless on the minibus.  By the way, the bus runs not according to the schedule, but according to availability.  The beach is small but well equipped.  There is a non-alcoholic bar.  The advantage of the location of the hotel beach is that from its territory you can walk along the coasts of other hotels, which is not at all characteristic of a country like Egypt. </p><p>  Delta Sharm Resort 4 * does not have a pontoon, and there is a reef, but tourists are delighted nonetheless.  The beach is gentle, good for children or those who like to splash in warm water.  To the right of the "Delta" is the beach of the Hilton Hotel, where there is a good sunset, the sandy bottom is deep, there are no corals and you can have a great swim.  On the left, on the territory of the Marriott hotel, not far from the coast, there is an excellent reef with fish.  So the entertainment here is for every taste, and the sea and corals are simply fantastic.  Nearby there are paid beaches - "El Fanar" for divers and "Tarrazin" - for lovers of glamor and relaxation.  In addition, to compensate for the lack of sea nearby, the hotel has built as many as twelve pools.  They are heated and without, separately for children and adults.  There are even special pools equipped for jumping.  Near all these artificial ponds you can sunbathe.  It happens that the main pool does not have enough places, but you can always find a corner to your taste and with free sun loungers.  Nice, simply breathtaking water slides.  And drinks in bars near the pools can be ordered directly sitting in the water, and consumed there. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Delta sharm resort 4 reviews photos" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/554445.jpg" width="480"></div></h2><h2>  Excursions to Israel, the desert and the underwater kingdom </h2><p>  Of course, many people come to Egyptian hotels solely to swim in the sea, try delicious food and relax by the pool.  But the very location of these places simply encourages you to travel.  And if you are also an active tourist, and ‚Äúseals‚Äù bother you with relaxation, then Delta Sharm Resort 4 * is a great place for various excursions.  The first place in popularity, of course, takes a trip to Israel.  Although tourists lament that it is difficult to stay on the bus all night, and then cross the border for a long time, they are nonetheless very pleased that all the holy places and sights of this country are so close to the hotel. </p><p>  Those who wish to learn diving are taken to Tiran Island in a comfortable yacht.  Fans of the history of Christianity have the opportunity to make a pilgrimage to the famous monastery of St. Catherine.  In the evenings, you can ride to the Old Town or to the resort of Naama Bay.  The hotel provides a free shuttle bus for these trips.  You can still go by yourself or with the kids to the water park, as well as parachute.  Well, extreme or exotic lovers can ride in the desert on camels, buggies and ATVs.  A sunset in the mountains or a walk in a Bedouin village, bonfire dancing and a kebab with hookah - all this awaits those who love adventure. </p><h2>  As guests evaluate their stay at Delta Sharm Resort 4 *.  Reviews </h2><p>  Egypt, despite revolutions and reforms, still remains a haven for tourists.  And this hotel and the service in it are only getting better.  Many of the guests who have been here note that if you want to relax for two weeks and get all the same benefits that are offered for a week in the "five", then you are here.
