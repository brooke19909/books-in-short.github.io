    <h2>  Who can take a loan? </h2><p>  A potential borrower can be any person who has reached the age of majority, but most often banks issue loans to individuals from twenty-one years.  Of course, a prerequisite for obtaining a loan is a permanent source of income.  It can be documented as well as verbally only.  Well, of course, you must have a passport, citizenship and a place of permanent residence.  A telephone is also needed for communication.  If the borrower meets these criteria, he can only decide <span>where to get a loan without refusal</span> in Moscow. </p>

    <p>  After the borrower determines the type of loan, you can choose where to get a loan in Moscow.  A microloan can be obtained at any of the <span>microfinance organizations.</span>  Their offices are located throughout the city.  Also on the Internet there are a large number of sites on which you can apply for a loan without leaving your home.  Credit for the purchase of goods can be issued directly in the store.  And where to get a consumer loan in Moscow?  This type of loan can be issued at most banks in the capital.  The most favorable lending conditions to their customers are provided by such banks as Sberbank of Russia, VTB 24, Pochta-Bank, Alfa-Bank, Rosselkhozbank and many others.  The conditions for issuing a consumer loan at a particular bank can be found at any of the offices or on the bank's website.  You can apply for a loan both at the office and online. </p><h2>  Required documents </h2><p>  In order to get a consumer loan, it will be necessary to provide a certain set of documents to the bank.  Basically, it is standard.  It includes the following documents: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Passport and a second document to choose from.  It can be SNILS, TIN or a driver‚Äôs license. </li><li>  Many banks require a 2-personal income tax certificate or a certificate in the form of a bank.  Sometimes you may need a copy of the work book certified by the seal of the employer.  The bank makes such requirements to the borrower if he takes a very large amount.  In such a situation, guarantors may also be required.  But not everyone has the opportunity to document their solvency to the bank. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Loan without references and guarantors </h2><p>  The question arises: "Where in Moscow to get a loan without information?".  Many banks meet their customers by offering to take loans without the need for 2-personal income tax.  In Moscow, such banks are Alfa-Bank, Post Bank, Renaissance Credit, Vostochny and Tinkoff.  Also, if the borrower receives a salary on a plastic card, then you can get a loan from this bank without providing any information.  In this case, the constant replenishment of the account by the employer is already a confirmation of the income of the potential borrower. </p><p>  An excellent option to find out where to get a loan in Moscow is to familiarize yourself with the offers of banks on the Internet.  This will significantly save time and help you choose the bank that provides the most optimal conditions and loan term.  You can try to send an online application to several banks at once.  Also on the Internet there are now many organizations that are engaged in the selection of credit to the borrower.  Such organizations are both paid and not.  Employees of this organization will independently send an application to those banks for which a specific borrower is suitable for the terms of the loan. </p><p>  In the worst case scenario, you can turn to private investors.  But, as a rule, such loans always have an inflated interest rate.  Here are the main ways to get a loan in Moscow. </p><h2>  Additional documents </h2>

    <p>  Sometimes a single passport and SNILS are not enough to get a suitable loan.  Even if the future borrower has an ideal credit history, there are no delinquencies and open loans at the moment, banks still approve the loan at an inflated rate. </p><p>  A credit institution does this for obvious reasons.  Any bank must insure its risks, and if the borrower does not provide documents confirming income, this is problematic. </p><p>  To get a loan at a better rate in this situation will help additional documents, which almost everyone has.  Such a document can be a foreign passport with a note of departure for the last six or twelve months, a certificate of ownership of real estate or a vehicle (not a driver‚Äôs license, but a TCP).  The existence of a voluntary medical insurance policy (paid life and health insurance) or a plastic registered card of the Gold or Platinum status of a third-party bank may also have a positive effect on credit conditions. </p><p>  Here is the whole list of additional documents for obtaining a loan without inquiries and guarantors at a more favorable rate. </p><p>  But it is worth remembering that the amount of the loan without certificates confirming the existence of a constant income will always be slightly less than with them.  Usually it does not exceed three hundred thousand rubles. </p>
