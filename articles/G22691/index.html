    <p>  History of chivalry </p><p>  The emergence of this estate is closely related to the emergence of the feudal system in land relations.  Presumably, its inception began in early medieval Europe.  So, the first knight of <span>King Arthur was</span> mentioned back in the VI century AD.  However, the real prosperity of the estate begins in the IX-X centuries.  Then, a tradition unique to the entire planet arose on the continent.  The highest leaders, during this period becoming the first kings, granted the state lands to their officers for military service.  The latter, in turn, swore allegiance to their overlord.  Actually, ‚Äúfe‚Äù in Old German meant loyalty, and ‚Äúod‚Äù - possession.  Thus, the king was the highest lord in the entire medieval state, and the first knights were the earliest vassals.  This structure had a ladder hierarchy: a vassal for one overlord at the same time </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="King Arthur's first knight" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/269879.jpg" width="600"></div>  he himself could bestow the land to other soldiers, becoming overlord for them.  Such first knights had as their main duty the protection of the seigneur‚Äôs possessions, perhaps his ransom from enemy captivity, participation in his military offensive campaigns, and so on.  Very soon, chivalry turns into a privileged estate: their origin is confirmed by all kinds of letters, their condition allows them to devote themselves to an exceptional business, forcing the peasants to work for their needs.  For many centuries, they became the main striking force of any army, which no peasant troops on foot could resist.

Warriors completely shielded in heavy armor appeared closer to the end of the edged weapon era - in the <span>XIV-XV centuries.</span>  Already when the first firearms were created.  Knights of the X-XI centuries were increasingly protected only with chain mail armor and a steel helmet with an open face.  Their main weapon in all </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="first knight" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/269874.jpg" width="448"></div>  times remained a sword.  But knights never disdained weapons like an ax or spear.  Over time, the skills and technologies of the blacksmiths developed, and with them the protection of the body improved.  At first it was <span>plate armor,</span> which appeared everywhere from the 13th century, represented by brigantines in <span>Western Europe.</span>  Especially this type of armor is widespread in Russia in the form of scaly and lamellar (riveted to a leather base) plates.  And at the very beginning of the New Age, when feudal relations began to die gradually, giving way to capitalism, the knightly class experienced its last surge: their armor reached an unprecedented perfection, they became exactly the way we represent them now - with massive all-metal plates covering everything human body and head.  In addition, and militarily, this estate still had something to say to the world - after all, not least the New World was conquered by their hands.  Over time, the developed firearms began to break through armor, and the military strategists of the era mastered the new construction of foot troops with long glaive and halberds, more often overturning the knightly system.  All this accelerated the departure from the historical scene of such a significant military and social category.
